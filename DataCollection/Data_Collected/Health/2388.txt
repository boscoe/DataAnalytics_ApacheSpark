Delicata is a light yellow squash with green stripes and a creamy, rich texture. One of the best things about delicata is that it’s much easier to clean, cut and cook than butternut or other winter squash varieties.  Hannah Kaminsky of Fairfield, Conn., creator of the My Sweet Vegan blog, was inspired by the tubelike shape of the delicata. “Each perfect yellow and green-striped edible tube becomes an ideal vessel for every sort of filling imaginable, no matter how you cut or cook it,” said Ms. Kaminsky.As she was trying to come up with a meatless main course for the holidays, Ms. Kaminsky said she wanted something with spice and “abundant umami” to suit a wide-range of palates. The result is a new twist on the stuffed squash that includes a spiced lentil stuffing, topped with roasted squash seeds and a dairy-free cashew raita.The dish can be prepared well in advance. Bake and stuff them, cover with foil and reheat for 10 to 20 minutes before you’ll be ready to serve.You may be tempted to skip the cashew raita — a dairy-free take on the traditional Indian yogurt dish — but Ms. Kaminsky says that would be a mistake. “Don’t even dream of skipping it,” she said. “That rich final flourish ties together the meal, elevating the dish into something truly memorable. It’s the kind of surprisingly easy dinner that eaters will rave about for years to come.”
