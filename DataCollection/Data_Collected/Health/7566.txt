Asked by Marnie • 1 voteIt is highly unlikely, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Someone who is immune cannot spread the disease. A toddler who has received one shot has a 95 percent chance of being immune. With two shots, the likelihood of immunity rises to 97 percent. In both cases the chance of a vaccine failure -- in which case a vaccinated toddler could become infected and transmit measles -- is very small. Assuming that the vaccine is effective, as it is in most cases, Dr. Schaffner said: “The vaccinated child, even if they are exposed to the measles virus, cannot then transmit the virus to others. That’s because the vaccinated child’s antibodies completely surround, attach to and then kill the virus. The measles virus can’t multiply in the vaccinated child, and the vaccinated child cannot be an agent of transmission to others. That’s why vaccinated children protect the unvaccinated. That’s the whole concept of herd immunity: The vaccinated children really do provide a strong barrier of protection to the unvaccinated."Do you have a health question?
