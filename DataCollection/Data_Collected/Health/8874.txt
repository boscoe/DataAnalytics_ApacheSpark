India recently began one of the biggest drug-distribution campaigns in its history in an effort to eliminate “elephant’s foot disease,” also known as elephantiasis or lymphatic filariasis.The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare hopes to hand out free pills once a year to 400 million Indians at risk of the disease, which is caused by microscopic worms spread by mosquitoes.When male and female worms mate and grow in the body, they jam lymph nodes. Gallons of lymph fluid pool in the lower limbs, disfiguring them. Even more common, but less well-known, are gross distortions of genitalia.Nearly 1.3 million Indians have the disease, according to figures released by the ministry last week.AdvertisementThe campaign was begun with a touching video showing a young boy finding giant footprints in the dirt leading away from a village cricket field. As he follows them, a crowd builds, along with the sense that they are pursuing a monster.The prints lead into a modest house — where they turn out to belong to a gentle man with hideously disfigured limbs, whose family tells the villagers about the campaign so others will not suffer as he has.AdvertisementThe video was made with the help of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. According to interviews with the producers in Indian news media, it was produced in Hindi but then dubbed in nine local languages so villagers could understand it. A song in Sanskrit, described as a “neutral language,” was chosen as the score.A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: India Begins Campaign to Eliminate Elephantiasis.
