Reader Question • 643 votesStress is believed to be the cause of most eye twitches, but involuntary eyelid spasms “can be caused by any number of things -- an allergy, an irritation of the eyelid, crying, caffeine, anxiety, an acute emotional event,” said Dr. Philip Rizzuto, an ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. When both eyes twitch, the medical term is blepharospasm. To ease twitching, doctors recommend cutting out caffeine and avoiding stress; twitching usually resolves within a few hours or days. If abnormal involuntary blinking persists for more than a week, you should consult a physician, who will take a careful history and try to identify a specific trigger like a new environmental exposure. The cause of persistent blepharospasm is unknown but it is usually benign, Dr. Rizzuto said. If it becomes disruptive, making it difficult to read or drive and operate machinery safely, it can be treated with Botox, which is injected into the muscles of the eyelids to quell the spasms. The treatment is “not curing anything but provides symptom relief and improves quality of life,” Dr. Rizzuto said.If only one eye twitches, there is more reason for concern, because the cause could be something irritating the nerve on that side of the face, such as an abnormal collection of blood vessels or a growth or tumor, Dr. Rizzuto said. “If it’s only on one side, that’s when you want to start investigating.”Do you have a health question?
