Tylenol is a popular remedy for treating the symptoms of flu. But a randomized trial has found that the drug is no more effective than a placebo, with no discernible effect at all on reducing fever or other flu symptoms.Researchers in New Zealand randomized 80 adults with flu symptoms to either 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a placebo four times a day for five days. Twenty-two people in the placebo group and 24 in the Tylenol group had laboratory-confirmed flu virus infections. The study, published in Respirology, detected no differences between the two groups in severity of symptoms, mean daily temperature, maximum temperature, viral load, adherence to the medicine or time before the symptoms went away. There was one serious side effect in one person in the placebo group, but beyond that there were no adverse side effects in either group.“I would say that there’s no clear evidence that it helps, and none that it’s harmful,” said a co-author of the study, Dr. Irene Braithwaite of the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand. “But in animal models, it has been shown to be harmful. If you’re going to use it, use with care.”The best option for fighting flu, Dr. Braithwaite said, is to get the flu vaccine. “Vaccination is not foolproof,” she said, “but it’s the best protection you can have against the flu virus.”
