For a simple but substantive vegetarian entree this Thanksgiving, try this easy Artichoke Torte. Although artichokes aren’t a typical November vegetable, they freeze well and can be enjoyed any time of year. This recipe from Carol Lamont of Palo Alto, Calif., uses frozen artichokes to make a simple but delicious torte for your holiday table.“My 93-year-old mother started making artichoke torte to serve at our holiday meals long ago,” writes Ms. Lamont. “It helped my meat-eating nephews come to appreciate vegetarian food. Now that we cook for my Mom, I make the torte for all to enjoy. Sometimes she helps me chop the veggies and we raise a glass to celebrate our ‘Julie & Julia’ history of her teaching me how to cook.”
