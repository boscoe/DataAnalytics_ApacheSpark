A Danish study has found that news articles that focus on the risks or adverse effects of statin drugs may lead people to stop taking the medicines, and probably contribute to increases in heart attacks and deaths.The researchers tracked 674,000 people who started taking statins between 1995 and 2010, and identified 1,931 statin-related news articles during that time. They graded 110 of the articles as negative, 731 as positive and the rest neutral. The study is online in the European Heart Journal.Over all, when negative news articles were published, the rate of discontinuations increased by 9 percent. When positive articles appeared, the rate decreased by 8 percent. Some people, of course, stop taking their drugs regardless of the news.Compared with those who continued taking the medicine, those who stopped had a 26 percent increased risk for heart attack and an 18 percent increased risk for death from cardiovascular disease.There are various factors involved in decisions to stop the medicine, but after controlling for many variables, the researchers conclude that 2 percent of heart attacks and 1 percent of cases of cardiovascular illness could be directly attributable to the effect of negative news articles.“If you consider stopping a statin because of negative news,” said the lead author, Dr. Borge Nordestgaard, a professor of medicine at the University of Copenhagen, “you should discuss it with your doctor to get a balanced view of the risks and benefits.”A version of this article appears in print on 12/08/2015, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nostrums: Bad News May Beget Bad News.
