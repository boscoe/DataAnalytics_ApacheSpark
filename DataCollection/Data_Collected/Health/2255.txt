Some doctors practice “defensive medicine,” ordering extra tests and procedures believing this will ward off malpractice suits. A new study suggests that it does.Using data on 24,637 physicians and more than 18 million hospital admissions in Florida between 2000 and 2009, researchers found that the more a hospital billed, the less likely the doctor was to be sued.For example, among the one-fifth of general surgeons who billed the least, the rate of malpractice claims was 2.3 percent, while among the one-fifth who billed the most, the rate was 0.4 percent.Even after controlling for demographic factors and patients who had more than one disease, the association persisted across all specialties. The researchers also found that doctors who were high spenders one year were consistently high spenders the next.The study, in BMJ, demonstrated an association, not cause and effect, and it is impossible to know if a doctor’s spending was motivated purely by a desire to avoid malpractice suits.The lead author, Dr. Anupam B. Jena, an associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, wrote in an email message: “Our findings suggest that health care reform efforts designed to get physicians to reduce utilization may be met with sluggish opposition if the unintended effect of reduced utilization is increased malpractice risk for the physician.”
