It was a love of kasha and memories of family that inspired Nancy Jane Richer of Knoxville, Tenn., to create this holiday recipe.Kasha usually refers to toasted buckwheat groats (the whole kernel) that are soaked and slow-simmered. It’s a common Eastern European dish, and kasha varnishkes is a traditional Jewish recipe that combines cooked kasha with bow tie pasta and onions.Ms. Richer’s father loved kasha and died on Thanksgiving more than a decade ago. Recently, Ms. Richer spotted wild turkeys in her winter vegetable garden. For her, it felt like a message. “It was a magical omen,” Ms. Richer said. The result is this spicy take on kasha, created in memory of Ms. Richer’s parents. The dish is robust enough to eat as a vegetarian main course, but also tempting as a side dish for everyone at the table.
