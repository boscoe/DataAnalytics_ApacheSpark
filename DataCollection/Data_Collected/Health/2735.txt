Savory pies and tarts are go-to dishes at Thanksgiving. They can be made well in advance and they make a great main course for guests who are not eating turkey.We chose this recipe from Kathy Patalsky, a vegan blogger in Los Angeles, to represent the savory pie in our Vegetarian Thanksgiving series. We liked that it was easy (she suggests a pre-made crust) and the hazelnuts make it a great option for the winter holidays as well.Just cook up the vegetables, toast the hazelnuts, chop up the nuts and chick peas in a food processor and mix the rest together in a bowl. The herbs and bell pepper add festive color and your guests will be impressed.“These flavors are rustic, filling, cozy and festive,” Ms. Patalsky wrote. “I adore pot pies and tarts for main dish entrees. You can easily slice them like pies and serve to guests in an elegant way.”
