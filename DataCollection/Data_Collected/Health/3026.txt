Once personal health technology meant little more than bathroom scales, thermometers and electric toothbrushes. Now, these devices and apps are everywhere: on our wrists, in our phones, the bedroom, the kitchen, even on our children and pets. In this special issue of Science Times, we explore the lives of newly wired consumers and the consequences, good and bad, that arise from our increasing reliance on trackers, monitors, guides and a vast array of other devices to better our health.
Fitness
­Health consumers are counting steps, measuring heart rates and tracking sleep. The Consumer Electronics Association estimates that device makers will sell more than 40 million personal health and wellness devices this year; sales may reach $8 billion by 2018.
Food
Home meals are now high-tech affairs: a number of apps and devices aim to make cooking less complicated, helping users source healthful ingredients and stick to nutritious diets.
Family
Technology isn’t just for snooping on the whereabouts of family members (although it’s good for that, too). Various online tools now help kids finish homework faster, teen girls navigate adolescence, and keep pets safe.
Mind
While many people unplug from technology to reduce stress, a few devices actually promise to the calm the mind. Meditation apps, nerve stimulation devices and yoga apps may help you relax, while more practical devices simply help you find your keys.
