Exposure to dogs or farm animals in early childhood significantly reduces the risk for asthma, a large study has found.Researchers prospectively followed more than 650,000 children born in Sweden from 2001 to 2010. They recorded exposure to dogs and farm animals and assessed the risk for asthma in school-age children at age 6 and in preschoolers between the ages of 1 and 5. The study is in JAMA Pediatrics.Compared with children who had no exposure to farm animals, the rate of asthma was 52 percent lower in school-age children and 31 percent lower in preschoolers who lived on farms.Living with dogs had a weaker effect. Compared with children without dogs, school-age children who lived with dogs had a 13 percent lower risk of asthma, and children 3 and older had a 10 percent reduced risk. There was no association of dog exposure with asthma in children under 3.“Families that have a child shouldn’t worry about getting a dog,” said the lead author, Tove Fall, an associate professor of epidemiology at Uppsala University. She warned, though, that “if you have an allergic child, you shouldn’t get a dog and imagine that it will cure the allergy — it could make it worse.”Although the researchers controlled for many factors, including parental asthma, other unknown variables could be involved, and the exact mechanism remains unknown.For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.A version of this article appears in print on 11/10/2015, on page D6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Childhood: Animal Exposure Aids Asthma.
