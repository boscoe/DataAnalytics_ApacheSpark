Home chefs are always looking for a way to add color and flavor to the Passover table. We’ve chosen these spring vegetable recipes from Martha Rose Shulman to add to your family traditions.
Zucchini “Pasta”
	:
		If you don’t eat wheat, or you’re on a low-carbohydrate diet and miss pasta, this can stand in for fettucine.	
Asparagus With Green Garlic
	:
		When you sauté or roast asparagus in hot olive oil, the asparagus will have a much more concentrated flavor than it would if steamed or blanched.	
Mediterranean Okra and Tomato Stew
	:
		Best way to cook okra? Whole, after a quick marinade.	
Seared Brussels Sprouts
	:
		For delicious brussels sprouts, cook them in very hot oil.	
Rainbow Quinoa Tabbouleh
	:
		Quinoa lends itself to lemony salads, and the rainbow mix is particularly nice because each type of quinoa has a slightly different texture.
