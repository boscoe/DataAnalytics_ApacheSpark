According to estimates by Stanford researchers and other groups, golfing with a cart requires slightly more effort per minute than shuffleboard but less than archery or juggling, neither of which is known for making people sweat. The golf motion just does not demand much energy. According to the same calculations, practicing shots at a golf range uses about the same amount of energy per minute as tai chi.However, walking the course while pulling your cart is considerably more taxing, adding about 50 percent to the effort required, according to the academic calculations. But even walking the course is a relatively light workout. In an interesting 2010 study, 18 older men were asked to play nine holes of golf during one experimental session and to mow a lawn for 40 minutes in another. They wore equipment that measured their heart rates and energy expenditure. The men burned an average of 310 calories while playing the nine holes, compared with about 250 while mowing. But the time spent mowing was much shorter, so the exertion per minute and exercise intensity were considerably higher per minute during mowing than golf.On the plus side, golf improves balance. In a 2011 study, older male golfers performed much better on several different tests of balance and physical confidence than men of the same age who did not golf. So, while golf is not vigorous endurance exercise, it should “increase both the physical and psychological aspects of balance control,” the study’s authors concluded.Do you have a health question?
