Pumpkin is the ultimate fall vegetable, but most of the time, pumpkin is reserved for the dessert pie. This pumpkin recipe may convince you to serve it as a savory main course.Pumpkin found its way to the Thanksgiving table of Tara Deshpande Tennebaum out of necessity. She and her husband spend many Thanksgivings in Mumbai, where some of their favorite holiday ingredients are not available.During their travels, the family squirrels away Thanksgiving essentials like cranberries and pecans. Fortunately pumpkin is available in Mumbai, so Ms. Tennebaum uses a red pumpkin, known as bhopala or lal kadoo. The pumpkin is slow-roasted and caramelized, topped with a pesto made from nuts and cranberries to capture the flavors of fall.“It’s something all our nonvegetarian friends love because the thick wedges, once out of the oven, are velvety rich, and the pesto has all the flavors we associate with this holiday,’’ writes Ms. Tannebaum. “Over the years we have become friends with a group of die-hard Thanksgivingists — people who agree that this is one of the best holidays in the world, a day anyone, anywhere who loves food and has something to be thankful for can celebrate.”
