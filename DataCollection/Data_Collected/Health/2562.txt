Stuffing is a traditional Thanksgiving accompaniment to the turkey, but turning stuffing into muffins helps it hold its own on the holiday table — with or without the bird.This recipe for stuffing muffins comes from Ilene Godofsky of Queens, who writes  The Colorful Kitchen, a food blog. (Ms. Godofsky’s vegan pumpkin double-chocolate brownies make the blog worth the visit!) We like this fresh take on stuffing, and the fact that you can serve these muffins on their own, or topped with two of our other favorite side dishes — mashed potatoes and gravy.“Even though stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy are traditionally side dishes, this recipe is so fun that it takes center stage,” writes Ms. Godofsky. “Last year at Thanksgiving I made this recipe completely vegan and gluten-free and my family (who is normally very wary of anything made without meat or dairy) completely ate it up.”
