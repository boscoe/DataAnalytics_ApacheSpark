Cauliflower is a vegetable that I have no qualms about buying on impulse. It keeps very well in the refrigerator – I have made perfectly good meals using florets I found lingering in my produce drawer that had been there for more than a week. Not that I recommend this approach, but it is good to know that you need not use it up right away, especially when you find large heads weighing anywhere from 1 1/2 to 2 pounds. I love cauliflower for its versatility. It adores a vinegary marinade, so this week, cold weather notwithstanding, I steamed a good-size head until tender (5 to 6 minutes) and made 2 delicious salads, both of them adaptations of classic Italian dishes. I tossed it with vinaigrette, tuna, minced parsley and marjoram, and luxurious giant white beans for one salad that I ate for lunch every day until it was gone; and I tossed it with carrots, mint, vinegar and olive oil in another beautiful, simple combination that embellished my New Year’s Day buffet and disappeared from it very quickly.Steamed for a few minutes longer than 5 minutes – 6 to 8 – cauliflower is easy to break into very small florets using a knife or even a fork. It doesn’t become mushy, but it will easily stir into a tomato sauce, to toss with pasta or, as I did, fill a frittata. I also mashed it with potatoes for some spiced patties that I coated with sesame seeds and served with Sriracha sauce. And I added it to an aromatic Turkish pilaf seasoned with cardamom and allspice, an adaptation of one of Clifford A. Wright’s irresistible pilaf recipes.I used regular white cauliflower for all of this week’s Recipes for Health. But feel free to make them using other colorful varieties such as purple cauliflower, dark yellow “cheddar cheese” cauliflower, and green romanesca (it is called romanesca broccoli but it resembles cauliflower more than broccoli).  If any of these varieties grab your fancy at the farmers’ market or comes in your CSA basket, know that they will work.
