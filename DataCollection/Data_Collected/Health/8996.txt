A couple of years ago I gave you a recipe for a roasted mushroom base, a sort of vegetable Hamburger Helper that I had learned to make from Scott Samuels, a Culinary Institute of America chef. Chef Samuels combined it with ground beef to make delicious burgers. It has caught on among food service professionals who want to improve the nutritional profile of their offerings. Now they refer to it as, simply, “The Mix,” and they are keeping mushroom growers very busy.At this year’s Worlds of Health Flavors conference in Napa, Calif., Pam Smith, a culinary nutritionist, presented delightful recipes by the chef Clifford Pleau featuring a version of “The Mix” that was slightly different from the Scott Samuels recipe. Inspired, I made up a big batch of my own version of the roasted mushroom base when I got home and had a lot of fun using it all week in various dishes from tuna burgers to moussaka. They are all adaptations of traditional meat or fish dishes, with the animal protein cut by half or more and replaced with the mushroom base. The mix, or base, is an ideal use for mushrooms that are sold pre-sliced; if you use them you can produce this very quickly.To make the base, all you need to do is toss the mushrooms with salt, pepper and a small amount of olive oil, then spread them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and roast them until they are tender and dry. Then you chop them finely, either in a meat grinder or a food processor. Chefs prefer the grinder for texture and also because the mix comes out dryer when ground. I used a food processor and was pleased with the results. The mix kept well all week in my refrigerator, and what I didn’t use for recipe tests I used up in vegetarian dinners – an omelet, pasta, pizza and bruschetta.
