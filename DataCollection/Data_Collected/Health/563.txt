Reader Question • 70 votesThis question reveals a common and persistent misconception about the dangers of sitting, for which I may be partly to blame, since I have so frequently written about those dangers. (See here and here and here.)But while prolonged sitting is known to increase the risks for conditions like obesity, diabetes, heart disease, liver disease and premature death, the actual culprit behind the risks, scientists believe, is not the posture of sitting, but the immobility of your muscles when you are in that position. They aren’t contracting, and muscular contractions are important for health. Working muscles fuel themselves with blood sugar, aiding blood sugar control. They also stimulate the release of various biochemicals that improve cholesterol profiles and metabolic health.So sitting itself is not bad; it’s sitting still.Consequently, standing up and moving around, even for brief periods of time, reduces the risks of sitting, science shows. Even fidgeting can help, according to a fascinating new study, which found that women who fidgeted all the time, including while seated, generally lived longer than non-fidgeters, even if they sat the same number of hours most days.In that context, cycling is wonderful exercise. It involves hundreds if not thousands of muscular contractions and is an excellent way to improve cardiovascular fitness and other aspects of health. You may be seated while cycling, but you are decidedly not still.Do you have a health question?
