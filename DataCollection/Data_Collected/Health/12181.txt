How can you burn calories while you cook? What are some tips for making tasty gluten-free food? How can you be more active while at the supermarket and in the kitchen? Can you make your favorite foods into low-calorie fare?  Next Wednesday, May 6, Rocco DiSpirito, celebrity chef and author of “Cook Your Butt Off,” will join The Well Book Club to answer your questions about gluten-free, low-calorie eating, staying active and avoiding those extra calories. Please post your questions for Mr. DiSpirito to our book club discussion page. We will select 10 Well readers who participate in the conversation to receive a copy of the book.
