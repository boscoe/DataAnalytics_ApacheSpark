The New York State attorney general’s office accused four national retailers on Monday of selling dietary supplements that were fraudulent and in many cases contaminated with unlisted ingredients.The authorities said they had run tests on popular store brands of herbal supplements at the retailers — Walmart, Walgreens, Target and GNC — which showed that roughly four out of five of the products contained none of the herbs listed on their labels. In many cases, the authorities said, the supplements contained little more than cheap fillers like rice and house plants, or substances that could be hazardous to people with food allergies.At GNC, for example, the agency found that five out of six samples from the company’s signature “Herbal Plus” brand of supplements “were either unrecognizable or a substance other than what they claimed to be.” In pills labeled ginkgo biloba, the agency found only rice, asparagus and spruce, an ornamental plant commonly used for Christmas decorations.At Target, the agency tested six herbal products from its popular “Up and Up” store brand of supplements. Three out of six – including ginkgo biloba, St. John’s wort and valerian root, a sleep aid – tested negative for the herbs listed on their labels. But the agency did find that the pills contained powdered rice, beans, peas and wild carrots.Here are the products that were analyzed by the attorney general, along with the test results that were described in cease-and-desist letters that the agency sent to the four retailers.From GNC, Herbal Plus brand:Gingko Biloba:St. John’s WortGinsengGarlicEchinaceaSaw PalmettoFrom Target, Up & Up brandGingko BilobaSt. John’s WortGarlic EchinaceaSaw PalmettoValerian RootFrom Walgreens, Finest Nutrition brandGingko Biloba St. John’s WortGinsengGarlicEchinaceaSaw PalmettoFrom Walmart, Spring Valley brandGingko BilobaSt. John’s WortGinsengGarlic EchinaceaSaw PalmettoRelated: “New York Attorney General Targets Supplements at Major Retailers”Related: “Letters Outlining What Was Found in Herbal Supplements”A version of this article appears in print on 02/03/2015, on page A1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: 4 Retailers Told to Stop Selling Supplements.
