Life expectancy is a measure unlike any other, a sort of X-ray machine that can see through the geography of a city to the bones of a neighborhood’s distress. This week, researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation released life expectancy calculations for four cities, part of a broader series whose aim is to influence social policy.
New York CityIn Tribeca, Murray Hill and the Upper East Side, the average resident lives until 85 — on par with places in the world with the highest life expectancy like Japan and Hong Kong. In Brownsville, Brooklyn, about 10 miles away, life expectancy was 74, closer to that in Brazil.  Brownsville has the largest concentration of public housing of any neighborhood in the city. Residents there die from most major diseases at much higher rates than the city average.Riverdale80Williamsbridge8079PelhamWashington7977ParkwayHeights7983BRONX7775807980In East Harlem, life expectancy is near the city low, but just south of 96th St on the Upper East Side, residents can expect to live the longest in the city.Mott78Haven757676UpperWest Side84FlushingAstoriaUpper East Side848285Jackson HeightsBayside828484MurrayHillQUEENS83Sunnyside84Life expectancy in the Lower East Side and Chinatown is the city average, but four years lower than its immediate neighbors.8584GreenwichForest Hills83Village848481Williamsburg8081Tribeca85BushwickJamaica8279WoodhavenBedford797982Stuyvesant75Park Slope788081787480Brownsville had the lowest life expectancy in New York City.Sunset ParkEast Flatbush82828283Port Richmond81Bay RidgeBROOKLYN7881Bensonhurst82Sheepshead Bay80The Rockaways8376Coney IslandSTATEN ISLAND80Tottenville81Riverdale80Williamsbridge8079PelhamWashington7977ParkwayHeights7983BRONX7775807980In East Harlem, life expectancy is near the city low, but just south of 96th St on the Upper East Side, residents can expect to live the longest in the city.Mott78Haven757676UpperWest Side84FlushingAstoriaUpper East Side848285Jackson HeightsBayside828484MurrayHillQUEENS83Sunnyside84Life expectancy in the Lower East Side and Chinatown is the city average, but four years lower than its immediate neighbors.8584GreenwichForest Hills83Village848481Williamsburg8081Tribeca85BushwickJamaica8279WoodhavenBedford797982Stuyvesant75Park Slope788081787480Brownsville had the lowest life expectancy in New York City.Sunset ParkEast Flatbush82828283Port Richmond81Bay RidgeBROOKLYN7881Bensonhurst82Sheepshead Bay80The Rockaways8376Coney IslandSTATEN ISLAND80Tottenville81Riverdale80Williamsbridge8079PelhamWashington7977ParkwayHeights7983BRONX7775807980In East Harlem, life expectancy is near the city low, but just south of 96th St on the Upper East Side, residents can expect to live the longest in the city.Mott78Haven757676UpperWest Side84FlushingAstoriaUpper East Side848285Jackson HeightsBayside828484MurrayHillQUEENS83Sunnyside84Life expectancy in the Lower East Side and Chinatown is the city average, but four years lower than its immediate neighbors.8584GreenwichForest Hills83Village848481Williamsburg8081Tribeca85BushwickJamaica8279WoodhavenBedford797982Stuyvesant75Park Slope788081787480Brownsville had the lowest life expectancy in New York City.Sunset ParkEast Flatbush82828283Port Richmond81Bay RidgeBROOKLYN7881Bensonhurst82Sheepshead Bay80The Rockaways8376Coney IslandSTATEN ISLAND80Tottenville818080797783BRONX79757780798078EastHarlem75767684848285828484QUEENS83858483LowerEast Side8484818081857979798275788081787480Brownsville828282838178BROOKLYN818280837680STATEN ISLAND81ChicagoHealth authorities in Chicago spotted an unusual pattern: Life expectancy defied income in a number of neighborhoods, possibly because of the influx of immigrants who tend to live longer than native-born Americans.“We look at life expectancy to help us identify where the problems are,” said Dr. Julie Morita, the city’s health commissioner. “So when we have resources available we can direct them to where the need is greatest.”The Near North Side and the Loop, affluent downtown neighborhoods with median income of over $80,000 have the highest life expectancy in Chicago. RogersEdison ParkPark80817783North Park8081O’Hare8480International80O’HareAirport82Uptown8176Portage80Park81828080808080LincolnParkIn racially diverse Hyde Park 70 percent of residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher and life expectancy is 13 years longer than in Washington Park to the west.

One of the neighborhoods with that low lifespan was Vine City, the 30314 zip code, where Martin Luther King Jr. lived as an adult with his family. Karen Minyard, director of the Georgia Health Policy Center at Georgia State University, said the patterns of the lowest life expectancies coincided almost exactly with areas of high poverty and low education. “Your social circumstances help determine your life expectancy,” she said. Some low-population zip codes had too few deaths for life expectancy to be calculated.Zip Code 30327Residents of this 87 percent white zip code had the highest median household income in Atlanta, almost $140,000.818283Buckhead848182Along I-20Life expectancies are in the low 70s in the largely black neighborhoods along the I-20 corridor running from east to west through the city.728378Decatur79Vine CityDowntownEastside717374303107271737572The three zip-codes with lowest life-expectancy have unemployment rates over 20 percent.3035471Hartfield-JacksonAtlanta International Airport8182Zip Code 3032783848182728378Decatur79Vine City7173743031072717375723035471Richmond, Va.One of the reasons that Richmond’s gaps appear so extreme is that the calculations here are based on even more precise geographical data. Researchers were able to draw from census tracts, which are usually smaller than zip codes, and are typically just a few city blocks wide. That reveals concentrated pockets of wealth and poverty, which would be diluted over a larger area.The standout spot is Gilpin Court, a large public housing project, where life expectancy is just 63, on par with Haiti. Other public housing projects in the city account for many of the lowest pockets of life expectancy.At Virginia Commonwealth University and to the northwest, life expectancy is higher than the city average.72747677Northside80787970Gilpin Court, just a mile’s walk across I-64 from V.C.U., has the lowest life expectancy in Richmond.66Museum District73778064806376648071806773677274707473Westover Hills7183686774Swansboro677172Virginia State CapitolSome low-population tracts had too few deaths for life expectancy to be calculated.6973667472South Richmond6873737470Virginia CommonwealthUniversityGilpinCourt72747677Northside8078797066Museum District73778064806376648071806773677274707473Westover Hills7183686774Swansboro6771726973667472StateCapitolSouth Richmond6873737470Note: Data was calculated by tabulating the most recently available death rates and adjusting for the population.  Life expectancy is a catchall figure that includes deaths from disease as well as other causes, like gun violence. But the measure can also reflect demographic changes in a neighborhood, such as an an influx of wealthier, healthier residents moving into a gentrifying neighborhood.
