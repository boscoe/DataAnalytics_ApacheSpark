On Sunday I cooked up a big pot of nutty-tasting kasha, the cooked cereal made with toasted buckwheat groats. I enjoyed it all week. I stirred some into a frittata along with leeks and spinach, added it to two different salads and to buckwheat pancakes. I ate it plain, with a little milk and maple syrup as porridge for breakfast, and made a dinner in a bowl of kasha topped with mushroom ragout and kale. It was a breakthrough for me, because although I adore the flavor of buckwheat, for years I have had a tenuous relationship with kasha. When I have cooked whole buckwheat groats my results have been uneven, the grains (O.K., O.K., pseudo-grains) often mushy, or if not downright mushy, at least soft and indistinct. I have tried different methods, both stovetop and oven, and I have usually mixed the grains with an egg before cooking. I gave up on kasha for a while, opting for more predictable grains and pseudo-grains like quinoa and spelt. But this week everything changed when I bought a box of medium-grain kasha at the supermarket and took another stab at it. These groats were cracked, like bulgur, something I hadn’t seen before. (Indeed, I had reported years ago in this column that it was the medium cut of the grain that made them mushy; now I am convinced that I had it wrong, and that the cooking method also plays a key role). Cracked kasha (the package says “medium granulation”) is still a whole grain – nothing has been removed – but the grains have more exposed surfaces and are smaller than the whole pyramid-shaped buckwheat groats that I usually cook. I followed the directions on the box, mixing the buckwheat with a beaten egg and toasting it in a dry pan over high heat before adding hot water, salt and a little butter and simmering for 10 minutes. Then I did what I always do when I cook grains (and this instruction isn’t on the package): I let them sit for 10 minutes with a tea towel placed between the top of the pan and the lid to absorb steam from the grains. The kasha turned out perfectly — dry and fluffy, with the wonderful nutty/earthy buckwheat flavor I love. Convinced that the cut of the grain, the high heat used to dry-toast the egg-coated kasha, as instructed on the package, and the tablespoon of butter added to the cooking water made the difference, I used the exact same method with large, Russian-grown whole toasted buckwheat groats. The whole groats turned out better than any I had made before, but they took three times as long to cook than the cracked groats, yielded a little less, and because all of the egg is not absorbed by the whole grains the way it is by the cracked grains, you get some egg flakes floating on the top, which is not very attractive (though it is easy to remove them). I also tried cooking my cracked groats without the egg, and the results were not as good; while I wouldn’t call the eggless kasha mushy, the grains were not as distinctive and fluffy as kasha that is first mixed with an egg. So use the egg if you are not vegan. If you are vegan, coat the grains with a little oil before toasting.Now that I’m aware of this cracked buckwheat product I will use it often. It will be especially useful as a substitute for bulgur wheat if I am feeding people who can’t tolerate gluten. But it is the flavor and satisfying nature and versatility of this food, not its gluten-free properties, that has me hooked.
