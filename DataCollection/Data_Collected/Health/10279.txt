The Passover meal is one of the most meaningful gatherings in Judaism, symbolizing the Jews’ flight from slavery in Egypt. As the cookbook author Joan Nathan writes, the annual event gives her “chills, knowing that I’m following what was written in the Bible more than 2,500 years ago.”“We may not ‘eat the flesh that same night, roasted over fire,’ as the Book of Exodus says, but we still eat unleavened bread, bitter herbs and many other dishes added to the original meal,” she said, describing her own 40-guest Passover event.But thousands of years of tradition doesn’t mean you can’t still find moments of creativity and color in your Passover meal. We have collected some of our favorite Martha Rose Shulman recipes to help you set a delicious and meaningful Passover table.
Egg Lemon Soup with Matzos
	:
		No schmaltz is needed for this comforting Greek-style soup – the matzos are crumbled right into the broth.	
Bitter Herbs Salad
	:
		Endive, romaine and chicory are present on many Sephardic ritual platters, but here these pungent greens form the basis for a salad with a garlicky dressing.	
Braised Greek Artichoke Bottoms with Lemon and Olive Oil
	:
		These brightly flavored artichokes, served cold or at room temperature, can be made a day ahead of time.	
Sweet Potato and Apple Kugel
	:
		I’ve looked at a number of sweet potato kugel recipes, and experimented with this one a few times until I was satisfied with it.	
Broccoli, Quinoa and Purslane Salad
	:
		Slice the raw broccoli very thin for this delicious salad. If you can’t find purslane you can substitute mâche.	
Quinoa and Carrot Kugel
	:
		This caraway-scented kugel was a big hit in my household	
Quinoa and Cauliflower Kugel With Cumin
	:
		Cauliflower, steamed until tender then finely chopped, combines beautifully here with quinoa and cumin. Millet would also be a good grain choice.
