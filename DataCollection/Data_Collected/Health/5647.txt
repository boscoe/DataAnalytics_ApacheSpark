McNeil Jr.A new job title — chief of laboratory safety — will be created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency said Wednesday. The move follows a series of lab accidents, the most recent of which may have exposed a scientist to the Ebola virus. Applicants are being recruited, and a spokeswoman said that whoever filled the post would report directly to the C.D.C.'s director, currently Dr. Thomas R. Frieden. Each of the agency’s divisions had handled lab safety separately. In the past year, different high-security C.D.C. labs shipped out samples of anthrax, H5N1 bird flu and Ebola that had not been properly killed. Thus far, there have been no injuries and no spread of the pathogens, but the agency’s procedures have been heavily criticized as sloppy.Advertisement
