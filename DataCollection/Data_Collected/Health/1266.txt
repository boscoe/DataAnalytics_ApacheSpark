McNeil Jr.The United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime said Monday that an “unfortunate misunderstanding” had led to the impression that it would advocate the legalization of all drugs for personal use.A briefing paper to be presented at a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by the head of the agency’s H.I.V. division was sent last week to a few journalists by conference organizers and misrepresented as a major policy change. But the paper had never been cleared by the agency’s executive director, the agency said, and was meant to describe only how legalization was permitted under existing international drug-control treaties and how it would benefit the fight against AIDS.Richard Branson, the airline and music industry pioneer who is an advocate of legalization, released the paper on his blog on Monday, saying the agency was being pressured to suppress it. In fact, an agency spokesman said, a question about the paper posed to the White House Office of National Drug Policy by The New York Times last week had been passed to the agency, alerting officials that the paper was being presented as more important than it really was.Advertisement
