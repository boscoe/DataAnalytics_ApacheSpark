Taking hypertension medicine at night may control blood pressure more effectively and significantly lower the risk for diabetes.A dip in blood pressure during sleep is normal, and a nighttime dip of less than 10 percent in systolic pressure (the top number) is known to be associated with a higher risk of death.Researchers studied 2,012 men and women with high blood pressure. Their average age was 53, and none had diabetes at the start of the study. The researchers randomly assigned half of the people to take all their hypertension medicine at night, and half to take it all in the morning.Over an average of six years, 171 developed diabetes. After adjusting for fasting glucose, waist circumference, mean sleeping blood pressure and other factors, those who took their medicine before going to sleep had a 57 percent lower risk for diabetes. Taking medications at night also resulted in a greater relative decline in nighttime blood pressure. The study is in Diabetologia.“We are recommending now that patients take the meds in the evening. It’s a no-cost intervention,” said the lead author, Ramón C. Hermida, a professor of biomedical engineering at the University of Vigo in Spain, adding that patients should not change their medication regimens without talking to their doctors.For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.
