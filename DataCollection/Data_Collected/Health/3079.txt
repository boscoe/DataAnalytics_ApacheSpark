Over the last seven years of collecting new vegetarian Thanksgiving recipes on Well, we have learned that inviting a vegetarian or vegan to your holiday table creates more opportunity than challenge. Readers have seen that by making flavorful vegetarian and vegan dishes, they end up enhancing everyone’s meal.That’s what happened when Kate Reilly, a reader in Bedford Hills, N.Y., began looking for a vegetarian holiday dish for her family. The result was this pumpkin ravioli with sage walnut pumpkin butter. The homemade ravioli are simple to make but add a wow factor to the holiday table. And they can be made ahead and frozen, and cooked up in minutes on the day.It was a dish born out of necessity. “With four meat eaters, three vegetarians and one carnivorous but lactose-free family member, Thanksgiving can be a cooking challenge,” Ms. Reilly said. “I wanted one dish that would be spectacular, could be made ahead of time and frozen, eaten on Thanksgiving day and all weekend — or later — with little effort.”
