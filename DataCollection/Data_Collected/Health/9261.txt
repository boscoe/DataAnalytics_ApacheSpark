McNeil Jr.The world has spent more than $4 billion fighting Ebola, but according to a new report from Save the Children, it would have cost only $1.6 billion to bring health care systems up to minimum standards in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, which might have prevented the outbreak or ended it faster.Even before Ebola struck West Africa, more than 25 countries had health care systems worse than those in impoverished Liberia and Sierra Leone, the report also found.The assessment, released last week, relied on typical health measures like infant mortality, childhood immunization rates and numbers of health care workers per capita. But it also included assessments of fairness, such as government health spending and how often the poorest of the poor had doctors, nurses or midwives present at births.With the latter criteria included, Sierra Leone and Liberia rose in the rankings, because they had low- or no-fee basic services. Although Liberia had only 51 doctors in the country when the epidemic began, it had previously spent $20 per person per year on health.Guinea, the third Ebola-hit country, ranked near the bottom; it spent only $9 a person.“Governments need to make their health care systems a priority, especially for poor people,” said Carolyn Miles, the president of Save the Children USA.Despite low rankings, Nigeria and Mali contained their Ebola outbreaks because they had networks of low-level health workers trained to do contact tracing. In Nigeria’s case, many were polio vaccinators, because the country was, until recently, Africa’s last polio center.The top 10 countries in the index included Brazil, Egypt, Peru, five former Soviet states, and two sub-Saharan African countries: South Africa and Gabon.Advertisement
