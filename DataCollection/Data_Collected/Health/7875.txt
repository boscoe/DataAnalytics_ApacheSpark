A weekly allowance from parents is a rite of passage for many children. But should children be paid to do chores?Ron Lieber, the New York Times personal finance columnist and author of the new book “The Opposite of Spoiled,” argues that because parents don’t get paid for family housework, neither should the kids.Even so, Mr. Lieber says he believes an allowance is an essential teaching tool for raising children. Giving your children a reasonable amount of money to manage allows them to learn about the need to make trade-offs and the difference between wants and needs, and it puts them on a path for making “spectacular mistakes.”“They will buy one pair of jeans or Ugg boots and there won’t be any money left,” Mr. Lieber said. “I believe pretty strongly in the no bailout rule. Let them live with the consequence. Let them buy the prom dress secondhand. It’s a lesson they won’t have to learn at 25 when they want to bust into their 401(k) to solve the problem they created because they never knew how to make a trade-off.”What do you think?
