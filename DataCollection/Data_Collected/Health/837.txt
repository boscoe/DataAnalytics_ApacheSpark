Mohammad Abo-Hilal, a Syrian psychiatrist, is on a mission to help some of the two million child refugees traumatized by the war in Syria. This video was supported by The Global Reporting Centre.In global health, mental illness has historically taken a back seat to more deadly medical concerns like infectious diseases. But aid organizations, local charities and independent doctors have often intervened during crises to address one of the most disabling psychological problems of all: trauma, whether from rape, natural disasters or civil war.One such effort, Syria Bright Future, is based in Jordan and run by Dr. Mohammad Abo-Hilal, a Syrian psychiatrist. It is focused on helping Syrian refugees, particularly children.The United Nations is calling the Syrian conflict one of the worst humanitarian crises of the modern era. The country was once among the world’s largest hosts of refugees. But after years of a brutal civil war, it is now the largest producer of refugees: more than four million people have fled the country, according to United Nations estimates, about half of them children.
            This series examines the struggle to care for people with mental illness in places where psychiatry is virtually unknown.        Many of them are suffering traumatic reactions. A 2014 report from Unicef cited a survey that found that a third of Syrian children at the Za’atari refugee camp in northern Jordan displayed unusually aggressive behavior and engaged in self-harm. The report warned that without help, these children were at risk of drifting into crime, addiction and violence, and that some were joining criminal gangs or armed groups.AdvertisementDr. Abo-Hilal aims to lower that risk. Himself a refugee, he said he fled Syria in 2011 after being arrested and tortured by the government of President Bashar al-Assad. He arrived in Jordan with his wife and three young children — and set up Syria Bright Future.AdvertisementWith funding from international aid groups, it works with women and people with disabilities, but most of its programs are focused on children. These include one-on-one therapy, in which children begin to describe terrifying memories, and group sessions that try to help children cope with nightmares and flashbacks. They learn to visualize a safe space, use relaxation techniques and confront bad memories by drawing them.The evidence that such techniques can reliably reduce symptoms of traumatic stress is still sketchy. Doctors have searched in vain for good treatments, whether talk therapies or medications. But over time, Dr. Abo-Hilal said, many children have learned to manage their thoughts and emotions. Those with more serious problems are referred for specialized treatment.Dr. Abo-Hilal’s organization also offers activities to help children deal with the practical, day-to-day challenges of being refugees. In the Za’atari camp, Syria Bright Future is providing awareness sessions for teenagers on under-age marriage and gender-based violence, and safe spaces for younger children to play.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
