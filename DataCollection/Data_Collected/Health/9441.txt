Today is a magical day for math lovers and pie lovers. It’s the date on the calendar that happens once a century — 3/14/15 — and  matches the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, otherwise known as pi.To celebrate pi and  pie, we’ve put together a collection of our favorite pies.
Gluten-Free Pumpkin Pie
	:
		One of my all-time favorite pies, this one is sweet with spices but not very sugary.	
Leek and Yogurt Pie
	:
		This vegetable pie is based on a recipe from Diane Kochilas’s “The Glorious Foods of Greece,” an essential compendium for anyone interested in that country’s regional cuisines.	
Eggplant and Tomato Pie
	:
		This robust summer pie, topped with a layer of tomato slices flecked with thyme, is a nice party piece.	
Goat Cheese, Chard and Herb Pie in a Phyllo Crust
	:
		A garlicky mix of greens and your choice of herbs inside a crispy phyllo crust.	
Roasted Sweet Potato Pie or Flan
	:
		I like this as much without a crust as with one.
