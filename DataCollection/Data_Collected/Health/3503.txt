Portobello mushrooms are a great option for a vegan or vegetarian main course because they are large enough to fill a plate and can be stuffed with a variety of flavors.For reader Dianne Wenz of West Orange, N.J., small stuffed mushrooms were always a holiday side dish — until the year she decided not to serve them. “I didn’t make them one year, thinking no one would notice, but my dinner guests were disappointed that they were missing from the holiday table,” said Ms. Wenz. “To make up for it, the following year I made jumbo portobellos stuffed with beans and spinach, and I made them the star attraction of the meal.”
