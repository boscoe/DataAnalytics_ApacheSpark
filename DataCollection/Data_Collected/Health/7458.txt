Stomach and urinary tract infections may have a bright side: A new study reports that they are associated with a reduced risk for rheumatoid arthritis.Previous reports have suggested a connection between infection and rheumatoid arthritis, and this study aimed to test how infections at different sites might be involved.The analysis,  in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, used a Swedish database to investigate 2,831 people with rheumatoid arthritis matched by age, sex and other characteristics to 3,570 healthy controls. Each participant reported incidents of gastrointestinal, urological and respiratory infections over the past two years.Those who reported gastroenteritis were 29 percent less likely to have arthritis, urinary infections 22 percent less likely, and genital infections 20 percent less likely than those who did not. In contrast, there was no association with any respiratory infection — sinusitis, tonsillitis or pneumonia.The researchers acknowledge that their data depends on self-reports, which are not always reliable, and they emphasize that the study found no causal connection between infection and rheumatoid arthritis.The lead author, Maria E.C. Sandberg, a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute, said while this is still at the idea stage, “We hope it inspires further research that may give rise to new treatments in the future.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/10/2015, on page D6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Risks: A Bright Side to Some Infections.
