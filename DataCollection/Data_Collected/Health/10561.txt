In recent decades, studies have linked gum and tooth disease to heart disease. The leading theory was that oral infections and inflammation reached the heart through the blood.AdvertisementBut a literature review by the American Heart Association concluded in 2012 that there was no proof that periodontal disease caused heart disease.A version of this article appears in print on March 31, 2015, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Fluoridated Water Helps Older Adults Keep Teeth.
