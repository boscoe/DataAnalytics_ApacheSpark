Reader Question • 6 votesEveryone born before 1957 is assumed to be immune to measles, because virtually everybody caught it and became immune before the vaccine became available in 1963. It is possible to have a blood test to look for antibodies, which will tell whether you are immune; if you aren’t, you can get the shot. However, it is cheaper, easier and faster to just get the shot. Even if you were vaccinated or did have measles, there is no harm in being vaccinated again.In addition, some people who were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 may have inadequate protection because they received a killed measles virus vaccine, rather than the more effective attenuated live virus vaccine, said Michael Sennett of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An estimated 600,000 to 900,000 people received the killed vaccine, compared with more than 400 million doses of live vaccine that have been administered since the vaccine was licensed, he said.Those who received the inactivated measles vaccine, or are unsure which type they received, should be considered unvaccinated and be revaccinated if they don’t have other evidence of immunity. If there are concerns about an individual’s vaccination history, it is prudent to be revaccinated, Mr. Sennett said.A version of this article appears in print on 02/10/2015, on page D6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Ask Well: When in Doubt, Get Vaccinated.
