Whooping cough in infancy is associated with an increased risk for epilepsy, a new study has found. The findings underscore the importance of vaccination for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, in childhood.Danish researchers used government registries to find 4,700 children born between 1978 and 2011 who were diagnosed with whooping cough; about half were diagnosed when they were less than 6 months old. Each child was matched with 10 healthy control individuals from the general population.Among the 4,700 children who had had pertussis, 1.7 percent later developed epilepsy, compared with 0.9 percent among the 47,000 controls. After adjustment for gestational age, congenital malformations, maternal history of epilepsy and other health variables, the researchers calculated that the risk of developing epilepsy by age 10 in a child who had had whooping cough was 70 percent higher than for an uninfected child. The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.“We can’t say that if a child has epilepsy it was because of a pertussis infection,” said the lead author, Dr. Morten Olsen, an associate professor in the department of clinical epidemiology at Aarhus University Hospital. “And in any case, the absolute risk for epilepsy is very small — about 2 in 100. So we don’t want anyone to panic.”But, he said, “This is another argument to have your child vaccinated, another study showing that pertussis is a serious disease.” Pertussis is known to be associated with seizures and brain damage, but this is the first study to find an association with epilepsy. The mechanism is not clear, but the authors suggest that the severe coughing of pertussis may reduce the flow of oxygen to the brain.A version of this article appears in print on 12/01/2015, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Childhood: Infant Pertussis-Epilepsy Link.
