Only two weeks of modest consumption of high-fructose corn syrup causes cholesterol and triglycerides levels to rise, and the more consumed, the greater the increases.Researchers divided 85 people with generally healthy lipid profiles into four groups. One group consumed drinks sweetened with 25 percent high-fructose corn syrup; the second with a 17.5 percent concentration; the third 10 percent; and the last drinks sweetened only with aspartame.The results, in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, were consistent: The more corn syrup, the worse the lipid profile. While LDL (or “bad” cholesterol) in the aspartame group remained the same before and after the diet, the 10 percent group went to 102 from 95, the 17.5 percent to 102 from 93, and the 25 percent group to 107 from 91. Optimal LDL levels are under 100.Other blood tests of cardiovascular risk — non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid and others — moved in the same negative directions.“It was a surprise that adding as little as the equivalent of a half-can of soda at breakfast, lunch and dinner was enough to produce significant increases in risk factors for cardiovascular disease,” said the lead author, Kimber L. Stanhope, a research scientist at the University of California, Davis. “Our bodies respond to a relatively small increase in sugar, and that’s important information.”For more fitness, food and wellness news, “like” our Facebook page.
