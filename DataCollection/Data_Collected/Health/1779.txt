Pre-eclampsia, a frequent complication of pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, is associated with an increased risk for heart defects in newborns, a large study has found.Canadian researchers studied records of all live births in hospitals in Quebec from 1989 to 2012, a total of 1,942,072 newborns. The study, in JAMA, found an overall prevalence of heart defects of 8.9 per 1,000 births.But the rate among women with pre-eclampsia was 16.7 per 1,000. Defects in the septums, the walls that separate the heart’s chambers, were the most common, but all parts of the heart were affected — the aorta, pulmonary artery, valves and ventricles. The association was present after controlling for age of the mother, pre-existing hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes, obesity and other factors. Women whose pre-eclampsia occurred earlier in pregnancy were at higher risk.Pre-eclampsia by definition is diagnosed only after 20 weeks of pregnancy, but the researchers write that pre-eclampsia and heart defects probably share common risk factors that start earlier.The lead author, Dr. Nathalie Auger, an epidemiologist at the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre, said obesity is a risk factor for pre-eclampsia, but there is currently no way to prevent pre-eclampsia or heart defects.“But heart defects are rare,” she added, “and most women with pre-eclampsia will have children with normal hearts.”A version of this article appears in print on 11/03/2015, on page D6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Childbirth: Pre-eclampsiau2019s Heart Risk.
