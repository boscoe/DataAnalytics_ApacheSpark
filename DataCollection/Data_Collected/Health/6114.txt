Frieden, director of the C.D.C. He said doctors did not recommend the antivirals often enough, and should prescribe them even before an office visit for patients with flu symptoms and a high risk of complications. The medicines are safe for children and should be given even to those younger than 2, who can become dangerously ill from the flu, Dr. Frieden said. He said drugs could keep patients out of the hospital or intensive care, and might even save their lives.Advertisement
