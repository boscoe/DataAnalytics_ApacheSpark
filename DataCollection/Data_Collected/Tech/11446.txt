Is there a version of the program (or something similar) for the Android tablet community that isn’t expensive and is also simple enough for normal people to use?A. While it may get the most attention, Apple’s GarageBand program is not the only tool for those who want to create and edit their own music and audio projects; comparable apps for Android and Windows devices do exist. For instance, Stagelight by Open Labs provides step-by-step lessons for creating your own songs and includes a set of digital instruments and a library of audio loops. The basic app is free, but you can buy and download additional content to use with it. Stagelight works with Android 4.4, as well as with Windows 7 and later on a PC.The basic version of Magix Music Maker Jam is also free and comes in versions for Android, iOS and Windows 8 and Windows 10 computers. For a few dollars, in-app purchases bring extra content and features. Another Android-compatible music app, FL Studio Mobile, costs about $16.50 at the Google Play store, but it has video tutorials on YouTube to give you an idea of the app’s range and capabilities; a Windows variation called FL Studio Groove is $10.You can find other music-mixing apps to sample in the Google Play store. Keep in mind that some programs come with hefty audio libraries and may need some significant space on your tablet, though they many not be as demanding as the iOS version of Apple’s GarageBand app, which consumes at least a gigabyte of room on the device.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
