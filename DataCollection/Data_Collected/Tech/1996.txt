By any standard, Vera Jourova has had a busy year.As the European commissioner of justice, Ms. Jourova, a 51-year-old Czech, just helped to complete the largest overhaul in the region’s privacy rules in roughly 20 years. The changes, released late Tuesday, could have serious consequences for some of the world’s largest tech giants like Google and Facebook, including potential fines of as much as 4 percent of companies’ global revenues if they run afoul of Europe’s tough data protection rules.Ms. Jourova has also been at the center of the region’s somewhat stumbling response to a recent European court ruling that stopped companies from using a so-called safe harbor agreement to move online data between Europe and the United States.Europe’s policy makers have been trying to hammer out a new deal with their American counterparts, though both sides remain far apart on the access that United States intelligence agencies should have to Europeans’ data and what type of legal remedies Europeans can take in American courts when their data is misused.Yet as Europe winds down for the end of the year, Ms. Jourova’s in-tray already is filling up for 2016.Her most pressing task will be to complete a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement by the end of January. If a deal is not done by then, some of Europe’s national privacy watchdogs have suggested they could start investigations into companies that they believe are not protecting their citizens’ data.Already, a number of agencies, including the French and Spanish regulators, have sent letters to international companies reminding them of their obligations after the current safe harbor agreement was invalidated, according to legal counsels to a number of multinational companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.In an interview, Ms. Jourova said she still believed a data transfer deal could be reached by the end of next month, though she called on American authorities to give greater assurances that Europeans’ data would be protected from potential abuse from private and government entities.“A deal will only be made if there’s an equitable approach in the United States,” Ms. Jourova said, adding that she was scheduled to speak to her American counterparts at the Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Commission later this week. “By the end of January, we will have enough commitments from Americans bodies that European data protection rules will be ensured on American soil.”Ms. Jourova must also calm nerves across the region after the completion of the new, tough data protection rules. Along with heavy sanctions, the overhaul enshrines the so-called right to be forgotten into European law and forces any company with European customers — even if it does not have headquarters in the 28-member European Union — to comply or face potential fines.Several trade groups representing the likes of Google and Microsoft already have raised concerns that Europe’s new privacy rules might not be carried out uniformly.In a last-minute change, for example, Europe’s policy makers said anyone under the age of 16 must get parental consent to use online services like Snapchat and Instagram, but also included a provision letting national governments reduce that threshold to 13 years old if they so choose.Companies also are concerned that the region’s heavy sanctions for privacy abuses — say, when a company does not ask permission to use an individual’s online information — may be pursued with different levels of vigor in some countries compared to others.Facebook, for instance, is facing five separate investigations — in France, Spain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands — over potential data protection violations. And under the new regime, privacy experts said, companies could face a lottery over how national regulators view the financial damages caused by such activities.For Ms. Jourova, Europe’s new privacy rules must be uniform across the region, though she said the European Commission had work to do before the rules go into force in 2017 to educate regulators, companies and Europe’s citizens about the current proposals.“They are independent bodies and can do whatever they want,” she said in reference to Europe’s data protection authorities. “But it would be a failure if they impose different sanctions for the same data breach.”A version of this article appears in print on 12/21/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Tough 2016 Ahead for European Official.
