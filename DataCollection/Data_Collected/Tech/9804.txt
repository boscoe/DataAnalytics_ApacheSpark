The candidates post their opinions there, sometimes in the middle of the night. Reporters go there. Voters go there. And what is said there is often more important than what is said at campaign rallies.Now imagine that, despite all the interest and all the seeming success, your company still can’t turn a profit. And the number of people using your service isn’t growing very much.That’s the dilemma facing Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter. Despite a presidential election with a famously Twitter-happy candidate, the company lost $103 million on $616 million in revenue in its most recent quarter. Twitter’s total users increased 3 percent from a year ago, to 317 million.Perhaps not so surprisingly, Twitter announced on Thursday that it would cut 350 jobs, or about 9 percent of its work force. With those cuts, the goal is to get the company to profitability next year.The bullish view on Twitter is that after stagnating for more than a year, the number of people using it is on an upward trend again. That would mean more ads to show people, more revenue and, if it is careful with costs, profitability.The bearish view? After the presidential election is over, users drift off to something else, and the company becomes best known for what the election left behind — an army of racist trolls. That’s not going to be very appealing to advertisers.Advertisement
