The foundational stories of successful tech companies — at least the ones people like to tell over and over again — always include an unlikely and humble place: The family garage, a rented garage, even a playground.But in recent years, no story of humble corporate origin has carried as much weight as that of Facebook, created by Mark Zuckerberg and friends in a Harvard dorm room. That is, if you can claim a Harvard dorm to be a humble place.Not so surprisingly, many universities are now trying to cultivate that entrepreneurial spirit. At Rice University in Houston, for example, where students are already offered scholarly courses on business strategy and financing, as well as start-up workshops, administrators earlier this year announced a multimillion-dollar “entrepreneurship initiative” to develop related course and programs.Universities like Rice are following in the footsteps of successful efforts at Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — two schools that have long been associated with the tech industry. Critics worry that start-up programs inside universities may lack academic rigor and merely parrot Silicon Valley’s “innovate and disrupt” mindset while ignoring larger societal issues and critical thinking.And those critics may have a point. But for many students, learning professional skills firsthand can be just as important as what they learn in a classroom.
