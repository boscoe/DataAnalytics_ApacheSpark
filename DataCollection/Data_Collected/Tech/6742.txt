LONDON — France’s privacy watchdog on Friday called on Google to apply a European data protection ruling to its global domains or face financial penalties.The move relates to a decree from Europe’s top court last year that allowed anyone with connections to the region to request that links about themselves be removed from search engine results. That so-called right to be forgotten ruling has pitted Google, whose search engine holds a roughly 90 percent market share in Europe, against some of the region’s privacy regulators.The authorities want the ruling to apply to all of Google’s domains, including Google.com, although the company contends that Europe’s privacy legislation should apply only to regional domains like Google.de in Germany.French authorities are now increasing the pressure on the American company, saying that Google must apply the ruling across all of its domains in the next 15 days or face penalties including a one-off fine of up to 300,000 euros, or almost $340,000. Last year  Google was fined €150,000 for failing to adhere to the country’s rules in a separate privacy case.Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, who leads the French data protection authority, has been a vocal campaigner to expand Europe’s rules beyond the 28-member bloc. The region’s privacy officials will meet in Paris next week to discuss a variety of data protection issues, including the right to be forgotten ruling and pending changes to Europe’s privacy legislation.“For Google, the answer is worldwide,” said Ms. Falque-Pierrotin, when questioned late last year about the scope of the European privacy ruling. “If people have the right to be delisted from search results, then that should happen worldwide.”The French have also been the most active Europeans to request that links be removed from search engine results. Since the ruling last year, more than 55,000 requests from France have been submitted to Google, with about half of the links removed, according to the company’s latest transparency report.Google said that, when applying the right to be forgotten ruling, it had tried to strike a balance between individuals’ privacy and the right to gain access to online information. The company is expected to fight the move by the French regulator in the country’s courts.“The ruling focused on services directed to European users, and that’s the approach we are taking in complying with it,” Al Verney, a company spokesman, said in a statement.
