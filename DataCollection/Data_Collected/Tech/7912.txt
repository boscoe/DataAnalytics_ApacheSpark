As many job seekers know, networking can be a delicate art. In person, aggressive networkers earn themselves blank stares and no jobs, the human equivalent of the spam filter.If LinkedIn, one of the Internet’s largest professional networking sites, were a person, it would be the guy who looks nice enough, but has a tendency to pelt strangers with business cards at happy hour. The site is notorious for its aggressive email blasts — Are you absolutely, positively sure you don’t want to connect with Kathy? — and is often the target of public gripes from overwhelmed users.
            LinkedIn is like Beetlejuice. You say it too many times and they’re going to email you.        
            Time to edit my LinkedIn email settings. I like you @LinkedIn but five emails before noon is too many for one day.        
            dear god WHY did I become active in linkedin x_x TOO MANY EMAILS WAY TOO MANY EMAILS. PLEASE TELL ME THERE IS A SETTING TO STOP THIS!        On Monday, LinkedIn decided that less is more.In a blog post, the site acknowledged its history of overzealous email habits and said it was taking steps to reduce the amount that users would receive. Among the examples, users who receive too many requests to connect will now get just one weekly digest, and users who subscribe to several of the site’s groups will get updates in a streamlined format.“For every 10 emails we used to send, we’ve removed 4 of them,” Aatif Awan wrote in the post. “Already, member’s complaints have been cut in half.”In May, the site’s chief executive, Jeff Weiner, told BuzzFeed that the email traffic was too much for some users.“That needs to be corrected and improved, and it will be,” he said.It looks like the first steps toward a fix are already in place, but if you have a LinkedIn account and you’d like greater control over the flow of LinkedIn emails, there’s also an extensive toolbox for controlling email type and frequency on the Privacy & Settings page.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
