Dell has been relatively quiet since it went private nearly two years ago. But it may be near making a huge splash, as the company is said to be in advanced talks to buy EMC.As Michael J. de la Merced and Quentin Hardy report, a deal between the two companies would answer years of questions about the fate of EMC, a 36-year-old company that has grown into a collection of businesses, including network security and content management for corporate clients.It would also seem to give a clearer sense of where Dell is headed.
