It’s Facebook’s turn on Wednesday to present its report card.The company is scheduled to post its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, and it’s projected to be another robust financial report. Wall Street is estimating a 36 percent increase in revenue for the social network, to $4.37 billion, as the company has steadily built up its mobile advertising business and expanded into areas including messaging and virtual reality. Facebook follows a mixed bag of social media results this earnings season. Last week, LinkedIn beat expectations with its quarterly results, while Twitter gave a dismal outlook and said its user growth remained tempered. In one effort to appeal to new users, Twitter on Tuesday replaced the stars that people have used to “favorite” messages with a heart icon denoting a “like,” setting off a furious reaction among the Twitterati. Twitter appeared unrepentant, tweeting that “you can say a lot with a heart.”Speaking of reactions, San Franciscans also went to the polls on Tuesday to vote on a slate of ballot initiatives, many of which seemed to be responses to the excesses brought on by the tech boom in the city. One of the more contentious measures was Proposition F, designed to limit the supply of short-term home rentals in San Francisco and widely seen as directed against Airbnb, the highly valued online lodging service. The proposition failed to pass.
