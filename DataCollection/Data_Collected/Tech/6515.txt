On Monday, Apple will begin its annual developer conference, where the company is set to release new tools for software developers to create smarter apps that will gain deep access to the watch’s heart-rate and motion sensors, among other components, Brian X. Chen reports.“It feels like we have both our hands tied behind our backs, and that’s why you haven’t seen anything really impressive,” Phillip Ryu, a founder of a company that makes mobile games, said about apps for the watch, which was released with around 3,500 programs. Now, “it sounds like they plan on untying our hands.”Also on Monday, Apple is expected to announce the most sweeping changes to its music offerings since it introduced the iTunes store 12 years ago and revolutionized the way songs were bought and sold, Ben Sisario reports.

The new features will include a subscription streaming plan to compete with Spotify, as well as updates to the iTunes Radio service that will go up against both Pandora and traditional broadcasters, according to people briefed on the company’s plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
