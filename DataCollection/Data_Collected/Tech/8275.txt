For a while, Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, looked as if it was making a retail push into the United States and, just maybe, could directly compete with Amazon.com. But in June, after just a year, Alibaba sold the online marketplace 11 Main as well as three other small companies it had acquired to compete for American customers.The withdrawal made sense. Rather than taking a costly (and risky) run at Amazon, it would continue to help American retail brands sell to China’s vast and growing middle class.But on Wednesday there were indications that Alibaba may need to tweak that plan as well. The company reported that revenue was up 28 percent, but that growth was below Wall Street expectations. As a result, Alibaba’s stock tumbled more than 5 percent.So what’s wrong? Alibaba’s executives have said several things would fuel growth of their company, chief among them the big and getting bigger by the day e-commerce market in China. Sounded great. What they may not have counted on was an economic slowdown in their home country, made trickier by the devaluation of China’s currency.Of course, many companies would be happy to deal with “disappointing” 28 percent growth. But when investors are buying your stock on the assumption of hyper-growth, any return to normality can be taken as a sign of weakness.
