Thousands of cash-strapped Americans who filled out applications for payday loans on sites with names like paymeloans.com instead found their financial details had been used to make unauthorized debits or credit card charges, according to an investigation by federal regulators.The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday morning said it had charged two information resale companies with illegally selling the payday loan applications of more than 500,000 consumers. The third parties that bought the information subsequently “raided” consumers’ bank accounts for at least $7.1 million, regulators said.Some consumers subsequently had to close their accounts or were charged fees for insufficient funds, the agency said.In a complaint filed last week, the agency said that Sequoia One, a data broker whose principal place of business is in Tampa, Fla., and Gen X Marketing Group, a data broker in Clearwater, Fla., collected payday loan applications containing sensitive financial details, including consumers’ names, addresses, employer names and Social Security, phone, bank account and bank routing numbers.Sequoia One and Gen X Marketing Group could not be immediately reached for comment.But instead of selling the applications to legitimate payday lenders, the complaint said, the companies sold the loan applications to non-lender companies “that used consumers’ sensitive information to commit fraud by debiting consumers’ bank accounts for purported financial products that the consumers never purchased.”The complaint also charged four executives with selling personal information without consumers’ knowledge or consent and said these managers were aware of a “high probability” of fraud. Three of the defendants have agreed to settle the F.T.C.’s charges.The case comes at a time when federal agencies, legislators and trade groups are debating whether to restrict the trade in potentially sensitive information about consumers. Although there are narrow federal laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA that place some restrictions on how an individual’s credit or health records can be shared, there is little restriction on the sharing or sale of other financial and health information about consumers for marketing purposes.“There is a debate about whether invasions of privacy harm consumers,” Jessica Rich, the director of the the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a phone interview. “This is a clear-cut example where the sale of sensitive data caused considerable harm to consumers.”The case is part of a F.T.C. crackdown on predatory practices among specialized information resellers known as lead generators. These are companies that create websites with tools like mortgage calculators or loan application forms to collect information from people in the market for loans, insurance, cars, real estate or other products. Lead generators then sell the data they have amassed, known as leads, to companies seeking customers.Legitimate payday lenders, for instance, generally pay lead generators $10 to $100 per loan application, regulators said, and the lenders use the information to evaluate loan applications as well as transfer money to people whose loans have been approved.But the agency complaint said the data brokers used sites with names like paydayloanpreapprovalnow.com and directfundingservice.com to lure consumers and then sold their financial details to nonlenders for about 50 cents each.A version of this article appears in print on 08/17/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Two Loan Firms Accused of Fraud in Online Scheme.
