The ride-booking company Uber, under legal and regulatory fire across Europe and the United States, got a reprieve in Britain on Friday.A judge ruled that its services could continue to operate in London, one of the company’s largest international markets.As part of a long-awaited legal decision, Duncan Ouseley, the British judge, said that Uber’s smartphone app, which connects drivers with potential passengers, did not represent a traditional taxi meter.Under British law, taxi meters are allowed to be used only by London’s black cabs. The meter law, in place for almost 20 years, defines a taxi meter as a device that calculates a booking based on the time and distance of each ride.The British judge sided with Uber by saying its system did not constitute a traditional taxi meter because the company’s services relied on geospatial data and other technology outside its drivers’ cars to calculate the cost of each ride.Uber is expected to turn its attention to fighting new proposals in London that could put significant restrictions on how it and other ride-booking services operate in the British capital.Those new restrictions, still being drafted by London’s transport authorities and aimed at giving black cabs an edge, could force passengers to wait at least five minutes to enter a car after ordering one through Uber.The proposals would also require Uber drivers to pass a map-reading test and mandate that the company accept bookings up to a week in advance. In contrast to conventional taxi services, Uber does not allow advance bookings, which the company says is crucial to keeping the service and driver scheduling flexible and responsive to real-time demand.Despite the continued legal uncertainties, Uber welcomed the judge’s ruling on Friday, saying that it would allow the company to continue operating unhindered in London.“We understand that black cabdrivers are feeling the pressure from services like Uber,” Jo Bertram, Uber’s regional general manager for Britain, Ireland and the Nordic countries, said in a blog post. “But the answer is to reduce today’s burdensome regulations on cabbies — not introduce new regulations on an entire industry.”The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association, a trade body for London’s black cabs that has been an outspoken critic of Uber, said it would appeal the judge’s decision.The British ruling is one of the few brights spots in Uber’s regulatory fights with officials from Europe, the United States and farther afield.Last month, for instance, one of France’s highest courts upheld a finding that Uber’s low-cost service is illegal.Two of the company’s Paris-based executives are now expected to stand trial early next year on charges that they operated an illegal taxi service in France. Uber and its executives deny any wrongdoing.A version of this article appears in print on 10/19/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: In London,Uber Wins a Taxi Case.
