HONG KONG — China’s antimonopoly regulator sought on Tuesday to defend its $975 million fine against the chip maker Qualcomm, saying in a news conference that the punishment was not designed to ‘‘protect any industry, but more importantly to restore market competitiveness.’’In an official statement, the regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission, said that it had gathered proof that Qualcomm had taken unfair advantage of its dominant market position for chips that support cellular technology. In particular, the commission said, Qualcomm based royalties on the sale price of a smartphone, rather than the patents themselves, included expired patents in licensing agreements and insisted that smartphone companies give permission to use their intellectual property free in so-called cross-licensing agreements. Qualcomm customarily demands cross-licensing agreements from its customers, in part to avoid patent disputes, but also so it can offer clients’ patents along with its own to other customers, giving it an edge in the marketplace.Sheng Jiemin, a law professor at Peking University, called the amount of the fine ‘‘astonishing.’’‘‘This is by far the highest antimonopoly fine ever exacted in China,’’ he said.But he noted that internationally there was a basis for such heavy fines. ‘‘Qualcomm has not only been investigated in China, so this decision is actually a step forward for China,’’ Mr. Sheng said.Shi Jichun, a law professor at Renmin University of China, said the commission’s actions would also help protect consumers from high prices and encourage innovation by making competition between China’s relatively new smartphone companies more fair.Chinese polled online also did not see any problem with the commission’s actions. In a survey of more than 4,000 people by the Internet portal Sina, more than three-quarters indicated that they thought the penalty against Qualcomm was not strong enough.
