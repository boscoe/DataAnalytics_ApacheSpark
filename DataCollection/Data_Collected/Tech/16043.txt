Whoa, Yahoo!When the internet company began its life in 1994, its founders added an exclamation mark to its name to convey a sense of excitement. But now that exclamation mark serves only to punctuate the incredulity of those who have seen the company’s long, steep fall become even worse this week.Yahoo, which is in the throes of completing a sale of its core business to Verizon Communications, revealed on Thursday that it was breached in 2014 by what it believed was a “state-sponsored actor,” resulting in the theft of the account information of at least 500 million users. The hacking is the biggest known intrusion into the company’s computer network, writes Nicole Perlroth, exceeding other breaches in the last few years at companies like Sony.It is another stumble by Yahoo, even as the company’s last chapter as an independent entity seemed to be written. A $4.8 billion sale to Verizon was announced in July after Yahoo tried — and failed — under Marissa Mayer, its chief executive, to rev up growth in the last few years. It’s unclear how the sale will be affected, if at all, by the revelation of the breach.For Yahoo’s users, the hacking is a major headache. The internet portal has one billion monthly active users, who use Yahoo mail and Yahoo groups and get their news through the site — meaning it remains the gateway to many people’s digital identities. While the extent of the fallout will not be known for a while, The New York Times compiled a guide for what Yahoo users can do for now if they think their account was compromised.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
