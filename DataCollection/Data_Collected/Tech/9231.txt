Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, came to Silicon Valley over the weekend and wooed and wowed the tech crowd.Mr. Modi’s schedule was jam-packed with dinners with tech entrepreneurs and executives, as well as a question-and-answer session with the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, among other events. The visit — with Mr. Modi spending time in the heart of Silicon Valley — was a contrast to the command performance that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, had technology chief executives put on for him last week during a state visit to the United States, and indicated Mr. Modi’s desire to build up India as a tech destination. Mr. Modi may well get his wish, as companies including Facebook and Google are racing to get into India after being shut out of China. There are no state leaders holding big-time events with tech chief executives on the West Coast this week, but there is the usual flurry of news. Apple said this morning that it sold more than 13 million new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus devices in the first weekend that the smartphones went on sale.
