Uber has picked up another strategic investor.The ride-sharing company has raised roughly $100 million in financing from the Tata Opportunities Fund, an Indian private-equity firm owned by the Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The investment is meant to help Uber expand its business in India, one of the world’s biggest markets.Uber already said that it had planned to invest $1 billion by early next year into its operations in India, where Uber competes with local rivals like Ola, a ride-booking service that recently raised $400 million. Uber offers its services in 18 Indian cities, making India Uber’s largest individual market based on locations outside of the United States.“Right now, we’re particularly focused on building a great service for hundreds of millions of Indians,” Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, said in a statement about the partnership on Wednesday. “Tata’s leadership and experience will be crucial in helping us meet this important goal.”Both companies declined to comment on the value of the investment. A recent round of fund-raising valued Uber at around $50 billion.The partnership with Tata follows a similar deal with Baidu, China’s top search engine, which invested hundreds of millions of dollars into Uber late last year. Uber is making a big push into China.The deals with Baidu and Tata are part of Uber’s plans to become the world’s dominant private car service. Uber operates in more than 330 cities in 60 countries, quickly expanding beyond its San Francisco roots.Despite Uber’s global ambitions, the company has run into several problems during its expansion.In India, lawmakers in the Delhi region banned Uber’s services after one of the company’s drivers, who operate as independent contractors, was accused of raping a passenger. The ban was lifted this summer.Authorities in Guangzhou, a southern Chinese city, also raided Uber’s local offices in May, according to local media reports, and the company has faced violent protests across Europe where taxi associations and politicians have accused Uber of not complying with local transport rules.
