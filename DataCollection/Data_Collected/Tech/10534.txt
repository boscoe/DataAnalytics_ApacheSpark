Google Keep is the company’s own version of the all-purpose organizer for notes, lists, photos, drawings and reminders. You can also record and store audio clips and save webpage links within the Keep repository. From the Keep toolbar, you can quickly search for notes you have saved, and the program can even recognize text in photos and convert it to editable type — just choose the image, tap open the Menu icon in the top-right corner and select Grab Image Text.To turn a webpage into a note within your Google Keep files, open the tablet’s browser and call up the page you want to save. Tap the Share button or icon on the screen, or tap the More menu (which looks like a vertical stack of three dots) in the upper-right corner and choose Share from the menu.In the Share menu options, find and tap the yellow Google Keep icon. You should see a miniature version of that webpage in your Keep files. Later, when you are perusing your Keep notes, tap the web page preview to open that pageGoogle Keep works with Android, iOS, Chrome and other desktop browsers. As with similar note-organizer apps (like Evernote, Zoho Notebook, Microsoft OneNote and Apple’s iCloud Notes), the software can sync up across devices so your note collection is readily available on the screen you happen to be using at the moment.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
