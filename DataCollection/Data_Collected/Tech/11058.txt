Silicon Valley wealth can end up in unexpected places, with unusual results. One such example would be the wealth created by the social network Facebook, which over the years has reaped a bonanza for its co-founders, investors, early employees and others. Much of that money has gone into the usual gamut of things on the Silicon Valley spending list: new start-ups, some philanthropic efforts, not to mention cars, houses and high-priced vacations. But one atypical use of the Facebook money was the acquisition made in 2012 by Chris Hughes, one of the social network’s co-founders, who used part of his fortune to purchase The New Republic, a magazine known for its intellectual pieces, left-leaning political views and the nurturing of promising writers and editors. Since Mr. Hughes bought the magazine, he has tried to remake it into more of a digital media property — but with limited success. In 2014, staffers at the magazine revolted after Mr. Hughes replaced the publication’s editor, Franklin Foer, and others.On Monday, Mr. Hughes, 32, said it was time to end his grand experiment with The New Republic and put the magazine up for sale, writes Ravi Somaiya. “I will be the first to admit that when I took on this challenge nearly four years ago, I underestimated the difficulty of transitioning an old and traditional institution into a digital media company in today’s quickly evolving climate,” Mr. Hughes wrote in a letter to staff that was posted publicly. Let’s see what Mr. Hughes puts his Facebook money into next.
