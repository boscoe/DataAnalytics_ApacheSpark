The question of whether drivers at Uber and other on-demand companies are employees or contract workers does not yet have a firm answer. Some prominent executives and policy advocates are even arguing for a new kind of worker status, something that falls in the middle.Seattle, meanwhile, is taking its own approach.The city council there is expected to vote Monday on whether on-demand drivers have the right to collectively negotiate on pay and working conditions. If approved, the vote — pushed for by a drivers’ group — could give the drivers more say on their pay and inspire drivers in other cities to pursue similar votes. The results could have lasting repercussions on the bottom lines of Uber and Lyft. The vote will hardly be a final word on the question of labor rights and classification for people working in the on-demand world. But it is pretty clear that the drivers are not going to stay silent on the issues.
