Several members of the Federal Trade Commission defended on Wednesday the actions taken by the agency in its antitrust investigation of Google, nearly a week after an internal document came to light, raising questions about the process.An internal document from the Federal Trade Commission written during the investigation in 2012 but first reported on last week  showed that some central staff within the agency had wanted to sue Google for anticompetitive practices. The agency’s five commissioners ultimately voted not to sue.On Wednesday, the three commissioners who were at the F.T.C. at the time of that decision released a joint statement on the decision.“The Federal Trade Commission conducted an exhaustive investigation of Google’s Internet search practices during 2011 and 2012,” began the statement, issued by Edith Ramirez, the current chairwoman of the agency, and two fellow commissioners — one Democrat and one Republican.The commissioners asserted that the document recommending legal action, which had been produced by the F.T.C. Bureau of Competition in August 2012 and was mistakenly released to The Wall Street Journal as part of a recent records request, represented “a fraction” of the “voluminous record and extensive internal analysis” that was conducted on the matter.Since news of that document was reported last week, competitors and critics of Google have seized on it as new evidence of what they claim to be the company’s monopolistic practices and its powerful influence in Washington.“The report confirms the ongoing consumer harm that FairSearch.org and other interested parties have long warned about,” said Matt Reilly, legal counsel to FairSearch.org, a group funded by Microsoft and other competitors of Google, and a former antitrust litigator at the F.T.C. “The evidence details how Google abuses its dominant position in the market.”The F.T.C. did not dispute the thrust of that report’s recommendations: not to sue the Internet search giant over its search practices, but to sue for some of the company’s other practices, like pulling —also known as scraping — content from sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor and Amazon to improve Google’s sites.“All five Commissioners (three Democrats and two Republicans) agreed that there was no legal basis for action with respect to the main focus of the investigation — search,” the statement released on Wednesday read. “The Commission’s decision on the search allegations was in accord with the recommendations of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Economics, and Office of General Counsel.”The statement continued: “Some of the F.T.C.’s staff attorneys on the search investigation raised concerns about several other Google practices. In response, the Commission obtained commitments from Google regarding certain of those practices. Over the last two years, Google has abided by those commitments.”Those commitments are outlined in a  letter from Google to the F.T.C.’s then chairman, Jon Leibowitz.In the final paragraph of the commissioners’ statement, the agency once more expressed regret at the inadvertent release of its internal document. “We are taking additional steps to ensure that such a disclosure does not occur in the future,” it said.
