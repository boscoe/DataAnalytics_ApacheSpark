The European Commission on Tuesday filed antitrust charges against the chip maker Qualcomm, the latest in a growing number of competition investigations targeting American technology companies.Europe’s antitrust officials in Brussels said that Qualcomm, one of the world’s largest makers of chips, had abused its dominant market position in the region by offering financial incentives to smartphone and tablet manufacturers that agreed to buy equipment solely from Qualcomm.Qualcomm was also accused of unfairly setting prices below manufacturing costs to force competitors from the market. The company’s chips are widely used in smartphones and other mobile devices that have become central to many people’s daily lives.“I am concerned that Qualcomm’s actions may have pushed out competitors or prevented them from competing,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top competition official, said in a statement on Tuesday. “We need to make sure that European consumers continue to benefit from competition and innovation in an area which is at the heart of today’s economy.”AdvertisementQualcomm said on Tuesday that it had been cooperating with the European authorities and welcomed the opportunity to respond to the charges.
                The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.            “We look forward to demonstrating that competition in the sale of wireless chips has been and remains strong,” Qualcomm’s general counsel, Donald J. Rosenberg, said in a statement by email.AdvertisementQualcomm has until April to respond to the European charges. If found to have breached Europe’s antitrust rules, the chip maker could face fines amounting to about 10 percent of its annual global revenue, which was $26.49 billion in 2014, and could be required to change some of its business practices. In previous European antitrust cases, however, companies typically have not been asked to pay such high financial penalties.The European Commission opened its investigation into potential wrongdoing by Qualcomm in July.The company has been the focus of previous competition investigations.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As part of that deal, the company said it would offer a significant discount in China on licenses for some of its communications systems for high-speed data for smartphones.European policy makers ended a two-year inquiry in 2009 after failing to find evidence that Qualcomm had charged excessive royalties for access to its patents.In 2010, however, Icera, a British chip maker owned by Nvidia, filed a new complaint, accusing Qualcomm of using unfair financial incentives to attract new customers. That complaint formed the basis for the European Commission’s latest antitrust investigations into Qualcomm, according to a statement from the antitrust officials.Qualcomm is just the latest American tech company to face Europe’s antitrust officials. Both Microsoft and Intel have paid significant fines for falling foul of the region’s tough competition rules.
