Mozilla, the nonprofit company behind the Firefox browser, decided to put the software on a “rapid release” schedule a few years ago to speed up the development and delivery of security updates, performance improvements and new features to the program. While this schedule — which makes for a Firefox update about every six weeks — can be helpful for plugging bugs and security holes, it can cause user fatigue from seeing frequent requests to restart the browser because it has just updated itself again.Firefox is set by default to update automatically, but you can change this behavior in the program’s Options area (called Preferences in the Mac version), which lives under the Menu button in the top-right corner of the Firefox window. When you are on the Options/Preferences screen, click Advanced on the left side of the window, and then on the Update tab to see the current settings.While you are on the Update screen, you can see what changed in each new version of the program by clicking the Update History button. The browser then displays a box showing updates that were recently installed, and you can click the Details link next to each one to see more information.For a more extensive history that goes farther back in time and program updates, Mozilla keeps a Firefox Releases page on its site that you can browse for a better understanding of what changed and when. And, if you want to see what versions are scheduled for release in the new year, the company also keeps its Rapid Release Calendar online.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
