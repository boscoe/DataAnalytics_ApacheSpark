AdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Jim KerstetterYou have to give credit to Peter Thiel: The man keeps it interesting.On Thursday, the PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Convention. Mr. Thiel is the rare tech industry figure openly discussing his support of Donald J. Trump, and his appearance at the convention is making plenty of people in Silicon Valley squirm, as Farhad Manjoo writes.You may recall Mr. Thiel was most recently in the news when it was revealed that he was the financial backer of a lawsuit by the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan that has brought the gossip site Gawker to the brink of financial ruin.Mr. Thiel, despite caricatures of him as a sneaky, behind-the-scenes operator, is not a man who is very easily defined. He is a libertarian, which should mean that he is uncomfortable with government surveillance. Yet, he is also a co-founder of Palantir, a company long associated with doing data analysis for intelligence agencies.He is also a major figure in an industry that benefits from free international trade and immigration, yet he is supporting a candidate who aggressively stands against both. He was one of the original backers of Facebook (a move that made him a billionaire) and is still one of its board members, yet Facebook has been accused of having an anti-conservative bias.And Mr. Thiel is gay, speaking to a political party that says in its platform that same-sex marriage is “an assault on the foundations of our society.”Then again, if Mr. Trump wins, Mr. Thiel will be the rare tech figure with influence in the White House.Advertisement
