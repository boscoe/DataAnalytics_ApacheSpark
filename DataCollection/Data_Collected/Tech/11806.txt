Today we are bidding farewell to the blog, though not to the journalism that has sustained it.When Bits was born, blogs were the path toward a digital future. They were the only way for us to publish quickly, without the constraints of print deadlines and production. No more. We now have a home-grown publishing system that allows us to more seamlessly integrate our tech coverage across the web, apps, print, social media â€” everywhere you find our journalism.So for clarity and simplicity, the blog goes away and all tech stories will now carry the label of Tech.You will still see the Bits identifier on some of our journalism. The Bits email newsletter will continue, as will Bits special sections and daily reports that summarize the big news of the day.Even as the DNA of the blog has spread throughout all the work we do, the Bits name remains as a cherished companion to our tech coverage.Advertisement
