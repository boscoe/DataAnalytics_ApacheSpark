O.C.A.P. stands for OpenCable Application Platform, and it is the software that runs on your cable converter/DVR hardware. Just as you have to wait for your computer’s operating system to start up again after you restart your PC, Mac or Linux machine, your cable converter has to restart its own operating system when you reboot the box. As part of this sequence, your converter displays O.C.A.P. instead of the usual clock and picture-resolution information. (Some cable boxes have a fairly long start-up sequence and display other messages like APP as they go through the process.)Interactive applications like electronic channel guides, DVR recording and other programs you use with your remote control all run on the O.C.A.P. system. You do not have to worry about upgrading the software on the cable box yourself because your television provider pushes out any updates it has through the cable connection to the converter.As with computer operating systems, however, your cable box may experience a hardware or software problem at some point. If the box seems to spontaneously restart regularly — or restarts and gets stuck on the O.C.A.P. screen when it is rebooting — contact your cable provider to ask for a technician or a replacement converter box.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
