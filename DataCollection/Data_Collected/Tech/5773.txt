Technology’s older generation of rebels has now almost completely disrupted itself.Over the last few years, longtime leaders of industry giants like Microsoft, Oracle, Intel and IBM have stepped down, in departures that signal the passing of one tech era and the beginning of another. In many cases, their successors now struggle with updating their companies, which were largely built in a world of personal computers and packaged software, for one of mobile devices, cloud computing, sensors and software everywhere.On Monday, perhaps the last veteran leader of the old guard signaled it was time to leave the corner office — if only for a move down the hall. John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems since 1995, said he was stepping down effective July 26, to be succeeded by a longtime Cisco sales executive.“He is the last of the lions, presiding over years of incredible growth,” said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, a market research firm.Mr. Chambers’s successor, Charles H. Robbins, is 49, and joined Cisco, the networking equipment maker, in 1997, just two years after Mr. Chambers became C.E.O. Mr. Chambers, 65, will remain as executive chairman. The company said that Mr. Chambers would spend time supporting the company’s new chief and “engaging closely with customers and governments around the world.”AdvertisementThe transition is another sign of a generational shift in Silicon Valley. In September, Lawrence J. Ellison announced he would leave the C.E.O. position at Oracle, the world’s largest maker of database software. Like Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ellison became the company’s executive chairman and remains active.In August 2013, Steven A. Ballmer said he would step down as head of Microsoft, and he was succeeded in February 2014 by Satya Nadella. Unlike Mr. Ellison or Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ballmer cut his ties with Microsoft and left the board in August. He now gives commands from the courtside of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, which he purchased for $2 billion in May 2014.AdvertisementIn addition, just months before Mr. Ballmer announced his decision to step down as Microsoft chief, there was a passing of the guard at the chip maker Intel, with Brian M. Krzanich becoming chief executive to succeed Paul S. Otellini. The year before, in 2012, Virginia M. Rometty took the place vacated by Samuel J. Palmisano as head of IBM.Even as the executive suites at these large companies have turned over, a web-focused and mobile-proficient group of companies now dominate the technology scene, including Facebook and Google. Many of these are run by much younger leaders than Mr. Chambers, especially Google’s Larry Page, 42, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, 30. Their companies have powerful networks but are primarily devoted to software, and an ethos that information should be ubiquitous and shared.“Now it’s a young man’s game,” Mr. Colony said.Cisco makes much of the gear that runs the Internet, notably digital information switches. It also supplies equipment for the world’s telecommunications infrastructure, and for teleconferencing, video and Wi-Fi networks. It had sales of $47.1 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, compared with $1.2 billion in 1994, just before Mr. Chambers took over.Investors appeared to take the news of the executive shift in stride. Cisco stock closed at $29.17, up 4 cents.Yet the world Mr. Robbins is facing is unquestionably changing, and in a way that is fundamentally different from what Cisco is good at, Mr. Colony noted.
            Under John T. Chambers, who will step down in July as chief executive, Cisco was briefly the world’s most valuable company. Even after the Internet boom, it remained an industry leader.

"Chuck is going to have to break a lot of glass and change a lot of culture at Cisco,” he said.In a call with reporters alongside Mr. Chambers, Mr. Robbins said he would “be looking at ways to support our current strategy,” parts of which he might tweak to move faster.AdvertisementMr. Chambers and Mr. Robbins said Cisco would stress its recent forays into building networks for Internet-connected sensors, the so-called Internet of Things. Companies like General Electric and Google have been working extensively in this area as well. Mr. Robbins indicated that Cisco would be investing more in areas like computing and data storage, to add more value to its products.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The rise came on a combination of technical excellence, aggressive acquisitions, and Mr. Chambers’s irrepressible salesmanship. For a brief period during the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s, Cisco was the world’s most valuable company.Yet the stock has struggled for much of the 15 years since the bubble burst, forcing Mr. Chambers to spend billions buying back Cisco’s shares. The shares are at their highest since 2007, though still less than half their value in 2000.Increasingly, Cisco is facing new competitors offering cheap systems consisting largely of off-the-shelf chips and software, instead of Cisco’s proprietary technology. Companies that were once allies, like Dell and EMC, have also become rivals. Dell now sells switches based on open-source software. A company largely owned by EMC, VMware, owns a substantial software-based networking business.
            Mr. Chambers, 65, who became head of the company in 1995, has been one of the longest serving chiefs of a major publicly traded technology company.        Mr. Chambers at first dismissed the new technologies, but lately has offered products with more software, as well as a place for Cisco’s older components. Cisco also began focusing on the Internet of Things.So far it is a modest business, with a lot of competitors — particularly among an old guard looking for a new act.Ms. Rometty at IBM has also made smarter systems a priority, spending several billion dollars on cloud computing and related technology. At Intel, Mr. Krzanich has pushed into both mobile devices and machines to crunch the loads of data created by big new computing systems. And at Microsoft, Mr. Nadella last week held a conference for independent software developers to work on Microsoft’s cloud and mobile products, along with new technologies like three-dimensional goggles.Along with these competitors, Cisco faces new aspirants, who work more with off-the-shelf components and software. One of these companies is Arista Networks, which is staffed by several former Cisco executives. Mr. Chambers sued Arista last December, citing patent infringement. Arista fired back, calling Cisco’s actions “a smear campaign.”AdvertisementMr. Robbins will be running Cisco under the close watch of Mr. Chambers, who in the eyes of some Cisco watchers is only nominally leaving the corner office.“He’s from the same cloth as John, a sales guy,” said Timothy Zimmerman, an analyst with Gartner. “The major issue is that there has to be a stronger hand in product creation.”Mr. Robbins must also contend with the fact that Mr. Chambers’s nonstop salesmanship over the last two decades, along with the departure of so many executives over the years, has made him very much the public face of Cisco.A version of this article appears in print on May 5, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline:  Tech’s Transition Reaches Cisco.
