But on Wednesday, two relatively young public tech companies reported earnings that were better than Wall Street had expected, which may breathe some life into stalled offerings.The companies were Square, the mobile payments company, and Box, the cloud storage company. Square reported a wider net loss but a 49 percent revenue increase for the fourth quarter, helped by growth in a number of software businesses. The results gave Square’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, a lift. Mr. Dorsey has been juggling his role as chief of both Square and Twitter, writes Mike Isaac.Box, meanwhile, posted a 36 percent increase in sales and narrowed its net loss in the fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. The company has been something of a punching bag for skeptical investors because of steep losses and accumulating costs, but Box’s chief executive, Aaron Levie, has long maintained it was right to go public and that being a public company would ultimately be an advantage. On Wednesday, Box’s shares soared more than 10 percent in after-hours trading after it announced earnings.Advertisement
