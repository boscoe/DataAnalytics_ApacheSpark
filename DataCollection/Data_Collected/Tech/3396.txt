SEATTLE — Microsoft and Samsung have kissed and made up. Almost six months after Microsoft sued Samsung for violating terms of a patent licensing agreement, the two companies on Monday said they had settled their feud, which includes a court case in Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York and an arbitration case at the International Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.   “Samsung and Microsoft are pleased to announce that they have ended their contract dispute in U.S. court as well as the ICC arbitration,” said a brief statement, attributed to Jaewan Chi, a Samsung executive vice president, and David Howard, a Microsoft corporate vice president. “Terms of the agreement are confidential.”In August, Microsoft sued Samsung, claiming it failed to make timely royalty payments related to their patent licensing deal and withheld interest payments stemming from the delay. Microsoft has long claimed that Google’s Android operating system violates a number of Microsoft patents, and has sought licensing deals with a number of companies that make mobile devices based on the software, of which Samsung is the largest. Samsung had contended that Microsoft’s decision to acquire the mobile handset business of Nokia — a direct Samsung competitor — violated the patent licensing agreement between Microsoft and Samsung.
