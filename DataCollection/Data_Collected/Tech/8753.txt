This week in tech land, it’s all about Apple.The world’s most valuable company is holding a product event on Wednesday at the 6,000-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. There, Apple plans to showcase a new version of the iPhone, an upgraded Apple TV, and other offerings, according to Katie Benner and Brian X. Chen.Some of these freshened-up products will have big repercussions on other tech sectors, with the video game industry in Apple’s sights this time as the company makes its Apple TV more of a game-oriented gadget, writes Nick Wingfield. To add to the Apple-ness of it all, a new documentary on Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, opened on Friday. That’s ahead of another movie later this year on Mr. Jobs, who will be played by Michael Fassbender.Expect all of the new Apple gizmos to dominate the conversation this week, at least among the digerati. Join us for our own Apple discussion on Wednesday, when Ms. Benner, Mr. Chen and our tech columnist, Farhad Manjoo, attend Apple’s event and chat about it live online.
