In recommendations released on Monday, a task force assigned by the Federal Aviation Administration said that nearly all recreational drones should be registered with the federal government. The goal, it seems, is to help keep drone pilots honest as they take to the skies.Lots of questions remain about how the government, if it adopts the bulk of the recommendations as expected, will be able to actually enforce these new rules. Most people are probably not a big worry; it is the fraction who purposely create mayhem. These rules donâ€™t seem clearly aimed at the seriously bad actors. It would be a surprise, then, if these proposals are the end of the debate about drones.
