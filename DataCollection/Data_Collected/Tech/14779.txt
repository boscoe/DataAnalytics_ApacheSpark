And it underlines how Facebook is putting serious muscle and resources into Messenger, as messaging increasingly becomes a mobile do-it-all mode of communication, payments and many other functions.This also brings to mind Facebook’s overall footprint in messaging. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion users, while Messenger has more than 900 million. The more capabilities these messaging services add, the more likely people are to stay within Facebook’s family of apps. How’s that for dominance?Advertisement
