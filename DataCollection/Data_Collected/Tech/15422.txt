So it is not all that often nowadays that you hear social media being described as a place that inspires the warm-and-fuzzies.But that is exactly what is happening with a handful of apps that have actually started spurring some honest and unironic online sharing, writes Farhad Manjoo in his State of the Art column.In particular, the Stories features on Instagram and Snapchat, which weave snapshots into video diaries of someone’s day, are becoming a form of escapist entertainment. People are using Stories to depict their lives in an unvarnished fashion, especially since the video diaries expire after 24 hours and don’t live on to mortify their creators. Stories are for the most part also free of news of the real world — instead, they tend to be deeply personal.There are also new apps like Musical.ly, which blends social interactions with the making of music videos. The results are cheerful and fun and are being embraced by young people.So for those striving to sidestep, say, news of shootings or the you-can’t-make-this-stuff-up nature of this year’s presidential election, there are ways to get away from it all. And believe it or not, some of those places are still online.Advertisement
