The Waze app, which is owned by Google, is known for its real-time traffic reports and driving directions that dynamically update based on the latest data available. The app’s interface encourages its users to submit their honest observations as they travel, but instances have occurred where people have attempted to fool the service with incorrect information.For example, suburban residents have tried filing inaccurate reports of accidents or roadwork in their neighborhoods in hopes of making Waze plot traffic routes away from the area. Highway patrol officers, many of whom are concerned that the Waze app includes a button for reporting police sightings (and would like that feature removed for the safety of its officers), have also allegedly filed false location reports to obscure their true whereabouts.As Waze is an application that relies heavily on crowdsourcing, the overall group of people making reports can help weed out misinformation from polluting the constantly evolving map. When using the app on the road, travelers are encouraged to confirm — or deny — incidents like accidents, construction, highway hazards or police presence. Others passing through can quickly debunk a false report and correct the map.The Waze app itself also has safeguards built in to thwart tampering. As the app uses the smartphone’s GPS service, the software can tell if the user is in the correct area and in motion at the time of a report. Waze also suspends users who file too many false reports — in an attempt to earn points in the app’s gamelike interface — or to incorrectly alter the map.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
