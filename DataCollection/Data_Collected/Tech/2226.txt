I looked in the app, but I canâ€™t figure out how to cancel the service. How does one resign from Apple Music?A. If you have reached the end of the free three-month trial period of the Apple Music streaming service and find it is not for you, you can cancel your subscription (and monthly bill for it) in your Apple account settings. To quit Apple Music from your computer, open the iTunes program in Windows or Mac OS X.Click the account icon next to the search box in the top-right corner of the iTunes window. If you are not logged into the account, click Sign In and enter your Apple ID name and password if asked; this is the same name and password you use to buy content from the iTunes Store. Select Account Info from the menu. For security reasons, you may be asked for your password one more time.When you land on the Account Information screen in iTunes, scroll down to the Settings section. On the Subscriptions line, click Manage. On the Manage Subscriptions screen, go to the Apple Music membership line, click Edit and turn off the monthly Automatic Renewal setting. Click the Done button.To cancel your subscription from the Apple Music app for iOS, open the Music app and tap the account profile icon in the upper-left corner of the screen.
