Q. How do you get an animated GIF to work on Facebook? I uploaded one like I do with a regular photo and it just sits there, not moving.A. Facebook began officially allowing animated GIF files to appear in Timeline updates last year, but there is a specific method for posting them to your page. Instead of uploading them directly as you would a photo or video, you must instead post a link to the animated GIF from its current location on the web. Facebook, which also lets businesses boost promotional posts with animated GIF files, recommends that the files be less than 8 megabytes in size. The site converts animated GIF files uploaded directly to its pages to static images.As for finding links to animated GIFs, the web has several archives of the looping files, including those at Giphy.com, Imgflip.com and Imgur.com; the Labs area of the Giphy site also hosts extensions for popular browsers and other tools for using animated GIF files. Other sites, like the Digital Public Library of America, collect animated GIFs made from historical images. If you want to use original material for your creation, most animated GIF sites include tools for you to upload content and make your own gently moving pictures.Once you post the link to your animated GIF, your Facebook friends should see it behave according to their own settings for video playback. If the Auto-play Videos setting is enabled, the GIF should play on its own. Users who have the auto-play feature turned off need to click on the GIF’s thumbnail image to start the animation.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
