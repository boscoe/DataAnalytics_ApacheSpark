We are assured by the technologists of Silicon Valley that one day in the maybe not-so-distant future, robots will do most of the driving for us. Google, for example, has been testing autonomous cars for several years. Uber is also testing them with passengers in Pittsburgh and — for the moment — San Francisco.A computer needs its information to be a bit more specific than “turn left by the Stop and Shop,” so tech companies appear to have some work to do to give their self-driving computers the kind of detailed maps they will need.On Monday, the National Transportation Safety Board urged companies to add grade crossings to their digital maps. The recommendation comes 18 months after a fatal accident in California in which a driver’s use of a digital map may have been partly to blame. Grade crossings are particularly dangerous because the railway lines are at the same level as the road, and all it takes is a split-second mistake for a driver to make a bad turn and get stuck on the tracks.As Daisuke Wakabayashi writes, several big tech companies have promised to respond to the N.T.S.B.’s recommendation, but the companies have been very slow to add the crossings to their maps.It is an odd reaction. A Google car is going to need all the mapping detail it can get — grade crossings included — because it will not be navigating with intuition. It needs data. For that matter, so do humans, who are increasingly dependent on a computer to tell them where to go.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
