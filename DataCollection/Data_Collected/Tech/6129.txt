After a hiatus from his company RealNetworks, Rob Glaser is hoping for a Steve Jobs-like comeback.Mr. Glaser, who founded RealNetworks in 1994 and left in 2010, returned to his company in 2012 and became chief executive again last year. The company, which made RealPlayer, the streaming media software that was popular in the 1990s, is losing money. But Mr. Glaser is trying to drive it back into relevance with RealTimes, a photo-sharing application centered on families that was released on Tuesday.The RealTimes app lets users stitch photos and videos into montages that are stored on RealNetworks’s cloud service. The app, which is compatible with iPhones, Android devices, PCs and some TV streaming devices, is free for those who want to create clips that are no longer than 30 seconds; for people who want to make longer videos and use more cloud storage, Real offers paid subscription plans.RealTimes isn’t RealNetworks’s first major product since Mr. Glaser’s return. In 2013, the company introduced RealPlayer Cloud, which allowed people to share videos across different types of devices.RealPlayer Cloud was no game changer. But Mr. Glaser drew a parallel to when Mr. Jobs returned to a nearly bankrupt Apple in 1997. That company’s first comeback product was the iMac, followed by the iPod, which opened the door for Apple’s creation of the iPhone.“If they hadn’t done the iPod first, they probably wouldn’t have done the iPhone,” Mr. Glaser said. Similarly, Mr. Glaser said, RealPlayer Cloud laid the groundwork to make RealTimes.Making a comeback won’t be easy. RealNetworks, based in Seattle, continues to bleed money. For the first quarter of this year, RealNetworks reported a loss of $24.5 million, compared with a loss of $7.8 million in the period last year.RealTimes also enters a market flooded with media-sharing apps, including Instagram and Flickr. But Mr. Glaser is optimistic that his product will stand out because of its strong focus on families. Parents will find value in producing and sharing montages, partly because they can document their children changing as they grow older, he said.“If we really appeal to that market, we’ll unlock plenty of network effects,” Mr. Glaser said.A version of this article appears in print on 05/25/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Comeback Hopes in Photo-Sharing.
