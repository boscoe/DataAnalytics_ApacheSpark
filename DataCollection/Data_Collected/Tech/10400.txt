It is not yet clear who was responsible, but computer experts believe the attack in mid-November came from outside the country, and hackers in Iran are possible suspects. Similar malware was used two years ago in attacks on the Las Vegas Sands and Sony.About a month earlier, still-unidentifed hackers shut down access to a range of computer sites by sending a flood of traffic to a New Hampshire company that manages chunks of the internet’s infrastructure. They relied on corrupted internet-connected devices, like cameras, to generate that huge volume of traffic.And earlier this week, someone broke into the computers of San Francisco’s mass transit system, forcing the service to offer free fares.Who is doing it? Most likely, experts say, it’s a combination of nation states and hacking groups. But the recent attacks show that the stakes are rising, from hacking for fun or credit card numbers to bringing down important infrastructure systems.Advertisement
