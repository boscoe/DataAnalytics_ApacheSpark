Q. I have an iPhone and an iMac and somehow when the phone rings, so does the computer. Any idea how to turn off the computer component so just the iPhone rings? A. The Continuity feature (which Apple introduced with OS X 10.10 Yosemite and iOS 8 software in 2014), is designed to link certain apps and functions between your Mac and your iOS gadgets so you can keep working no matter which device you happen to be using. Continuity is the reason your Mac also rings when your iPhone gets a call, or — thanks to the Handoff feature within Continuity — why an email message you have started to compose on your iPhone pops up on your Mac’s screen when you walk into the room containing the computer.Your Mac will ring when you get a call if you are signed into iCloud and your FaceTime video/audio chat app with the same Apple ID on both your iPhone and Mac — as long as the computer and the phone are on the same Wi-Fi network. It is possible that the settings for using Continuity were enabled when setting up a new iPhone or Mac or during a software update for either.To stop the Mac from ringing when you get a call on the iPhone, open the FaceTime program from its icon in the desktop Dock; you can also open it from the OS X Launchpad screen or the Mac’s Applications folder. When the FaceTime program is open, go to the FaceTime menu, select Preferences and click the Settings tab. Turn off the check box next to Calls From iPhone and close the box.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
