Amazon Web Services on Wednesday announced Amazon WorkMail, an email service that adds a new front to the fierce competition in the cloud. WorkMail, which works behind existing interfaces like Microsoft Outlook, is being promoted as safer and cheaper than other systems.“Customers have repeatedly asked us for a business email and calendaring service that is more cost-effective and simpler to manage than their on-premises solution, more secure than the cloud-based offerings available today, and that is backed by the same best-in-class infrastructure platform on which they’re reliably running so many of their current (and future) workloads,” said Peter De Santis, vice president of AWS Compute Services, said in a news release.Amazon has been the leader in cloud computing, but Microsoft in particular is determined to catch up. Google is another major player, with IBM also a contender. “Even though there are these strong competitors, Amazon thinks there is still a market out there,” said T. J. Keitt, an analyst with Forrester Research. “They can make a play based on their data center capability and security, but whether that adds up to a highly utilized offering is to be determined. It could be an uphill march.”Google declined to comment. Julie White, general manager of office marketing at Microsoft, declined to directly address Amazon’s new venture but said in a statement that Microsoft has been deeply invested in business email for 20 years. She added that Microsoft was “making investments to extend the power of Outlook across platforms while also delivering innovative technologies like Office Graph that powers functionality such as Office Delve and Outlook Clutter that utilize machine learning and the cloud.”
