The ruling reinstates one of the most severe legal restrictions faced by the company anywhere in the world.The decision, by Judge Joachim Nickel, overturns a ruling from September that allowed UberPop to operate. The injunction against the service was sought last year by a taxi drivers’ trade group.Uber operates two other services in Germany and elsewhere in Europe — UberBlack and UberTaxi — that use only professionally licensed drivers. Those services are not affected by Wednesday’s ruling, which also ordered that Uber be fined 250,000 euros, or about $270,000, for each violation.Uber’s services allow drivers to connect with potential passengers using a smartphone app, offering passengers rides for prices well below those of Germany’s highly regulated taxis. But the company, based in San Francisco, has faced legal challenges across the world, especially in Europe, since it was founded in 2009.In France, prosecutors ordered raids this week on Uber’s offices in Paris as part of an investigation into the legality of its services in that country after the French government passed legislation requiring all drivers who carry paying passengers to have a license and appropriate insurance.The Frankfurt district court found UberPop to be in violation of Germany’s public transportation act, which requires any service carrying passengers for a fee to be operated by licensed drivers. In his ruling, Judge Nickel said that while a ban on the service posed limitations to the right to employment, the court believed that the benefit outweighed this concern.Uber had argued that the service was not subject to the same rules as taxis because the company functions as an exchange service that connects drivers with passengers. The company said it planned to appeal the ruling.“We regret today’s interim ruling about UberPop,” said Fabien Nestmann, the company’s general manager in Germany. “We will now wait to see the court’s reasoning and review it thoroughly.”“The ban pronounced by the court represents a fundamental infringement,” he added, “in particular of our right under European law to establish and provide a service.”The lawsuit that led to the ruling was brought by Taxi Deutschland, a trade group representing Germany’s taxi drivers, which charged that UberPop had violated competition laws. The group welcomed the ruling on Wednesday.“The basis of Uber’s business model is in violation of the law,” Dieter Schlenker, the head of Taxi Deutschland, told the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Uber has been seeking help from regulators to adapt existing German transportation laws to recent technological advances, as well as working to find ways to fit its services within the limits of existing law. It recently began its UberTaxi service, which uses the Uber smartphone app to call a registered taxi in a way similar to a traditional dispatcher.Advertisement
