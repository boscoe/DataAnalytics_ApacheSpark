Video games used to be such a simple business. You bought a console (say, an Xbox), you bought a game at your local big-box retailer ($46 for Halo: Combat Evolved at Wal-Mart), and you went on your merry way — spending hundreds of hours glued to a TV screen, blasting away at the bad guys.How have times changed. Mobile devices have sharply changed the types of games that are made and the way we play them, ushering in so-called free-to-play games and overhauling in a few years an industry built over decades. But changing the games landscape just as much has been the rise of e-sports, as the world of organized competitive video games is called. As we wrote about last year, e-sports now attracts tens of the thousands of people to live events, filling stadiums built for sports like basketball. Top players have huge followings and earn big money. Competitions have taken off on campuses around the country.And let’s not forget, testing for performance-enhancing drugs is coming. But if you still weren’t convinced that e-sports is here, take a look at the news announced on Tuesday. Microsoft is pushing its Halo 5: Guardians  game, the latest in the blockbuster science fiction shooter series, to the loyal fans of e-sports. As Nick Wingfield reports, Halo had been a hit among e-sports players and followers, but it lost its mojo — now, it is trying to get that back.At stake is not just sales of Halo 5 — many of which will be sold in the old-school way, as discs at big-box stores. It is also about pushing the Xbox console itself. And perhaps more than anything, it is about tapping into a brave new world, one in which, when the first Halo arrived 14 years ago, was barely a figment of our imagination.
