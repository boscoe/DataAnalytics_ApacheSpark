Recruiting top talent in Silicon Valley is always tough. But you know there’s a boom under way when the hiring gets even tougher.That’s the situation these days as many Silicon Valley start-ups go on hiring sprees, often poaching from established tech companies to fill their ranks. Several top executives at larger tech companies have been lured to roles at up-and-coming start-ups in recent months, including Uber landing Google’s longtime head of communications in May. The phenomenon is even more widespread among engineers and other workers, such as chefs at tech companies, some of whom are getting picked up by start-ups that can dangle the prospect of fat payouts down the road, as well as sell the image of a nimbler workplace, Mike Isaac found. Just one look at the long list of Uber’s job openings shows how hungry for staff members these start-ups can be. Other tech personnel moves include a new leader at Pivotal Software and many people who would probably rather remain anonymous but whose information, through a hack at dating website Ashley Madison, was recently posted.
