Airbnb laid down the gauntlet on Wednesday to regulators: Don’t try to curtail us.In the wake of a successful defeat on Tuesday of a ballot initiative in San Francisco that would have limited short-term rentals, Airbnb, the online room rental service, held a briefing at its headquarters to proclaim it would now go a step further. The company said it plans to organize voting blocs in other cities where it operates, and those groups could then be mobilized if needed to vote down other rules that might be proposed that would hinder the start-up’s growth, write Conor Dougherty and Mike Isaac.The declaration is something of a turnabout for Airbnb, which has traditionally made nice with local politicians in many of its most popular markets instead of trying to take them on. That is changing now; Airbnb in August hired a well-known political operative, Chris Lehane, to be the head of global policy.Airbnb’s fighting words immediately garnered notice. BuzzFeed said Airbnb “is building an army.” The take-no-prisoners attitude is reminiscent of Uber, the ride-hailing app, which has barreled into many markets worldwide without permission and with the strategy of asking for forgiveness later.In other news, Facebook reported another robust quarter of earnings, Expedia said it would buy HomeAway for $3.9 billion, Dropbox held an event at which it took a dig at rival Box, and Fortune reported that the online retailer Jet.com has raised $500 million led by Fidelity Investments.
