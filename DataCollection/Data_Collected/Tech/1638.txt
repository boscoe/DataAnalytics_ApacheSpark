Q. When I am moving around a document on my PC, I sometimes have a hard time seeing the flashing cursor because it’s so thin. Is there a way to make it bigger?A. Most versions of Windows include controls for making screen elements easier to see, and in Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, you can increase the thickness of the blinking text-insertion cursor with just a few steps.In older versions of Windows, go to the Start Menu to Control Panel and open Ease of Access to get to the various settings (including cursor thickness) grouped under “Make the computer easier to see.”In Windows 10, the latest version, you can get to the Settings area directly from the Start menu; once you open Settings select Ease of Access. On the left side of the Ease of Access window, click Other Options. In the Visual Options area, go to Cursor Thickness and use the slider on the screen to make the text-insertion cursor as chunky as you want.AdvertisementIn addition to beefing up the text-insertion cursor, you can find other settings here to make Windows 10 easier to see and use.You can make the desktop’s text and icons bigger, or turn on the Magnifier program that enlarges a selected area of the screen. Depending on how much additional visual assistance you need, you can also turn on the option for a high-contrast color scheme or even flip on the Narrator program, which reads aloud alert boxes and other text on your screen.AdvertisementMac OS X users have similar assistance technology and controls to adjust cursor size, zoom in on the screen or have text read aloud. To see what is available, open the System Preferences icon from the Mac’s Dock and click the Accessibility icon.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
