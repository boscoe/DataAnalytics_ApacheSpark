Now, however, the material is also getting virtual.As Steve Lohr reports a group of textile and apparel makers, semiconductor companies, universities and the United States Department of Defense will be figuring out ways to create “smart garments” and other connected cloths.Like many things in tech these days, it is not as weird as it might sound. Last year’s New York Fashion Week included dresses with mechanical devices that reacted to their wearers’ emotional states and sports bras with cooling vents that opened if the wearer got hot. Many people already use wearable technology, such as smart watches and activity trackers.Some of the early uses for smart textiles include sensor threads in mattresses that track sleep habits, or battle clothing that can baffle night vision goggles — or camouflage the wearer by merging the color of the cloth with the look of the surroundings.That last part is not as strange as it seems. The government has, for some years, studied the masking techniques of cephalopods, a group that includes octopuses and squid, which are nature’s masters of disguise.Another idea behind the initiative is to help revive the American textile industry, which for decades has seen jobs lost to automation and cheaper overseas manufacturing. The goal, according to the project proposal, is 50,000 jobs over 10 years in a number of industries.It is unlikely that the bulk of those jobs will be anything like traditional textile work. Most tech manufacturing is an exacting affair, often carried out in clean rooms where robots are preferred to humans. Moreover, even in China, where labor is cheap, assembly work is increasingly done by computer-driven machines.Perhaps there is some protectionist comfort in that outcome: The United States will be taking jobs from Chinese robots that American robots can do better.Advertisement
