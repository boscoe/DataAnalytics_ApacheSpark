Facebook’s Oculus is finally offering clarity on how much of a premium a virtual reality experience will cost.After months of teasing the introduction of its Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles, the company said on Wednesday that it had opened orders for the system, which includes a headset and controller devices, with a price of $599. That’s without a computer included — you’ll need a fast one that will probably cost around $1,000. The device begins shipping in March.Oculus also said that in February, it would open orders for a bundle, which includes the Rift headgear system and a computer that is certified to work with Oculus, for $1,500.“People have been dreaming about immersive high-end VR for decades, and we’re thrilled to share Rift with you this March,” the company said in a blog post, announced during International CES, the consumer electronics show now taking place in Las Vegas.While $599 and $1,500 aren’t cheap, Brendan Iribe, the chief executive of Oculus, said in an interview on the CES show floor that he felt there was still a broad market for the Rift at that price. “It’s a premium experience at a premium price, he said. “It’s not that
much more than iPads and basically pretty close to a laptop.”

Oculus is just one of many companies preparing to offer virtual reality devices this year. HTC, the Taiwanese manufacturer, worked with the software distribution company Valve to develop the virtual reality gadget Vive that will be released in April. Similar to Oculus, the Vive requires connecting to a powerful computer, meaning the pricing should be similarly high. The companies have not announced the price yet.And Samsung Electronics teamed with Oculus last year to offer an entry-level virtual reality system, the Gear VR. That device, at $100, requires inserting a Samsung Galaxy smartphone into the headgear because it relies on the smartphone’s screen for video and its computing brains for running apps and games.Many companies are marketing their devices toward gamers, but the companies are hoping virtual reality has a broader reach to everyday consumers. Chet Faliszek, a writer for Valve, said in an interview that he didn’t think the HTC Vive would be limited to gamers, partly because it involved moving around and making hand motions just like people did in everyday life.“They can do all these very natural things,” he said. “That versatility and that ease of using things is what works. It’s easier to enter in than a game.”
