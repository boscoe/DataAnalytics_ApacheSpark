Flickr does have a Stats page that displays a graph of your recently viewed photos, a chart of the overall visitors to your archive, and a list of your most popular pictures. However, you need to upgrade from a free account to a Flickr Pro account to see that Stats page.Free Flickr accounts provide one terabyte of storage for photos and videos that meet certain size requirements, unlimited downloads of your original photos and the ability to play brief uploaded videos. Flickr Pro accounts, which charge an annual fee, add the Stats page and subtract advertisements from your browsing experience. Pro users also get discounts for photo-related products and services.For those trying to keep track of the company’s account offerings over the years, the original Flickr Pro account was a $25 yearly paid plan that was discontinued in 2013, only to be revived as a $50 annual plan (or $6 a month) in 2015. The Auto-Uploadr feature for automatically uploading pictures to your account was once available to every user, but the tool became an exclusive Flickr Pro perk this year.If you do sign up for Flickr Pro, you can get to the Stats page by logging into your account through the web browser. Click the You menu at the top of the page and select Stats.When you are on the Stats page, you can see which photos have been viewed in the last month or so. The page also lists the pictures with the most all-time views and the total numbers of photos and videos you have uploaded to the site. Another chart on the page shows how people find your images — through social media, web searches or by browsing Flickr itself.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
