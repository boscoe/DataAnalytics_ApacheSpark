Apple has reached a deal with Italian tax authorities over a dispute about how much tax the American technology company should have paid in the European country.A spokesman for Italy’s tax authority declined to comment on the amount of owed taxes, though local news reports suggested that the figure could reach as much as $350 million.The investigation, which dates to 2013, examined whether Apple had moved roughly $1.1 billion in revenue from its Italian operations through an Irish subsidiary to lower the taxes that the company was obliged to pay in Italy.The country’s investigation into Apple’s activities is the first time that an individual European country has focused on the company’s complicated corporate tax structure, though policy makers in countries like France have previously looked at other tech companies’ tax arrangements, including those of Google.AdvertisementThe move by Italian authorities comes as officials look to strengthen tax revenue from both local and multinational companies to offset the country’s lagging economy.A representative for Apple was not immediately available for comment.Apple’s issues in Italy are the latest problem that the company has faced in Europe. The authorities are also investigating whether it had received an overly generous tax deal in Ireland, where the company has large operations.That separate investigation by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is expected to make its judgment in early 2016. The Irish government is likely to appeal any decision that would force the country to recover any owed taxes from Apple in order to protect a low tax regime that has enticed many international companies to set up operations in the country.Apple’s agreement in Italy is not expected to alter the company’s tax arrangements in the European Union. Apple executives have repeatedly stated that they pay the required amount of tax in the countries where they operate.Europe’s increased focus on Apple, though, forms part of a growing crackdown by European officials on the tax dealings of many American international companies operating in the 28-member bloc.AdvertisementIn October, for instance, Europe’s antitrust authorities ordered the Dutch government to recover money from Starbucks after accusations that the Netherlands gave the coffee retailer illegal state aid by letting it shift profits and pay lower tax rates than those available to other companies.

The companies have denied any wrongdoing.Apple, which has denied accusations that it does not pay enough tax in certain countries where it generates significant revenue, is just one of a number of American companies that have used Ireland as a base for its international headquarters.Ireland’s corporate tax rate, at 12.5 percent, is one of the lowest in the Western world, compared with 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States, though Irish officials deny that the low-tax structure represents unfair competition.A version of this article appears in print on December 31, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Apple Settles a Tax Dispute With Italy.
