Q. Is there a way to turn off those onscreen text boxes that cover up part of the video while it’s playing on YouTube?A. While the pop-up notes that appear while a video is playing are often meant to provide more information — or to sell copies of a song in the Google Play or iTunes Store — you should be able to turn them off in your YouTube account settings. Start by going to https://www.youtube.com/account playback in your web browser.On the Playback settings screen, turn off the checkbox next to “Show annotations and in-video notifications” and then click the Save button at the bottom of the screen. Commercials that play before the clip starts or advertisements that appear along the bottom of the screen as the video streams are not affected and will still be there. (If you wish to watch clips on the site without ads, the company’s YouTube Red service offers ad-free videos and several other perks for about $10 a month — after a free one-month trial period to test it out.)The YouTube Playback screen has a few other settings you can change. For instance, you can also turn off (or on) any closed captioning included with videos. If your Internet connection runs on the slow side and you would prefer that the site automatically show lower-quality videos that load faster, choose the option, “I have a slow connection. Never play higher-quality video.”Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
