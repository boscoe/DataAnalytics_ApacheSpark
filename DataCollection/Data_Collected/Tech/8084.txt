Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications company, said on Monday that it had sold its Here digital mapping unit to a consortium of German automakers for 2.8 billion euros, or about $3 billion.The announcement signals the latest chapter in Nokia’s transformation, as the company tries to rebound from the demise of its once world-leading mobile phone unit, which was sold to Microsoft last year for about $7.6 billion.As part of the changes, the Finnish company has pared its operations to focus almost entirely on its telecom network infrastructure business, which provides communications equipment to some of the world’s largest carriers, like AT&T and China Mobile.Nokia had announced this year that it was willing to sell the Here mapping unit, the largest global competitor to Google Maps.AdvertisementUnder the terms of the deal, a consortium of German automakers, including Audi, BMW Group and Daimler, will acquire Here. Digital mapping is part of an array of digital technologies on which carmakers are making big investments.AdvertisementTechnology companies like Google and Apple already have onboard entertainment services and digital mapping offerings, through smartphones, that compete with services by carmakers. And a number of those American giants are also now working on driverless car projects to take on players like the German automakers.The members of the German consortium said that they would use Nokia’s digital mapping unit for their own autonomous driving plans, but that they would be willing to license the technology to other companies.“Our environment is constantly changing,” Rupert Stadler, Audi’s chairman, said in a statement. “That’s why the information in digital maps has to be continually updated so that maximum utility can be offered.”Nokia’s share price was off by 0.5 percent in afternoon trading in Helsinki, Finland. The stock prices of BMW Group, Daimler and Volkswagen, the parent company of Audi, were stable in Frankfurt on Monday.The three automakers have taken an equal share in Nokia’s mapping unit, and the transaction is expected to close by the first half of next year. The companies added that they would continue to run Here as a separate business.The sale of Nokia’s mapping unit comes as the Finnish company is close to completing its $16.6 billion acquisition of the French-American telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia has received regulatory approval from United States and European antitrust authorities for that deal, but it is still waiting for the go-ahead from Chinese officials.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The efforts have come as many of the world’s largest mobile phone carriers have cut spending on new cellphone and broadband infrastructure.Nokia’s focus on its telecom business, which now generates more than 90 percent of its yearly revenue, stands in marked contrast with the company’s once-dominating position in the smartphone world. The company, which has roots that date to wood-pulp manufacturing in the 19th century, was slow to respond to threats like Apple’s iPhone and eventually sold its handset unit to Microsoft after multiple attempts to regain its foothold.AdvertisementBut that deal has turned out to be a bad one for Microsoft, which has largely failed to generate interest in Windows phones. Microsoft announced last month that it would write down nearly all of its Nokia handset acquisition.For Nokia’s part, analysts said that the Here mapping business did not fit with the company’s increased focus on its extensive telecom operations. Here reported revenue of €290 million, or about one-tenth of the revenue from Nokia’s telecom operations, in the second quarter of 2015.Still, Here’s revenue represented a 25 percent increase from the comparable period a year earlier. Global automakers now represent more than half of its business.By agreeing to a sale price of roughly $3 billion, the Finnish company is essentially writing off years of research and development, and a series of multibillion acquisitions that had turned Here into a global mapping champion. Those deals include the $8.1 billion purchase in 2007 of Navteq, the maker of digital mapping and navigational software based in Chicago, as Nokia tried to keep pace with other handset makers and mobile operating systems.As digital maps are becoming a crucial focal point of many emerging industries, a number of bidders had expressed interest in Here, including the ride-booking service Uber, which submitted a $3 billion bid for the business before dropping out last month.Other tech giants, including Amazon, the Chinese search engine Baidu and Facebook, also rely on Nokia’s geospatial data for their mapping services. These companies had turned to Here to reduce their reliance on Google — a company that they increasingly compete with for users, engineers and advertising revenue.It will now be up to the German automakers to convince these tech companies that they can continue to offer the same level of digital mapping services that had made Nokia’s unit the main global rival to Google Maps.A version of this article appears in print on August 4, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: German Automakers Team Up to Buy Nokia’s Digital Mapping Division for $3 Billion.
