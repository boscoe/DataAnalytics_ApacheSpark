Tumblr has long promoted itself as a hub for artists and creative entrepreneurs. Now, Tumblr wants to put those people to work.To that end, the company unveiled a new initiative, in which it plans to hand-pick some of its most popular artists and creative users and pair them up with brands who want to advertise across the popular blogging platform.The program, Creatrs by Tumblr, plays on a simple thesis: For social networks, the most popular type of content bubbles up from the members who are most dedicated to using the site. Some popular Tumblr artists have used their huge online followings to sign book deals, sell their artwork or become celebrities inside their Tumblr world.Tumblr wants to capitalize on that talent as well. In the program, the company will pair up artists with brands who purchase Tumblr’s advertising products — like so-called “sponsored posts,” which appear in users’ Tumblr streams. Tumblr believes that can help a brand like, say, Subway, create a more authentic ad for Tumblr that won’t turn off users.“We think we have the largest creative class on the entire Internet,” David Hayes, Tumblr’s head of creative strategy, said at an event at the company’s New York headquarters on Thursday. “With Creatrs, we can drive traffic from our community both to the artist and the brand at the same time.”The move is in line with a greater movement by social companies that want to court advertisers who may not be well-versed in creating advertisements that work well with a specific platform. Companies like Facebook and, more recently, Pinterest, have in-house teams dedicated to helping brands create ads that are not jarring for users to see.But instead of using a traditional external advertising agency to create the promotion, as many big brands do, Tumblr believes its own users have a much better grasp of what its audience of more than 420 million monthly viewers want to see.Tumblr says the program will also benefit artists as well. Selected artists will be paid for their work while being exposed to millions more people across Tumblr and, potentially, the wider audience that visits Yahoo, which acquired Tumblr in 2013.More than 300 artists have been tapped for the initial introduction of the program, though the company expects to recruit more talent if the Creatrs initiative gains momentum.A version of this article appears in print on 01/26/2015, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Ad Idea From Tumblr.
