The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday accused LifeLock, an identity theft protection service, of making deceptive claims in its advertising, in violation of an agreement the company made with the agency in 2010.In a suit, the F.T.C. said that from 2012 to 2014 LifeLock failed to alert customers as soon as their identities were used by thieves and also failed to protect data with the same high-level safeguards used by financial institution, both claims the company has made to its customers. The suit was filed in the United States District Court in Arizona, where the company is based.LifeLock, which was founded in 2005, promises to detect and block criminals attempting to steal or misuse others’ identities, offering plans ranging in price from $10 to $30 per month.In 2010, the company agreed to pay $12 million to federal and state officials to settle charges that it made false claims in its advertising. As part of the settlement, LifeLock agreed to discontinue the advertising and to better protect consumer data.In the court filings submitted on Tuesday, the F.T.C. said the company did not live up to its end of the agreement, including failing to establish a comprehensive program for protecting consumer data.LifeLock said it would fight the F.T.C.’s new accusations.“After more than 18 months of cooperation and dialogue with the F.T.C., it became clear to us that we could not come to a satisfactory resolution of their issues outside a court of law,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. “We disagree with the substance of the F.T.C.’s contentions and are prepared to take our case to court.”In February, LifeLock tried to settle the matter out of court, offering to pay the agency $20,000. The F.T.C. turned it down.Customers have brought lawsuits as well. The company faces three class-action lawsuits in California alone, which argue that LifeLock has not been entirely forthcoming with its ads and cancellation policy.LifeLock’s advertising has backfired on the company in other ways as well. One of the company’s more famous marketing moves involved displaying the Social Security number of Todd Davis, LifeLock’s chief executive, in television and online ads to demonstrate the strength of LifeLock protection.The result: Mr. Davis had his identity stolen at least 13 times.A version of this article appears in print on 07/22/2015, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Lifelock Is Violating Agreement, F.T.C.
