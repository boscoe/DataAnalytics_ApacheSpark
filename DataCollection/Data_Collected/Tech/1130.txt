Video — not to mention online music streaming — was supposed to kill the radio star. Instead, some longtime radio stations have found a way to transform and use all the new Internet outlets to thrive, Nick Wingfield writes. One case in point is KEXP, a public radio station based in Seattle. Founded in 1972, the station is known as one of the first to play music from Nirvana, as well as Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. Now, even in an era when Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora enable listeners to get almost any type of music with a few taps on their smartphone or computer, KEXP is going strong by serving as a human tour guide through all that’s available, writes Mr. Wingfield.The Internet has helped the station reach larger audiences worldwide by increasing its distribution. KEXP has stoked this by adding video programming (though a YouTube channel, naturally) and by working to be an in-person destination for fans.“We barely call ourselves a radio station” anymore, said John Richards, the morning D.J. at KEXP. It’s a tale where the digital shift isn’t destroying old media, but opening new opportunities instead.
