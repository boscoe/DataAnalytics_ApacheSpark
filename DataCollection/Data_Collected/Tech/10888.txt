Happy New Year, everyone. If you want a peek at the year ahead in tech, look no further than the giant International CES this week. The huge annual trade show, running Wednesday through Saturday in Las Vegas, will have its usual mind-numbing number of new gadgets. But some types of technologies will get the brightest spotlights, including virtual reality and 4K high-definition TVs. Some of the industryâ€™s biggest companies are placing bets that those two areas are ripe this year. Who know yet whether consumers will follow their lead.Tech policy is also going to be top of mind at the conference. Michael Huerta, a top safety official at the Federal Aviation Administration, is expected to talk about drones at a news conference. And the leaders of the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission are expected to appear on stage. It will be worth noting what is on the minds of all three of these officials.
