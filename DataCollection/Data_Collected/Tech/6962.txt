The search for Twitter’s next chief executive has formally begun.The social media company’s board of directors announced Monday that it had hired Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm, to help identify and recruit candidates to succeed Dick Costolo, who is stepping down as Twitter’s boss on July 1.The eight-member board, which includes all three people who have been chief executives of the company, noted that it would consider internal and external candidates.The board also confirmed that it would only consider people who are willing to take on the job full-time. That would seem to rule out Jack Dorsey, the interim chief executive, unless he were willing to give up his full-time job running Square, a payments start-up. Mr. Dorsey has said publicly and privately that he intends to remain at Square.Peter Currie, the company’s lead independent director and chairman of the search committee, said in a statement that the board was “confident in Twitter’s product road map and excited by the current pipeline. We also believe much more can be done to realize Twitter’s enormous unmet long-term potential. In our next C.E.O., we are looking for a bold thinker and proven leader capable of helping Twitter fully capitalize on its unique platform for the benefit of users, advertisers and employees, and to maximize value for investors in the years ahead.”James M. Citrin, head of Spencer Stuart’s North American chief executive practice, will lead the firm’s efforts on behalf of Twitter. Mr. Citrin has handled many prominent chief executive searches, including the ones that led to the hiring of Marissa Mayer at Yahoo, Léo Apotheker at Hewlett-Packard, and the promotion of Brian Krzanich to the top job at Intel.
