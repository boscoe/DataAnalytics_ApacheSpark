It is a common criticism of tech companies these days: They say they want to change the world, but what they really want to change is how much money they have in the bank. Or the horsepower of the car in the driveway. Or maybe the exotic locale of the third vacation home.And then there is Kickstarter, the well-known organization that helps good ideas and maybe a few pipe dreams get off the ground through crowdfunding. The co-founders of Kickstarter announced on Sunday that they are reincorporating as a “public benefit corporation.” Public benefit corporations are a relatively new concept. Under the designation, a company must attempt to do something that benefits the public and must include that in their charter.The change builds upon a move last year to designate Kickstarter a B Corporation, which means a company must meet rigorous environmental and social-responsibility standards. In other words, Kickstarter is trying to practice the noblesse oblige it preaches.Kickstarter’s co-founders, Yancey Strickler and Perry Chen, say they are making these moves to ensure their creation isn’t corrupted by the money washing over the rest of the tech industry.“We don’t ever want to sell or go public,” said Mr. Strickler, Kickstarter’s chief executive. “That would push the company to make choices that we don’t think are in the best interest of the company.”What a novel concept.
