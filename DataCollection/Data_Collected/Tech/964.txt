I recently presented at the 2015 Cassandra Summit on the Internet of Things (IoT) and our work at The New York Times, drawing on over fifty years of experience in computing.The IoT contains Things of Interest (ToI) to our users and to The New York Times. While the intersection contains objects we are familiar with now (such as mobile devices, watches and laptops), by 2020 the mutual ToI will vastly expand. How should we respond?One way, which I discuss in my presentation, is to generalize and expand our global services at a reasonable cost. This will allow our very creative marketers and developers to deploy great apps quickly and solidify each userâ€™s experience across their ToI.
