Facebook is not the only big tech company looking at ways to connect to the many people in the world who do not have access to the Internet. Google, for example, has discussed using drones, high-flying balloons and even low-cost satellites to beam Internet signals to remote parts of the world.But perhaps no other company has managed to stir up as much controversy as Facebook. This week, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive and co-founder, will visit New Delhi and is expected to discuss the Internet.org project. When it was announced two years ago, Internet.org was described as a long-term effort to experiment with different means of connecting people to the Internet, starting with pilot projects in India. But Internet.org quickly faced criticism: Did Facebook’s project simply represent enlightened self-interest or a more cynical attempt to make sure that the next generation of people who come online are introduced to Facebook before anything else?Since then, Facebook has retooled its free and low-cost offerings in India partly in response to that criticism. It has also embarked on an ambitious effort to bring high-speed Wi-Fi to remote villages in the Himalayas. It is difficult to say if that will be enough to ignite interest in Internet.org. But give Mr. Zuckerberg credit for tenacity.
