LONDON — How much computer can you buy for just $35?For fans of Raspberry Pi, a British-made computer aimed at children, hobbyists and tinkerers, the answer is quite a lot.On Monday, the British charity behind the minicomputer announced a new version that was significantly more powerful that the previous device, which had sold more than four million units since being introduced in 2012.The machine, the Raspberry Pi 2, now has a 900 MHz quad-core central processing unit, or C.P.U., compared with a 700 MHz single-core C.P.U. in the older version and features one gigabyte of RAM memory, or double what was previously included.“The Raspberry Pi has been more successful than our wildest dreams,” Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi’s founder, said at a press conference in London on Monday. “The thing that we’ve been trying to do with Raspberry Pi is to get more children into computing.”Despite the much-improved performance, the device — about 3 inches by 2 inches and less than an inch high — will still retail for the same price as the older version.The Raspberry Pi also will continue to run on Linux-based operating systems, though Mr. Upton said that his team had been working with Microsoft so that the computer supported the Windows 10, Microsoft’s latest operating system.“We are excited about our partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation,” Microsoft said in a statement on Monday. “This release of Windows 10 will be free for the maker community through the Windows developer program.”Yet people who are thinking of replacing their laptop or desktop with one of these ultracheap machines may want to hold off.That’s because Raspberry Pi is a just a bare circuit board and requires the addition of a monitor, keyboard and other basic computing parts before it can come to life. And even the new Windows 10 will be a pared-back version of the software aimed at only the most technically savvy computer users.Yet that bare-bones approach to computing has captured the imagination of millions of hobbyists and teachers around the world, which have used the device for such tasks as teaching children how to code and creating a smartphone based on the Raspberry Pi machine. And in a sign of the computer’s growing appeal, Google even donated $1 million last year to buy 15,000 of them for British children.“The real surprise for us is the level of interest from hobbyists and the level of industry interest,” Mr. Upton said on Monday. “We’re seeing people now using Raspberry Pi as a regular computer.”
