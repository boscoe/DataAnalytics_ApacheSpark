HONG KONG — The light at the end of the tunnel may finally be coming into focus for Sony.The beleaguered Japanese electronics maker said on Wednesday that it would aim to achieve 500 billion yen, or about $4.2 billion, in annual operating profit by the fiscal year that ends in March 2018, a huge jump from the ¥20 billion that it has forecast for the current year.The optimism comes from the company’s expectation that it will emerge from years of restructuring with a business focused on higher-margin products.At the urging of analysts and investors, Sony over the past two years has been easing away from its reliance on computers, televisions and mobile phones in favor of more profitable but smaller-scale products like camera sensors for smartphones, the PlayStation console and video games, and its film studio.During a conference call with analysts to discuss the company’s midrange corporate strategy, Kazuo Hirai, Sony’s chief executive, said the company would continue with a restructuring that emphasized profitability over volume.Last year, Sony sold its computer division and spun off its television group into a separate unit. Mr. Hirai said on Wednesday that the company would not rule out an outright sale of its television and mobile communications units, but that a revamping of the mobile unit would continue.“We now have a clear aim in sight for completing a large-scale restructuring effort,” Mr. Hirai said.As the next part of that effort, Sony is targeting October 2015 for the spinoff of its video and sound business as a wholly owned subsidiary.“We must grant each business unit greater autonomy,” he said, with each group granted more flexibility to respond to industry changes.Mr. Hirai said the segments that he expected to drive profitability were devices, which includes image sensors; game and network services; music; and the film studio. (He also repeated that the recent cyberattack on the studio would have no material impact.)The television and mobile businesses remained volatile, he said, and the company will seek to manage their risks. Sony’s smartphone unit was its most profitable in 2013 but has since been hit hard by competition at both the high and low end in major markets like China.Mr. Hirai also said that return on equity would be the company’s benchmark performance indicator, and he set a target of 10 percent for the fiscal year ending in March 2018.
