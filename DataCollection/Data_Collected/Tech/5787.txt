Zenefits, a fast-growing software-as-a-service start-up in Silicon Valley, announced on Tuesday that it had raised $500 million, valuing the company at $4 billion.The round is a remarkable sum for the young company, which offers a human relations management service to small- and medium-sized businesses. Zenefits started just two years ago, and has garnered about $65 million in private funding to date.Zenefits has the faith of venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, which participated in this latest round, as well as larger late-stage investors like Fidelity Management and TPG.The round is another reminder of the hot fund-raising climate in Silicon Valley, with start-ups daily raising hundreds of millions of dollars at ballooning valuations. Zenefits itself raised money in both January and June last year, a relatively time-compressed period for multiple financings.Zenefits said it had more than 10,000 small- and medium-sized businesses using its service. In order to grow as fast as it wants, the company said it must spend aggressively on sales and customer support staff to bring even more new clients on board.“A lot of companies are going after the Fortune 1000,” said Parker Conrad, chief executive of Zenefits. “We’re going after the small-and-medium business 5 million. That’s a lot of conversations we need to have.”The service is free for businesses to use, with Zenefits receiving a significant payment from insurance companies if a small business signs up for insurance using the start-up’s system.
