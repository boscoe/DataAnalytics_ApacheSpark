It’s set to be another busy week in technology news. In Silicon Valley, two of the best-known social media companies — Twitter and Facebook — will be reporting their quarterly earnings in the next few days. In Europe, Nokia will be posting its financial results, with plenty of scrutiny over who might emerge as the victorious bidder for the company’s mapping business. Before we even get to those events, there are plenty of Times tech stories to read, including Quentin Hardy’s examination of how algorithms determine if you will pay back a loan or stay in a job, and Dino Grandoni’s look at the surge of podcasts, and the business models to support them. Enjoy.
