A San Francisco jury cleared the firm, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers, in March of claims it short-circuited Ms. Pao’s career because she was a woman, in a case that helped begin a wide discussion about gender and the technology industry. Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Ms. Pao, said she declined to comment. Should Ms. Pao decide to pursue an appeal, her case would be heard by California’s First District Court of Appeal. She could face a difficult path. According to Westlaw data, out of 49 decisions involving discrimination and retaliation over the past two years, the First District affirmed 26 of 31 cases where the employer won in the trial court, or 84 percent. Only five cases were reversed. The court, which covers San Francisco and 11 other Northern California counties, handed victory to employers in more than half of the cases they lost in the lower courts, reversing 10 of 18 cases.
