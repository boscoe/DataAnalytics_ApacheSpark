Has Amazon Prime Day been everything it was advertised to be?The reaction online at the halfway mark has been less than effusive, with the Twitter hashtag #PrimeDayFail gaining traction Wednesday alongside complaints of lackluster merchandise, paltry discounts and all-around disappointment.An Amazon spokeswoman, Julie Law, who has spent much of Wednesday defending Prime Day, said in the early afternoon that she had lost her voice. (She later clarified that she had a cold.)In an email, Ms. Law said that Prime Day peak order rates had already surpassed 2014 Black Friday levels on the website and that new deals were still starting every 10 minutes.“Some of our most highly anticipated deals are still coming, so stay tuned!” she said.To observe its 20th anniversary, Amazon promised “more deals than Black Friday” for members of its Prime service, who pay $99 for a year of free shipping on purchases from the site.AdvertisementAmazon’s audacity prompted its archrival Walmart to compete with an event the same day, offering “thousands of great deals” and free shipping on orders of $35 or more at Walmart.com.AdvertisementThe day seemed to start with excitement.
            I am clearly going to be suckered in to buy something from Amazon and or Walmart tomorrow. I just can't pass up a really good bargain:)        
            Trying to get some early Christmas shopping done with this Amazon sale         But shoppers were quickly grumbling about a less-than-stellar lineup.
#PrimeDay is pretty dumb, unless you want to save on suntan lotion, aspirin, gummy vitamins and outdated tech.        
            The best deal I've seen so far is 15% off a box of pop tarts. #AmazonPrimeDay 
            I think #amazonprimeday might be the worst sale I have ever seen, and I have been to regional Scottish car boot sales pic.twitter.com/jxybl0ejvm Others were underwhelmed by the discounts.
            Damn been waiting for the PS4 to go down 10 cents #AmazonPrimeDay pic.twitter.com/eIiThMX9IT 
            Like...I had a cart full of things I wanted to buy on #PrimeDay. This is one of my "savings." Two. Cents. pic.twitter.com/nhUMDO2zdS Clunky navigation on Amazon was an issue.
#PrimeDay is a bust -no way to search for discounted items- site a complete mess. I might even have to go to a store. @amazon #PrimedayFail 
            AMZN's #PrimeDay proves once again how utterly terrible their site navigation is.        When the deals were good, shoppers reported being put on endless wait lists.
            First reaction to #PrimeDay? If I wanted to be on a waitlist, I'd apply to college again. Walmart site seems easier to navigate than Amazon.        
            Also... tried buying a #SelfieStick. I'm #293 on the waitlist. Not sure if this is a lowpoint in my life or not. #PrimeDay Some shoppers even said their Prime Day experience drove them to other shopping sites, including Walmart.
            Welp... just bought a new TV unnecessarily. Thanks #AmazonPrimeDay for leading me to @Groupon to look for better deals.        
#PrimeDay has been a total let down. I'm heading on over to http://t.co/G4KGtHqcBQ 
            Amazon Prime Day is meh, so far.
But go to Walmart for their "competing sale" and you can see GTAV for the 360, for the low price of $63!        Some shoppers did appear to find deals, though perhaps not the ones they had hoped.
            I just bought 42 pieces of Rubbermaid Tupperware for $15! I love #PrimeDay #PrimeLiving pic.twitter.com/XVSNA8Kt8T 
            Ahhhh someone please shut off my Internet I'm hooked to Christmas in July! Just bought Noah a swim diaper :-) #PrimeDay #ChristmasInJuly 
            I bought a wifi dongle. This is what you reduced me to, #PrimeDay. I went in expecting diamonds and I got dongles. #PrimeDayFail Mostly, there was sheer disappointment.
            looks like #PrimeDay got a little too much hype #PrimeDayFail 
            We were rooting for you, #AmazonPrimeDay, WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SALE LIKE THIS!        
#AmazonPrimeDay = the next April Fools day.        Amazon’s Ms. Law said that Prime members had already bought “tens of thousands of Fire TV Sticks, 35,000 ‘Lord of the Rings’ Blu-Ray sets, 28,000 Rubbermaid sets and 4,000 Echos in 15 minutes.”“A Kate Spade purse was gone in less than a minute,” she said.Ms. Law also said the much-deplored, confusing “Join wait list” button simply meant that all available discounts had been placed in customers’ carts. But if those customers didn’t complete their purchases within 15 minutes, that discount was passed on to the next customer in line.The wait list, she said, often allowed Amazon to secure more inventory. After long wait lists for Bose headphones on Wednesday morning, Amazon added more units to the sale, she said.A search for similar complaints on Walmart’s sale yielded few results, offering a rare respite for the discount giant, itself a frequent target of Internet derision.AdvertisementStill, at least by web offerings, Amazon dwarfs Walmart. Walmart sells about seven million products online. Amazon sells an estimated 300 million products.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
