Pluralsight, an online service that provides advanced training courses for technology professionals, is on a shopping spree.Last year, after raising $135 million from investors, the company acquired Smarterer, a skills assessment and scoring system, for $75 million.Today, executives at Pluralsight announced that the company was spending $36 million to acquire Code School, a platform that offers online technology courses for first-time coders seeking to become professional software developers.“It gives us a phenomenal learn-to-code on-ramp,” Aaron Skonnard, the chief executive of Pluralsight, said in a phone interview. “People can go to Code School when they want to learn a new technology for the first time, and then they will graduate into Pluralsight’s professional training platform.”Based in Farmington, Utah, Pluralsight charges subscription fees, starting at $29 a month, for individual users seeking to stay current with technology skills, like programming languages, animation and graphic design. Enterprise clients that wish to offer unlimited access to Pluralsight courses for their employees pay annual fees.Now Code School, which providers interactive entry-level classes involving video instruction and coding challenges, extends Pluralsight’s customer base to beginners.Mr. Skonnard said his company was scouting for additional acquisitions.“There will be probably be more expansion, as we identify new areas of content that will be valuable to our customers,” he said.Mr. Skonnard declined to comment on the company’s valuation in its most recent round of financing last year. Industry analysts have valued Pluralsight at nearly $1 billion.
