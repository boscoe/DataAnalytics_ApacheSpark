Q. Is there a way to make the Microsoft Edge browser in Windows 10 open multiple preset tabs when the program is started?A. Edge, Microsoft’s latest browser, can open multiple webpage tabs when you start the program — after you dig down into its settings to specify the sites you would like to see first. To make this happen, open Microsoft Edge and go to the More Actions menu, which appears as three dots in the browser’s upper-right corner. Choose “Settings” from the menu that appears when you click on the dots.On the Settings menu, look for the “Open With” options and select “A specific page or pages.” In the drop-down menu below it, choose “Custom,” and below that, enter the URL of a webpage you want to see when you fire up the Edge browser. Click the “+” button to add that page and go on to the next address you want to add. Repeat the process until you have entered all the pages you want to see when the browser opens. The next time you start Microsoft Edge, each of those sites should automatically appear in its own tab.Have a breaking-news site or other page you check frequently throughout the day? The Microsoft Edge browser can also pin regularly visited sites to the Windows 10 Start menu. To pin a page, go to it via a bookmark or its web address so the site is open in the Edge browser. Go to the More Actions menu in the top-right corner and choose “Pin this page to Start” from that menu. The newly pinned page appears as a clickable shortcut tile on the Start menu.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
