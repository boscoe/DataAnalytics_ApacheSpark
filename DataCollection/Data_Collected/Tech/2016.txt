Some days, even Google gets frustrated by the D.M.V.Google may be one of the most valuable and innovative companies in the world, but it can’t seem to get California regulators to share its vision for self-driving cars. On Wednesday, the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles released proposed requirements for autonomous vehicles. Of most significance is what the state believes the cars — driven as they are by computers — still can’t do without: Humans.The state wants to make sure that a licensed (and presumably sober) driver can take over the vehicle in an emergency. In other words, don’t count on your self-driving car getting you home if you’ve had one too many at the bar after work. What’s more, the prototype self-driving cars Google has been working on don’t have steering wheels or brakes. The company says that in tests it has found that once passengers get accustomed to the car doing the driving for them, they stop paying attention to the road. In fact, in an emergency a human is more likely to cause an accident than help avoid one, Google says.The good news? Even the rosiest of forecasts say it will be years before regular people are riding around in self-driving cars, prepared — if the state has its way — to put down the coffee or stop reading the email or instantly sober up before these notably cautious robotic cars get into trouble. And California’s D.M.V. rules for self-driving are only proposals, so there is still time for Google and other companies, like Uber, to persuade regulators to let the car do the driving.
