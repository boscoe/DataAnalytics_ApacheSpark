For years, Uber has used rallies, ad campaigns and word of mouth to recruit tens of thousands of drivers to work for the company. Now it is trying a different tack: Make it fun. On Thursday, the company will release UberDrive, a smartphone-based video game that loosely mimics being an Uber driver. The app is fairly simple; players are asked to cart passengers from one destination to the next on a real map of San Francisco, while earning in-game cash and unlocking additional features. If successful, the app could lure people who had not previously thought of driving for Uber. Users can sign up to become drivers and upload their applications and screening materials directly from inside the game. But the app is more than a recruitment tool. It could also serve as a way to educate Uber’s existing driver base, many of whom have never been professional drivers. The game exists entirely on a city map, powered by Google Maps, and includes tips about landmarks and points of interest throughout the Bay Area city. The game was developed by Mike Truong, a senior product manager at Uber who has worked at video game studios like Loud Crow Interactive and Electronic Arts. His background was in creating education apps for small children. San Francisco is, for now, the only city playable inside the game. Mr. Truong’s background in educational games has informed the design and feel of the game, with goals and incentives to keep people playing and learning as they go. If the game is a success, Uber will continue to add city-specific content for other major metropolitan areas.If it’s a flop, it’s no big deal for Uber; the game was developed as a side project by Mr. Truong and his team, who primarily work on rider and driver projects related to the so-called core experience of using the Uber platform. The game will be available for download at Apple’s App Store beginning Thursday.
