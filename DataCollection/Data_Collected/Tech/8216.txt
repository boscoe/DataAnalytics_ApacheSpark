Rite Aid, the nationwide pharmacy and retail chain, announced on Tuesday it would accept smartphone payments from Apple and Google, two of the largest players in mobile wallet technology, beginning this weekend.That will include Apple Pay, Google Wallet and the coming Android Pay at all of Rite Aid’s 4,600 retail stores in 32 states and the District of Columbia, the company said.Rite Aid is just the latest national retailer to accept these forms of payment, which require little more than the wave of a smartphone to pay for items with a credit card at the register. Retailers like McDonalds and Whole Foods have accepted Apple Pay since the product first started last year. More stores, including Sephora and Best Buy, also participate.But Rite Aid’s inclusion is a stark change from just nine months ago, when the pharmacy chain shut off the ability for its credit card terminals to accept Apple Pay and Google Wallet. That was because of contractual agreements with Merchant Customer Exchange, a coalition of retailers that plans to offer a competing mobile payments product, according to two people briefed on the company’s plans.Some of these agreements expired this year, according to these people, who requested anonymity because the terms of the agreement are not public. That freed retailers to accept competing forms of mobile payments, like Apple Pay and Android Pay.The Merchant Customer Exchange plans to release its CurrentC mobile payments app this year, though the company has not announced a wide roll-out date.Rite Aid declined to comment on the terms of its business agreements, but Ashley Flower, a spokeswoman, said the company was still a part of the Merchant Customer Exchange and planned to accept CurrentC when it’s widely released.The exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A version of this article appears in print on 08/17/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Rite Aid Alters Payment Policy.
