Let’s recap a busy day at the International CES, shall we?— Netflix is going worldwide.— Oculus Rift, Facebook’s virtual reality device, is going to cost $599.— Over 180,000 drone users have registered with the Federal Aviation Administration.— General Motors’ new electric car, the Chevy Bolt, has a range of 200 miles on a charge and will cost about $30,000 after tax credits.The common thread here? Not a smartphone or smartphone app in the bunch. Although mobile technology has dominated the technology industry for several years running, the announcements are yet another reminder to look elsewhere for some of the most interesting new technologies coming our way.
