The tech news cycle typically ramps up another notch after Labor Day, which was clear yesterday with many happenings from across the tech world.Many of them had to do with China. Paul Mozur and Jane Perlez reported on Tuesday that during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to the United States later this month, the Chinese Internet czar Lu Wei, who oversees China’s restrictions on overseas Internet companies, plans to hold a tech forum in Seattle. Many top executives from American tech companies, including Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, have been invited. The meeting comes as tensions rise between the United States and China over tech, and the forum — which deviates from Mr. Xi’s carefully choreographed visit — plays into the brinkmanship between the countries, Mr. Mozur and Ms. Perlez wrote. Yahoo disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that it was reconsidering its plan to spin off its $23 billion stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, after federal tax authorities declined to rule in advance on whether the transaction would mean huge capital gains taxes for Yahoo or its shareholders. And Uber, the ride-hailing company, said on Tuesday that it had raised an additional $1.2 billion to enter more than 100 cities in China over the next year.In some non-China tech news, Dell announced it would begin selling the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 tablet to large corporate customers — an unusual development since Dell typically sells only its own hardware. And in a move with cultural significance, Intel said it planned to end its support for the prestigious Science Talent Search, one of the best-known science and mathematics competitions for American high school students. That brings us to today, when Apple will hold an event to introduce new products. Follow a live blog with the reporters Katie Benner, Brian X. Chen and Farhad Manjoo here.
