Researchers say they have created artificial intelligence that in some cases can do a better job of learning and identifying characters than humans.While we’re still a long way from the Terminator or the female automaton Ava in “Ex Machina,” the development is a significant leap in A.I. technology. So-called computer-vision technology is already used in a wide array of products, from cars to video-game controls.On Thursday, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and the University of Toronto reported a new type of “one shot” machine learning in the journal Science. The computer-vision program outperformed humans in identifying handwritten characters based on a single example. This program, the scientists say, is capable of quickly learning the characters of a language, similar to the way humans learn.By exposing these so-called neural networks to a large set of examples, they can be trained to understand speech, detect objects in images or even identify types of behavior.But don’t worry. They are still a long way from being able to identify Sarah Connor.
