The visibility of your Facebook timeline to other Facebook members as well as to the general Internet population depends on how much of yourself you choose to reveal in your account settings. (For quick access to Facebook’s privacy settings and explanations, click the lock icon at the top of any Facebook page to open the Privacy Shortcuts menu.)Fellow Facebook users — who are not on your Friends list — can search within the social network and see basic things like your profile picture, cover photo and country. You can see what your profile page looks like to friends and those who are not friends by going to the Privacy Shortcuts menu, choosing “Who can see my stuff?” and selecting “View As” underneath “What do other people see on my timeline?”Posts on public pages, like a fan page for a TV show or an open discussion group, are also visible to all, including web-based search engines outside Facebook. If you do not want comments that you have made on public pages to potentially be seen all over the world, go back and delete them.While public comments may be out in the open, you can block external search engines like Bing, Google and Yahoo from linking your Facebook timeline in search results. The option to prevent search sites from listing your Facebook page is also in your account’s privacy settings. If you have allowed your page to be publicly searchable before, however, it may take some time for it to be purged from a search engine’s index.Advertisement
