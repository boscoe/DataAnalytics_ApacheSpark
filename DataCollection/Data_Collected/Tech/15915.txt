I screen, you screen, we all live on video screens. Companies and governments keep taking notice, and are scrambling to catch up with the ways we and video are changing each other.Katie Benner reports that the social media company Twitter has released an app to let people watch its video content on the television services of Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.These include live streams of multiple sports events, as well as news programs. It’s another reminder that, in an era where everything can be recorded or watched on demand, there is a curious premium attached to real-time events.It is quite a step from Twitter’s original purpose, a 140-character “microblogging” service, when it came out in 2006. A way for people to muse about themselves has evolved into a way to comment and share information about events almost as they happen, to participate in hashtag games that appear out of nowhere and now to look at video in real time.If, as they say, the internet collapses both time and space, Twitter is trying to address the remaining value in time: knowing about things in the moment they are going on.AdvertisementElsewhere, Mark Scott reports, European regulators are addressing the way internet video now collapses space.AdvertisementVideo on demand from the likes of the BBC or Netflix, even premium Hollywood movies, may become readily available to 500 million European Union residents, regardless of what country they are in.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For years, video fans have used virtual private networks, or VPNs, to tunnel under national restrictions on what content they can see, at what price.What the E.U. is doing, in this rare case, is acknowledging a reality about how the world works that business still denies.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
