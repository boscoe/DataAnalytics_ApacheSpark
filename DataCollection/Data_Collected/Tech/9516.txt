Cutting the cable cord might not be as easy as you think.As Brian X. Chen writes, people now have plenty of streaming services and devices to choose from if they want to cancel their cable-television subscription. But that’s precisely the problem: too many options.So Brian teamed up with The Wirecutter, a product recommendation website that The New York Times has collaborated with in the past, to come up with a comprehensive guide for cord-cutting in 2016. The Wirecutter tested various services and hardware to help you figure out what might work for you and what wouldn’t.The resulting guide is tailored to viewers’ personal habits. Are you a movie buff? Then the best streaming choices for you may be different from what you need if all you want to watch is live sports. Likewise, families with children may not make the same choices as those who want to watch premium shows from HBO.We hope you find the guide useful.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
