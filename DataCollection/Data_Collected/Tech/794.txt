On Tuesday, the police said the boy had been released on bail.TalkTalk  said on Friday that a substantial number of its customers could have been affected by the data breach, the third cyberattack on the company in 12 months. It became aware of the breach late on Wednesday.Dido Harding, TalkTalk’s chief executive, confirmed on Friday that the company had received a ransom demand from a group purporting to be behind the attack, though other groups have also claimed responsibility.On Saturday, the broadband provider said on its website that the stolen customer data had been less sensitive than initially thought and did not include complete credit card numbers or customers’ passwords, for instance.On Monday, after the teenager’s arrest, TalkTalk said it would “continue to assist in the ongoing investigation,” which is being conducted by cybercrime agents for the Metropolitan Police of London, the Northern Ireland police and the National Crime Agency of Britain.TalkTalk’s efforts to play down the impact of the data breach have not stopped British authorities from criticizing the company and the failure of its online security systems.British lawmakers said on Monday that they would open an investigation into the data breach, and the country’s data protection authority said it would begin a separate inquiry.Shares of TalkTalk are down 8 percent since the hacking attack was confirmed on Friday.Advertisement
