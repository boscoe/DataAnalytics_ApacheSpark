IBM has been associated with many things over the years. But few people would ever connect Big Blue, as IBM is sometimes called, with a progressive attitude toward design.Phil Gilbert is trying to change that. Mr. Gilbert is in charge of design at IBM and is trying to get the technology giant to embrace a concept called “design thinking.” Design thinking, at its basic level, is a way to get engineers, product developers and nearly everyone at a company to first consider what customers want — rather than building something and then trying to convince people that they want it.Putting this new way of thinking in effect at an older company is not necessarily about product-design breakthroughs, like the iPod click wheel. Indeed, IBM has long since sold off its traditional consumer computing business. Mr. Gilbert and his designers, who could soon number 1,000, aim to get all at IBM to better understand what the company’s business customers really need. After that, they can figure out what products and services will satisfy those needs.IBM could use some fresh thinking. Though it is still a huge company, its revenues have declined for more than two years. Its newer businesses in areas like artificial intelligence are growing, but not quickly enough to make up for declines in older hardware, software and services.Perhaps a groundbreaking idea like the click wheel — or some modern equivalent — is not exactly what IBM needs. But understanding what customers need would be a good start.
