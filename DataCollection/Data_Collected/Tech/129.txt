The predicament seemed intractable. On one side, Jack Dorsey said he would not leave his job as chief executive of Square, the payments start-up, until he was “old or dead.” On the other side was Twitter’s board, which said that its next chief executive would need to be devoted full time, an apparent reference to Mr. Dorsey’s plan.Now it is clear the board got over it. Mr. Dorsey will run both companies.Still, as Nick Bilton writes, Mr. Dorsey is returning to a frayed Twitter, and has a lot of work ahead of him there. But he has plenty of challenges facing him at Square, too.Mr. Dorsey’s dual-chief role means, Mike Isaac and Leslie Picker write, that he may be choosing between his two companies. “But the situation is even trickier for the employees of Square,” they write. “Some of them are concerned at how Mr. Dorsey’s split attention will be received, according to more than a dozen current and former employees of Square and Twitter. Some said it seemed as if Mr. Dorsey was choosing his favorite child, Twitter, over the second-born, Square.”The change comes at a perilous time for Square, as it is preparing for a public offering, perhaps by the end of this year. The developments will be worth keeping a close eye on.
