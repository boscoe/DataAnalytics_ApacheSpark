GIFs, the fodder of Internet memes for quite some time, have experienced a recent resurgence, propelled by mobile devices into a more widespread form of instant visual-messaging.They have become a mainstream form of digital expression, a way to relay complex feelings and thoughts in ways beyond words and even photographs, making them hugely popular with young audiences who never leave home without their smartphones.Dozens of readers sent us their animated, looping images, responding to a personal call by one of our reporters, Mike Isaac, for their greatest GIF moments.The submissions included one of street signs that had been stitched together into an animated daily poem, and one of a newborn baby boy that was made by his proud father. Here are some others that had the newsroom chuckling, or cooing.“When you’re angry because you’re starving, but you’re too angry to eat.”“This GIF is applicable when absolutely nothing is going according to plan, especially at work. Strategic plan fail? Angry panda GIF. Someone won’t mute their phone on the conference call? Angry panda GIF. A bad piece of legislation passed? Angry panda GIF. There’s really no time when something spectacularly terrible is happening that the angry panda can’t be applied.”“This little crab GIF has become our mascot of summer and is now our rallying call. This little dude is so cute and the loop is perfect, it’s the GIF of summer 2015.” “My dog trying to tell me she understands.”
