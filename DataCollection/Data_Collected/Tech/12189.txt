A self-driving car being tested by Google struck a public bus on a city street in Mountain View, Calif. The tech company’s vehicles have been involved in more than a dozen minor accidents, but this fender-bender may represent the first time that a Google car has caused an accident. A report from Google on the Feb. 14 episode was posted online Monday by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Google’s car was moving at less than two miles an hour and the bus at 15 m.p.h. No one was injured. The report does not address fault, but Google wrote that its car was trying to get around some sandbags when its left front struck the right side of the bus. Google did not have immediate comment.
