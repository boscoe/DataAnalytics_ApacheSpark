Reddit, the popular community news site, formalized a new set of guidelines that aim to restrict some of the risqué and potentially offensive content posted to the site.The policy, posted to Reddit’s site on Wednesday, will effectively “quarantine” some of the communities — or subreddits — on the site, making them viewable only to users who opt in to seeing them.Reddit said it will also ban some of the communities as a result of the new policy. Those communities were chosen because they “exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and make Reddit worse for everyone else,” according to the company.“Our most important policy over the last 10 years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations,” Steve Huffman, Reddit’s chief executive, wrote in a post on Wednesday. “Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.”The policy marks the first major change to the site since Mr. Huffman, a co-founder of Reddit, recently returned to take over as chief executive after taking a six-year hiatus to found and work at another start-up. In the two years before Mr. Huffman’s return, Reddit raised $50 million of venture capital and has tried to figure out how to expand into a viable online business.The new policy may elicit contempt from some users of the site, which in the past decade has slowly but steadily grown into an online traffic powerhouse with more than 195 million regular monthly visitors. Reddit, which essentially acts as an online message board for community discussion about news and events, became widely known for its laissez-faire approach to content posted to the site, be it pornographic, racist or otherwise offensive.Some of the communities being banned include racist groups targeting African-Americans, and a subreddit dedicated to posting and discussing animations of child pornography, according to the company.In the last two years, Reddit has tried to clean up some of the more controversial aspects of the site. Earlier this year, it posted some early versions of content guidelines and banned a handful of communities, some of which were racist or involved the harassment of overweight people.Those attempts were met with vitriolic pushback from  some of the people in Reddit’s vocal, active user base, many of whom were concerned that the platform was clamping down on free speech.Others, however, say that Reddit’s new policies do not go far enough, and that while certain areas of the site are being banned, other controversial communities continue to exist.For its part, Reddit has tried to engage in discussions with the community to find a balance between what should and should not be permissible.“This is not the last time our policies will change, of course,” Mr. Huffman wrote. “They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.”A version of this article appears in print on 08/10/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Reddit Issues Rules to Rein In Offensive Forums.
