Microsoft Edge, the browser released with the Windows 10 operating system last year, does not currently support extensions (small utility programs to customize your browser) unless you are in the Windows Insider Program for testing early versions of the software. However, that will change on Aug. 2 when Microsoft rolls out its Windows 10 Anniversary Update.Microsoft has been testing several Edge extensions with developers and its Windows Insiders this year. Once you install the update, you should be able to add the extensions from the Windows Store. Some of the planned extensions include Adblock Plus, Amazon Assistant, Evernote, LastPass, Office Online and Pinterest.The update includes other improvements to Edge, like better power management and new accessibility features. Microsoft is also increasing the overall security for Windows 10, adding new powers to the system’s Cortana virtual assistant and releasing the Windows Ink feature for better digital pen input for touch-screen devices.The Windows 10 Anniversary Update will be available as a free download for computers already running Windows 10.
