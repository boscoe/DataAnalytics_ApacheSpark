Q. When I click an email address link on a web page to send a new message on my PC, Firefox tries to open the separate mail program I never use, instead of switching to the Gmail page I have open in another tab and creating the new message there. Can I fix this?A. Like other browsers, Mozilla Firefox looks for the computer’s default mail application when you click a “mailto” link on a webpage or email message. If you find the program is opening Windows Mail, Apple Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird or another stand-alone mail program instead of the mail service you use through your browser (like Gmail or Yahoo Mail), you just have to change a Firefox setting.To change the default mail program Firefox opens, click the three-lined Menu button in the top-right corner of the browser window and select Options (Windows) or Preferences (Mac). On the left side of the next screen, click Applications. In the Content Type list in the middle of the screen, scroll down and select “mailto” and in the Actions drop-down menu next to it, choose Gmail. The next time you click an address to compose a note, Firefox should pop open a New Message form in your Gmail window.Google Chrome has its own setting you can adjust. If your browser’s settings do not give you the option to choose a web mail service as your default mail program, a browser add-on might work. For example, the Google Toolbar extension for Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser allows you to open “mailto” links with Gmail. A free extension for the Chrome browser called Mailto: for Gmail is another way to pop open a fresh Gmail message when you click an address link.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
