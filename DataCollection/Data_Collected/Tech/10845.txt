Hacking has dominated technology news over the course of 2016, with revelations of major breaches at Yahoo and the hacked emails of Democrats.Now we close out the year with the news that President Obama, in the waning days of his administration, is punishing Russia for its cyberattacks against the United States, which probably affected the American presidential election.David E. Sanger, a New York Times national security correspondent, writes that President Obama’s administration has imposed sanctions against two of Russia’s leading intelligence services, including four top officers, for their roles in cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. The United States also released samples of malware and other indications of Russian cyberactivity.The response — the strongest American action ever taken against a state-sponsored cyberattack — is expected to have repercussions on the relationship between the United States and Russia that will play out for many months.AdvertisementOne unknown is how President Obama’s successor, Donald J. Trump, will act on the conflict when he takes office next month. The president-elect has been skeptical of the American intelligence reports of Russia’s cyberattacks. On Thursday, Mr. Trump said that it was time to “move on” from the issue, but that he would meet with intelligence officials.Russia, at least, seems to be betting on an improved relationship with Mr. Trump. On Friday, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, said he would not retaliate against the Obama administration’s decision to impose sanctions.AdvertisementThe Bits newsletter will be on hiatus until Jan. 3.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
