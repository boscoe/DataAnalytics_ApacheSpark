Is there anything similar for Windows tablets and laptops to help locate lost or stolen hardware?A. Microsoft added a Find My Device tool in an update to Windows 10 last year. The Find My Device feature basically works the same way that Apple’s Find My iPhone/iPad/Mac service does, using GPS and Wi-Fi network information for locating the missing phone, tablet or computer. As long as all the location services are enabled, the device’s whereabouts is displayed on a map when you log into your account through a web browser. (Google’s Android software includes Android Device Manager, which is its own hardware-tracking solution.)To use Find My Device on a tablet or laptop running Windows 10, make sure you are signed into the administrator-level Microsoft account you use with the gadget, and that the service is activated. To do that, go to the Windows 10 Settings to Updates & Security and select Find My Device (or Find My Phone for Windows Phone users). If the service is turned off in the Windows 10 settings, tap the Change button to enable it and allow the laptop or tablet to check in over the Internet periodically.Should the time come that you need to track down a lost Windows device, open the web browser on another machine, log into your Microsoft account at https://account.microsoft.com/devices/about. Click the Find My Device link on the page to see a map with your hardware’s last-known location.Windows Phone users have additional powers with the Find My Phone service. Through their Microsoft accounts, they can remotely ring, lock or erase the missing handset.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
