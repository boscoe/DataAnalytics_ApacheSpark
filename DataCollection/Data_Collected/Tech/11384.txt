Ready or not, here they come.The last couple of weeks have been a bit of a warm-up to earnings season. Intel and IBM reported lower profits, with their numbers reinforcing how adjusting to the rapidly changing tech industry is hard work, even for longtime giants like them. Both are turning their ships toward big opportunities; the question is how fast they can turn their ships, and whether they will be able to capitalize fully on those opportunities.But the season hits full swing this week. Apple reports on Tuesday; as Katie Benner reports, investors will be looking for signs that the company continues to be a growth company. Facebook reports on Wednesday; it will be interesting to see how much more of the mobile advertising market they have swallowed. Seattle’s two giants, Amazon and Microsoft, will report on Thursday. Here’s a safe bet with that one: Microsoft will have billions of dollars more in profit.And there’s more! Alibaba, PayPal, eBay and Qualcomm report as well this week.Whew. Strap in, it’ll be a busy week.
