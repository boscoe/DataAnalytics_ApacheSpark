Now the video site and its parent company, Google, are hoping users will pay for the privilege to watch the same videos without ads.YouTube executives on Wednesday introduced YouTube Red, a long-anticipated subscription service that will cost $10 a month for the same videos ad-free. The company simultaneously announced YouTube Originals, a slate of original programming that will be available only on the paid service.“People are embracing paid subscriptions for ad-free content at an incredible pace,” said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, who introduced the product on a stage at the YouTube Space in Los Angeles, a center where people who post on YouTube can make and edit videos on professional equipment free.Mr. Kyncl also gave some updates on the company’s ad business, noting that the number of advertisers running campaigns on YouTube was up 40 percent over the last year and that the top 100 advertisers had increased spending by 60 percent.Google continues to make the most of its revenue from advertising on its search engine, but it is now hoping to use its fast-expanding catalog of YouTube videos and music services to start bringing in subscription revenue as well. The service, which begins next week, will work across the original YouTube as well as YouTube’s gaming app, its forthcoming music app and Google’s Google Play music service.YouTube has become one of Google’s big growth drivers, generating $5 billion to $10 billion in revenue, according to the best guesses of analysts. The research service eMarketer predicts YouTube will generate $9.5 billion in ad revenue for Google this year.Whatever the number, YouTube is the most popular video service in a world where people are spending less time watching television and more watching video on tablets and mobile phones. Americans are projected to spend four hours and 11 minutes a day watching television this year, down 11 minutes from last year, according to eMarketer.But the time they spend watching video on digital screens is expected to rise 10 minutes, to one hour and 34 minutes a day, this year.YouTube executives said they were introducing a subscription service in part to give a new revenue stream to the Internet-famous “creators,” the most popular of which already make millions of dollars a year in advertising revenue.For now, the paid site will mostly be the same service as the current, ad-supported version of YouTube. There will be some extra features like the ability to download videos so subscribers can watch them offline. Subscribers can also watch the videos while they are using other applications like email.And starting next year, creators will begin adding extra context — YouTube Originals — that will over time create a two-tiered system where fans can pay for the extra content.On Wednesday, YouTube announced a handful of new productions, including “Scare PewDiePie,” a reality series made by Maker Studios and the producers of “The Walking Dead,” the popular television show about a zombie apocalypse. The series will star PewDiePie, a Swedish YouTube star whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, and show him encountering “terrifying situations inspired by his favorite video games.”In addition to YouTube originals, the service will include a roster of programming from big media companies like 21st Century Fox, NBCUniversal and Time Warner that are already on the ad-supported version of YouTube. The media companies will get about 55 percent of the revenue from the service, said executives with knowledge of the terms.Some media executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they felt pressured to participate in the new service. The executives said YouTube had implied that if they didn’t provide content for subscribers, there was a chance their ad-supported content would not be available on YouTube in the United States.“We’ve made a lot of progress and have worked closely and collaboratively with our creators large and small,” said a YouTube spokesman in an emailed statement. “It is precisely because of this work that we have the signed agreements with the overwhelming majority of our partners, representing over 98 percent of the content watched on YouTube. We look forward to continuing this work for YouTube Red.”A number of media companies have been unveiling their own subscription streaming services.Media executives said their revenue from the service was not likely to make much difference to their bottom lines, but they were eager to support the idea of more people paying for their content.But it is what they deliver to YouTube that will make the difference for the new subscription service.“In general, it certainly seems like consumers are much more comfortable paying for subscription video, but content is key so we’ll have to see how they execute on it,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities.Advertisement
