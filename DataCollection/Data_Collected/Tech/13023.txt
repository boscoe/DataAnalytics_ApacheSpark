In Android 5.0 and later, open the Contacts on your Android device and tap the entry you want to use. Tap the pencil-shaped Edit icon. Once you are in editing mode, you can change any of the information in the contact file and add a picture.In the picture area at the top of the contact screen, tap the camera icon in the bottom-right corner. In the Change Photo box, choose Take Photo (to summon the device’s camera and snap a picture right there) or Choose Photo (to pick a picture from the device’s photo library). Tap the checkmark-shaped Save icon when you are satisfied. On some Android devices, you may see a Change button near the photo instead of a camera icon to get you started with picking a new picture for the contact file.If the contacts you edit on your Android device are synchronized with the contacts in your Google Account, the changes you make on your phone or tablet will also appear on the Contacts screen you use with your Gmail account on the web. Likewise, if you are syncing Google Account contacts with your Android device, you can edit the files and add photos from the Google Contacts screen in your web browser — the contacts will automatically update over your device’s network connection.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
