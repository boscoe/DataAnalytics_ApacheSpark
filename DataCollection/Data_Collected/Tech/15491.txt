How do I get Facebook to display the photos I upload in higher definition?A. Facebook automatically resizes pictures you upload to the site, but you can change this in the settings for your account. Keep in mind that uploading larger image files will take up more data, in case you are on a metered plan from your carrier and need to keep an eye on your monthly allowance. (Uploading photos over a Wi-Fi connection is usually faster and cheaper, unless you are on a slow network with a data allowance there, too.)If you are using the Facebook app on an Android phone, go to your news feed page and tap the More button (which looks like three horizontal lines) at the top of the screen. Scroll down the list of icons to the Help & Settings area and select App Settings. Tap the button next to Upload HD Photos.On the iPhone version of the Facebook app, tap the three-lined More button at the bottom of the screen. Tap Settings and then choose Account Settings in the menu that pops up. In the list of Settings categories, tap Videos and Photos. On the next screen, under Photo Settings, turn on the button next to “Upload HD.”For your photos to look their best, the site’s Help Center suggests that you size them to widths of 720 pixels, 960 pixels or 2,048 pixels with the HD Photos setting enabled. Even with the HD Photo settings activated, some larger pictures will not appear in their full resolution, as Facebook has a maximum width of 2,048 pixels for standard images.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
