Q. I use Google’s two-step authentication to protect my Gmail account, but I got temporarily locked out the other day when I was asked to re-enter my password, and the corresponding text code from Google didn’t arrive until hours later. Where do I get a set of those preprinted backup codes in case this happens again?A. When you are logged into your Gmail account with your web browser, click your profile icon in the upper-right corner and then click the My Account button. On your Account page, click Sign-in & Security. In the Signing Into Google area of the page, click 2-Step Verification. (As an alternate method of getting there by browser, you can also log into your Google account at https://www.google.com/accounts/SmsAuthConfig.)On the 2-Step Verification screen, make sure the Verifications Codes tab is selected. Scroll down the page to the Backup Codes section and click the Generate Codes button; if you have previously cooked up a batch of backup numbers, the button says Show Codes. On the next screen, Google gives you a set of 10 eight-digit numbers. You can use each numeric code once for logging into your Gmail account when verification is required.Click the Print button to create a hard copy of the list so you can keep it in a safe place, like a wallet or purse. If you prefer to keep the codes on your computer, click the Save to Text File button. The file will be named Backup-codes-[your username].txt in case you lose track of the downloaded copy and need to search for it on the computer later.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
