Aaron Levie, the chief executive and co-founder of Box, has had a rough year.Earlier this year, Mr. Levie and his company, which sells online data storage services to companies, were taking a beating on Wall Street. The initial public offering of shares in Box were a disappointment; losses were piling up, and its value as a publicly traded company was lower than its perceived value when it was still private.So what happens next year? Believe it or not, Mr. Levie could well be lauded as one of the few young Silicon Valley execs who was willing to take his lumps with public investors for the long-term benefit of his company and his employees.Net losses at Box are still growing. But an earnings forecast issued last week was rosier than expected and the company appears to have momentum. More importantly, it went public before the gap between the value placed on privately held tech start-ups (very, very high) and publicly traded tech start-ups (for the most part, very rational, as the recent I.P.O. of Jack Dorsey’s Square demonstrated) got completely out of control.When the company most like Box, the similarly named Dropbox, attempts to go public — whenever that is — there is a chance public investors will agree with the private investors that have valued it at $10 billion.But the more likely scenario: If and when that day comes, the public value won’t be anywhere close. And Dropbox executives will be forced to explain why investors should pay a premium over Box, which has already run the I.P.O. gantlet.
