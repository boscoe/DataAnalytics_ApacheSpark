Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, and her husband, Zachary Bogue, are expecting twin daughters, according to an announcement she made on Yahoo’s Tumblr.Ms. Mayer said Monday that her twins were due in December and that she planned to work throughout her pregnancy. When she was first hired by Yahoo in 2012 from Google, Ms. Mayer revealed she was pregnant, and she worked during much of that term as well.“Since my pregnancy has been healthy and uncomplicated and since this is a unique time in Yahoo’s transformation, I plan to approach the pregnancy and delivery as I did with my son three years ago, taking limited time away and working throughout,” she wrote in the post, adding that Yahoo’s board of directors and her executive team were “incredibly supportive and happy” for her.Ms. Mayer’s announcement is Silicon Valley’s second high-profile pregnancy in as many months. Mark Zuckerberg announced recently that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were expecting a daughter.The announcements come as several large tech companies have rolled out increasingly generous paid parental leave programs. Netflix said it would offer unlimited leave in the first year after a child is born, while Microsoft said it would significantly increase paid leave.Ms. Mayer, who has led Yahoo for more than three years, has struggled to rebuild the company’s once-dominant advertising business. In particular, the company has struggled with mobile advertising, where it has lost market share.Still, most of Wall Street is focused on the company’s 15 percent stake in China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba. Yahoo has said that it will spin off the holding, worth about $26 billion, into a separate company in the fourth quarter, though the transfer depends on how much the company would have to pay in taxes on the spinoff.
