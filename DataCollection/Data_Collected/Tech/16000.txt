Add another new messaging app to the proliferation of chat apps.On Wednesday, Google made its new messaging app, Allo, officially available. The app is distinct from Google’s past messaging efforts in that Allo includes an artificially intelligent assistant that is designed to help people with their conversations and searches for information.Allo joins a crowded messaging field. In the United States, Apple’s iMessage (of which a new version was released last week), Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, among others, are already popular. In Asia, where messaging became more popular earlier than in the United States, WeChat and Line are used by millions.So how much can Google Allo stand out from that horde and how well does it work?To arrive at a determination, Brian X. Chen recently tested Allo for five days and compared it with other apps like iMessage, Messenger and Google Hangouts.
