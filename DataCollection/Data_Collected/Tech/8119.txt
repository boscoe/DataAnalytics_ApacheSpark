If you thought the so-called right to be forgotten was limited to Europe, think again. A court ruling in Europe last year said that people could request search engines to remove a link if it went to a page that unfairly besmirched them. The ruling went somewhat counter to the prevailing thinking about the Internet as a sort of free-wheeling data hose.A French court later went a step further. It said that if a link was going to be removed, it needed to be removed from all of a search engine’s global domains. For Google, that means that a page linked to from Google.fr must also be taken down on Google.com, a site the company considers to be American. There is at least a fighting chance that this interpretation holds up in European courts. As  Farhad Manjoo writes, upholding the French ruling could have far-reaching implications, and it has some free speech advocates up in arms.It essentially started with a single man. Dan Shefet, a Danish lawyer who has lived in Paris for 30 years, wanted to clear his name from a variety of accusations, including professional malpractice and fraud. In 2013, he appealed to Google to take down links to those accusations.Google took down links, but only on its French site. Then, last year, Mr. Shefet went to a Paris court, successfully arguing that given the right to be forgotten ruling, the company needed to remove the links from all the company’s global sites, including Google.com. “Google put up a hell of a fight,” he told The New York Times. “But they lost.” Last week, in explaining why it was fighting the broad interpretation of right to be forgotten, the company’s global privacy counsel wrote that no country should be able to dictate the type of online content available in other countries. “In the end,” wrote the counsel, Peter Fleischer, “the Internet would only be as free as the world’s least free place.”  Unlike so many things that happen on the Internet, though, it might be outside of Google’s control.
