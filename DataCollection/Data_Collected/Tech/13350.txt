Q. What do I do if I forget my computer’s Windows password?A. If you have not forgotten the password already, write it down somewhere or put it in a password manager program on your phone. If you are using a local account to log into a Windows PC, you can also recreate a password reset disk on a USB flash drive ahead of time. Use the Start menu to search for “password reset disk” and follow the instructions on screen. Do not forget where you store the USB drive.If you share the PC with someone else who has an administrator account, you can have that person log in and reset your password. If you have a local account and did not create a password reset disk before you forgot the password, you may be able to get back into the computer by using a third-party password recovery utility. Another creative approach for Windows 7 calls for using a System Repair Disc (if you have one) to wriggle your way back into your PC.Unless you took the steps to set up a local account on your Windows 8 or Windows 10 computer, you are most likely using a Microsoft account instead. A Microsoft account is made up of an email address (like an old Hotmail.com or Outlook.com account) and a password that gets you into the computer.If you are using a Microsoft account to log into your PC, you can use another computer or device to request a password reset online on Microsoft’s site — so you can get back into your own machine. And, if you set up a local account on your Windows 10 machine and cannot remember your password, the How-To Geek site has a detailed guide to other things you can try to get back into your computer, but proceed at your own risk.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
