HONG KONG — Despite a glimmer of progress after talks in March between the United States and China over a potential technology trade war, little has changed, according to a letter sent by trade groups to Chinese leaders on Monday.After a meeting of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and top Chinese officials last month, there came word that China would delay implementing new rules designed to encourage banks in the country to buy crucial technology, like servers and mainframes, from Chinese companies. American trade groups that had lobbied against the rules were cautiously optimistic, calling the Chinese move to delay implementation a good first step.Their satisfaction was short-lived.“Chinese banks are continuing to implement new procurement practices favoring domestic products and services consistent with the guidelines, creating urgent challenges for companies whose products and services are affected by them,” said the letter from trade groups, which include the American Chamber of Commerce and organizations from Europe and Japan. It is addressed to a crucial Chinese committee on cybersecurity, led by President Xi Jinping of China.The letter was provided by a person who declined to be named because he was not authorized to release it to the media.The latest letter signaled a renewal of trade tensions over the new technology policies being rolled out by Beijing. It also showed that high-level talks between officials like Mr. Lew and Premier Li Keqiang of China had not proved to be as successful as the Obama administration might have hoped.It was not clear whether the Chinese had backed off from assurances they gave to Mr. Lew or whether they did not view the assurances as formally binding. Regardless, in the letter, the industry groups called on China to put its assurances in writing.The letter urged “the Chinese leadership to officially suspend implementation of the guidelines through a written public notice, publicize them as a proposal, and initiate a formal public consultation consistent with China’s international obligations.”Regardless of what happens next, it seems the cease-fire has been broken, and the world’s two largest economies continue to move toward a technology trade war.
