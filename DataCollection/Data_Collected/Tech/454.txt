The advertising blitz was breathtaking in its intensity. The online fantasy sports company DraftKings — a company most people had never heard of — briefly became television’s top advertiser as it ran an ad every minute and a half in the week leading up to the start of the National Football League season. The deluge was an indication of just how big fantasy sports and online sports gambling have become, despite efforts to keep much of it away from Internet users in the United States.A  2006 law that was supposed to curtail online sports gambling has inadvertently opened the doors to entrepreneurs, creating huge sports betting enterprises — some legal and some not, according to an investigation by The New York Times. The scale of some of the illegal operations is as dazzling as the ad blitz from DraftKings: One organization in Texas processed $1 billion during a single NFL season before it was shut down.The concern is that many of these online sports wagering organizations are targeting young men at an age when they are most likely to become gambling addicts, or the companies are offering cover for money made in other illegal activities.With that concern have come calls for more scrutiny. On Monday, DraftKings and the other big fantasy sports site, FanDuel, released statements defending their businesses’ integrity after allegations that employees were placing bets using information not generally available to the public. On Wall Street, they would have called those allegations “insider trading.”By Thursday, Nevada regulators had ordered websites like DraftKings and FanDuel to stop operating immediately in the state until the companies and their employees receive state gambling licenses.
