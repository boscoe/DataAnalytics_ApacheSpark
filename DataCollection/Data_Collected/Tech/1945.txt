Apple’s round of fall software updates to its OS X and iOS systems has come with typical bugs for users. However, many who rely on Google’s free Picasa application to import, organize and edit digital photos have been complaining specifically that the OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) update has taken away the picture program’s ability to import photos directly from some USB-connected cameras — including iPhones.Over the years, Google has shifted its attention from Picasa to Google photos, but it still occasionally updates Picasa for the Windows and Mac OS X versions; a Linux edition was put out to pasture in 2012. Google has yet to formally comment on the importing issue with OS X or put out an update to Picasa.You have other ways to transfer the photos from your phone to your computer. The key is that once the photos have been copied to the Pictures folder or another folder on the Mac, you can just open Picasa and allow the program to scan and index the images so they are ready for you to organize.Apple includes an Image Capture utility with OS X that can be used to pull in photos from a connected phone or camera’s memory card. Since you are using a newer iPhone with El Capitan, you can also use the AirDrop feature to wirelessly beam photos from your phone to the Mac’s Downloads folder over your home Wi-Fi network and a Bluetooth connection.Online syncing solutions like Apple’s iCloud Photo Library or the third-party app Photo Sync can also move images between devices. And, if you decide it is all too much effort, switching from Picasa to the Photos app with OS X and importing your pictures to the new program, is an alternative approach.Advertisement
