Deep breaths, everyone.Yes, Instagram will be changing how it presents which photos and videos you see, going from a strictly here’s-the-latest model to an algorithm much like the news feed on Facebook.No, the change is not happening right now, as many users mistakenly believe.And the many requests you have probably received to turn on notifications for individual users may not be your best bet to continue seeing the posts you most want to see.Starting last weekend, many people’s feeds were cluttered with images pointing up and to the right, with celebrities, major brands and everyday users imploring followers to turn on notifications for their individual accounts. Instagram is apparently changing today and I don't want to lose you tap the three 3 dots up the top right of this post and click ‘turn on post notifications’. Do the same with @superelixir and all your favourite accounts to make sure you don't miss our posts  #instagramchanges #superelixir #turnmeon #greenloveA photo posted by Elle Macpherson (@ellemacphersonofficial) on Mar 28, 2016 at 3:19am PDTWhile changes are, indeed, coming, many of the posts suggested they would be happening immediately. For most people, that is untrue.Advertisement“Despite the rumors, no feed changes are being implemented right now — we still have weeks, or even months, of testing to go,” an Instagram spokesman said in a statement. “Currently the test groups are very small. When we roll it out broadly, we will definitely let the community know.”What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Your favorite friends, brands and celebrities may essentially be asking to overwhelm you with notifications.AdvertisementThe panic is based on a fear that once the algorithm takes over, posts you would otherwise see in a reverse chronological presentation may soon be hidden. That is true: Instagram is likely to present photos and videos based on how inclined you are to be interested in them, your history of interaction with the user and how timely the posts are. If you rarely like or comment on an account’s photo, those photos might be less likely to show up.But you may see more of an account if you interact often with it. If you like every one of your friend’s photos of her cat, you would more likely see her photos, even if they were posted many hours before you logged in. Instagram is betting that you probably won’t scroll down too far and that you would rather see your friend’s cat than whatever was posted five minutes ago.“On average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their Instagram feed,” Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, said in an interview in March. “What this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you see is the best 30 percent possible.”A similar concern has risen each time a major social network has switched to an algorithmic approach. Facebook faced criticism in 2009, and Twitter heard a similar uproar last month when it began putting older tweets at the top of user timelines.Nonprofit groups, news organizations and brands have long expressed frustration with their diminishing reach on Facebook. Many users, including celebrities, appear to be bracing for a similar result on Instagram.
            If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Well, the only thing that's broken now is your relationship with your users. So fix that. @instagram A version of this article appears in print on March 31, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Instagram Feed Is Changing, but Not Yet.
