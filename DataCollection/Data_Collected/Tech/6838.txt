LOS ANGELES – It was easy to miss, but Nintendo made something of an unusual move for the company at this E3 games conference. For the third consecutive year, Nintendo did not hold a splashy live event at the conference to introduce its latest products, unlike Sony and Microsoft, its two big competitors in the game console business. Instead, Nintendo broadcast an online-only video on Tuesday morning that any fan could watch, not just E3 attendees.During that relatively low-key video, which featured Muppet versions of senior Nintendo executives bantering among themselves, Nintendo announced that it had reached a deal with Activision to allow two iconic Nintendo characters – Donkey Kong and Bowser — to appear in the next Skylanders game, Skylanders SuperChargers.In Skylanders, toy figurines interact with on-screen action, and the game has been a huge hit for Activision.This type of crossover arrangement may not seem that unusual, but for Nintendo – a company that has insisted on restricting use of its characters to its own games and hardware – it is extraordinary. As Reggie Fils-Aimé, the president of Nintendo’s United States division, said in the company’s E3 video (while in human, not Muppet, form), Nintendo is a “company that is very protective of its franchise, that always likes to have total control.”Nintendo is loosening its grip on its business in other ways. After consistently – some might say stubbornly – avoiding taking its games to mobile devices, Nintendo in March announced its plans to do just that.The company’s focus is still very much on creating games for its own hardware. At E3, where it had a large booth on the show floor, it exhibited a game called Star Fox Zero that uses the tablet controller of the Wii U console to let people pilot a plane.   Another game, Super Mario Maker, will allow players to design their own game levels and share them with others.A version of this article appears in print on 06/17/2015, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Two Nintendo Characters to Appear in Activision Game.
