After an outcry over privacy concerns, Samsung has clarified that some of its so-called smart televisions listen in on the conversations of viewers only if the viewers permit the devices to do so.Samsung responded to an uproar that began after the company recently updated a privacy policy for its Internet-connected Smart TV line of sets. The new language implied that Samsung eavesdrops on its users, describing in one sentence a voice recognition capability that allows viewers to operate their televisions with verbal commands.“Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition,” the sentence said.In a blog post on Tuesday, Samsung said that sentence had “led to confusion,” and it posted a new explanation of how its voice recognition system works. While the new explanation is very similar to the old one, there are several significant differences.Samsung said the unnamed third party that receives voice recordings through Samsung television sets is Nuance Communications, a leading maker of voice recognition technology. The new statement also said that Samsung collects voice commands from viewers only when they click an activation button on their remote controls or screens and speak into a microphone embedded in the remote — not all the time.The company also emphasized that viewers could turn the voice recognition feature off completely, though they would lose some voice functions on their television. That will be reassuring to some people.“Samsung takes consumer privacy very seriously and our products are designed with privacy in mind,” the company said in its blog post. “We employ industry-standard security safeguards and practices, including data encryption, to secure consumers’ personal information and prevent unauthorized collection or use.”Samsung does not say in its privacy policy how long it or its partners store voice recordings of Samsung television viewers, nor does it say whether viewers can delete those recordings.Amazon takes a different approach with Amazon Echo, a new music system and virtual assistant for the home. Like Samsung’s televisions, Echo collects voice commands from its users after they have activated the device with a verbal “wake word” or a button press. But the company also provides detailed instructions for deleting the recordings.
