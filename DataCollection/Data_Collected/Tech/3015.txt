Federal regulators are cracking down on mobile service providers that advertise “unlimited” data plans only to reduce the speed of data transmission if customers reach a certain limit on their data use. Slowed data speeds can make it difficult for mobile device users to browse the web or watch streaming videos.On Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission announced that TracFone Wireless, the largest prepaid mobile provider in the United States, had agreed to pay $40 million to settle agency charges that it deceived consumers by unfairly engaging in the practice, known as “throttling.”The agency charged that TracFone Wireless advertised different brands of unlimited data plans for about $45 a month via television, radio and print ads, sometimes aiming at narrowly targeted audiences. For instance, one brand, called Telcel America, was marketed to Spanish-speaking consumers, the agency said. Contrary to the marketing claims, however, the company “drastically slowed or cut off consumers’ mobile data” after their data use exceeded certain limits in a 30-day period, the agency said in a news release. Consumers who paid for the plans can now file claims for refunds.In an emailed statement in response to a request for comment, TracFone said: “We have worked with the F.T.C. to reach an amicable settlement and we have no further comment at this time.”“The issue here is simple: When you promise consumers ‘unlimited,’ that means unlimited,” Jessica L. Rich, director of the agency’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.The TracFone case is the second agency complaint against mobile providers that market unlimited data plans. Last fall, the F.T.C. filed a complaint against AT&T Mobility, charging that the company failed to adequately disclose to customers with unlimited data plans that their data speeds would be reduced if they reached certain limits on data use. That case is continuing.
