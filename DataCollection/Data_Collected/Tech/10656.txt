Both of these were actually fake news articles that circulated widely online, including on the world’s biggest social network, Facebook.Facebook is now taking steps to limit the misinformation on its site. On Thursday, Mike Isaac reports, the company began a series of experiments to better identify, flag and reduce the prominence of false articles, as well as making ad changes to hurt the bottom lines of fake news purveyors. If the tests are successful, they will be rolled out to a bigger audience, the company said.The new measures include partnering with groups that can help fact-check articles. If an article is deemed fake, it will carry a “disputed” designation on Facebook. If people still want to share it, they will see a pop-up that reminds them that the veracity of the information is in question. In an interview, James Goldston, the president of ABC News, which is one of the groups that will be doing the fact-checking, explained how the partnership would work.Facebook’s efforts are unlikely to stem the mushrooming of fake news, which also proliferates beyond the social network. And the company is walking a fine line of potentially discarding its position as a neutral player by intervening to ferret out fake news, some critics said. A Breitbart News article accused Facebook of working with “partisan fact-checkers.”Facebook acknowledged the balancing act.“I think of Facebook as a technology company, but I recognize we have a greater responsibility than just building technology that information flows through,” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, wrote in a post on Thursday. “We have a responsibility to make sure Facebook has the greatest positive impact on the world.”Advertisement
