The era of online shopping made “buy before you try” (and ship back if you don’t like it) a typical consumer experience. The Apple Watch, which comes out April 24, is probably something you should actually try before buying.That’s because the smartwatch, unlike past Apple products, is different from other gadgets that you’ve ever owned. Sure, it’s a wristwatch, but it’s also a miniature computer packed with features designed to augment the abilities of the iPhone. The watch cases and bands also come in different materials, sizes and colors. So you’ll want to see how the watch feels on your wrist and looks with your outfit.Apple is aware of the unique conditions of buying the Watch and has altered its retail operations accordingly. The company said that starting on Friday, customers could visit an Apple store to try on the Watch and see the different bands — a full two weeks before they can actually obtain the gadget. With past Apple products, like the iPhone, consumers typically couldn’t touch one until the device was already available in stores.Apple, in another break from the past, will allow people to buy the watch only online, for deliveries that will begin April 24.“We expect that strong customer demand will exceed our supply at launch,” said Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s head of retail operations, in a media statement. “To provide the best experience and selection to as many customers as we can, we will be taking orders for Apple Watch exclusively online during the initial launch period.”Shoppers can begin ordering the watch at 3:01 a.m. Eastern time on Friday. But if Apple is giving you a chance to try one in stores ahead of release, why not? The company encourages people to schedule an appointment on its website, apple.com.
