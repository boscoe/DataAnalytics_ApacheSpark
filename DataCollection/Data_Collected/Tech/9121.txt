In Seattle, President Xi Jinping of China on Tuesday addressed wary American business executives who are worried about market barriers, cybertheft and tough security measures imposed on foreign companies. But back in China, an American company is breaking down its own market barriers.Uber, the San Francisco ride-hailing company, said it was starting a new carpooling service in Chengdu, China, on Wednesday morning. Called UberCommute, the service gives Chinese car owners who drive long distances the option of picking up passengers heading in the same direction. The driver and rider share the cost of the trip, which means the driver ends up saving money.Uber plans to eventually expand the service to other cities, but it seems to make sense to start in a major Chinese city where gridlock is common. It competes with a similar service from Didi Kuaidi, China’s dominant ride-hailing start-up, which recently began offering a carpooling service aimed at commuters. But for the rest of the tech industry in the United States, all eyes will be on Seattle on Wednesday. China’s Internet czar, Lu Wei, is expected to hold an Internet forum attended by several top American technology companies, such as Apple, IBM and Uber.
