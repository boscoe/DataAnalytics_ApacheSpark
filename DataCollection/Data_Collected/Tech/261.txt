Jack Dorsey on Thursday addressed marketers in public for the first time since he was named chief executive of Twitter. His talk emphasized the real-time nature of the service. “Today, Twitter can show everything that is happening in the world 10 to 15 minutes faster than any other service,” Mr. Dorsey said.He used the stage on Thursday to show multiple video products. As Vindu Goel and Sydney Ember write, one announcement in particular stood out: The company will “allow scores of professional video publishers and creators to check a box to allow marketers to run short advertisements before their clips. The publisher will keep 70 percent of the ad revenue, with 30 percent going to Twitter.”The move wasn’t revolutionary — it is an expansion of a program that already exists at the company — but it may come to represent one in a steady stream of new products and features released under Mr. Dorsey. Just this week, Twitter also released a feature called Moments. The feature organizes tweets on particular topics or events, as a way to make the service somewhat more accessible — a “worthwhile effort,” Farhad Manjoo wrote.
