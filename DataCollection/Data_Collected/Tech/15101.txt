The company’s stock plunged in response.On Tuesday, Apple reported its latest quarterly earnings — and they were not particularly pretty. The company showed a continued sales drop, spurred by declines across its hardware products, Vindu Goel writes. Still, Apple’s stock rose in after-hours trading because the results were less bleak than Wall Street expected. And there was a bright spot from services revenue.The company may soon have more opportunity to zag rather than zig. Apple traditionally holds an event every September to introduce its new iPhones, which may give it some ability to arrest — at least temporarily — any acceleration of a downward spiral. It’s a reminder that whatever direction Apple ultimately takes, it will not be a linear one.Advertisement
