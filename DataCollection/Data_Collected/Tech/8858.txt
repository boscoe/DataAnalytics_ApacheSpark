This week is all about Apple, the world’s richest tech company, which introduced new iPhones, an overhauled Apple TV and a jumbo-size iPad on Wednesday.Alongside those announcements, Apple set a release date for iOS 9, the free update for its mobile operating system: Sept. 16. We tested an early version of iOS 9 for two months and homed in on the most important new features. (We also recommend that users wait awhile before updating to the new version of the operating system, in case there are any annoying bugs left over.)Speaking of smartphones, Kit Eaton rounds up apps for taking nice panoramic photos, and J. D. Biersdorfer answers your questions about Android software updates and destroying hard drive data.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
