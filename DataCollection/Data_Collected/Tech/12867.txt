Is there any way to get to it faster in Windows 10 besides running a search for it?A. The Control Panel of previous Windows versions has been largely supplanted by the newer Settings app that Microsoft includes on the lower part of the Start Menu in Windows 10. The Settings app can adjust many of the same Windows elements as the Control Panel, like the display, devices and network connections. But if you miss the old familiar Control Panel (with more direct access to things like Default Programs, AutoPlay and the Device Manager), you can get to it more quickly than by typing or commanding the Cortana assistant from the Search box.While there are many ways to cut down the time to the Control Panel, one quick route is to right-click on the Start Menu button and choose the Control Panel option from the menu that pops up. Pressing the Windows and X keys also opens the menu with the Control Panel item, with shortcuts to other Windows utilities like the Device Manager, Task Manager, Power Options, Command Prompt and File Explorer.If you like the visual Start Menu of Windows 10, you can also add the Control Panel to your collection of tiles. Just enter “Control Panel” into the Search box or tell Cortana to “open Control Panel.” Right-click the Control Panel result in the list and choose “Pin to Start.” Once you have the tile pinned to the Start Menu, you can drag it into position at the top of the stack or wherever you find it easiest to use.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
