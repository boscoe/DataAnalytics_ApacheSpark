The technology industryâ€™s financial data is set to go on full display this week.With Intel having reported earnings last week, a lineup of other tech companies are now on deck to do the same. IBM, Yahoo and eBay, along with Amazon, Google and Microsoft, among others, are all preparing to post their quarterly results over the next few days. Next week, it will be the turn of Apple, Twitter and others.The earnings will spotlight the winners and losers of the tech industry, especially as the large companies compete with one another for revenue, users and strategic advantage. One of the fiercest rivalries, of course, is between Apple and Google, which battle each other in multiple arenas. That includes how they view the mobile world, with Apple pushing an app-centric vision while Google prefers a mobile web-centric one. Katie Benner and Conor Dougherty found that those two differing viewpoints have resulted in many websites getting stuck in the middle, with the businesses trying to figure out if they should do an app (as suggested by Apple), a mobile website (as recommended by Google), or both.The earnings results in the next few weeks may indicate which side is winning such tussles. Check back here soon for any verdict.
