Facebook Live, the company’s real-time video-broadcasting feature, is available in the Android and iOS versions of the Facebook app. As with status updates and photos on the site, you can choose the audience for your live video post. This means you can restrict viewership to just your Facebook friends, or you can make the video public for anybody to see. If you choose a public audience, the video may even end up on the desktop Facebook Live Map showing active streams taking place around the world.To start a Facebook Live session, open the Facebook app on your device and tap the Status icon in the upper-left corner of the News Feed page; you can also tap the Post icon below the profile photo on your Timeline page. In the menu that appears, select Live Video. You may have to grant the Facebook app additional permission to use your device’s microphone.On the next screen, use the drop-down menu under your name to select the audience for your video and type a short description of what you will be showing your viewers — perhaps along the lines of “New puppy gets a bath.” When you are ready to begin broadcasting, tap the Go Live button in the Facebook Live window. If you are sharing only with friends, those friends will be notified that you are streaming live video.If the Go Live button is grayed out, your device does not have an internet connection strong enough to stream video, so look for a sturdier Wi-Fi or 4G cellular signal nearby.You can stream up to 90 minutes of live video at a time, and your viewers can comment on the clip as they watch. Tap the Finish button to end the live stream. The recorded video stays on your Timeline page.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
