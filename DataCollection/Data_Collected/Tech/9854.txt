By tapping into new technologies and the ubiquitous use of smartphones, the likes of Uber and Lyft — rival ride-booking services — were supposed to solve many of the problems that litter the traditional economy.But it turns out some of those problems are hard to tackle, even for these new Silicon Valley tech darlings.That’s the main conclusion from an academic paper published Monday that said African-American users of these digital services faced racial discrimination by some Uber and Lyft drivers.The findings — based on roughly 1,500 combined trips in Seattle and Boston — come on the heels of similar racial discrimination accusations against Airbnb, the vacation rental website, where people with African-American-sounding names found it harder to rent rooms than their white counterparts.AdvertisementAccusations of racial discrimination also have been levied at conventional taxi services. But the claims against these newer tech companies — which have garnered multibillion-dollar valuations and often a global footprint — could tarnish their reputations if such practices are not addressed quickly.AdvertisementAirbnb, for its part, has recently taken steps to stamp out such racial bias, including the creation of a new nondiscrimination policy.As part of the research into Uber and Lyft, African-American and white users in Seattle and Boston hailed rides separately with both services.“We found that African-American travelers in Seattle experienced statistically significantly longer delay waiting for a trip request through UberX or Lyft to be accepted,” said the researchers from the University of Washington, M.I.T. and Stanford.

In extreme cases, though, “drivers are more than four times as likely to cancel on an African-American male passenger than on a white male passenger.”Follow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82.A version of this article appears in print on November 1, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Study Shows Black Riders Wait Longer.
