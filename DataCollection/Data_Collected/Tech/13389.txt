After noting that “new versions of Windows since 2009 have included support for the key media formats,” Apple retired the Windows version of QuickTime 7 multimedia software this year. QuickTime for Apple’s OS X operating system is still supported.With Apple no longer providing security updates to fix holes in its Windows QuickTime code, computers running the software could be at risk. The security software company Trend Micro issued a warning this month describing two “critical vulnerabilities” in QuickTime for Windows and advised users to uninstall Apple’s abandoned program immediately. The Homeland Security Department posted a warning based on Trend Micro’s findings and also recommends that PC owners remove QuickTime from their systems.Odds are that many users may not even notice that the software is gone once it is removed, but some programs for Windows still rely on QuickTime’s ability to handle certain audio and video formats. Adobe is one company that posted a warning to users of its photo- and video-editing programs that removing QuickTime would cause problems with using those applications; Adobe says it is working to improve the situation. If you rely on a program that may use QuickTime, check with the company that makes it for updates and solutions.You can remove the QuickTime software from your Windows system with the usual methods for uninstalling programs. For example, from the Start Menu’s Programs or Apps list, open the QuickTime folder and choose Uninstall QuickTime; you can also use the Search box to look for “Uninstall QuickTime.” And you can pry the program off your PC with Microsoft’s built-in tools in the Settings or Control Panel for removing programs in Windows 7 and Windows 10.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
