The phone carrier T-Mobile USA made lots of noise this week about allowing many subscribers to stream content from some video services over their cellular connections without burning through their data allotments — so much noise that it was easy to overlook that T-Mobile also raised prices on many of its data plans.Let’s start with the simplest price increase: T-Mobile’s unlimited data plan now costs $95, up from $80. The carrier increased the size of its limited data plans, but also raised the price for most of them. The data tiers now cost $50, $65 and $80 for two gigabytes, six gigabytes and 10 gigabytes. In the past, the data tiers cost $50, $60 and $70 for one gigabyte, three gigabytes and five gigabytes.The revised pricing structure can be a good deal for some existing T-Mobile subscribers, who have the option to switch to the new plans. If you’re on the five-gigabyte plan for $70 a month, for example, it would be beneficial to switch to the new six-gigabyte plan that costs $65 a month. And if you’re on the current one-gigabyte plan for $50 a month, you might as well switch to the new two-gigabyte plan for the same cost.But brand-new customers signing up for T-Mobile may find that the data plan options are generally higher priced than the previous ones were. The average American wireless subscriber uses roughly three gigabytes a month, so most new subscribers will want to opt for the second tier, the six-gigabyte plan for $65 a month. This way, you’ll be getting lots more data per buck than you would have with the older $60, three-gigabyte plan. But you also pay a little more to get more data than you will probably use.In the wireless industry, this type of price revision is nothing new. AT&T also previously restructured its data plans to offer more data while increasing prices.
