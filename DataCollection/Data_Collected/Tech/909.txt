San Francisco is set to come face to face this week with an issue that has divided the city: the tech boom.Tuesday is Election Day, with San Francisco voters eligible to decide on 11 propositions, many of which are, in one form or another, about the ripple effects created by the technology industryâ€™s rapid growth in the city.On one hand, San Francisco has benefited greatly from the large number of tech start-ups that have set up shop in town, including Airbnb, Lyft, Pinterest and Uber. Their growth has spurred job creation, property development and new businesses to feed and provide other services to the tech workers.But the boom has also made living in San Francisco unaffordable for many, with skyrocketing housing prices and $4 pieces of toast, and there has been a backlash. Other cities such as Seattle are now looking at San Francisco as a cautionary tale rather than as a shining model.Seven of the propositions on the San Francisco ballot are related to the tech industry and housing costs, Conor Dougherty writes. The most prominent initiative is Proposition F, intended to reduce the supply of short-term home rentals and widely seen as a reaction to Airbnb, the online lodging service.Few think the proposition will pass; Airbnb has been spending to fight the measure, producing a tone-deaf series of ads that the company later apologized for. But the initiative, and others like it, all point to the question that residents living through the tech boom keep asking themselves: Whither San Francisco?
