Q. I have a mobile phone plan. How do I know when I get close to my limits for text messaging, plus my voice and data allowance?A. Once you create a user name and password for the site, you should be able to check your current usage levels on your wireless carrier’s website or through its own smartphone app. You should see your current usage statistics, payment due date and other account information — and possibly the chance to sign up for usage alerts to warn you when your allowance is running out.Depending on your smartphone, you may also see a usage meter for cellular data and talk time in the device’s settings, but you may have to manually reset it at the start of each billing period to get an accurate reading.The four major national wireless carriers — AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless — also offer numbers you can dial on the phone’s keypad to get a text message back with your current usage statistics. For example, on AT&T, open the phone’s keypad and dial *3282# (more easily remembered as *DATA#) to get a free text message back with your current usage statistics; dialing *3286# (or *DATO#) gets the information in Spanish. To get your remaining AT&T voice minutes for the billing period, call *646# (or *MIN#) for English and *876# (or *USO#) for Spanish.With a Sprint account, text the word USAGE to 1311 to check your meter. Both the query and response messages are free.On T-Mobile, dial #646# (or #MIN#) to check your voice minutes, #674# (or #MSG#) to see how many text messages you have sent and #932# (or #WEB#) to get the details on your data usage.With a Verizon Wireless account, dial #646 (or #MIN) on the phone to get a text message back with your voice-minutes information. If you stay on the line after dialing, you can hear your current usage announced, and get further options to hear your text and data usage as well. You can also check your text and data meter by dialing #3282 (or #DATA), which send the information back as a free text message.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
