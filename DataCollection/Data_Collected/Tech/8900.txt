It’s the season for tech events and conferences.Late last month, the virtualization company VMware held its giant conference in San Francisco. Last week, Apple hosted a product event in San Francisco to introduce its newest iPhones, iPads and Apple TV. This week, it’s the turn of Salesforce, the cloud computing software company, to clog up the city’s streets with its huge Dreamforce conference, which our tech reporter Quentin Hardy will be watching. Stay tuned.In the meantime, the world of security start-ups is becoming ever more sophisticated. Consider iSight Partners, a young company based in Chantilly, Va., which may have gathered together the largest private team of experts in a nascent business called threat intelligence. Nicole Perlroth recently visited the cyber intelligence firm to find out how the operation works.Then there’s CloudFlare, a San Francisco-based start-up that helps manage Internet traffic and keep it secure, which is pioneering a novel business model in China called “virtual joint venture.” CloudFlare is working together with Baidu, one of China’s largest Internet companies. Under their arrangement, writes Paul Mozur, CloudFlare has essentially transferred some of its intellectual property and given up local control in order to operate the joint service with Baidu. It’s a model that may gain momentum as other American tech companies look to grow in China’s politically sensitive tech industry.
