It has been said before but it bears repeating: Twitter’s biggest problem is Twitter.When the social media site was created, its founders thought it could be the water cooler or town hall for the world. It was a nice thought. What they probably never anticipated was that Twitter would become a meeting place for all sorts of people you would never want to meet at the water cooler.Even in its early days, tech writers used Twitter to call one another out about their coverage — who got what story first and why they got it all wrong. Was it juvenile? Of course. But it was usually harmless.What happens on Twitter today, critics would argue, isn’t so harmless. From racist trolls to terrorist recruiting to gaslighting — today’s popular way to describe lying so often that people can’t quite tell the truth anymore — Twitter has some serious issues.But give Twitter credit for one thing: Its executives realize they have a problem. On Tuesday, the company outlined new ways to report or hide offensive content.AdvertisementIn related news, Google said on Monday that it planned to crack down on fake news sites that rely on its AdSense advertising network to turn fabrication into a profit-making venture.That both companies are taking a hard look at how their services are being misused shined a harsh light on Facebook, where Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, dismissed the company’s problem with fake news posts, despite the reported misgivings of some of his own employees. But by late Monday night, Facebook did add language to the guidelines of its ad network spelling out that fake news sites were barred from the ad network. To be clear, that doesn’t mean they’ll disappear from Facebook.AdvertisementMr. Zuckerberg must run in different Facebook circles than the rest of us.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
