We interrupt your video stream of a man climbing the Trump Tower in Manhattan to bring you this message: Amazon is being a lot more clever with its oddball drone delivery project than you might think.In this week’s State of the Art column, Farhad Manjoo takes a hard look at what Amazon may be trying to accomplish with its drones.Amazon’s tiny aircraft were dismissed by many as a media stunt when they were first shown on “60 Minutes” in 2013. But Amazon has kept at it, and with good reason, Farhad writes. One of the online retailer’s biggest problems is its distribution system, which is essentially maxed out.Much of that Amazon can’t do much to fix (though it is trying). But drones could extend the delivery system beyond what it currently is. How exactly the company might do that is hard to say.A crazy idea? Perhaps. But then again, taking on retailing giants like Walmart and Barnes & Noble with a little online bookstore was also once a little crazy.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
