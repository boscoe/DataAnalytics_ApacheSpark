Q. How do I make my iPhone pictures appear on the map in the Photos app?A. The iOS Photos app automatically groups pictures you take into a Places album — as long as you have the location services feature enabled on your phone when you are snapping your shots. The Photos software reads the GPS information embedded in each picture file to sort images, and then displays the images accordingly on a map within the app.To see the map, open the Photos app, tap Albums, scroll to Places and open it. Tap the Map button at the top to see the pictures plotted on a map, or tap Grid to see them as thumbnails listed by location.One way to make sure your future photos appear on the map is to make sure the phone’s Location Services function is on when you take the pictures. Open the Settings icon on the Home screen, tap Privacy and select Locations Services to toggle the GPS function on or off. In the list of apps below, make sure the Camera app (or whichever app you use to take pictures) has permission to use your location.If you have a pile of untagged photos on your phone and still want to put them on the map, you can manually tag then with an approximate location using free or inexpensive third-party iOS apps like Mappr or the paid version of Photo Investigator. Once you save the edited version back to the Photos app, you should see the image in your Places album and displayed on the map.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
