Although I do not intend to upgrade to Windows 10 anytime soon, I have heard that the new system does not include WMC. Is this really true, and what are the alternatives?A. Microsoft stopped developing Windows Media Center some time ago and did not even include it with Windows 8 in 2012, though the software was available separately.A Microsoft representative said last year that Windows Media Center would not be included the Windows 10 operating system due to “decreased usage.” If you run Microsoft’s Compatibility Report software on a Windows 7 system, you will also see a message informing you that Windows Media Center does not work with Windows 10 and will be removed during the upgrade process.For those upgrading Windows 7 and Windows 8 systems, Microsoft says it does provide a Windows DVD Player program as a free download, which may not satisfy people who also used Windows Media Center for recording TV shows, listening to music and working with digital photos. For those who do not mind tinkering, do-it-yourself instructions for finagling Windows Media Center onto a Windows 10 PC can be easily found online, but success with the project may vary.If you used Windows Media Center only for playing DVD movies and music, you can find alternatives if you upgrade to Windows 10 and do not have a serious loyalty to the old software. For example, VideoLAN’s VLC media player can play many types of video and audio files. If you want more of a “media center” experience, programs like Kodi, MediaPortal or Plex may offer a range of functions similar to the old, discontinued Microsoft software.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
