The internet giant struggled for more than a decade to find a winning strategy. Now it is giving up. On Tuesday, Verizon officially acquired the company for a fraction of what it was worth in 2000. The business will be formally combined with Verizon’s AOL unit, with many expected to lose their jobs.

Yahoo’s value lies in its billion monthly users, more than any site other than Google and Facebook. But over the last decade it has lost advertising revenue and search traffic to those same companies. By combining Yahoo with its AOL unit, Verizon hopes to create a stronger competitor.

Yahoo’s revenue has been sluggish for years. Marissa Mayer, hired as chief executive in 2012, managed to post some growth in hot categories like mobile and video advertising, but that did not offset weakness in the display and search ads that are the company’s bread and butter. With the completion of the Verizon merger, Ms. Mayer resigned from her position.

Although investors place little value on Yahoo’s business, the company owns 15 percent of Alibaba, worth about $48 billion. Investors pressured Yahoo to find a way to separate the Alibaba stake from the rest of Yahoo. The Verizon deal does that, leaving Yahoo shareholders with an investment company that holds the Alibaba stock and shares in Yahoo Japan.
