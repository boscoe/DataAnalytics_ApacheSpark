Like other photo-editing programs, Apple’s Photos for OS X can use third-party extensions to add advanced editing tools and utilities to the software. For example, certain Photos extensions can supply filters, borders, watermarks and special effects to a photo when you have it open in the program’s Edit mode.You can find and buy Photos extensions in the Mac App Store. Prices range from free to about $25, and your purchases get billed to the credit card you have on file with Apple for iOS and App Store downloads.To browse the available Photos extensions, go to the Apple Menu in the top-left corner of the Mac and choose App Store. You can also click the blue Mac App Store icon in the desktop Dock. When the Mac App Store window opens, search for “photos extensions” to see the offerings. Click an extension icon to read more about it, and click the price or GET button to download it.Once you have downloaded the extensions you want, open the Mac’s System Preferences by selecting the option under the Apple Menu, or by clicking the System Preferences icon in the Dock. In the System Preferences box, click Extensions. On the left side of the box, select Photos and turn on the checkboxes next to the extensions listed on the right side.Now, when you have a picture open in the Edit window, the programs you have just added will be available in the Extensions menu. Choose the extension you want to use to apply its effects to the picture open on your screen.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
