Democrats and Republicans alike are worried about the outcome.But there are other worries, too, among them whether hackers are likely to disrupt the voting process, making an already circuslike campaign season even more of a three-ring spectacle.David Sanger, national security correspondent for The New York Times, has written on the concerns of federal and state officials going into the election, in particular focusing on five possible ways hackers may be looking to interfere with the election.Those methods include hackers penetrating voter registration rolls and making their own alterations; taking down websites with an attack of so much data that voters cannot get information about their polling places, as well as directly making mischief with voting machines.Some of this may seem paranoid, but it has already been a strange few months of online security snafus related to the election.Last month, the Obama administration alleged the Russian government was trying to influence the election by stealing and disclosing emails from the Democratic National Committee. Among the email accounts hacked was that of John D. Podesta, the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton.So, an overabundance of caution? Perhaps. But this year, maybe itâ€™s not too much.Advertisement
