The pop musician Will.i.am has started moonlighting as a technology entrepreneur. Now he has an experienced technology executive to help him run his new wearable start-up, i.am+.The company on Thursday announced that Phil Molyneux, who most recently was president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics in the United States, will take on the same role at i.am+, a 60-person start-up based in Los Angeles. Mr. Molyneux will report to Will.i.am, the company’s co-founder and chief executive.The company has released one product, a $399 wristband device called Puls, for which it has done a limited rollout. Unlike most of the smart bracelets on the market, which are primarily fitness trackers, Puls has a built-in cellphone and does not require a conventional handset to make calls and access the Internet.In an interview, Mr. Molyneux said the company envisioned a family of wearable products merging fashion and technology, all based on a common operating system that it developed, AneedA, which uses Google’s Android software. Unlike the smartphone business, the wearables market is young and full of smaller companies like Fitbit that are garnering meaningful sales.They dynamics of the business could change soon with the arrival of the Apple Watch. Apple is expected to share further details about the product at an event on March 9. Mr. Molyneux predicted that Apple’s product and marketing would be like the rising tide that lifts others’ boats.“It’s significant, of course,” he said. “The launch of the Apple Watch will bring a whole new consumer focus to the wearables area and tethered devices.”Mr. Molyneux, who worked for Sony for 28 years in a variety of roles, said there was no comparison between the agility of his new and old employers. “Their ability too innovate and pivot in microseconds is something bigger companies can’t do,” he said.
