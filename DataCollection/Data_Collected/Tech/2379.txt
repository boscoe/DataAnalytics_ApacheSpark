Apple continues to make billions of dollars from mobile apps sold in its App Store. The company said on Thursday that in 2014, billings from app sales rose 50 percent from the previous year, which results in roughly $15 billion in revenue for app developers and a $4.5 billion cut for Apple.Apple takes a 30-percent cut of each app sale made in its App Store. The $4.5 billion sum is a tiny sliver for Apple, which makes more than $180 billion in annual sales. But it is still a considerable sum for providing a storefront for developers to sell their apps.By comparison, Google’s Android is the largest mobile operating system in the world, but its app store, Google Play, generates far less money than Apple’s. That’s partly because Apple’s iPhone customers are wealthier and spend more money than people who own Android phones. App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks mobile app sales, said that in the third quarter of 2014, Apple’s App Store revenue was 60 percent higher than revenue generated from Google Play.App Annie said it had not yet released numbers for annual sales for Google Play. In June 2014, Google said it had paid out $5 billion to developers in the previous 12 months. Gina Johnson, a Google spokeswoman, said the company did not have newer statistics to share. Apple said its App Store serves 1.4 million apps for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices. Google Play hosts 1.72 million apps, according to App Annie.A version of this article appears in print on 01/12/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: App Store Sales Rose 50% in '14.
