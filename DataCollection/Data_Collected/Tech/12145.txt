Apple vs. the F.B.I. is quickly becoming a fight only a lawyer could love.In case you missed it, investigators want Apple’s help breaking into an iPhone that belonged to one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Apple says no way, since it would have to create new software to do this and would essentially be hacking its own products.The basis of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s demand is a 1789 law called the All Writs Act. The government has used this very old law in the past to obtain customer information from Apple, but the company contended in a court filing Thursday that “Congress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the F.B.I.”If you do not find discussions of 1789 law all that fascinating, there is also a Bill of Rights discussion. Apple contends that its First and Fifth Amendment rights are being violated by a court order supporting the F.B.I.How’s that? Apple says that courts often consider software code to be speech under the protection of the First Amendment, and compelling Apple to write code would amount to compelling speech. Also, Apple says last week’s court order amounts to “arbitrary deprivation of [its] liberty by government.” That’s covered in the Fifth Amendment.Next, a number of tech companies are expected to file court briefs in support of Apple.So fasten your seatbelts. Silicon Valley — which has lots of money and lawyers — is throwing down with the Justice Department, which has lots of clout and lawyers.It is not clear yet if the industry’s lobbyists have been deployed en masse to influence lawmakers on Capitol Hill.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
