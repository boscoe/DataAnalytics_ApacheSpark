The video game industry has been in flux for years, evolving from people buying shrink-wrapped boxes of games that are played mainly on personal computers and consoles like the PlayStation and Xbox, to using digital downloads and online and mobile games.This holiday season, the digital tipping point for the games industry is more evident than ever, writes Nick Wingfield. That’s clear from the dismal  sales numbers of games sold through physical retailers, even as big titles set new sales records and consoles are flying off the shelves. The disparity is the result of digital downloads of games taking off, a move that has plenty of implications for many parts of the business.

And it is likely that game publishers may increasingly look to digital avenues for distribution.Looked at another way: It’s yet another disruption in the always disrupted technology industry.
