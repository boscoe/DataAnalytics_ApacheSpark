 Are you proud of a particular moment when you used a GIF to express your emotions? Maybe you were sad about something.Or contemplating what to watch on Netflix. Maybe you were trying unsuccessfully to wink at someone. (Or had something in your eye.) Whatever the case may be...
Tell us how you used a GIF to convey your emotions in an email, text or on social media, and why that moment stands out. It can be funny, serious, sarcastic or sad. Submissions should be suitable for a family newspaper and be kept to 400 words or less.
