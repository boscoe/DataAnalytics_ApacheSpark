Except when it’s not.If there is one smart takeaway in the planned merger of AT&T and Time Warner, as Farhad Manjoo writes, it is that no one is quite sure how, exactly, this thing will work out.People in the executive suites of the two companies may take issue with that, of course. The plan appears to be that by bringing the two companies together, you’ll have one giant company that can do lots of things better: more money to develop content and more money to build the next generation of networks that can deliver that content.Synergy. Leverage. Scale. You pick the business cliché, and people who think this merger is a great idea are probably using it to explain why it will work.But big media mergers are risky. And they often represent one of two things: either a business cycle is entering its peak, or an old way of business is slowly dying and the only way to make money from it is by getting so big that you can squeeze out money here and there.As Brian Wieser, an analyst at the Pivotal Research Group, told Farhad: “This appears to be about empire sustenance rather than economic efficiency.”Advertisement
