In a blog post on Monday, Mr. Robbins said the president and chief operating officer, Gary Moore, and president of development and sales, Rob Lloyd, would leave Cisco on July 25. Mr. Robbins, a 17-year veteran of the networking communications company, will succeed John Chambers as chief a day later. “To drive our continued success and leadership, our organization structure must always evolve as the market changes,” Mr. Robbins said in the post. He praised Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Moore for their “tremendous leadership.” Mr. Lloyd has been with Cisco for 21 years and Mr. Moore for 14 years. Mr. Robbins said he would announce his organizational structure and leadership team in the next two weeks. Advertisement
