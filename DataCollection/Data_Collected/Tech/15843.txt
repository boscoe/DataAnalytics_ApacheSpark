Q. Is it possible to sign a PDF using an iPad?A. With an update to the Mail app in last year’s iOS 9 software, Apple added a Markup tool for annotating PDF files sent as attachments. If you are not sending the documents by email, third-party apps like Adobe Acrobat Reader, Evernote and many others also let you sign and annotate PDF files on iOS devices and other platforms (like Android).If you need to sign a PDF file attached to a Mail message, first press and hold the attachment icon until the box of sharing options appears on the screen. If you are sending the attachment yourself, tap the Markup icon. If you have been sent the PDF and merely want to digitally sign it and return it to the sender, tap the Markup and Reply icon. A copy of the file will appear on the screen.Once you enter Markup mode, a new toolbar appears along the bottom of the PDF file. By tapping the various tools, you can write or draw on the document, zoom in on sections, type in text — or add a digital version of your signature to drag into place on the appropriate line of a form.To add your John (or Jane) Hancock to the file, tap the Signature icon near the middle of the toolbar. In the box that appears, sign your name with your fingertip, Apple Pencil or other compatible iPad stylus. When you have finished, your signature will appear in a floating box on the screen that you can drag into place on the document. Tap the Done button in the corner of the window when you have finished annotating the file and want to send it along in its updated state.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
