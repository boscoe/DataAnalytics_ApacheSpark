PayPal, the digital payment company, posted a 29 percent jump in profit and a 14 percent revenue increase on Wednesday in its first financial report to investors since it was spun out of eBay in July.The company reported a profit of $301 million, or 25 cents a share, for the third quarter. Sales totaled $2.26 billion, slightly lower than the $2.27 billion projected by analysts, according to Bloomberg data.PayPal also said it had 173 million active user accounts, up from the 157 million the company reported in the same quarter a year earlier.“We are operating in a time when change is sweeping through the financial services industry, driven by the rise of mobile technology and the acceleration of money becoming digital,” Daniel H. Schulman, chief executive of PayPal, said in a statement.AdvertisementThe results are a kind of litmus test for the more than 16-year-old PayPal, as it works to prove it can be a thriving stand-alone company after years of being attached to eBay.

Or do they have their sights set on much bigger goals, potentially competing with Visa and MasterCard?”PayPal has spent the last few years remaking itself for a world that has shifted from desktop computers to smartphones. The company has also tried to simplify paying for things on mobile devices, a task that many online merchants and retailers have struggled to handle.PayPal has also diversified into other areas. On Tuesday at the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Mr. Schulman said the company had extended more than $1 billion to more than 60,000 small businesses through PayPal Working Capital, the company’s cash advance program aimed at small merchant sellers.Other commerce upstarts that have popped up in the last five years, like Stripe and Square, have focused particularly on mobile devices, an attempt to outflank PayPal.But PayPal has taken steps in that direction, too. In 2013, it acquired Braintree, a mobile payments processor. Along with Braintree came Venmo, a peer-to-peer money transfer app that is popular with young users.A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: PayPal Shines in First Report as an Independent Company.
