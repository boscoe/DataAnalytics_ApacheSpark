Q. How do I add a photo to someone’s address file directly in my iPhone’s Contacts app?A. Open the Contacts app on your iPhone and scroll through the list until you find the person you want to use. Tap the person’s name to open the contact file and then tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the screen. Tap the Add Photo link next to the person’s name.A menu appears giving you the choice of Take Photo or Choose Photo. If you are with the contact in question at the moment, tap Take Photo to call up the iPhone’s camera and snap a picture to use right there. Or select Choose Photo to go to the iPhone’s Photos app, where you can browse for a suitable image.After you tap a picture to use with the contact, you can move and scale the image by pinching, zooming and dragging your fingers on the screen so the subject’s face is prominently displayed within the profile photo area. When you are satisfied with the position of the photo, tap Choose to add it to the contact file.If you later want to delete or change the photo for that contact, call up the file again and tap the Edit button in the corner. Next, tap the smaller Edit button under the photo to get to a menu of options like Take Photo, Choose Photo, Edit Photo or Delete Photo.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
