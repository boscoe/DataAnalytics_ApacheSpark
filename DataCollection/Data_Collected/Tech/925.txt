Even as technology moguls including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet’s Larry Page try to connect emerging countries to the web through ambitious global efforts, there is an Internet access problem closer to home.Across the United States, the digital divide remains deep and unyielding. New research is now revealing more of the fallout from that divide.In a report out on Tuesday, Common Sense Media, a nonprofit children’s advocacy and media ratings group in San Francisco, found that many teenagers from low-income households encounter disadvantages in doing homework compared with those in middle-income and high-income homes because fewer of the low-income youths own laptops, desktops and tablets. Some of the lower-income teenagers use mostly smartphones, which can be difficult for doing schoolwork, such as typing an essay. Many teenagers from lower-income families also have only dial-up web access, compared with higher-income youths, who have higher-speed Internet, writes Natasha Singer. The study is a reminder of the digital problems in our own backyard, which have been well documented in other papers such as a home broadband report in 2013 by the Pew Research Center. Among the statistics from the Pew report were that 54 percent of those making less than $30,000 a year had broadband, compared with 88 percent of those making more than $75,000. The survey also said 53 percent of Hispanics and 64 percent of blacks in the United States had high-speed Internet at home, versus 74 percent of whites.
