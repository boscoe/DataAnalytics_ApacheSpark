Greylock, which was an early investor in Facebook and LinkedIn, now has $3.5 billion in assets under management.The new fund shows how resilient the venture capital industry has been this year despite worries that the rich billion-dollar-plus valuations of many private companies, known as unicorns, would crash and drag down start-up investors.Yet in the first three quarters of this year, venture firms have raised $32.4 billion, putting 2016 on pace to be one of the strongest years in terms of fund-raising since 2000, according to a report from the research firm PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association. In 2000, the venture industry raised $101.4 billion, according to the association.Venture firms have raised six new funds of $1 billion or more so far this year, including Technology Crossover Ventures with a $2.5 billion fund and Andreessen Horowitz with a $1.6 billion fund. The six funds account for 26 percent of the total capital raised, according to PitchBook and the association.The influx of capital is a potential lift for start-ups that need money, but it could make it harder for venture firms to deliver high returns down the road. The report from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association notes that the number of start-ups getting funded has declined for five straight quarters, even as investors have more money to put to work. With fewer investment opportunities, venture firms may end up overpaying for pieces of private companies.Greylock tends to invest in companies early in their life cycles, a strategy that Mr. Slavet said helps investors earn higher returns when there is a lot of capital in the system.The firm is exploring new places to invest its money. Greylock is known for investments in consumer and business software companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Workday and Airbnb. While it will continue to invest in those areas, it is also working on investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and robotics.“Lots of investors are thinking that certain trends have become more mature and that emerging areas are exciting but unclear,” Mr. Slavet said.Advertisement
