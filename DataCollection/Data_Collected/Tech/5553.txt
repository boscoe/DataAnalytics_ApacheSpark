Google seems to have a new strategy in Europe: If you don’t like the message, try to befriend the messengers.Less than two weeks after the European Commission filed antitrust charges against Google for abusing its dominant position in online search, the company said it would spend 150 million euros, or $165 million, over the next three years to help European publishers and newspapers adapt to the digital world.And by announcing the plan, the Digital News Initiative, Google was trying to assuage fears from many European newspapers, including Axel Springer of Germany, that the search giant held too much control over how Europeans access online content, analysts said. Google has a roughly 90 percent market share across the 28-member bloc, more than its stake in the American market.The creation of Google’s program also comes before new potential problems for the company in Europe, including potential changes to Europe’s copyright rules. The proposals, which will be announced on May 6, could force Google and other news aggregators to pay to use online content provided by European publishers.Just like in the United States, many European newspapers have struggled to change their business models, as print advertising continues to stumble and publishers become increasingly reliant on online traffic, particularly from smartphones. The $164 million fund will allow publishers to bid for grants to create new forms of digital journalism, according to the search giant. Google also said that it would offer training in digital skills for European journalists and help newspapers create products aimed at boosting online revenue.As part of the new program, Google said it would be initially working with The Guardian and The Financial Times in Britain, Die Zeit and FAZ in Germany, Les Echos in France, La Stampa in Italy and NRC Media in the Netherlands.“Over the years, Google’s relationship with news and the news industry has often been misunderstood,” Carlo D’Asaro Biondo, Google’s president of strategic partnerships in Europe, told a conference in London on Tuesday, who added that any European publisher could apply for grants. “We want to play our part in the common fight to find more sustainable models for news.”Google’s efforts to win over skeptical publishers, many of which rely heavily on the company’s news aggregation product to drive traffic to their websites, stands in contrast to its heavy-handed approach toward Spanish newspapers at the end of last year.In response to new Spanish rules that required Google and other online news aggregators to pay local publishers for the use of their online content, the search giant shut down its Google News Spain product in December. The company also barred any Spanish publisher from appearing in its global news aggregations services.Other European countries also have tried to force Google to compensate newspapers for including so-called snippets of online news in its search results. Not all the efforts, however, have proved successful.After Germany passed rules last year that allowed publishers to charge aggregating sites when their articles appeared online, Google removed many German organizations from its news product, which led to a sharp fall in online traffic to some newspapers’ sites.Axel Springer, which has talked openly about Google’s dominance, experienced a 40 percent decline in traffic coming from Google’s search results and an 80 percent drop in traffic from Google News, according to Mathias Döpfner, Axel Springer’s chief executive.In response, many of the Germany publishers backed down, agreeing to forgo any fees to be included in Google’s news aggregation service.The new fund for publishers mirrors a similar effort in France, where Google created a $65 million program in 2013 aimed at helping local publishers increase their online revenues. The International New York Times participated in that fund. The efforts by Google followed discussions by the French government to create a potential tax on search engines every time they used content from local media outlets.Mr. D’Asaro Biondo of Google said on Tuesday that the French program had led to a number of projects, including the creation of tablet and smartphone versions of the French newspaper Le Monde.“I can’t promise it will be smooth,” he said, in reference to the new digital initiative. “At Google, we know that innovation is never a linear process. It’s always messy and often happens in random ways.”
