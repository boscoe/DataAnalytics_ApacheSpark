Cute animals. Addictive jingles. Local sports stars acting awkwardly. These are some of the charming hallmarks of local television ads, and Google would like you to see more of them. In a note to customers who subscribe to Google’s Google Fiber Internet and television service in Kansas City, Kan. and Kansas City, Mo., the search giant said it would soon begin a trial of local TV ads that will be aimed at a viewer’s locality and viewing habits. A spokeswoman who confirmed the service said Google expected it to roll out in the coming weeks. The move, if it were widely adopted by rival cable companies, could represent a sea change in how television ads are viewed and sold. For starters, it would mean that people in the same city might see different ads while watching the same show. It could also change how ads are sold by giving advertisers more leeway over when ads are shown, to whom and how often — the same kinds of control they have when advertising online. Google’s trial — which for now is aimed only at customers in the Kansas City area, who can opt out of having their viewing history used for advertising purposes — will use ads that are targeted by geography and what kinds of shows they view most often. “Fiber TV ads will be digitally delivered in real time and can be matched based on geography, the type of program being shown (like sports or news), or viewing history,” Google said in a online forum for Google Fiber. “If you’re a local business in Kansas City, just as with digital ads, you’ll only pay for ads that have been shown, and can limit the number of times an ad is shown to a given TV.” Analysts had been expecting Google to start experimenting with targeted television ads from the moment it announced its Google Fiber Internet service, which is about 100 times faster than the standard broadband connection. The company makes about $60 billion in annual revenue based largely on its ability to mine its user information to deliver highly targeted ads. And, of course, the idea of using technology to fine-tune television ads has been around for decades. Cable companies are doing the same thing. Invidi Technologies, based in Princeton, N.J., makes software inside around 30 million United States cable boxes that can be used to target television ads based on age, gender, income, whether the viewer owns a dog or if their car lease is about to expire. Verizon, Dish, DirecTV and Comcast are all customers. “It is like direct mail for television,” said Michael Kubin, an executive vice president at Invidi. Nobody should expect Google to overtake television advertising anytime soon. While Google Fiber is growing fast in the Kansas City area, it is still only a sliver of the local television market. According to a recent report from research firm MoffettNathanson, in the fourth quarter Google Fiber had just under 30,000 video subscribers across Kansas City, Mo. and Kansas City, Kan. “To Cable & Satellite investors, Google Fiber is a bit like ebola: very scary and something to be taken seriously… but the numbers are very small, it gets more press attention than it deserves, and it ultimately doesn’t pose much of a risk (here in the U.S. at least),” the report said.Still, the move is another example of the increasingly blurred lines between television and the Internet. Over the last year, many entertainment companies like HBO have announced new services that allow “cord cutters” who do not have a traditional cable connection to watch their shows over the Internet. As shows become more like the Internet, it is natural for ads to follow the same path.  “It will matter less and less how you get your connection and more what you can see, when you want to see it,” said Jonathan Nelson, chief executive of Omnicom Digital. “Wherever there is people’s attention, that’s where we need to be.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/24/2015, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Google Plans an Experiment With Targeted Ads for Television.
