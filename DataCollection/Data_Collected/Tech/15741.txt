The desktop version of Google Calendar offers at least two ways to see different time zones at once when you are trying to schedule events. To add a time zone to your calendar alongside the one you normally use, click the gear-shaped Settings icon in the top-right corner of the Google Calendar window.On the Settings screen, next to “Your current time zone,” click “Show an additional time zone.” When the Additional Time Zone menu appears, select the time zone you want to use. You can also add a label like “NYC” or “Seoul” to clarify the display on your calendar. Click the Save button when finished. You should now see two columns of times along the left side of your calendar.If you need to juggle more than two time zones, you can add the optional World Clock widget to your calendar, which is available from Google Labs. Go back to the Settings icon in the upper-right corner of the Google Calendar window and choose Labs. On the Labs page, scroll down to World Clock and click the Enable button. Click the Save button.When the World Clock widget appears on the side of your Google Calendar window, click the Settings link underneath it and choose the time zones you want. Later, after you add events to the calendar, click an event to see what time it will happen across all your selected time zones in the World Clock widget.On a smartphone, you can use the world-clock function in your phone’s standard clock app to see multiple time zones. You can also add a third-party clock app or even look up compatible times on sites like World Clock Meeting Planner, World Time Buddy or World Time Server.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
