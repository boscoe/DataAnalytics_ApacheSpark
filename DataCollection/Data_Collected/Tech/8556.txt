Apple shipped enough units of its new smartwatch to nearly overtake market leader FitBit in the last quarter, according to analysts at International Data. Their report warns that traditional fitness bands may be losing popularity to smartwatches and other devices that offer more features. Apple has not revealed how many watches it has sold. Many analysts estimated Apple sold two million to three million watches during the quarter that ended in June. I.D.C. says it starts with Apple’s financial reports but also gathers data from suppliers, distributors and consumers to estimate the number of units shipped — not retail sales. Also Thursday, Apple announced a new product event for Sept. 9 in San Francisco, where it is expected to show off new iPhones and other devices. Advertisement
