BEIJING — Uber, the ride-hailing service, has struck a deal with China Yongda Automobiles Services Holdings, a Chinese luxury auto dealer, to provide discounts and financing for drivers of Uber cars.Under the agreement, Yongda will provide Uber’s partners — transportation firms and independent drivers — discounts on new car purchases, finance and after-sales service. Uber contracts with independent drivers and livery services in 55 countries to provide transportation hailed via its smartphone app.The deal comes as the fast-growing San Francisco-based company faces intensifying competition in its efforts to expand in the potentially lucrative Chinese market. Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache — two richly-funded startups that share roughly 99 percent of the ride-hailing market in China — recently merged in a $6 billion tie-up.Yongda said that the two companies have already rolled out purchase incentives on models from Audis and Volkswagens.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
