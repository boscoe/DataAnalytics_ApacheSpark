With the single swoop of a $1 billion purchase of Merge Healthcare, Watson would be digesting medical images to help doctors make diagnoses. As Steve Lohr reports, images like CAT scans, X-rays and mammograms, IBM researchers estimate, represent about 90 percent of all medical data today.

That would surely be no small feat.In entirely separate — but also potentially future-casting — news, the Pew Research Center released a study about the friendships teenagers have online.
