Be it by land, air or sea, there is no shortage of ways to get around New York.So what room is there in for an app like Via, a ride-sharing app for New Yorkers that offers a service similar to Uber or Lyft, but with only a fraction of the market share?Daniel Ramot, Via’s co-founder and chief executive, believes there is more than enough room to go around. To that end, his company said on Thursday that it had just raised $27 million in venture funding from a handful of investors, with an aim to expand the service far beyond the confines of Manhattan.Every weekday, from 6:45 a.m. to 9 p.m., Via will pick you up and drive you anywhere between 32nd and 110th Streets in Manhattan for a fixed cost — $7 plus tax per ride, or $5 plus tax if you pay in advance. You’re also able to pay for Via with pretax commuter options, like WageWorks or Commuter Check.This is cheap for a private car service, especially if you’re riding from one end of Manhattan to the other. Via keeps costs down by grouping passengers together in an S.U.V., and it does the heavy lifting of matching you with other users who need a ride in the same direction.That, as my colleague Jonah Bromwich recently wrote, gives Via a more communal feel than riding solo in an Uber, or perhaps a more friendly vibe than a crowded New York City subway car in the middle of summer.But car-pooling is also an area in which ride-hailing titans like Uber and Lyft have shown increasing interest over the past year. And to some observers, it could be where the future of both companies lies.Uber offers its UberPool service to riders who are willing to pick up one or two extra passengers traveling in the same direction in exchange for a discount. Lyft, which has long toyed with long-distance ride-sharing, offers the same service with its Lyft Line product.Both companies have raised billions of dollars in venture capital, and are expanding across the world at a breakneck pace.Via remains undeterred. The company plans to use the new round of funding to expand into additional markets, Mr. Ramot said, as well as continue to recruit new talent.
