Uber, the ride-hailing service, agreed on Thursday to use digital maps provided by the Dutch technology company TomTom in its smartphone applications.The move is the latest foray into digital mapping for Uber, which had offered to buy Nokia’s mapping business for around $3 billion early this year but lost out on the deal to a consortium of German automakers.Uber, which is increasingly using digital maps to run its fast-expanding global operation, has also acquired a portion of Microsoft’s map technology and hired a number of engineers from Microsoft’s mapping team.As part of the latest deal, Uber will license TomTom’s mapping and traffic management services in the more than 300 cities where it operates. Uber did not say how much it would pay for the licensing rights.The agreement represents a lift for TomTom, which also provides the core mapping services used in Apple’s Maps app, as well as in its own mapping products.TomTom has faced stiff competition from the likes of Google Maps and Nokia’s former mapping unit, called Here, which is now owned by Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler.Both of those competitors have greater financial resources to invest in their mapping services, though analysts said the Dutch company could benefit as people who do not want to rely on Google or the German carmakers look for alternatives.That appears to be the case with Uber, which has shown increased interest in developing its own mapping operations despite maintaining close ties to Google. In February, for instance, Uber announced plans to open a research and development center in Pittsburgh, where the company said it would study autonomous cars.
