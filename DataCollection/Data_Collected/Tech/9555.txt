I am considering buying a Moto G4 Plus but cannot find information on whether (or how to) sync photos from the Moto to my Apple devices and/or my Mac Pro. Is it possible to do this? If so, how?A. Google Photos may be one simple solution for all the devices involved. If it is not there already, install the app on the Android phone and have it automatically back up your images online to your Google Photos account, where you can also see and download them to the Mac from a web browser. You can install the Google Photos app for iOS on your Apple devices to see the photos there and add any new pictures taken with your iOS devices to your Google Photos library.This approach can also work with other file- and photo-sharing apps that are compatible with Android, iOS and OS X/macOS and have an automatic online backup option, like Flickr, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive. The Google Play store has a number of photo- and file-syncing utilities available that can move the photos, too.If you prefer the old-fashioned approach to copying photos to the computer, you can use the USB cable that came with your phone to connect it to the Mac. The computer’s Photos program may open up and offer to import the photos on the phone for you (as it would with any compatible camera).You can also install Google’s free Android File Transfer software for the Mac. Once you install the program, you can use it to see the contents of the Moto and copy the photos over to the Mac. (AirDroid is one of the many apps that does the same thing over a wireless connection.) When you have the pictures on the Mac, you can share them with your other Apple devices through iCloud Photo Sharing or another online service.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
