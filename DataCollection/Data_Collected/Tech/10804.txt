Since the presidential election, fake news has been in the spotlight for how its spread online may have influenced the American electorate. So what is it like to be one of the fighters of this scourge?David Streitfeld, a technology reporter for The New York Times, recently found out when he visited the San Diego offices of Snopes, a website that is a longstanding debunker of misinformation. In recent weeks, Snopes’s role in battling false stories has grown because it partnered with Facebook, which is trying to limit the dissemination of fake stories across its social network partly by working more closely with fact checkers.At first glance, it’s hard to tell that Snopes is one of the chief weapons against fake information, David reports. The offices of the website do not look like much — no sign outside, junk food inside.And for their efforts, the people who work at and run Snopes are not exactly rewarded. Instead, the group is facing its own rising tide of fake news about things like how Snopes is funded, as well as personal attacks by critics who say Snopes is part of a left-wing media conspiracy.David found something else about Snopes in his reporting: The people who work there are persistent. Brooke Binkowski, Snopes’s managing editor, said she has no plans to back down from fact-checking what is real and what is not, especially in an era when misinformation is rampant and rationality seems to have fallen out of the window.“Not to be ideological or Pollyannish, but you have to believe this work makes a difference,” Ms. Binkowski told David. “Otherwise you’d just go back to bed and drink.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
