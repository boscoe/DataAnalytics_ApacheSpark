Microsoft began to roll out the Windows 10 Anniversary Update in early August, so if you have Windows 10 installed on your computer, the new software may already be there — or waiting to download and install, if you use a metered connection or have not been online much. The Start menu and a few other system elements look a bit different in the Anniversary Update, but if you do not know what to look for, you can quickly check to confirm your version.Press the Windows and R keys on the keyboard to call up the Run box. Type in “winver” (without quotation marks) and press the Enter key. If you see “Version 1607” listed, you have the Anniversary Update already installed by way of the Automatic Updates setting in the system’s Windows Update tool.If you do not have the Anniversary Update, open the Start menu and go to Settings, then open Updates & Security and select Windows Update. Click or tap the Check for Updates button. The Anniversary Update, security patches and other software for your PC should begin to download. Follow the steps onscreen to install the update.If you do not want to install the Anniversary Update through Windows Update, Microsoft also has a way for you to download the software as an ISO image file that you can burn to a disc and use for installing the software. To do that, go through the steps above to get to the Windows Update box. Instead of selecting Check for Updates, click the Learn More link in the box to go to the page on Microsoft’s site where you can download the software.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
