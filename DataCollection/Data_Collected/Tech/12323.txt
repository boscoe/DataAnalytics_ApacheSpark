AdvertisementSupported byBy Mark ScottFacebook moved to change its relationship status with the British tax authorities on Friday.The company announced that it would soon alter how it paid tax in Britain, potentially leading to the company paying millions of dollars more on its operations in the country.The move comes in the face of growing anger across Europe about American technology giants’ aggressive accounting practices.Google is facing its own issues over tax across the 28-member bloc, as French and Italian authorities investigate, while Apple, whose international operations are run from low-tax Ireland, is at the center of a lengthy inquiry by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, about whether it received a preferential — and potentially illegal — tax deal from the Irish authorities. Apple and the Irish government deny any wrongdoing.As part of Facebook’s new tax structure, the company said it would report sales linked to its British operations, primarily from digital advertising, through its local subsidiary, instead of booking its British revenues through its Irish unit. Facebook’s international headquarters are in Dublin.The change means the company will pay taxes in Britain on its local sales, as opposed to the current structure, in which Facebook primarily pays taxes through its Irish operation. The new structure will take effect in early April, according to the company.“U.K. sales made directly by our U.K. team will be booked in the U.K., not Ireland,” Lena Pietsch, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement on Friday. “Facebook U.K. will then record the revenue from these sales.”While Facebook did not disclose how much more British tax it would pay, it is likely the company will pay significantly more than it currently does on its operations in Britain.In 2014, the latest year for which records are available, Facebook paid a mere $6,100 in British corporation tax, or slightly less than the average British worker paid in income tax.From 2008 to 2014, it paid a combined $1.2 million in taxes to the British government, while recording a $76.5 million loss over the same period, according to DueDil, a data research company.That compares with $16.2 million in taxes that Facebook paid to Ireland’s tax authorities from 2008 to 2014, according to company filings analyzed by DueDil. Facebook had $3.6 million in pretax profit on its Irish operations over the period.The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.The company is not the first American tech company to alter its British tax structure. Last May, Amazon, which also is being investigated by the European Commission for its tax practices in Luxembourg, agreed to start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations.Facebook’s efforts to revamp its accounting structure in Britain follow changes in the country’s tax laws aimed at forcing companies to pay more tax on revenue generated there.The so-called Google tax — officially called the diverted profits tax — charges companies a 25 percent tax rate on profits on British revenue that the country’s tax authorities consider to be artificially moved overseas to avoid the British system.For many American tech companies, many of which use complicated tax structures through the likes of Ireland and Luxembourg to reduce their global tax burdens, Europe’s more aggressive stance is starting to bite.Along with its continuing negotiations with French and Italian tax authorities over potential back taxes, Google also recently agreed to pay an extra $183 million in taxes to the British government to cover the 10-year period through 2015.That figure, though, has been ridiculed by many British politicians as paltry compared with Google’s sizable operations in Britain. Google executives, however, have said that the company has complied with the country’s tax rules.Advertisement
