Marissa Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, and Maynard Webb, the chairman, discuss the company's decision to spinoff of its core Internet business, leaving the Alibaba stock in the old company.SAN FRANCISCO —  Even after the Internal Revenue Service refused in September to grant its blessing to Yahoo’s proposed tax-free spinoff of its $32 billion stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Marissa Mayer was determined to go forward with the deal. In late October, Ms. Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, told shareholders that the plan was on track, and the preparations were still continuing last month.Yet last week, when Yahoo’s board met to review the planned January spinoff, it decided to call off the deal. On Wednesday, the board announced that Yahoo would pursue a spinoff of its core Internet business instead, leaving the Alibaba stock in the old company.Although Yahoo’s board said it still believed that the company would prevail in any tax dispute, too many people on Wall Street were worried that challenging Uncle Sam over a possible $10 billion tax bill was just too big a risk, and those fears were depressing Yahoo’s stock price.“It was clear that it was causing a certain amount of market uncertainty,” Ms. Mayer said on Wednesday in a joint interview with the board chairman, Maynard Webb. “Audits and challenges can be raised over five to seven years.”AdvertisementMr. Webb said that after a day and a half of meetings, the nine-member board concluded that it could minimize the tax bill and achieve the same goal — separating the Alibaba investment from the rest of Yahoo — by reversing the direction of the transaction.Advertisement“We have been through God knows how many meetings and discussions on this all the way through the process,” he said. “We are convinced as a board that we are very undervalued today, and that the best way to unlock value is to separate out the Alibaba proceeds from the operating business and focus on the continued turnaround in the operating business.”
                As Yahoo’s chief executive, Ms. Mayer acquired more than 20 companies, but ultimately struggled to turn around the web pioneer.            The new Yahoo will be two companies: One will have a 15 percent stake in Alibaba, and the other will have everything else, including search, email, the Tumblr social media service, various sites like Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo’s $8.7 billion stake in Yahoo Japan.Ms. Mayer said she was “deeply committed” to Yahoo and planned to stay and run Yahoo’s core businesses. “I am committed to seeing it through,” she said.Mr. Webb said the board was “solidly behind Marissa” and her strategy.Many details of the new spinoff plan remain to be worked out, including who will run the Alibaba shell company and whether the new transaction will incur taxes.The change in approach comes at a cost: It will add at least a year and a host of complexities to what was already a difficult process.Mr. Webb said the board determined that another alternative — selling the company — was not the right choice.“If someone came in today and made offers on what the core or operating business is worth today, it would probably be a lowball offer,” he said.AdvertisementSome investors, notably the Starboard Value hedge fund, disagreed with the board’s belief that the company would have won a tax fight over the original plan.“The tax attorneys were telling them one thing, and the market was telling them something else,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Securities. “They decided to succumb to the shareholder pressure.”Starboard declined to comment.The new plan carries its own risks. Besides the additional delay, many of Yahoo’s contracts, including its agreements with bondholders and Yahoo Japan, will have to be renegotiated before the deal can proceed.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

            In addition to its stock ownership in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, Yahoo owns a cluster of operating units that are considered the core business of the company.        Separately, Yahoo said that one of its directors, Max Levchin, had resigned to focus on his duties as chief executive of Affirm, an online lending company. The board has no plans to replace him and will shrink to eight members.AdvertisementThe change in Yahoo’s strategy is the latest effort by Ms. Mayer to assuage shareholders.Ms. Mayer, who was hired in 2012 to turn around Yahoo, had planned to spin off the company’s 15 percent stake in Alibaba, bundled with a small-business-services unit, into a new company called Aabaco. She then planned to focus on improving the company’s core business, the sale of advertising that is shown to the roughly one billion users of Yahoo’s apps and websites.Ms. Mayer is now effectively back to square one. Yahoo’s core Internet operations are struggling, even though Ms. Mayer has made dozens of acquisitions, added original video and magazine-style content, and released new apps.The shares in Alibaba remain Yahoo’s most lucrative asset, with the company’s stake in Yahoo Japan a distant second. The rest of Yahoo is worth $3 billion to $8 billion, according to analysts’ estimates.Much of the back-and-forth over Yahoo’s strategy has had to do with taxes. Yahoo shareholders want to reap the gains that the company has made from its Alibaba stock, which it bought a decade ago for a relative pittance. A spinoff of Alibaba shares into a separate entity would have helped mitigate the capital gains tax bill, but the move became less appealing after the I.R.S. said it might crack down on such transactions.Starboard Value had been agitating for a sale of Yahoo’s core business instead, and it sent a letter to the company last month in which it laid out its reasons. In essence, Starboard said that while selling the core business would probably incur some capital gains taxes, those taxes would be lower and more certain than the $10 billion tax bill that could be due from the Alibaba spinoff if the I.R.S. successfully challenged the structure of the deal.Yahoo’s shift in strategy comes as Ms. Mayer and her husband, Zachary Bogue, are expecting the birth of twin daughters this month. She has said she plans to take a “limited time away” for maternity leave and will be “working throughout.”Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from New York.A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Yahoo Balks at Battle With Taxman by Spinning Off Core Business .
