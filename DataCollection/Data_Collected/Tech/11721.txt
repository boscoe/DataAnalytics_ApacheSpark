Jonathan Sallet, the general counsel at the Federal Communications Commission, is not the typical government lawyer.In two years as the F.C.C.’s general counsel, his job has been to defend the commission’s contentious policy that would classify Internet providers as utilities. These rules, generally known as net neutrality, are widely supported by Internet companies and activists and generally opposed by the companies that would be labeled as utilities.Mr. Sallet’s input also helped kill the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger last year. Now the cable industry is watching to see what the F.C.C. will do with the proposed merger between Charter and Time Warner Cable.The question is: What will Mr. Sallet say? Though analysts expect the merger to be approved, they also expect several requirements will be attached to the decision.
