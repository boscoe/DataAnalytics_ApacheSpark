Q. I know Windows 10 automatically performs software updates, but when I get a notification saying, “Updates were installed,” I’d like to know what exactly was installed. Is there a way to find out?A. As with earlier versions of Windows, Microsoft gives you a way to see what Windows Update has downloaded and installed on your PC. Open the Start menu, select Settings, choose Update & Security and then Windows Update. If you are partial to Cortana, the Windows 10 voice-activated assistant, you can also say “Open Windows Update settings” to open the same box, but trying to get to a more specific part of the system may result in a confused Cortana sending you out on a Bing search.One you are in the Windows Update settings box, select Advanced Options. On the Advanced Options screen select “View your update history” to see a list of patches that have been automatically installed on your computer. Tap or click the “Successfully installed on [date]” link under the name of each update to read more about what it is supposed to fix; select the More Info link in the box to go to Microsoft’s support site for further reading.At the top of the Update History box is the Uninstall Updates option. Tapping or clicking Uninstall Updates takes you to the Windows 10 Control Panel that displays a full list of installed updates from Microsoft and other software makers — and the chance to remove certain updates that may be causing more trouble than they are worth.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
