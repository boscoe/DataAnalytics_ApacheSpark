Ford said it was in talks with Tencent, maker of the popular WeChat messaging app, to develop messaging functions for the manufacturer’s cars in China. David Huang, a senior engineer who heads Ford’s Asia Pacific connected-services unit, said, “People want to stay connected, stay informed and stay entertained all the time, even when they’re driving.” Drivers would sync their phone to their car’s software system and control WeChat functions, chosen by Tencent and certified by Ford as safe, through voice commands or limited use of buttons. Yale Zhang, managing director of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said connectivity was a deciding factor for Chinese customers buying a car. “Those kind of things are the fundamental things people will consider,” he added. Many Chinese use WeChat’s free voice messaging feature instead of phone calls, holding up their smartphones like walkie-talkies as they speak, tap and listen to replies.

WeChat is China’s most prevalent chatting app, with about half a billion active monthly users.A version of this brief appears in print on February 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Tencent to Develop Chat App for Fords in China.
