Cook, Apple’s chief executive, who has evolved into one of the world’s most outspoken corporate executives and moved the once-secretive company repeatedly into the spotlight on social issues, write Katie Benner and Nicole Perlroth.Mr. Cook sees privacy as a customer right and thus felt he had little choice but to take a public stand this week when a federal court ordered Apple to help authorities break into the iPhone of one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.On the other side are law enforcement officials, including attorney generals, the Justice Department, federal prosecutors and others. Many of these authorities have been sounding the alarm that Apple’s iPhones, which use encryption, are counterproductive to investigations because information cannot be accessed. The iPhone in the San Bernardino attack became the perfect case on which to press Apple on the issue, write Matt Apuzzo, Joseph Goldstein and Eric Lichtblau.Let the showdown begin.Advertisement
