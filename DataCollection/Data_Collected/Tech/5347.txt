When it comes to violent posts on its social network, Twitter has long held that it would only seek to ban direct, specific threats made against others on its microblogging service. Now, the company has decided that simply promoting violence against others is enough to get a user suspended.Twitter quietly updated its rules of user conduct following the publication of an opinion piece by its general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, last week in The Washington Post that acknowledged that the company needed to “do a better job combating abuse without chilling or silencing speech.” The company formally announced the new policy on Tuesday. In addition to the new prohibition against promoting violence, Twitter said that it would begin to use other enforcement tools, such as temporarily suspending accounts — a sort of Twitter timeout for abusers. The company will also begin testing the automatic blocking of tweets that match previous patterns of harassment.  Although the post itself will still be allowed, Twitter said it will try to block it from showing up in the feed of the intended target, blunting its impact.The company’s changes comes after other recent updates to its anti-harassment tactics in December, February and March. Those were made in response to a chorus of complaints from users that it has done too little to address issues such as rape threats, so-called revenge porn in which nude images of people are posted without their consent, and violence promoted by terrorist groups such as the Islamic State.“Our mission is to provide a platform for free expression to flourish; for that mission to be successful, we need to ensure that voices are not silenced because people are afraid to speak up,” wrote Shreyas Doshi, Twitter’s director of product management, in a blog post explaining the new policy.A version of this article appears in print on 04/27/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Twitter Extends Ban on Threats.
