While Pope Francis moves his historic tour of the United States to New York and China’s president Xi Jinping shifts from meeting with business leaders in Seattle to political leaders in Washington, D.C., another world leader is embarking on an American tour.As it did with Mr. Xi, the technology industry will play a central role in discussions conducted by Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India. Mr. Modi is scheduled to speak at the United Nations and meet with East Coast business executives on Friday before heading to the main event: a whirlwind tour of Silicon Valley, including visits to Tesla, Stanford, Google and Facebook.But unlike Mr. Xi, Mr. Modi’s meeting with American tech industry leaders is more likely to be a celebration than a tense discussions about hacking and security restrictions. A number of tech leaders, including top executives of Microsoft and Google and several influential venture capitalists, are Indian-American. And Indians are a fast-growing part of Silicon Valley’s engineering and business circles.Mr. Modi, a technophile who regularly posts on Facebook and Twitter, is expected to spend much of his time courting Silicon Valley to do business in India even as he calls attention to his country’s influence on the technology industry.On Sunday, Mr. Modi is expected to address 18,000 people, mostly Indian-Americans, in a sold-out arena in San Jose.
