BRUSSELS — Europe is getting close to testing a question increasingly central to data security: Will requiring companies to quickly inform regulators of a breach help protect people’s information?Several prominent Internet hacking incidents, including at Target and JPMorgan Chase, have raised concerns that individuals’ online information is increasingly vulnerable. Now, as part of a data protection overhaul expected to be approved by European officials in the coming months, a greater onus will be put on companies.Under the proposals, any company — even one based outside Europe — that collects and manages data about the region’s more than 500 million residents would need to inform a national privacy watchdog within 72 hours of discovering a data breach. Companies also must notify customers as soon as possible, particularly when the use of the stolen data could violate individuals’ privacy rights.The regulators would have the right to fine companies up to 2 percent of their global revenue, or a maximum $1.1 million, if they do not comply with the privacy rules, which  already are some of the most stringent in the world. The fines authorized in the overhaul, which would be much higher than current penalties, vary depending on the severity of each data breach.The rules, which are still being negotiated, are expected to be completed by early next year and take effect as early as 2018.Yet while policy makers here have hailed the new obligations as a means to protect people’s rights, companies, privacy lawyers and even some data protection advocates question whether requiring businesses to inform regulators within three days of any data breach — be it a minor hacking or a major attack — will make individuals’ information safer.“It’s all very well to set deadlines, but what will this actually achieve?” said Paula Barrett, head of privacy and information law at Eversheds, a law firm in London. “Seventy-two hours is a very tight deadline. For many, it seems like this number was just plucked out of thin air.”Many executives say a mandatory three-day window would place a high regulatory burden on companies’ fast-expanding use of the data they collect about their global customers. It also goes well beyond similar rules in other jurisdictions, according to company officials. In the United States, for instance, the most onerous laws require that companies inform authorities and customers within a month of discovering a data breach.Privacy specialists say companies may not be able to find a solution to a hacking within the period before notification of one of Europe’s data protection regulators is required. That may allow other hackers to take advantage if authorities decide to make the breach public, potentially raising individuals’ anxiety that their information is not secure.Under the proposals, the rules allow businesses to notify just one of the region’s 28 regulators, which would then coordinate with counterparts across the Continent. The regulator that is notified would be based on where the hacking occurs or where a company has headquarters.The goal, lawmakers say, is to make it easier for companies to inform privacy authorities, while responding to data breaches immediately.“Companies have to do all they can to notify regulators and consumers,” said David Martin Ruiz, senior legal officer at BEUC, the European consumer association in Brussels. “It’s their duty.”But some of the region’s privacy watchdogs could struggle to keep up with the increased authority from Europe’s proposed rules. Many of the regulators have small staffs — and even smaller budgets — to handle the increasing workload awaiting them.The privacy regulator of Ireland, for example, where many American tech companies have international headquarters, primarily because of the country’s low corporate tax, has an annual budget of just $4.1 million. That pales in comparison with those of its American counterparts, primarily the Federal Trade Commission,  which have hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal to ensure that technology companies comply with domestic legislation.In the United States, almost all states now require companies to notify authorities and customers after a data breach. President Obama also called for new federal rules early this year that would require businesses to inform people within 30 days after their data has been hacked. Previous attempts to pass nationwide legislation did not gain traction in Congress.But as with many other aspects of data protection rules, European regulators are taking a stronger stand on how governments and companies protect data and privacy compared with the United States. In Europe, privacy is viewed as a fundamental right on par with freedom of expression.This month, for example, the European Court of Justice, the region’s highest legal authority, struck down a data-sharing agreement between Europe and the United States that allowed the likes of Google and Facebook to move people’s online information across the Atlantic. The judges said American privacy rules did not offer as much protection as those in Europe.The court’s ruling “stressed the importance that Europe places on protecting people’s privacy,” said Jacob Kohnstamm, the Dutch data protection regulator.While Europe’s proposed rules go far beyond what is required in the United States, privacy advocates say the mandatory notification process would ensure that companies do not try to hide serious data breaches that put people at risk.The data notification changes build on rules that require European cellphone carriers and Internet providers to inform local authorities within 24 hours after discovering customers’ information has been compromised.Several telecom executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the current rules had been a mixed blessing.While the 24-hour mandatory notification had ensured that data breaches were taken more seriously, particularly by senior management, the officials said it remained difficult to fix any security flaw before they were required to inform national authorities.“The timing is absolutely crazy,” said Tanguy Van Overstraeten, who runs the global privacy and data protection practice at Linklaters, a law firm, in Brussels. He has helped several telecom operators comply with the existing rules.“When you are the victim of a data breach, you want to fix the problem first,” he added, “not spend time notifying the regulator.”A version of this article appears in print on 10/15/2015, on page F11 of the National edition with the headline: A Deadline to Disclose.
