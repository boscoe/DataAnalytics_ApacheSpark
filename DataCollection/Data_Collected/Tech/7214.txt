In speeches and on social media, John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile, has built a reputation of emphatically, if sometimes profanely, promoting T-Mobile’s services, often at the expense of the competition.That penchant has appeared to rub off on the chief executive of another wireless carrier. Late Wednesday night on Twitter, after Mr. Legere criticized a new pricing plan from Sprint called “All In,” Marcelo Claure, Sprint’s chief executive, responded in kind with a string of tweets calling T-Mobile’s own pricing practices misleading.@JohnLegere imitation is a joke. You trick people to believe that they have a 15 dollar iphone lease payment when it's not true. You tell— MarceloClaure (@marceloclaure) July 2, 2015@JohnLegere them they can upgrade up to 3x but you don't tell them the price goes up to 27 dollars when they do. You say one thing— MarceloClaure (@marceloclaure) July 2, 2015@JohnLegere but behave completely different. It's all a fake show. So its really #Tmobilelikehell— MarceloClaure (@marceloclaure) July 2, 2015In the past, Mr. Legere usually focuses his venom on the two largest carriers in the United States, AT&T and Verizon. And this spring, T-Mobile and Sprint together petitioned the Federal Communications Commission to expand the pool of airwaves to be sold next year to smaller carriers like Sprint and T-Mobile, but not AT&T and Verizon, which each have significantly more market share in the United States than other carriers.But on Wednesday night, in an expletive-laden message, Mr. Claure said T-Mobile was “worse than the other two carriers together.”Mr. Legere responded 13 hours later..@marceloclaure you mad bro?— John Legere (@JohnLegere) 2 Jul 15The T-Mobile press relations office declined to offer an official comment. “John speaks for himself,” Annie Garrigan, a T-Mobile spokeswoman, said.
