Sales of the company’s latest games console, the Xbox One, have fallen behind that of Sony’s PlayStation 4.Initially, Microsoft priced the Xbox One higher than the PlayStation 4 because it bundled its Kinect camera sensor with the console. It has since released a less expensive version of the Xbox without the Kinect.With a smaller base of console owners to sell the latest games to, publishers have less opportunity to profit, which makes games with more narrow audiences tougher to justify.Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he had little doubt that Microsoft would continue to develop top-selling games like Halo and Gears of War for the Xbox, along with smaller projects.But he said some games like Fable, with significant development budgets and middling sales, were no longer worth the investment for Microsoft. Mr. Pachter estimated that the Fable games, over more than a decade of history, have sold around seven million copies.“It’s just not impressive,” he said. “They weren’t getting what they bargained for.”Advertisement
