Last year, Mr. Zuckerberg explained how the company was opening the code to Facebook Messenger, its mobile messaging app, so other companies could build atop what it’s already doing. Facebook also unveiled Aquila, a V-shaped unmanned vehicle, which would help it provide web access around the world.This year, expect similar themes. Facebook is again expected to talk about Messenger, as well as its live video effort, Facebook Live, among other topics.It’s unclear if drones will be on the program. But the machines and their ilk are on the agenda at another event this week, at a United Nations meeting on autonomous weapons in Geneva, writes John Markoff.The flying devices, along with missiles and other military equipment, are getting scrutinized as they blend more with artificial intelligence. Through A.I., the weapons are increasingly gaining capabilities for attacking and homing in on targets without any human involvement. That has raised alarm bells at Human Rights Watch and other groups, which argue that the implications of such autonomous weapons are “profoundly disturbing.”Advertisement
