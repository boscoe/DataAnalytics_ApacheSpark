Updated, 10:04 a.m. | A federal judge has refused to throw out a lawsuit filed by a games publisher accusing Oculus VR of stealing trade secrets and code in the creation of the Oculus virtual-reality headset. The ruling late last month by Jorge A. Solis, a judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas, denied a request to dismiss the lawsuit by two of the defendants in the case, Oculus and Palmer Luckey, the company’s co-founder who came up with the idea for the Oculus virtual-reality headset. On Monday, the judge also ruled against a similar request by a third defendant in the case, Facebook, which acquired Oculus for $2 billion last year. The ruling is a win for ZeniMax Media, the game publisher, which sued Oculus last year, following the Facebook deal. ZeniMax accused Oculus of stealing its expertise and code in the creation of the Oculus Rift headset. The lawsuit centers on help that John Carmack, then a ZeniMax employee and the designer behind iconic games like Doom and Quake, provided to Mr. Luckey as he was starting Oculus. Mr. Carmack later joined Oculus as its chief technology officer and ZeniMax contends that the assistance that Mr. Carmack gave to Mr. Luckey was illegal. It’s too early to say whether ZeniMax will win the case against Oculus. At this stage, the judge wrote in his ruling, ZeniMax merely had to show enough facts to make a plausible claim for relief. It is not, he wrote, the court’s job “at this juncture to decide whether defendants would prevail on the merits of the case.” The judge has scheduled a jury trial in the case to begin Aug. 1 of next year.  Spokesmen for Oculus, ZeniMax and Facebook declined to comment on the judge’s ruling.
