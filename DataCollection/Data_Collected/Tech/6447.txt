The increasing cost of chip manufacturing is driving Intel’s $16.7 billion purchase of Altera, as well as the other big mergers sweeping the semiconductor industry, Quentin Hardy and Chad Bray write in DealBook. “Ten years ago, the cost from designing a new chip to making it a product was $10 million to $50 million,” said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. “Today it’s $100 million to $200 million. Solving weird and challenging physics problems at this small size requires a lot of expensive equipment. That’s why there’s all this M.&A.” The New York Times compiled a list of recent deals; however, Richard Beales of Breakingviews questioned whether these cost savings will be realized in these mergers. Besides gaining economies of scale in buying Altera, Intel would benefit in other ways. Altera’s primary chips would help Intel focus on two of the biggest emerging markets, large data centers and the so-called Internet of Things, or computer-enriched machines that work with other devices. Altera’s chips can be reprogrammed once they leave the foundry, while Intel’s semiconductors are more powerful but lack that flexibility. By combining the two types on a single chip, Intel thinks that by late next year it can start offering its big business customers ways of fine-tuning performance to suit specific needs.
