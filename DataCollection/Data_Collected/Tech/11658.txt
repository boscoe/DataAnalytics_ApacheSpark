Europe’s national privacy agencies demanded more details on Wednesday about whether the European Union’s new data transfer agreement with the United States would adequately protect individuals’ personal information.The move by the privacy regulators, which represent individual countries within the 28-nation European Union, indicates an unwillingness to accept the word of officials in Brussels that they can adequately safeguard citizens’ personal data.The group asked the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, to provide a fuller explanation of how safeguards would work and to explain how Europeans could seek legal redress in the United States if they believed their data was misused.The primary concern is how much access American intelligence agencies will have to European citizens’ personal information.AdvertisementEurope’s privacy regulators set a Feb. 29 deadline for receiving the new information. If the regulators then decide that the new agreement with the United States does not protect Europeans’ privacy rights, the national officials would have the power to investigate — and potentially fine — companies. And because the data pact cannot take effect until all 28 European Union countries have signed off on it, the questions raised by the national data privacy officials could complicate that process.AdvertisementThese uncertainties, legal experts say, may threaten the new data transfer deal — known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield. The agreement was reached after three months of tense negotiations between American and European Union officials.“We want to receive the documents to assess whether the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield can answer our concerns,” said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France’s privacy chief, who is chairwoman of a pan-European body of national data protection authorities. “We have to review the consequences of this arrangement.”The data transfer pact, intended to replace a 15-year-old agreement that Europe’s highest court struck down in October, covers the trans-Atlantic transmission of people’s individual data — including online search queries, financial information and employee records.Such data is the lifeblood of modern international business and digital commerce. Billions of dollars in trans-Atlantic trade hang in the balance, for online companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon, as well as for more traditional multinationals like the drug maker Pfizer and the industrial company General Electric.Ms. Falque-Pierrotin’s group of privacy regulators said on Wednesday that the current data transfer system would remain in place at least until the end of February. But the deadline raises questions of what would happen if the region’s privacy regulators could not be reassured that the new Privacy Shield pact provided sufficient protection of personal data.“I am 100 percent sure we received concrete assurances from the Americans,” Vera Jourova, the European justice commissioner who was in charge of Europe’s negotiating team, said in an interview on Wednesday. But, she conceded, “the current situation isn’t ideal.”The main provisions of the Privacy Shield included written guarantees by the United States that its national security agencies would not have indiscriminate access to Europeans’ data when it is transferred to the United States.
                All the talk about data privacy can get caught up in political wrangling. But the different approaches have practical consequences for people, too.            The deal also calls for the creation of a data privacy ombudsman within the State Department as the first point of contact for Europeans seeking redress for privacy complaints. These provisions would be reviewed annually to ensure that they met European privacy standardsAdvertisementThe national data protection officials, who had a two-day meeting in Brussels before making their announcement on Wednesday, are far from united over how the region’s data rules should work.Some of them, including Ms. Falque-Pierrotin in France and her counterparts in Germany and Spain, have sent letters to companies warning them that the current trans-Atlantic data transfer system is on shaky legal ground. But others — particularly officials in Britain and Ireland, where many international companies have headquarters — have said they favored the current data transfer approach.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Others, in contrast, are likely to permit companies to continue moving digital information almost unfettered between two of the world’s largest economies.“Businesses will want to be cautious about signing up to Privacy Shield given the potential legal challenges,” said Marc Dautlich, a data protection lawyer at Pinsent Masons in London.Wednesday’s developments are the latest chapter of a bitter dispute.On one side are companies and government agencies in Europe and the United States that favor unfettered data transfers.On the other side are consumer advocacy groups in Europe, backed by some national data protection agencies, who are skeptical that Europeans’ privacy rights will be upheld when their personal data is transmitted to the United States.“There’s a big concern about this agreement,” said Estelle Massé, a policy analyst at Access Now, a digital rights advocacy group in Brussels. “Will it hold up in court?”Complicating the issue are security concerns on both sides of the Atlantic about the rise of international terrorism. American and European law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not want Europe’s tough data privacy protections to prevent them, when necessary, from gaining access to the online communications of terrorism suspects, among others.AdvertisementThis standoff is the result of a ruling last year by European judges that local citizens’ digital data was not sufficiently protected when transferred to the United States. The judges also demanded that Europe’s data protection authorities take a more active role in policing how information leaves their national borders.These privacy agencies had set a Jan. 31 deadline for European and American negotiators to agree to a new data transfer pact. And while the negotiators failed to reach an agreement by that deadline, they continued work almost around the clock, resulting in the deal announced on Tuesday.Even as they agreed on the broad outlines of the new accord, American and European policy makers knew they still had to fill in the details. Now, the national data regulators have given them a deadline.Victoria A. Espinel, president of the Software Alliance, a trade group in Washington, underlined the implications the deal could have.“Half a trillion dollars of trade is at stake,” she said. “We still expect that cool heads will prevail.”A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: European Privacy Agencies Seek Details on Data Transfer Deal With U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
