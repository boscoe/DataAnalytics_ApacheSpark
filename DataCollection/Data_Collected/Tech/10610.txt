Both of those forces were abundantly on display this week.On Tuesday, the federal government proposed rules that require new cars and small trucks to “talk” to one another. Under the rules, automakers would have to include wireless technology and chips to enable the vehicles to broadcast data about their speed, location and direction as they are traveling, writes Cecilia Kang.The rules aim to improve road safety, and making automakers responsible for making cars smarter is the way the government appears to be going.At the same time, in a sign of how cars are sweeping through the tech industry, Alphabet on Tuesday said it was spinning off its autonomous vehicle project into a stand-alone company, writes Daisuke Wakabayashi. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, named the new effort Waymo (short for “a new way forward in mobility”).Google has been working on self-driving car technology for years, but the spinoff signals that it believes the technology may be nearing commercialization. Still, Waymo was short on details about what its business strategy might be.Uber also did its part this week with cars and technology. On Wednesday, the ride-hailing company said it had begun offering a self-driving car service to some passengers in San Francisco, reports Mike Isaac. That makes it the second time this year that Uber has opened an autonomous vehicle service to the public; the first was when the company rolled out driverless cars in Pittsburgh in September.Advertisement
