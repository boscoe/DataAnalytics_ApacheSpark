Nothing says Thanksgiving like overcrowded airports and traffic jams. But given the holiday, let’s be thankful for a minute — for the intersection of technology and travel.Thanks to online search data, our friends at The Upshot were able to create several memorizing graphics about where Americans travel to for the holiday weekend. Florida and Las Vegas are hot destinations, as you might expect. And Boston, being the chilly college city that it is, is one of the places that people escape this time of year.And thanks to technology, once those travelers land, they can easily get directions to their final destination. It’s no secret that Google Maps and other smartphone mapping services have changed how we get around. As our friends in Travel note, those nifty mapping tricks are now becoming available without a data connection, too. Google‘s Offline Maps can do turn-by-turn voice directions, or search within a map for destinations along with their details, all while being offline. Offline Maps is only available to Android users so far — iOS is expected in the coming months. The bit of savings on your mobile data bill will probably be welcome.Finally, a programming note: We here at the Daily Report will be away the next few days, returning on Monday. Happy Thanksgiving to all.
