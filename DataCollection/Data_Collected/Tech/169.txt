Phones. Tablets. Laptops. Made by Microsoft?The giant software company continued its foray into the hardware business on Tuesday, introducing a suite of new products. The one that generated the most surprise was the company’s new laptop — the first laptop from Microsoft. Called the Surface Book, the computer can pull apart at the hinge so that the screen turns into a large tablet. It is not cheap, at $1,500.As Nick Wingfield noted, the new hardware shows how Microsoft has had to adjust in the face of competitors like Apple and Google. But what the devices also demonstrate is how crucial Windows 10, Microsoft’s latest operating system, is to the company’s future. This is no secret; the company has been pointed in this direction for a long time. All the new devices, though, use some form of Windows 10, part of giving consumers — and developers — a more seamless experience. With its hardware, Microsoft is showing other Windows device makers the way forward.For now, that promise is not much more than a marketing pitch, because sales of the devices are still dwarfed by those of competitors. But perhaps Microsoft at least has our attention now.
