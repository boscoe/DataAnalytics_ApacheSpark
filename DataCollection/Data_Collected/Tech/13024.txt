But the effects of the case linger.On Tuesday, two developments showed that the debate touched off by the case — weighing digital privacy against national security — is still going on.In one, the F.B.I.’s top lawyer gave an update on the San Bernardino attacker’s iPhone, which the agency was eventually able to crack with the help of an unidentified third party. James A. Baker, the bureau’s general counsel, said the F.B.I. had extracted data from the device and was putting it to use, without answering whether the information was useful to the San Bernardino investigation, Eric Lichtblau writes.At the same time, WhatsApp, the messaging app owned by Facebook, said it had fully encrypted all communications on its service, Mike Isaac writes. The move thrust WhatsApp deeper into a debate about digital data — with more encryption of everything, including photos, videos and group texts — that will only make it harder for law enforcement to get information from the messaging company. All of which is to say, the push-pull between tech companies and the federal government over access to digital data and communications is far from over.Advertisement
