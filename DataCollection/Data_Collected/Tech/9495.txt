Samsung and Twitter are not tech companies whose names are often uttered in the same breath. But they are connected right now by the theme of explosions.O.K., the connection might be somewhat tenuous. But Samsung is struggling at the moment because one of its products, the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, has at times literally exploded in flames — in fact, even the replacement products that were meant to be safe have been doing so, write Daisuke Wakabayashi, Choe Sang-Hun and Vindu Goel. That has led Samsung to halt production of the device and to ask its partners to stop selling the product. On Tuesday, Samsung killed the Note 7 entirely.Twitter, simultaneously, is grappling with the exploding of potential deal talks to sell itself — or, wait, is that an implosion? The company is still in discussions with at least one suitor, Salesforce.com, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, is more amenable to a potential sale now than he was last month, writes Mike Isaac. At the same time, Twitter is continuing with plans as if it will be an independent entity, showing how uncertain any outcome might be.The Samsung and Twitter situations underscore how fickle the tech world can be with once-hot products or services that can, in what seems like a flash, lose popularity. Then it’s out of the frying pan and into the fire — and an exploding fire at that.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
