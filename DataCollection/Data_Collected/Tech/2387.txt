Uber has made millions offering quick, convenient rides to customers. Its ambitions are much larger. To that end, the company started testing UberCargo on Thursday, a new service that allows customers to transport goods locally by cargo van. It is most likely an appeal to urban dwellers who do not own cars or trucks and occasionally have to move larger items from one place to another; in a company blog post, Uber gives examples like riding with a large pet or moving a mattress to a new home.But more than that, it is a signal of Uber’s ever-expanding goals to be a transportation company for any and all sorts of items — from a file folder of important documents to a wagon-load full of chilled groceries.Uber has already dabbled in the delivery business. In New York, the company offers UberRush, a bike messenger courier service for delivering small items quickly. And in Washington, users can have a number of items typically found at a convenience store delivered to their homes by the UberEssentials program. The company has even developed a specific division in the company, called “Uber Everything,” dedicated to working on expanding the types of partnerships and delivery services the company is able to offer. Uber is not without competition. Technology giants like Google, Amazon and eBay are all testing same-day grocery delivery services. Start-ups like Postmates, Instacart and GrubHub Seamless also offer similar on-demand delivery services. And just recently a start-up called Lugg — which, like UberCargo, offers an on-demand moving service for cumbersome items — started in the San Francisco Bay Area. While Uber’s ambitions are large, the company is testing its new services slowly and methodically. UberCargo is now only available in Hong Kong, while other services like UberFresh, a lunch and dinner delivery option, was first piloted in the greater Los Angeles area. The company did not specify when or if UberCargo would become widely available.
