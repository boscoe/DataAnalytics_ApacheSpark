As 2015 draws to a close, the effusiveness over richly valued technology start-ups has become more muted, with investors and others questioning the sustainability of a horde of a highflying companies, and what may come next for the enterprises.For some employees of those start-ups, the picture is not likely to be pretty, writes Katie Benner. She cited the example of Good Technology, a privately held company in Silicon Valley that was once valued at $1.1 billion, but was sold to BlackBerry this year for $425 million. After the sale, employees of Good learned that their stock in the company — a type of stock known as common shares — was valued at just 44 cents a share. In contrast, investors in Good, who owned a class of stock called preferred shares, walked away with millions because their preferred stock was valued at more than $3 a share. Executives walked away with millions of dollars, too. Making matters worse for employees, some had paid taxes on their Good stock based on an earlier, higher value of the shares. The story sparked plenty of talk about what employees do and do not know when it comes to owning private company stock; whether there’s really a difference between employees of privately held companies and public companies; why workers should join start-ups in the first place; and even a discussion of the long, complicated history of Good.  Readers, we’ll leave it to you to discuss. The Bits Daily Report is on hiatus until Monday.
