For the tech industry’s venerable giants, the new stuff just doesn’t seem to be worth as much as the old stuff.Like Intel last week, IBM on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that showed growth in areas like data analysis tools and cloud computing. But that growth wasn’t nearly enough to offset disappointing returns from traditional markets like hardware, software and services.IBM reported a 19 percent drop in net profit, to $4.5 billion, from the same time period a year earlier. And quarterly revenue fell 9 percent, to $22.1 billion.In the quarter, IBM said that revenue from newer markets, its “strategic imperatives,” grew 16 percent compared with the quarter a year earlier. For the year, they grew 26 percent and now account for 35 percent of corporate sales.But that was not enough to make up for poor showing in other areas. Software sales were down 6 percent year-over-year, and sales in areas like services and hardware were also lackluster.Transitions are never easy. But IBM is one of the few big tech companies from the mainframe and minicomputer era to adjust — if painfully — to personal computers and the early days of the Internet.Another tech giant that made that transition? Intel.Don’t count either of them out. Both companies still have gigantic market reach and generate billions in cash every quarter. But getting to the future could be painful.
