And as something you want to see on your terms. Now.If so, it’s going to be a very big deal for an industry that still thinks it’s special.As Sapna Maheshwari writes, the Olympics seemed to show NBC, which had the rights to broadcast the Games in the United States, that people increasingly want to see live events as they happen.Perhaps a half-million people a day watched the events on live streams, and a disproportionate number of those were probably in the coveted group of 18- to 34-year-olds.Some of that change may have been forced by NBC itself, which delayed the broadcast of some events to show them during prime time, sacrificing immediacy in the hopes of a larger viewing audience.As we have written elsewhere, however, in a world where seeing things in real time and commenting on them is a big value for the young, that kind of time delay may alienate the coveted crowd. NBC was unable to deliver its advertisers the kind of audiences seen during the 2012 London Olympics, and as a result, NBC had to give advertisers free airtime to make up for the shortfall.So what is to be done for broadcasters and advertisers? Increasingly, the ad buyers are thinking about packages that mix traditional television ad spots with digital messages. Broadcasters will have to accept that more events will have to be shown in real time, possibly through exclusive apps or other specialized channels where they can charge a premium.The Olympics are, of course, a pretty special case: a huge amount of sports, played during daytime hours. Most big professional sports in the United States have been styled to suit broadcast needs for a long time, from playing football on Monday nights to the advent of colorful uniforms and field markers. Television may even affect which sports Americans worship — football and basketball show better on television than once-popular events like dance marathons and horse racing.That doesn’t change the apparent need for greater immediacy, though, as people move away from watching things in a specific room with a couch and a television to wherever they may be. The sports-broadcasting industry may already be adapting to that, with ever-faster pastimes like Extreme Sports.Advertisement
