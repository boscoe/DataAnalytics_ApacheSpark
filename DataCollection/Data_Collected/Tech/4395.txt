EBay, the giant online auction site, sells millions of items to customers all over the world every single day. It wants to sell a whole lot more.The company plans to introduce on Tuesday a new section of the website in partnership with Sotheby’s, the storied auction house, in hopes of reaching an entirely new class of the art- and collectible-buying public.First announced last July, the initiative will bring scores of Sotheby’s less expensive items — which range from about $1,000 to $50,000 — to eBay’s customers, a crowd that both companies hope will be eager to purchase works of art online.Beginning April 1, the new section will stream live video of Sotheby’s New York art sales to prospective art buyers, who can participate in the auctions in real-time online.Sotheby’s has traditionally made a similar version of this real-time bidding possible through its own site, as well as for customers who wish to bid on auctions over the telephone. The new initiative, however, gives Sotheby’s access to eBay’s 155 million monthly users, a huge pool of potential new customers.It is an important pairing for both companies. EBay, in the midst of a split from PayPal, has seen lackluster growth over the last few quarters, and hopes to bolster auction revenue with the new partnership.Sotheby’s meanwhile, is in fierce competition with its main rival, Christie’s, which has said it will invest $50 million to beef up its Internet-only auctions.EBay will take a cut of each item sold through the new partnership, though the terms of the deal were not disclosed.
