Q. I want to make Windows 10 appear more like earlier versions of Windows. Is it possible to put an icon for My Computer on my desktop?A. You can add an icon for This PC (Microsoft’s new name for My Computer) to your Windows 10 desktop, as well as icons for your user folder, Network, Recycle Bin and Control Panel. Start by right-clicking on the desktop and choosing Personalize from the contextual menu. (You can also tell the Cortana assistant to “Open Settings” and then click the Personalization icon.)On the left side of the Personalization settings box, select Themes. In the Classic Settings area, click “Go to desktop icon settings.”You should now see a box with several icons you can add to your desktop; the Recycle Bin icon may already be selected if you chose it when you set up your system. Turn on the checkboxes for This PC and any other icons you want to see on your desktop. Click the Apply and O.K. buttons when you are finished.If you prefer calling your machine the friendlier “My Computer” instead of “This PC,” you can change the name. Right-click on the desktop icon, choose Rename from the contextual menu, type in “My Computer” and press the Enter key. In similar fashion, you can also change the name from the Windows File Explorer. If you do not have a visible icon for it, press the Windows and X keys on the keyboard and choose File Explorer from the menu.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
