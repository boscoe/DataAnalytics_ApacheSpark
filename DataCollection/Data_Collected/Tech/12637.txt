If Apple employees refused to perform the software engineering tasks that would be necessary to provide the F.B.I. with access to the contents of an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the December mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif., their decision would be explicitly supported by the code of ethics of a professional organization called the Association for Computing Machinery.The group urges computer professionals to obey existing laws unless they raise ethical issues that come into play around privacy and technological systems that have the ability to harm the public.One of the points in the ethics code reads: “ACM members must obey existing local, state, province, national, and international laws unless there is a compelling ethical basis not to do so.”Two other points state that programmers should, “avoid harm to others,” and “respect the privacy of others.” Both points went on to detail programming actions that might lead to the kinds of privacy invasions that Apple has stated that a weakened operating system might incur.AdvertisementThe code of ethics is significant because it discusses the scenarios under which software engineers might choose to resist performing a task and notes that individuals who choose this path must be ready to accept the consequences.“Violation of a law or regulation may be ethical when that law or rule has inadequate moral basis or when it conflicts with another law judged to be more important,” it says.AdvertisementHowever, “If one decides to violate a law or rule because it is viewed as unethical, or for any other reason, one must fully accept responsibility for one’s actions and for the consequences.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
