SEATTLE — Most demonstrations of new technology do not involve cooking and then tasting freshly fried potato chips, sprinkled with sea salt and pepper. They should. The chips came out of a conventional pot filled with hot oil sitting on an ordinary gas stove, all of which had received what was effectively a brain transplant from two devices, both the creations of a new start-up called Meld. The first was a temperature sensor that clipped to the side of the pot, providing a precise reading of the oil inside the pot. The second was a round device attached to the front of the stove in place of one of its knobs, which communicated wirelessly with the sensor in the pot to regulate the temperature of the oil. Think of Meld as a Nest thermostat for your kitchen. Both add I.Q. points to the (usually) dumb systems in people’s homes that control different forms of heating — Nest for the furnace, Meld for the stove. The design of the round Meld Knob, as it is called, bears more than a passing resemblance to the Nest thermostat. The company was founded by Darren Vengroff and Jon Jenkins, two engineers who met while working at Amazon years ago, and operates from an office building in an industrial marine neighborhood in Seattle overlooking a ship canal, in one of the few offices where the start-up could operate the stoves necessary to test its products.  The company is starting a fund-raising effort on Kickstarter  on Tuesday to finance the initial production of its product, which will start at $99 and ship in the fall. Here’s a video from Meld showing how the product works:Meld is exploiting the tailwinds from two trends, the first of which is illustrated by the success of Nest, bought by Google for $3.2 billion. Nest showed the promise of adding connected devices, collectively called the Internet of things, to homes. Sensors and silicon for connecting devices are getting increasingly cheap, and smartphone apps give people friendly interfaces for controlling them.It’s also an attempt to tap growing interest in modernist cuisine, a gastronomic movement, championed by people like Nathan Myhrvold, a former Microsoft executive, that places a heavy emphasis on the science of cooking and techniques for achieving new culinary experiences. One of the most popular tools of modernist cuisine is sous vide, in which meat and other proteins are sealed in plastic and submerged in water baths to cook at precisely regulated temperatures for hours, producing exceptionally tender results. Many restaurants use sous vide equipment to cook meat and then slap it on the grill for a minute or so to crisp it.         Meld can do sous vide cooking, along with many other types of cooking, including candy making, beer brewing, stew simmering and deep frying. Sous vide devices are getting cheaper — the Anova Precision Cooker costs $179 — but Mr. Vengroff said Meld’s is more flexible and is less bulky, which he predicts will appeal to people with limited kitchen counter space and storage.  “Why does that precision only exist in this big complicated gadget that the vast majority of consumers will never put in their homes?” said Mr. Vengroff, a dedicated amateur chef who went to culinary school in New York. In the potato chip demonstration at Meld’s office, a tiny, battery-powered motor inside the Meld knob adjusted the heat on the burner under the pot. A Meld iPhone app communicated wirelessly with the knob and temperature clip to show when the oil reached the target temperature for frying. The app also contained a recipe for potato chips — Meld will start with hundreds of recipes — including a timer that said when to fish the spuds out of the pot. The clip and knob remained in tight communication to keep the oil in the pot at a constant Goldilocks temperature, neither so hot that the oil smoked and the potatoes burned and not so cool that they came out undercooked. I saw this in action when I first dropped the potatoes into the pot and the water on them suddenly cooled the oil a few degrees. The clip detected the temperature drop, and the knob sprang into action, cranking up the heat on the stove  before dropping it down seconds later. Professional chefs and skilled amateurs like Mr. Vengroff know how to do these adjustments intuitively when they’re in the kitchen. Meld is for the people who aspire to cook like them, the company said.And yes, the chips were excellent.
