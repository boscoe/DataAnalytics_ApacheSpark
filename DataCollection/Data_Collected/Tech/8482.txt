Another day, another sell-off in the global markets. Concerns about China’s economic slowdown and a souring view of emerging economies dominated again on Monday. And like last week, tech stocks were not immune from the market’s plunge.Perhaps this is the upside: It could have been worse. When the markets first opened on Monday, even Apple — the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization — was down about 10 percent. But an email from Tim Cook, the company’s chief executive, hailing the company’s sales in China helped push the stock higher, at one point back to positive territory. Eventually, the shine of the email wore off and Apple shares ended down 2.5 percent. On a day immediately named “Black Monday” by local commentators in China, where the markets were hit particularly hard, falling 2.5 percent didn’t seem bad at all.Companies the size of Apple have some tools at their disposal to combat a down market. Start-ups are a little less equipped. Yet as Katie Benner writes, any adverse effect on venture-backed companies from the market downturn is likely to be uneven and more complicated than a straight bust. The ripples of the change could move slowly. Well-run companies with achievable business plans (and plenty of cash) could survive and even thrive for some time. The weaker companies, those burning quickly through their stockpile of investor money, could find it hard to replenish that money. In other words, if the market doesn’t start to turn around soon, all the giant fund-raising rounds may be in limbo — as well as the life of some of today’s start-ups.
