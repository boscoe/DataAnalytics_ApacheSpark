American internet companies, be they Google, Facebook or Uber, have had a hard time breaking into the Chinese market. But there is a flip side to that: Chinese internet companies have had a hard time breaking out of it.Two decades ago, China essentially walled off its internet from the rest of the world. The result helped create an environment where local companies (not to mention censorship) thrived. Today, companies like Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba are among the biggest internet companies in the world.But other than as investment vehicles, their results outside China have been disappointing, as Paul Mozur reports. Critics say there are various reasons for this, from censorship by the Chinese government to cultural tastes and internet habits different from those of the rest of the world.Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba all have offices in the United States, but their most successful efforts so far have been investments and acquisitions.One notable outlier from this trend has been the music start-up Music.ly. Its app allows users to lip-sync to popular music and dance in their own videos. It is hard to tell it is made in China, and that’s intentional: Its makers have largely ignored their home market to make a play for the American audience.There’s a risk to that, of course, because ignoring a country with more than 700 million internet users is not always the wisest decision.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
