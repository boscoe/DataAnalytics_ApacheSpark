Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, has picked the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to help take it public early next year, people briefed on the matter said.This would be much more than an inside-baseball corporate and financial event. Snapchat is one of the few consequential social media companies that has flourished independently in the age of Facebook. It is used by the coveted younger generation. It is experimenting with digital video, filters, disappearing messages and more, and is having a profound effect on the way people communicate and entertain themselves. Advertisers are increasingly flocking to it.Over time, Snapchat has collected a prominent array of investors, including Alibaba and T. Rowe Price, that have been pumping billions of dollars into the young company. So when it does reach the public market, Snapchat is likely to roil the moneyed world and reap bonanzas for its founders, among many others.In other words, Snapchat represents the intersection of social media, digital culture, technology, teenagers and would-be dashing billionaires — plus those who want to make money off all this. So get ready for those puns. You’ll be reading a lot more of them going into 2017 as an initial public offering nears.Advertisement
