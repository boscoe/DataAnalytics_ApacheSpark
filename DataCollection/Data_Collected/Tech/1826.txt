A bit more than 10 years ago, Yahoo paid $1 billion for a 40 percent stake in a little-known Chinese e-commerce company called Alibaba.Fast-forward to this week and it is increasingly apparent that the Alibaba stake — now 15 percent — is perhaps Yahoo’s most valuable asset. Yahoo’s board of directors said Wednesday morning that it would abandon its plans to spin off its Alibaba stake. Those plans called for bundling the stake with a small-business-services unit into a new company called Aabaco. Instead, the company will spin off all of its other assets, including its stake in Yahoo Japan, into a new company. In other words, all of what we have come to know as Yahoo will be spun out.Over the years, Alibaba has become a giant, even dominant, Internet company in China. Yahoo has bobbed in the water, showing little growth or direction, while other Silicon Valley Internet companies like Google and Facebook have become giants in their own right.“We’re thinking long term about the fastest-growing country in the world for the Internet,” said Terry S. Semel, Yahoo’s chairman and chief executive at the time of its Alibaba investment in August 2005.Mr. Semel probably had no idea just how valuable to his company that long-term investment would become.
