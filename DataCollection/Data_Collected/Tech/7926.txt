Several social media stocks took a pummeling on Wednesday, with Yelp plunging 25 percent and Twitter dropping 15 percent after both companies issued quarterly earnings that disappointed investors in one way or another. On top of that, Facebook’s shares fell slightly in after-hours trading after it posted financial results that included a surge in spending and a forecast of slowing revenue growth. Let’s see if LinkedIn, which reports earnings on Thursday, also joins this not-so-fun party. Few should be surprised by the stock reaction. Investors have demonstrated for many months that they are unforgiving of any stumble by technology companies that became alluring because they had portrayed themselves as high growth. See what happened last quarter with LinkedIn, Yelp and Twitter, which all plummeted more than 20 percent shortly after reporting results that surprised investors (and not in a good way). At the time, Vindu Goel and Mike Isaac wrote that “shareholders increasingly have little tolerance for the slightest misstep” by social-media companies — something that was once again made very clear this week.
