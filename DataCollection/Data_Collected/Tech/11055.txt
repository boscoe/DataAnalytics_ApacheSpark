Google, facing increased scrutiny from European regulators, has hired a former senior adviser to President Obama to lead its global public policy team.Caroline Atkinson, who left her position as a White House deputy national security adviser last month, will join Google in March and be based in Washington. Her most pressing task will be to temper concerns by antitrust enforcement officials in the European Union, which has accused the company of abusing its dominance in web search.Ms. Atkinson, who joined the administration in 2011, is the latest in a string of Obama administration officials to join Silicon Valley companies. David Plouffe, also a former adviser, joined Uber in August 2014, and Jay Carney, a former press secretary, was hired by Amazon early last year.As Silicon Valley companies have grown in influence, they’ve raised greater regulatory concerns over competition and privacy. The senior government officials have been hired to help navigate the regulatory landscape and coordinate campaigns aimed at softening the images of their companies. Ms. Atkinson served as Mr. Obama’s representative at gatherings of the Group of 8 and Group of 20 and at other major economic summit meetings. A former official at the International Monetary Fund, Ms. Atkinson began her career as a journalist. She replaces Rachel Whetstone, Google’s longtime head of policy, who left for Uber in May.“Caroline’s an internationally respected diplomat and adviser, and we’re delighted to have such a thoughtful leader heading our global public policy team,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on 01/13/2016, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Former Obama Adviser to Lead Public Policy Team at Google.
