But if you’re still with me, there’s been plenty of action in that world lately.Oracle, the behemoth maker of software for businesses, on Thursday announced its biggest acquisition in more than a decade, with a $9.3 billion agreement to buy NetSuite. NetSuite specializes in accounting and other back-office e-commerce software, especially for smaller businesses, and the deal goes to the heart of Oracle’s attempt to reinvent itself for the cloud-computing era, where software is accessed over the internet, write Quentin Hardy and Leslie Picker.It’s another strategic move by Lawrence J. Ellison, the software mogul who founded Oracle and remains its executive chairman, and who through personal and family holdings owns more than 40 percent of NetSuite. Mr. Ellison has been one of the biggest dealmakers in software for more than 15 years and this latest purchase further adds to that record.At the same time, another tech giant made waves in the enterprise computing world: Amazon. The Seattle e-commerce company on Thursday posted quarterly earnings, including more evidence that its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services, is a juggernaut, writes Nick Wingfield. Sales for A.W.S. jumped 58 percent from a year ago to $2.9 billion, and the business accounted for more than half of Amazon’s operating income. Microsoft and Google have been trying hard to catch up to Amazon in the field.That’s enough to keep at least some people awake.Advertisement
