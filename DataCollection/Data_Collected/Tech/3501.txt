For at least a couple of old tech companies, the week offered some good news. And perhaps some lessons about what survival, even prosperity, will look like.On Tuesday, Richard K. Templeton, the chairman, chief executive and president of Texas Instruments, spoke at a Goldman Sachs Technology conference in San Francisco. Texas Instruments, a 63-year-old company that produced the first silicon transistor, ran into trouble several years ago selling digital chips for wireless products. The company refocused on cheaper and less sophisticated nondigital chips. Done well, these chips have exceptional profit margins, and Texas Instruments’ stock has gained 143 percent in the past five years. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 78 percent over the same period.The chips also turn out to be profitable at a time when seemingly everything is acquiring some kind of machine intelligence. Performance improvements that used to happen with better mechanical engineering now come from closer monitoring and computer analysis. Mr. Templeton foresaw Texas Instruments as targeting a lot of small manufacturers, the kinds of places with 50 employees turning out just a few products, that never came near his business before. The reason is that almost every part of the manufactured world, including things like outboard motors or novelty doorbells, is going to have to include machine intelligence to monitor its performance. He plans to sell it to small manufacturers through an online catalog of parts, with salespeople touching the larger accounts.“It’ll be difficult for you and your world to analyze,” he warned a room full of Wall Street bankers. “It’s literally hundreds of thousands of customers, very disaggregated.”  On Wednesday, Cisco Systems reported second-quarter earnings well above what Wall Street expected. Revenue was $11.9 billion, versus a consensus estimate of $11.8 billion published in a survey by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted net income was $2.7 billion, or 53 cents a share, compared with an expected 51 cents a share.For John T. Chambers, Cisco’s chief, it seemed a vindication for several years of struggle. “I’m not sure people outside Cisco appreciate the magnitude of the changes we have made in the past years,” he said in an interview. Cisco, he said, had changed 30 percent of its leadership, moved 40 percent of its employees from traditional businesses like computer networking hardware, and into software, industry-specific applications, collaboration and cloud computing. Cisco laid off 6,000 people from its ranks of 74,000, but also hired 6,000 people for other jobs.All those changes were similar to what Texas Instruments had gone through: The old company was retooling for a world in which machine intelligence is everywhere.Mr. Chambers looked to the future with considerable swagger. Within a couple of years, “we become the No. 1 information technology company,” he said. “It will be a whole new generation of strategic partnerships.”“What T.I. does is put intelligence in engines, or mining equipment. We’ll provide an architectural approach,” creating networked intelligence that feeds signals from those machines to local computers and the cloud with an aim of maximizing productivity, Mr. Chambers said. He suggested that Cisco might work extensively with General Electric to do this in health care, or with Bosch for home appliances.Cisco’s goal is to sell comprehensive systems that use many of its products, consulting with governments and big businesses to re-engineer things like municipal water systems for large cities, or to track the movement of people through stadiums and big retail complexes. For people who have followed Cisco it is a familiar claim, which may actually come true soon. Though the stock is up about 20 percent over the past five years, Mr. Chambers described it as “at a seven-year high, and ready to break out.” Still, in an interview in 2008 he set himself a goal of perhaps $87 billion in revenue by the time he turned 65. That birthday was last August, when Cisco reported revenue of $47 billion. Admittedly, the world financial crisis happened in between, so lots of plans had to change.So far, however, Cisco’s “big and comprehensive” approach does not have the payoff of T.I.’s “small and spread out” style. These things have a way of swinging, of course, and the first rule for any incumbent facing change is the same: Find a way to survive that works for what you’ve got.
