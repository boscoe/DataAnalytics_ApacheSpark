Mobile devices, considered an important growth area, had revenue of $200 million and losses of $4.2 billion.The transition to new devices matters, because for decades Intel’s model for success has been to make enough money to invest before rivals in advanced chip-making facilities, with transistors of almost unimaginably small size. If growth and profitably slip, Intel has big problems. Read more »
