Facebook hit quite a milestone on Thursday.“For the first time ever,” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, posted on the social network, “one billion people used Facebook in a single day.”Facebook is present in nearly every aspect of people’s digital lives these days. But just a decade ago, that sort of traffic feat would have been hard for the social-networking site to even have imagined. When it started on Harvard’s campus in 2004, it was essentially an online directory for the university’s students. A year later, it had expanded to 800 campuses and had 2.8 million users. Still, when the first mention of Mr. Zuckerberg appeared in The New York Times, in a 2005 small business article headlined “Student’s Start-Up Draws Attention and $13 Million,” the site was still something of a novelty. For one thing, it was called thefacebook.com.Sean Parker, who was then the the company’s president, said in the article that how to retain alumni as users was “an interesting question for us.” He added: “We’re trying to figure out what functionality they want once they graduate. Are they looking for jobs? Are they trying to date?”Jim Breyer, the venture capitalist whose firm had just invested $13 million in the company, was confident the thefacebook.com would find the answers.“It is a business that has seen tremendous underlying, organic growth,” Mr. Breyer said in the article, “and the team itself is intellectually honest and breathtakingly brilliant in terms of understanding the college student experience.” Boy, was he right — though it now seems clear they understood more than just the college experience.  These days, Mr. Zuckerberg runs a company with a market capitalization of over $250 billion. And on Monday, he said, “1 in 7 people on Earth used Facebook to connect with their friends and family.”
