Yet investors keep pouring money into mammoth new venture funds.On Monday, Technology Crossover Ventures, or TCV, said it had raised $2.5 billion for its latest fund, which is called TCV IX. The venture capital firm is best known for investing in companies such as Dollar Shave Club, Netflix, Vice Media and Zillow.“Despite an overall level of caution, our investors are still looking for opportunities” to invest, said Nathan Sanders, general partner and head of investor relations at TCV.TCV’s new fund is one of several from the venture capital industry to be sized at $1 billion or more this year, even though there has been hand-wringing over whether a tech boom that had blossomed over the last few years might be imperiled. Some high-priced start-ups have had their valuations marked down by mutual fund investors, while other private companies suffered public management blowups or layoffs.Yet in June, venture firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers raised $1.4 billion across two funds and Andreessen Horowitz raised $1.5 billion. Earlier this year, Founders Fund raised $1.3 billion, while Accel garnered $2 billion and Norwest Venture Partners raised $1.2 billion.Over all, the American venture industry raised $8.8 billion in the second quarter of the year, down from $11.1 billion a year earlier, according to data from Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association. Still, venture firms have raised $22.9 billion in the first half of the year alone, compared with $28.7 billion for all of 2015.TCV tends to focus on investing in companies that are more mature and have substantial traction in the market. The firm last announced a new fund in 2014, when it raised $2.2 billion.TCV has also increased its presence in Europe, where it has invested nearly $700 million over the past five years in companies like Spotify.Jay Hoag, a general partner at TCV, said the internet had “democratized the opportunity,” allowing the firm to find investments in places including Stockholm, Copenhagen and London.Advertisement
