Not every printer and scanner has compatible driver software for Windows 10, so if you have not upgraded yet and rely on your current hardware, check first with the manufacturer to make sure your equipment will work with Microsoft’s latest operating system. Many companies even have specific Windows 10 information pages on their sites to answer common questions and provide updated drivers, and post a list of models that do not play nice with the new system.Brother, Canon, Epson, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox are among those companies with special areas on their support sites dedicated to Windows 10. For those who have already upgraded, many manufacturers (including Epson and HP), also have online guides for troubleshooting problems after the Windows 10 installation.Microsoft’s site has its own support page for fixing printer problems in Windows 10. Removing the printer from the system and then reinstalling it is one of the company’s suggestions, and Windows can sometimes find updated driver software on its own with the Device Manager utility. Microsoft’s support page also has a link to its printing troubleshooter program, which guides you through a series of steps for diagnosing and resolving certain issues.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
