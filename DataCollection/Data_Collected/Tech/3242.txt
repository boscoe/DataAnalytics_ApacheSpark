Verizon Wireless executives say they are confident that network quality, not prices, will attract customers. But that has not stopped the company from cutting prices.Verizon said on Wednesday that     it was trimming the costs    of most of its mobile shared data plans by $10.For example, a plan that includes one gigabyte of data now starts at $30, down from $40; a plan that includes six gigabytes now starts at $70, down from $80. (Verizon’s shared data plans separate the cost of data from the cost for each phone line, so these rates refer only to the data part of a phone bill.)Verizon, however, is still resisting calling these price cuts. Instead, the company says customers can pay the same amount they used to, but now they will receive more mobile data.The move was surprising given that just days ago, Verizon said on its financial earnings call that it would not compete on price. Jan Dawson, an independent telecom analyst, said it was a sign that Verizon was finally responding to price cuts across the wireless industry.Chief among the many deals is Sprint’s offer to cut bills in half for any Verizon or AT&T customers who switched to Sprint.“I think it’s a sign that Verizon is starting to feel the pressure on price with more than just a small set of customers, and so it’s finally realized that it needs to compete broadly on price rather than targeting specific customers with deals,” Mr. Dawson said.Debi Lewis, a Verizon spokeswoman, suggested the discounts were nothing new.“We’re always looking at delivering value to customers,” Ms. Lewis said. She noted that Verizon also offered promotions over the holidays, which would be replaced by these new discounts.These reductions are not permanent. The company said the new rates were part of a limited-time promotion, meaning customers will have to sign up for the new plans before they end. Ms. Lewis declined to say when that would be. .
