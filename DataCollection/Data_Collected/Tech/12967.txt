Q. I’m getting more used to Windows 10, but I miss having those links on the Start menu that went right to my Documents and Pictures folders. Can I get those back?A. Microsoft has provided various ways to pin folders to the Start menu, Quick Access area and other easy-to-reach parts of the desktop, but if you long for simple Windows 7-style Start menu shortcuts, you can add them with a few clicks. Open the Start menu and select Settings.On the Settings screen, choose Personalization and then select Start on the left side of the window. At the bottom of the screen, select “Choose which folders appear on Start.”The next screen displays a list of buttons you can enable for shortcuts to specific folders; these will appear in the bottom-left corner of your Windows 10 start menu. By flipping the buttons on the Settings screen, you can add File Explorer, Documents, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Videos and other links to the menu — eliminating the need to have desktop shortcuts to get to those folders quickly.If you click back a screen to the other Start personalization options, you can further customize the look of the menu. Among other things, you can decide if you want to show your most-used apps, your most recently installed apps or display your recently used items in jump lists on the taskbar or Start menu.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
