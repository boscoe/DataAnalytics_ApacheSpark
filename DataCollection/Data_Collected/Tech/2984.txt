HONG KONG — Facebook and Instagram were inaccessible for about  an hour Tuesday, but  after a brief mystery, Facebook said the  cause had been  an internal malfunction  rather than a cyberattack.Facebook users began reporting  problems in gaining access to  the social  media site on Tuesday morning, Hong  Kong time. On Twitter, users posted images of an error message from Facebook that  read: ‘‘Sorry, something went  wrong. We’re working on it and we’ll  get it fixed as soon as we can.’’Both Facebook’s mobile application  and its  website were inaccessible. Facebook owns Instagram.‘‘Earlier this evening many people  had trouble accessing Facebook and Instagram,’’ Facebook said from its California headquarters. ‘‘This was not the  result of a third party attack but instead  occurred after we introduced a change  that affected our configuration systems.  We moved quickly to fix the problem,  and both services are back to 100 percent for everyone.’’In a post to developers using the  Facebook platform, the company said  ‘‘Facebook and Instagram experienced  a major outage tonight from 22:10 until  23:10 PST. Our engineers identified the  cause of the outage and recovered the  site quickly. You should now see decreasing error rates while our systems  stabilize. We don’t expect any other  break in service.’’ Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong,  and Vindu Goel from San Francisco.
