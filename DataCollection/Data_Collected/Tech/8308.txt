Someone at Google did not get the memo about August being a sleepy month.On Monday, the Internet giant announced it was splitting into a conglomerate called Alphabet. On Tuesday, we learned a few other companies, like a little German auto manufacturer called BMW, are already using the Alphabet name. And on Thursday, Google asked for two more weeks to answer antitrust concerns from European regulators.And for good measure, Google on Thursday also unveiled a new Chrome operating system and Chromebook computing devices made by Dell. Chromebooks have been around for a while now, a low-cost alternative to Windows and Macintosh devices.But there has always been one problem for business customers: old files. They have so many old things like Word documents and spreadsheets, it’s hard for them to migrate. The new version of Chrome is supposed to help that process. And Dell’s new Chromebooks, which will cost $399 to $799, will go on sale Sept. 17. In Europe, the bigger the American tech outfit, the more likely it seems it will get attention from a regulatory body. The companies scrutinized  over the years for tax issues or antitrust allegations reads like a Who’s Who of tech’s biggest companies — Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Apple and Google, to name a few. Add the privacy complaints aimed at Facebook, and you pretty much have a list of the most influential tech companies of the last two decades.Google asked for a second extension before it has to respond to a European Commission complaint that it favored its own shopping engine in searches over those of its rivals. If Google is found to have violated Europe’s antitrust rules, it could face a fine topping $6.6 billion, or about 10 percent of Google’s annual revenue.That’s a lot of Chromebooks.
