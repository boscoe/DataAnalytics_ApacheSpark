The tablet has an eight megapixel camera on the rear and a 5.1 megapixel camera on the front.The Xperia Z4 will be released in the United States in June 2015, in both Wi-Fi and LTE-network models. The company did not announce pricing.Sony Mobile said it would not, however, sell its forthcoming Xperia M4 Aqua smartphone in the United States.

PhotoThe forthcoming Xperia M4 Aqua smartphone from Sony is waterproof, but will not be sold in the United States.Credit The phone is waterproof and will sell for about 299 euros, or about $335, without a contract.That is more than the Lumia 640 and Lumia 640XL phones that Microsoft announced on Monday, which will be available in the United States. But Sony said it preferred to focus on a premium, flagship experience in the country.The company sells the Sony Xperia Z3 in the American market, which is available with a contract on T-Mobile and Verizon but not on AT&T or Sprint.Sony Mobile is estimated to have lost more than $2 billion because of declining smartphone sales in 2014. So while the company is smart to release a low-cost Xperia M4 smartphone in markets where those phones are selling quickly, it might be a good idea to make the model available to American shoppers, as well.
