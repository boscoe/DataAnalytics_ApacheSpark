Our tests all came back negative for food pathogens, toxins or outside contamination.”In August, Soylent introduced the snack bar, priced at $24 for a box of 12. But two weeks ago, the company recalled the bars and offered full refunds after customers wrote online that they’d vomited, or experienced nausea or diarrhea after eating them. And in September, Soylent said that it was halting new orders on an energy drink, called Coffiest, after the product was not delivering the advertised amounts of Vitamins A and C.The setbacks don’t seem to be a major deterrent for faithful Soylent customers, who by last year had placed more than six million orders for the meal-replacement products. Soylent fans have ordered so much of the powder that the company said recently it didn’t have enough inventory to fulfill its subscription-based customers. Soylent said that less than 0.1 percent of customers were sickened by the powder, but did not immediately respond to an email inquiry on Friday that asked for the total number of illnesses reported.Meal-replacement technology might be a Silicon Valley staple, but the problems with Soylent’s products has renewed a debate that has been around since its inventor, Rob Rhinehart, first introduced the product in 2013: Is replacing meals with a gritty powder an innovative improvement on food culture, or does Soylent just take all of the joy out of eating?“Silicon Valley’s failure to capture our appetites lies at the heart of what the technology industry misses about so many other things in this world,” David Sax wrote in The New Yorker on Oct. 17. “Though it may be possible to create technically feasible products for any aspect of our lives, those only succeed if they improve — rather than seek to replace — the human, highly tactile and pleasurable world we want to live in.”Advertisement
