How can I tell how much storage space I have used so far?A. On the fourth-generation Apple TV set-top box, you can check how much storage space is used and available by using the remote control to navigate first to the Settings icon on the home screen (or by telling the Siri assistant to “open Settings”). Once in the Settings area, choose General and then Manage Storage. A list of all your Apple TV apps — and how much space each one occupies — will appear on the screen.If you see any apps listed that you never open (or would like to remove anyway), use the remote to select the trash icon next to that app. Once you press the remote’s touch-sensitive surface to delete the app, the program and all of its related files will be erased from the Apple TV. (Only apps and their related data are stored on the drive; videos and music played on an Apple TV are streamed over a network connection.)You can also delete apps directly from the Apple TV’s home screen when browsing your collection. To do so, use the remote to select the app. Next, press and hold the touch-sensitive part of the remote until you see the app begin to wiggle on the screen. Press the Play/Pause button on the remote and choose the Delete option that appears in the on-screen menu.You can delete apps you have downloaded, but you cannot delete Apple’s stock apps that come with the device. If you decide later that you want to restore a deleted app, you can download it again free of charge from Apple TV’s app store.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
