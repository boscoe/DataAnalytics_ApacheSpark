Now let’s talk about the ever-growing presence of video in our lives.As Katie Benner and Sapna Maheshwari write over two stories, short videos primarily made for viewing on mobile devices are reshaping both internet companies and much of the advertising industry.First is a story on how Snapchat, which gained millions of users as a place to ship disappearing images and text messages, is turning itself into a place for mobile video.One major insight: The company seems aware of the ways that looking at things on phones change what and how people watch stuff. The platform calls for short, fast videos, and a lot of novelty in the mix.That is one reason Snapchat, which is renaming itself Snap Inc., is starting to make cool-looking glasses capable of shooting videos 10 seconds long. That short duration, along with Snap’s branding itself as a place of fun ephemera, may help these glasses get past the objections Google faced with Glass, its camera for your face.If Snap can put millions of these glasses on our noses, it will have a lot of interesting content, like the way dashboard cameras and security cameras have inadvertently created millions of minutes of watchable content. More ominously, more mobile video will expose more social woes, like the number of police shootings of black people.Snap is a business, and it wants to sell ads to run with pretty much anything people are looking at. So do Facebook and its photo-sharing subsidiary, Instagram. Ultimately all of them, along with companies like Google’s YouTube, want to draw away some of the billions of dollars now spent on television ads.But there’s already trouble in that paradise.As Ms. Benner and Ms. Maheshwari write in another story, many of these companies are struggling to convince advertisers that ads on short videos, viewed on tiny screens with little speakers, can still result in the kind of hummable, memorable, earworm-able marketing outcomes created by TV ads.That situation worsened last week, they wrote, when Facebook said that for several years it has misstated, in a way favorable to Facebook, how much time people actually spend watching these videos.A setback, for sure, but the past is not returning, and mobile video is an increasing reality in much of our lives. We just need to see who is going to get rich on our attention, and how.Advertisement
