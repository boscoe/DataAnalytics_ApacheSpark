Facebook had a message for advertisers on Wednesday: Whoops.The company, the world’s biggest social network, acknowledged in a lengthy blog post that it was moving to restore confidence among advertisers in its methods for explaining how long users see videos, news articles, ads and corporate messages, Steve Lohr and Sapna Maheshwari write.A little more than a month ago, Facebook apologized for overstating how long, on average, users spent watching videos.But don’t worry: Facebook now has a blog called MetricsFYI that explains these things in detail and that will explain and analyze how it comes to its metrics. The blog is one of a number of changes the company is making to restore confidence among the advertisers that pay the bills.It’s been an odd week for Facebook. For the last few years, it has seemed as though the company could do no wrong, with the exception of some serious missteps in a plan to provide internet access in India.But with the presidential election over, some are asking hard questions about the impact of all those fake news stories you saw friends sharing. No, in case you were wondering, Hillary Clinton did not go to jail. No, leading Hollywood personalities are not actually lizard people.Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, has publicly doubted fake stories had much of an impact on the election. But just in case, his company reminded people that fake news sites are banned from the Facebook ad network.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
