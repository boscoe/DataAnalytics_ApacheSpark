When you’re as rich as Apple and life gives you lemons, you make data centers.On Monday, the State of Arizona announced that Apple would invest $2 billion in the creation of a data center at a facility in Mesa after its original plans to produce sapphire, a material tougher than glass, there were abandoned. Apple had contracted GT Advanced Technologies, a sapphire producer, to make sapphire screens for iPhones, among other things. But to Apple’s surprise, GTAT declared bankruptcy last October after failing to meet some of Apple’s demands. As a result, Apple released its latest iPhones without sapphire. While Apple may have abandoned sapphire production at the Arizona facility, the company has not given up on the facility itself, which measures 1.3 million square feet. Apple on Monday said that the multibillion-dollar investment in the data center was one of its most significant investments ever, creating 600 engineering and construction jobs. The center will be partly used as a central command center for monitoring Apple’s other data centers around the world, the company said. “We’re proud to continue investing in the U.S. with a new data center in Arizona, which will serve as a command center for our global networks,” said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. She said the facility would be powered entirely by renewable energy, much of which will come from a solar farm.Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona said that Apple’s decision to create the data center in Mesa was “a huge win for Arizona and a high testament to our business-friendly climate and talented work force.”
