Uber, the popular ride-hailing service, disclosed on Friday that one of its information databases had been tapped by an unknown third party, potentially revealing the names and drivers’ license identification numbers of up to 50,000 of the company’s drivers. The breach, which occurred in May 2014, was a one-time event, according to Uber. When Uber discovered the breach in September of last year, the company said it updated its database security. To date, Uber has not been notified by drivers of any misuse of their information. “Uber takes seriously our responsibility to safeguard personal information, and we are sorry for any inconvenience this incident may cause,” Katherine Tassi, Uber’s managing counsel of data privacy, said in a company blog post.The breach comes at an unfortunate time for the San Francisco company, which is under close scrutiny from regulators, investors and consumers.The company has raised more than $5 billion from venture capitalists and institutional investment firms in the five years since it was founded. It is fighting against competitors like Lyft, a rival service, in the United States, while also trying to take on competitors in new markets such as the Asia Pacific region and Europe. Institutions like Target, Home Depot, eBay and JPMorgan Chase have all been hit by hackers over the last year, affecting hundreds of millions of customer accounts. In a blog post, Uber said the breach affected drivers across multiple states in the United States, which the company said was a “small percentage” of current and former Uber drivers. The company has offered affected drivers one free year of an online identity protection service from Experian and has filed what is called a “John Doe” lawsuit to collect information in an attempt to discover the identity of the intruder.
