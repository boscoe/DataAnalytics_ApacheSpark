If Jack Dorsey and the other leaders at Twitter thought news of a high-level shake-up would excite investors, they were wrong. On Monday, shares in Twitter fell once again, by 4.6 percent. The company’s stock has fallen more than 40 percent in the last three months.As Mike Isaac reported on Sunday, Mr. Dorsey is looking to add two board members. In addition, several executives are leaving the company, at least some of whom were named by Mr. Dorsey in a tweet, like the senior vice president of engineering and a senior vice president of product. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Dorsey added to the changes, announcing the appointment of Leslie Berland as Twitter’s chief marketing officer.What will it take for Twitter’s fortunes to turn around? Investors are definitely hungry to see Twitter attract more users to its messaging service. And the changes generate a lot of news coverage. But the sort of changes needed to attract more users will take some time to pull off. They can’t be done with a snap of the fingers and putting a few new people in the mix.
