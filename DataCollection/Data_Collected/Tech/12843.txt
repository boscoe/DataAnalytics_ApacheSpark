Apple’s iBooks can be read on iOS devices and in the iBooks app for OS X, but printing your highlighted passages notes is a bit easier on the iOS side. One way to grab your annotations there is to open the iBook file on the device and tap the Table of Contents icon (which looks like a set of three dots and dashes) in the upper-left corner of the screen. On the Contents screen, tap the Notes tab.You should now see all of your highlights and notes for that particular book on the screen. Tap the Share icon in the upper-right corner and choose Edit Notes. Next, tap Select All (if you want everything) or just pick the material you want to save. Tap the Share button, shown at the top of the iPad screen (or at the bottom of the iPhone/iPod Touch screen) and choose a method of delivering the selected text — like Mail, Notes or with another text-sharing app you may have on your device. For example, if you choose Mail, the highlights and notes are copied into the body of an email that you can send to yourself for later use.If you are using the OS X version of iBooks instead, open iBooks, go to the View menu and choose Show Notes Panel; you can also press the Command and numerical 4 keys on the keyboard as a shortcut. Click into the Notes Panel, open the notes you want to copy and choose Select All from the Edit menu (or press the Command and A keys) to select all the text. You can copy and paste the content into a word-processing document or other text applications on the Mac to save the file.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
