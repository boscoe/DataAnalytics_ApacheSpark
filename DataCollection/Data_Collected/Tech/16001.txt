You can set parental controls for the Google Play store within the Google Play app for Android. While setting these restrictions may not prevent your children from seeing prohibited content that comes from a direct web link to the material, the filters should work within the Google Play app. (If you have multiple Android devices you want to police, you must configure the parental controls settings on each device.)To set restrictions, open the Google Play app and tap the three-line menu icon in the top-left corner. Select Settings and then Parental Controls. Tap the button to turn on Parental Controls.Next, create a passcode, then set your limits. For apps and games, you can choose a specific content rating for programs that can be installed on the device. Movies and television shows can be restricted based on the standard industry content ratings like PG-13 for films, or TV-14 for shows. You can also block the purchase of music tracks and e-books tagged as “Explicit.”Amazon’s Kindle tablet hardware, which runs a variation of the Android operating system, has a parental control system for videos and other content in the Settings area. Many Amazon devices include FreeTime software that allows parents to control the apps that can be used, and the amount of time the child can use the tablet.Apple’s system software includes a similar Restrictions feature for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices. To use it, tap the Settings icon on the Home screen, go to General and select Restrictions.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
