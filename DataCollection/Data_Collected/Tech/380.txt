Smartphones increasingly hold our lives — our contacts, messages, credit card data, health care information and the controls to our smart homes — within their sleek metallic finishes. So when we lose the devices, it’s a problem.Smart software means we can track, recover and — if it’s clear the devices are gone for good — wipe the smartphones clean so that no one can steal the data. My iPhone was stolen recently at a neighborhood bar. But with a few taps on a friend’s laptop, I wiped the phone’s data. Then I began saving up for a new device.Here is a primer on how to track and disable your smartphone if it goes missing.1. FIRST, go into settings to enable the phone to back up your data and send you its location. If you have an iPhone, go to settings and tap iCoud. Turn on iCloud Backup, Find My iPhone and Send Last Location.2. IF YOUR DEVICE GOES MISSING, you can then sign into iCloud.com or use the Find My iPhone app to see your device on a map, lock the device and place a message on the home screen with a contact number.3. IF THE PHONE IS REALLY GONE, you can remotely protect the data by clicking the Erase iPhone button on iCloud or the Find My iPhone App. If you have backed up your phone in iCloud, you should be able to download all your information onto a replacement device.4. FOR ANDROID PHONES, go into the device’s settings and then into security to activate the Android Device manager to track and erase a misplaced phone. If you are logged into your Google account, you can also type “find my phone” into a Google search box and see your phone on a map and make it ring, though you can’t lock or erase the phone.
