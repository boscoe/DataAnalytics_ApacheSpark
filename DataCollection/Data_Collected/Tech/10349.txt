The Finder, Apple’s desktop system of icons, files and folders for its Mac computers, can be customized in many ways. If you do not see a Pictures folder in the sidebar (the left pane of an open folder window in the Finder), it most likely has not been enabled in the settings — but you can change it.To get started, click the Finder icon on the left side of the Mac’s desktop dock; if you have not noticed it before, the Finder icon looks like a two-toned blue smiling face that some have speculated was influenced by the artist Pablo Picasso. Next, go to the Finder menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and select Preferences from the menu.In the Finder Preferences box, click the Sidebar tab to see a list of all the items you can show or hide in the left pane of a Finder window. In the Favorites area, turn on the checkbox next to Pictures, Movies, Music and any other icons you wish to see in the sidebar.Along with your favorite icons, the sidebar can also display other places around the Mac that you can jump to with a mouse click, like iCloud folders. The Shared area can show the Back to My Mac feature, connected file servers or devices using Bonjour networking. In the Devices list, you can choose to show or hide your Mac’s main icon, its hard drive icon, connected external drives or connected media like DVDs or an iPod. In later versions of the Mac operating system, you can also show Finder tags in the sidebar.The other tabs in the main Finder Preferences box contain other settings. You can do things like choose tag colors, display connected device icons on the Mac’s desktop or show three-letter extensions on file names.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
