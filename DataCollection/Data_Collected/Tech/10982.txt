Never mind longer tweets, many Twitter users are saying. What about an editing function?After reports on Tuesday that Twitter was considering increasing its character limit to 10,000 from the traditional 140, large numbers of longtime users again began lobbying for the ability to revise their tweets after posting. Facebook has long offered this function.Right now, if tweets have typos or factual errors, users have to live with them or, in extreme cases, delete the original and post a new version, losing any retweets, likes and embedded shares elsewhere.The idea of an editing button or similar tool has attracted fans from all walks of life: Journalists, entrepreneurs and musicians have endorsed the idea.
#Twitter10k Twitter will soon be facebook... Can we get #EditTweet instead?        But it took a member of social media’s ruling class to get a response from Jack Dorsey, the site’s co-founder. Last July, Kim Kardashian said on Twitter that she had emailed a request to edit her posts “so that when u misspell something u don’t have to delete & repost.” Mr. Dorsey praised the idea.
@KimKardashian great idea! We're always looking at ways to make things faster and easier.        Mr. Dorsey’s comment about constant change has been true since the early days of Twitter. Some of the first capabilities the company added to increase user engagement included automatic retweet buttons, embedding tools, favorite buttons and collapsible tweets meant to make it easier to view a conversation. Some of those changes were met with a rocky reception from users, but generally were regarded as attempts to create a better experience for the highly engaged.AdvertisementMore recently, as the platform has struggled to offset sluggish growth, its grasp for new users has alienated those who are irked by the constant change. Some complained when Twitter changed the “favorite” symbol from a star to a “like” heart, experimented with changing the platform’s chronological timeline, and put its new Moments feature a bit too close to old standby tools. Now, every time there is a change, a familiar chorus of dissent erupts.
            Haven't really minded most changes Twitter has made. But it feels like they are ignoring users in the hope of more users. Winning strategy?        
            Shouts to twitter for making features to attract new users and ignoring us day one homies cough cough editing tweets        To some, the character limit extension feels like further evidence that Twitter is ignoring sensible requests from already engaged users. But where extending room to write might cause a fundamental shift in how people use a platform known for brevity, adding an edit button might cause a shift in how tweets are consumed.AdvertisementIn October, Kevin Weil, the senior vice president of product at Twitter, again addressed the proposed feature at a conference, and said that the nature of tweets could change if an edit function were added.“There are real challenges to editing tweets after you post them,” Mr. Weil said, according to Business Insider.Public tweets are often embedded on blogs, other social networks and on news websites. If a tweet is widely shared but then edited significantly, this could complicate the experience for those who share it, which, from a user experience and product standpoint, could become problematic for both new and engaged users.Another argument against the edit button is that altering a widely shared tweet can change its meaning — and give people who misbehave a loophole for covering their tracks.This could have implications for a class of journalists who — whether it is ethically sound or not — expose the bad behavior of strangers on Twitter: Would that be nearly as easy if an editing function existed? (Probably. There’s always the screen grab.)
            1. The common objection to edited tweets is that an unscrupulous tweeter might change meaning of tweet after wide RTing.        “Am I alone in not wanting an ‘edit’ button on Twitter?” Matt Zoller Seitz, the editor in chief of RogerEbert.com, posted on Wednesday. “Seems an invitation to revise history and encourage liars. Why isn’t ‘delete’ enough?”AdvertisementSeveral people who responded to Mr. Seitz suggested an “edited” designation, much like the one Facebook introduced in 2013.
@mattzollerseitz tweets could be marked with some kind of "edited" logo. Maybe clicking on it could reveal previous versions.        Others dreamed up ways to make an editing function more palatable.One user, C. Max Magee, suggested that the edit capability could be constrained by a time limit, not unlike Gmail’s Unsend tool, that would give a user a few moments to reconsider but prevent changes later to the history of a conversation.“They need an edit button that disappears after five minutes, to save you the typo, curse, delete, rewrite, repost routine,” Mr. Magee wrote, adding that the five-minute window “protects folks from abusing the function to change meaning in context of discussions.”As the #EditTweet debate continued on Wednesday, Twitter itself did not respond to a request for comment.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
