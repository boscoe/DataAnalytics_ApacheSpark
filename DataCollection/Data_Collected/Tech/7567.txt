Gabriel Stricker, the chief communications officer of Twitter, left the company Thursday — the first high-level management change under Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder who stepped in on July 1 to run the troubled company temporarily while the board searches for a permanent chief executive to replace Dick Costolo.Twitter issued a statement suggesting that Mr. Stricker’s departure was involuntary: “It continues to be essential that we show the world the value of Twitter. Communications is a key component of that, and to help build toward a stronger future, we are looking now to shift our communications strategy and direction. We will be bringing in new leadership, and we thank Gabriel for his contributions.”In classic Twitter fashion, Mr. Stricker tweeted his goodbye:Thank you @Twitter for an extraordinary ride.
It continues to be much more than a company.

During that time, Twitter completed a successful initial public offering, but has also been dogged by the perception that its service is difficult to use and that the company itself is chaotic. Mr. Stricker’s relationship with Mr. Costolo was strained, but associates believed he had a better relationship with Mr. Dorsey.Twitter declined to say whether Mr. Dorsey fired Mr. Stricker, and no successor was named.Twitter’s board is conducting a formal search for someone to replace Mr. Costolo, who stepped down as chief executive on short notice last month but remains a director. Typically, new chief executives bring in their own person to head communications, so anyone stepping into the job now would risk being replaced in a few months when the new boss took over.
