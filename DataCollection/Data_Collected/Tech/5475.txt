Last year, Amazon had a profit of 23 cents a share in the first quarter.The stock price, which tends to be highly volatile after earnings reports, immediately fell before rising again.For the first time, the web retailer broke out numbers for Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division that previously had been buried in the category “other.” Amazon more or less invented cloud computing, which is expected to become a $100 billion market as established companies rent processing power instead of setting up their own data centers.AWS had net sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter, up 49 percent from $1.05 billion in the first quarter of 2014.“Amazon Web Services is a $5 billion business and still growing fast — in fact it’s accelerating,” Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon.com, said in a statement.Analysts were estimating that Amazon Web Services, which is growing at about 40 percent a year, had annual revenues of as much as $6 billion. Microsoft’s Azure, the company’s cloud computing platform, is in second place, but far behind.“There is no debate over the fact that AWS has much greater scale and better brand awareness than Azure and is further along the path to offering premium services on top of core compute capacity,” Karl Keirstead, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, wrote in a report this week.Amazon Web Services revenue is growing fast enough that ultimately there would be regulatory requirements to disclose it. Amazon, which tries to reveal the minimum about how it works, merely said the current moment was “appropriate.”Shares in Amazon usually move forcefully after the earnings release — often down, but strikingly up after fourth-quarter results were announced three months ago. The stock has risen about 25 percent since then. In regular trading Thursday, the stock barely moved.The sustained rise was enough for Colin Gillis of BGC Partners to downgrade the retailer this week to “hold.”“The company is going to sustain its investment cycle regardless of overall profitability,” he wrote, adding that he was “broadly more positive” on its overall prospective — just not at these prices.Advertisement
