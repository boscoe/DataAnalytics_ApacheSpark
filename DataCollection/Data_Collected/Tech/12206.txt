Sound familiar?These days, interest in artificial intelligence has probably never been higher. The biggest companies are chasing it and venture money is flowing toward it. The same could be said for a couple of other technologies: virtual reality and self-driving cars.In all three cases, the road to widespread commercial success appears longer than around the corner, despite the interest. So it goes with the technology industry. As Steve Lohr reports, “Silicon Valley veterans argue that people routinely overestimate what can be done with new technology in three years, yet underestimate what can be done in 10 years.”There is at least one takeaway from the buildup in these new areas. It is becoming increasingly clear that companies and investors are busy figuring out what happens after our mobile obsession. After nearly a decade of smartphones and apps dominating the headlines, and lining the industry’s pockets with billions of dollars, that seems almost refreshing.Advertisement
