Apple’s product event came and went as foretold by many.Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, rolled out new iPhones, a jumbo-sized iPad, an upgraded Apple TV and other accouterments at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday. Many of the refreshed products had already been teased out by the tech press in the previous weeks and months, and there were few surprises. What stood out, though, was how Apple is starting to do some things it once swore it would never do, writes Katie Benner. That includes a stylus, an accessory that the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had once mocked. Another element that jumped out is how the iPhone, Apple’s biggest moneymaker, continues to dominate the mobile market, writes Farhad Manjoo. While most tech hardware is subject to the forces of commoditization, the iPhone has so far withstood the trend through a mix of services, software and design that have helped distinguish it from other smartphones. For an up-close-and-personal look at the new Apple products, Brian X. Chen spent some time hands-on with the new iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. He also gives a primer on the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 9, and what consumers need to know about it.
