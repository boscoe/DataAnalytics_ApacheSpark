A federal magistrate judge in California ordered Apple to help break into the device, prompting Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, to publicly defy the order.The law gives judges the power to “issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.”The ruling on Monday, by Magistrate Judge James Orenstein, gives Apple a little legal momentum. But the case differs from the California one, in which Apple is being asked to build a way to break into its own phone to access data. In the New York case, the Justice Department says, Apple can already access the data the government is seeking.Advertisement
