Months after President Obama proposed to strengthen digital privacy protection for students, two legislators on Wednesday introduced a comprehensive bill in Congress intended to accomplish that goal.Titled the Student Digital Privacy and Parental Rights Act of 2015, the bill would prohibit operators of websites, apps and other online services for kindergartners through 12th graders from knowingly selling students’ personal information to third parties; from using or disclosing students’ personal information to tailor advertising to them; and from creating personal profiles of students unless it is for a school-related purpose. The bill would give parents access to information held about their children and allow them to correct it; to delete information about their children that schools do not need to retain; and to download any material their children have created.It would allow operators of services to use and disclose aggregated student information without personal identifiers to improve their own educational products or market their effectiveness. And it would allow companies to sell or disclose student information as part of a merger or acquisition, provided the successor company continued to be subject to the restrictions under which the data was originally collected.The bill, modeled in part on a new student online privacy law in California, was introduced by Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican. In a telephone conference with reporters Wednesday morning, Mr. Polis said the bill provided a framework to address the privacy concerns of parents and educators “while at the same time allowing for the promise of education technology to transform our schools.”Despite the bipartisan sponsorship, the bill may be unlikely to pass in a Republican-dominated Congress.The student digital privacy bill comes at a time of widespread government and industry enthusiasm for education technology — along with mounting concerns that many school districts may be ill-prepared to evaluate and adopt digital learning products. The Department of Education, for instance, this month issued a primer for ed tech start-ups in part because many developers have been rolling out their educational apps in classrooms without conducting rigorous studies beforehand to find out whether the products are effective. The chief technology officers of some leading school districts also recently pointed out the challenges they face in managing hundreds of different learning apps that teachers want to use in their classrooms. Officials at the Los Angeles Unified School District are reportedly seeking a refund of millions of dollars from Apple and other companies after an ambitious project to provide students there with iPads, which came preloaded with educational software, went awry, according to an article last week in The Los Angeles Times.The student privacy bill is not intended to address these deeper concerns arising from the proliferation of educational technologies in schools. But if enacted, it would moot some concerns about the potential commercial exploitation of students’ information.Supporters of the bill include the American Federation of Teachers; the National PTA; the School Superintendents Association; and the State Educational Technology Directors Association.So far, the only tech industry company officially supporting the bill is Microsoft.A version of this article appears in print on 05/04/2015, on page B6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Facebook Adding Free Video Calls.
