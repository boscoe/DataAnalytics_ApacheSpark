“I want to build the ESPN of video games.”So said Robert A. Kotick, the chief executive of Activision Blizzard, on Monday, when the company announced that it had bought the assets of Major League Gaming, the e-sports league. As Nick Wingfield reported, one of the top assets Activision will get from the deal is MLG.tv, an online broadcasting network that streams game matches to consoles, personal computers and mobile devices. Mr. Kotick said Activision intended to create a traditional television channel distributed by cable and satellite providers.Mr. Kotick and Activision will need to overcome many challenges to achieve his vision, however.It is not clear that cable companies will want to carry a channel devoted to competitive video games, for example. And e-sports fans can now get their fix of e-sports video online in places like Twitch and YouTube. It is also not clear that they would want to turn to cable television to get the latest scores and highlights — or that less-devoted fans would want to watch, either.
