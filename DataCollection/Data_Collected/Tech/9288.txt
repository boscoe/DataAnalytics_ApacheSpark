Like the gadget in the video? Click to buy!On Tuesday, YouTube said it would make it easier for advertisers to pair their ads with videos highlighting a particular product. The new feature, available in the coming months, will allow viewers to get directly to a retailer’s site with a single click. No searching required. The new feature seems to be particularly appealing on the many videos of product reviews and tutorials, a type of video that has been growing in popularity on YouTube. It also, as Hiroko Tabuchi writes, brings “a shopping element to yet another corner of the Internet, as highly trafficked websites and social networking services increasingly fashion themselves into shopping hubs.”If there was any doubt about that trend, Twitter put it to rest on Wednesday. As Vindu Goel reports, the company is making it possible to put a buy button in a tweet. “A Twitter user,” he wrote, “can then purchase the product in as few as two taps — one tap on the buy button and a second to confirm the purchase.”It has been a big week for new online ad tools and features, several of which have been announced at Advertising Week in New York. As Sydney Ember wrote on Monday, Madison Avenue might still be the heart of the advertising industry, but much of the money — and influence — is coming from Silicon Valley.
