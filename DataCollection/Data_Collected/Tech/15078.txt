It seems to do better with some shots than others.A. Like other image-editing programs that include a “one-click fix” or “auto-correct” type of button, the Enhance feature in Apple’s Photos for OS X (and iOS) analyzes the photo and adjusts the color and contrast to hopefully improve the overall look. The changes may work better on some photos than others, but increasing color and contrast often brightens up pictures.The Enhance button cannot fix problems like blurry shots or compositional issues, but if you want to tinker, you can use the tools in the Adjust menu to make more detailed changes. The Photos Help guide, available under the program’s Help menu in the main Mac toolbar, has more details on how to use the editing tools, but to get started, open the picture you want to improve in the main Photos window and click the Edit button in the upper-right corner. In the Edit window, click the Adjust icon in the toolbar along the right side of the screen.The Adjustments pane opens to reveal sets of sliders you can use to tweak various elements of the image, including exposure, brightness, contrast and saturation. If you do not see several groupings of sliders in your Adjustments panel, click the Add button at the top to select the tools and sliders you want to display.After you have finished adjusting the photo, click the Done button on the top-right corner to save the changes and return to the main Photos screen. If you want to discard the changes, click the Revert to Original button in the Edit window instead.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
