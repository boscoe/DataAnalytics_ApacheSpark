Don’t tell the money-raising folks at Lyft that the days of so-called tech unicorns are numbered.The San Francisco ride-hailing start-up is looking to raise $500 million at a valuation of about $4 billion for the company. That’s up from the current $2.5 billion, according to people familiar with what the company is trying to do.A unicorn, at least in tech industry terms, is a company that is supposed to be worth at least $1 billion. They used to be hard to find, but by the latest count there was more than 140 of them. The biggest of them all is Uber, Lyft’s arch-rival, which is now seeking a round of investment that would value the company at somewhere between $60 billion and $70 billion. Uber has already raised more than $8 billion.Of course, a cynic would argue that when it comes to privately held start-ups, assigning valuations in the billions requires a bit of magical thinking, since these companies don’t have to release their financial results. And there are signs that some investors are getting more judicious about the relative value of some companies.Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, recently discounted its investments in a number of start-ups, including a 25-percent haircut for its investment in the hot messaging service Snapchat. Earlier this year, the giant asset manager BlackRock also discounted another highly valued start-up, the online storage service Dropbox.Lyft has already raised more than $1 billion. But when you are a unicorn that intends to change the world, there is no such thing as having too much money.
