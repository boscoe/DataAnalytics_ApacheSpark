HONG KONG — Amazon.com’s Japan unit has said that it is cooperating with the local authorities in an investigation into whether child pornography has been sold on its website. “We take this investigation seriously, and we are cooperating fully with the authorities,” Amazon said in a statement Monday. “We don’t permit illegal items on our site, and we have systems and processes designed to prevent and remove illegal items from being listed.”On Friday, the Japanese police raided Amazon’s Tokyo headquarters, a distribution center and the offices of an affiliate, according to a report by the Japanese news agency Kyodo.The police were searching for evidence that the site was selling child pornography, like books with photos of nude girls under the age of 18, according to local news reports, which said that listings of child pornography often are not removed quickly from the site, although the material is illegal. The Japanese authorities raided an Amazon distribution center last year in connection with the potential sale of child pornography, the Kyodo report said. Two men also were arrested in September after books containing images of underage girls were found on sale through the American e-commerce giant’s Japanese website.  The allegations of child pornography sales have drawn anger from some consumers and nonprofit groups.Amazon said in its statement Monday, “We are committed to enforcing our policies and the law for items listed on our site.”
