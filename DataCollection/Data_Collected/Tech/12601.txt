Apple has refused, on the grounds that it is being denied due process and cannot under the First Amendment be forced to write the code the F.B.I. needs to unlock the phone.In its legal filing, Apple tried to damp the emotional tone of the court fight — if not the public fight — and focus on legal arguments. A federal court hearing is scheduled for March 22.Advertisement
