WASHINGTON — Home prices in the United States climbed at a faster pace in February than the previous month, a Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller index found, driven by higher sales and a limited supply of available houses.The 20-city home price index rose 5 percent in February from 12 months earlier, S.&P. said Tuesday. That is up from a 4.5 percent pace in January.Faster sales most likely drove the price gain. Signed contracts to buy homes jumped in February, yet the number of Americans listing their homes for sale remains low. That has led to bidding wars in some cities.Home prices are increasing at a more sustainable pace than in the last two years, when they rose at a double-digit pace for 14 straight months. Yet some economists warn that continuing increases may price many would-be buyers out of the market, particularly as pay gains remain weak.Advertisement"While slow and steady growth throughout the country may sound like an unambiguously good thing, some of these markets were unaffordable to begin with and are not getting any cheaper," said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight.
            Index measuring attitudes toward the economy, 1985=100.        110100908070’14’15All 20 cities in the index reported year-over-year price gains in February. Home prices in Denver jumped 10 percent, the most of any city, followed by San Francisco with 9.8 percent. Denver is one of two cities, along with Dallas, where prices have surpassed their previous peak during the housing boom. Prices nationwide are 10 percent lower than the July 2006 peak.AdvertisementSome areas may remain below their bubble peaks for years. Home prices in Las Vegas plunged nearly 62 percent during the housing bust and are still 41.5 percent below their previous peak, S.&P. said.Also Tuesday, the Conference Board said consumer confidence in the United States fell this month to the lowest level in four months, knocked down by a slowdown in hiring. Its consumer confidence index fell to 95.2 in April from 101.4 in March, the lowest reading since 93.1 in December.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Americans were also more likely to say that there would be fewer jobs and that their incomes would be lower in six months. The share saying that they planned to buy a car or a major appliance within six months fell. The decline in confidence hit all age groups.Also weighing on consumers’ spirits were gasoline prices, which tumbled to a nationwide average low of $2.03 a gallon in late January and have bounced back up to $2.55 a gallon, according to AAA.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
