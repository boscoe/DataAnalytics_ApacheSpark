It would begin trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange in Stockholm on Nov. 25.An EQT fund “will remain a large shareholder in Dometic after the listing, and I am fully confident in the company’s ability to continue successfully implementing its growth strategy and create value for its shareholders,” said Harry Klagsbrun, a partner at EQT.The offering will consist of share sales to retail and institutional investors in Sweden and a private placement to qualified institutional investors outside Sweden.AMF, Handelsbanken Fonder and Nordea Funds have agreed to act as cornerstone investors and to acquire shares worth about 1.4 billion kronor, or about 9.8 percent of the company, based on the midpoint of the expected price range.Dometic, which is based in Solna, Sweden, manufactures heating and air-conditioning systems, refrigerators and appliances for boats, recreational vehicles and other passenger vehicles.
