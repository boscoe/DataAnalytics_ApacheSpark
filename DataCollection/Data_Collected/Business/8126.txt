The subsidiary ended the quarter with a United States market share of 12.4 percent, which represented a slight increase from the second quarter in 2014.The subsidiary also improved its cash position during the period, ending the quarter with net cash — excluding financial liabilities — of $2.1 billion. At the end of the first quarter, it had about $1.2 billion.Advertisement
