But “Cars 3” will shift into high gear and arrive a year sooner.Those were among the changes that Walt Disney Studios made to its movie release schedule in an announcement on Thursday. Disney set or shifted release dates for 19 big-budget movies — many still untitled – planned through 2020. The studio offered no explanation for its scheduling decisions.“Cars 3” and “Toy Story 4” will swap years, with Lightning McQueen now arriving in June 2017 and Buzz Lightyear showing up in June 2018. The Marvel superhero film “Black Panther” was moved up five months, to February 2018, which takes it out of the more competitive summer corridor. A newly announced Marvel sequel, “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” will take the old “Black Panther” slot in July 2018.“Captain Marvel” will now be released in March 2019, four months later than expected. The previously undated “Incredibles 2” from Pixar will arrive in June 2019.As studios have increasingly focused on expensive event movies intended to attract a global audience, they have started to camp out on release dates further in advance. Summer, Christmas and Thanksgiving are the most coveted release windows, but March and April, when many students are on spring break, are also prized; studios are also steering major films into January and February — traditionally quiet months on the United States movie calendar — to take advantage of national holidays in China. But only one other studio, Warner Brothers, has claimed dates as far out as 2020.Between Disney and Warner alone, major superhero movies will now be released in April, May, July and November of that year.Advertisement
