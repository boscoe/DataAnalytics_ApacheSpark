The company reported nearly a 10 percent gain in sales of its F-Series pickup truck and a 29 percent improvement in S.U.V.s.Analysts said some of Ford’s improvement could be traced to deliveries to rental fleets, but mostly attributed the overall increase to consumer demand for virtually all of the company’s models.“Ford’s growth in almost every category confirms its success in meeting demand throughout the new-vehicle market,” Mr. Brauer said.Fiat Chrysler, the smallest of the three domestic automakers, said it sold 182,000 vehicles in February, up 11.8 percent from last year.While sales of its passenger cars declined by 27 percent, the company said that sales of its Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups both rose by 23 percent during the month.Foreign automakers also enjoyed good months, with Honda reporting an increase in sales of 12.8 percent and Nissan reporting a 10.5-percent improvement.Advertisement
