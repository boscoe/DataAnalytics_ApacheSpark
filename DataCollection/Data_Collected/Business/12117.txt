The increase in January was the largest since March 2015.Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 3.9 percent after tumbling by a revised 3.7 percent in December. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have decreased 4.3 percent in December.The durable goods report was the latest indication that the worst of the manufacturing downturn was probably over. Manufacturing output rose solidly in January, and factory payrolls that month increased by the most since August 2013.The report also added to data on retail sales, employment, existing-home sales and industrial production in suggesting that the economy regained its footing at the start of the year after stumbling in the fourth quarter.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the American economy, remains constrained by a strong dollar, weak global demand and capital spending cuts by oil field service companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton after a plunge in oil prices.Efforts by businesses to sell unwanted inventory have also meant fewer orders placed, adding to pressure on factories. Tighter financial conditions after a global stock market sell-off pose a risk to capital spending.“While today’s report breathes some life into the outlook for the troubled manufacturing sector, as well as prospects for business spending, we are not out of the woods yet,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C.In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 272,000 for the week that ended Feb. 20. The four-week moving average of claims, which irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,250 to 272,000.It was the 51st week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with a strong labor market. That is the longest spell since the early 1970s, and the labor market remains strong despite the tighter financial market conditions.Advertisement
