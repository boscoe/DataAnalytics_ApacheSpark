However, they will not face restrictions on the servicing of mortgages that the banks issue themselves.In the announcement on Wednesday, the O.C.C. also said that it was handing over to states about $280 million that it had received as part of a 2011 settlement related to the financial crisis.The regulatory agency says it was unable to distribute the money to affected homeowners, and was giving the money to the states in the hope that they would have more success in finding eligible homeowners to receive the money.The banks could not all be immediately reached for comment.Advertisement
