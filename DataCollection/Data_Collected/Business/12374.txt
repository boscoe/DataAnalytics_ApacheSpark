Trump claimed in September that hedge fund managers were “getting away with murder” by avoiding taxes, while Senator Bernie Sanders argues that “it is time to break up the largest financial institutions in the country.”There is the oft-heard refrain that individual executives were not held accountable for violations that led to the financial crisis. Hillary Clinton promises to cut into the bonuses of executives when their companies violate the law, “and when egregious misconduct happens on an executive’s watch, that executive should lose his or her job.”Campaign rhetoric rarely gets into the details of just how the financial sector should be tamed. Simply calling for greater policing of management is unlikely to change how they operate, especially when there is little threat of personal liability for individuals.Although “Downton Abbey” has ended its run, something better may be coming from Britain: new rules that can furnish a guide for how to hold senior managers accountable when their companies violate regulatory requirements.Under provisions approved by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority that went into effect on Monday, high-level management at banks have a “statutory duty of responsibility” under which they must “take reasonable steps to prevent regulatory breaches in the areas of the firm for which they are responsible.” A failure to take those steps can result in an enforcement action against the executive, which could lead to civil fines and even removal from the firm.This provision for individual management responsibility for violations is actually weaker than an earlier proposal. As originally drafted, the rules created a “reverse burden of proof” that would have required executives to prove that they took all reasonable steps to prevent a violation, otherwise they could be punished. This was more of a “shoot first, ask questions later” approach to liability that drew substantial opposition from the banking sector.The new rules currently apply only to the banking sector, but will expand in 2017 to cover other financial companies that have a substantial impact on the economy, including insurance companies, securities firms and commodities brokers. The financial crisis showed that it was much more than the banks that contributed to the near meltdown, so a wider range of firms need to be brought under the regulatory umbrella.The approach of imposing responsibility for ensuring regulatory compliance on individual executives has been required in limited circumstances in the United States. A provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, adopted in 2002 after accounting frauds at Enron and WorldCom, requires the chief executive and chief financial officer of a company whose shares are traded on the public markets to certify that its financial reports comply with the accounting rules, including those for adequate internal controls. That law caused corporate executives to be much more careful about corporate accounting procedures, lest they risk a criminal prosecution that could result in up to 10 years in prison for a knowing violation.That law is much more limited than the new British rules because it only covers two top members of corporate management, and applies to just corporate financial statements and internal controls. Regulatory violations can come from a number of areas, such as environmental discharges and health care reimbursement, which have little to do with accounting yet can cost a company millions of dollars in penalties in addition to the cost of conducting an internal investigation.The quest to hold corporate executives accountable seems to be a never-ending search for a mechanism creating a strong enough incentive for them to change the corporate culture. Attacking bonuses has been offered as another means for getting the attention of senior management by putting their personal assets at risk.A provision of the Dodd-Frank Act expanded the use of clawbacks by requiring public companies to adopt policies to recover incentive-based compensation paid to executives when there is a restatement of previously issued financial statements. The problem with this approach is that it is prompted only by a restatement not by other regulatory violations, and gets to only one component of executive pay, leaving untouched regular salaries — some of which are quite substantial.Professors Claire A. Hill and Richard W. Painter, who teach at the University of Minnesota Law School, wrote a book, “Better Bankers, Better Banks” (University of Chicago Press, 2015), in which they argue that executives at financial firms should be held personally liable for a portion of any fines imposed for a violation and fraud-based judgments, including settlements.Under their proposal, multibillion-dollar payments like those made by global banks JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to settle cases for their sales of mortgage-backed securities in the years before the financial crisis would result in exposure for their executives, which at least puts their pocketbooks on the line even if the bulk of the penalty is absorbed by shareholders.Any effort to adopt rules like those of the regulators in Britain, or the professors’ proposal, is likely to run into significant resistance from Wall Street. The Department of Labor’s proposed rule to impose on brokers giving advice on retirement savings a requirement to put their clients’ interests first, called a fiduciary duty, would seem to be unremarkable for firms helping to manage money for investors. But it has provoked criticism from Wall Street, including claims of financial catastrophe for small investors. The financial firms can be expected to fight any change that might expose their executives to greater liability or require more spending to comply with the law.Getting financial executives to change the culture of their firms will not be easy, as campaign promises to “clean up Wall Street” have been made before but cause hardly a ripple on Wall Street.The British rules might be worthwhile for a new administration to consider as a means to focus management on treating regulatory requirements as a topic worthy of their attention as much as increasing corporate profitability.Advertisement
