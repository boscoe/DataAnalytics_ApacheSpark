Bernstein in London, said that while the Turkish Stream project might still proceed, searching for a new contractor with the required pipe-laying ships would delay the project at least six months.He also said that Gazprom’s treatment of Saipem probably had damaged the Russian company’s reputation with other contractors. “I would imagine that international contractors would definitely think twice” about working for Gazprom, he said.Gazprom embarked on the Turkey project late last year after it canceled a plan to build a pipeline under the Black Sea and across Southern Europe in response to opposition from the European Union and the United States.Critics of that plan, called South Stream, said that it was a vehicle for Russia to tighten its near monopoly on energy supplies to countries in Eastern and Southern Europe. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia abruptly canceled the South Stream plan in December and said that Gazprom would shift the route and send gas through Turkey instead.In June, Gazprom and Greece signed  a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a gas pipeline, an extension of the one that will carry Russian gas to Europe through Turkey, in what appeared to be an effort by the Greek government to press its European creditors while it negotiated the terms of a potential bailout deal.When Saipem heard that its contract with Gazprom had been canceled, one of its pipe-laying ships, the Castoro 6, was in Russian waters, preparing to lay the first pipes for the project. Another large vessel, the Saipem 7000, was standing by in the Black Sea.Saipem was the main contractor on the South Stream project, but Gazprom kept a fleet of the Italian company’s ships waiting in the Black Sea for seven months while it tried to find a route that would bring the gas ashore in Turkey rather than in Bulgaria as originally intended. Shares of Saipem closed down 2.34 percent Thursday.Saipem said in a statement that the termination was for “convenience,” which was part of a standard contractual clause. It added that the terms of the contract allowed for compensation.The companies could not reach an agreement because of “numerous operational and commercial issues related to the new Turk Stream project,” said South Stream Transport, the Amsterdam-based subsidiary of Gazprom that is in charge of the offshore section of the pipeline.“Other project-related works remain ongoing,” it said, “and the company will commence discussions with potential offshore pipe-laying contractors for line one of the Turk Stream project shortly.”Mr. Green wrote in a note to clients on Thursday that the disagreement may have centered on added costs because of the new route to Turkey.Advertisement
