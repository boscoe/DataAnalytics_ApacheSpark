Lloyds has also entered an irrevocable agreement to sell its remaining 40.01 percent stake in the lender as part of a tender offer by Sabadell to TSB shareholders.The lender said that this was the last quarter in which it expected TSB to be reflected in its results. The charge in the first quarter included a loss on sale of TSB of £660 million and various costs associated with carving out the bank from Lloyds.For the three months ended March 31, the British bank reported a profit of £944 million, down from £1.16 billion in the first quarter of 2014.“We have made a strong start to the next phase of our strategy to become the best bank for customers and shareholders, as we continue to support and benefit from U.K. economic growth,” António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, said in a news release.“I am pleased with the continued improvement in financial strength and performance in the first quarter and expect our plan to deliver sustainable growth and improved returns,” he said.The lender said underlying profit, which excludes asset sales, restructuring costs and other items, rose 21 percent to £2.18 billion, from £1.8 billion.Lloyds posted a pretax profit of £1.21 billion.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, rose 7 percent to £3.02 billion, from £2.81 billion in the same period a year earlier.Lloyds said that impairments it had set aside for bad and underperforming loans declined 59 percent, to £177 million in the quarter from £431 million in the first quarter of 2014.The bank said that its costs were flat at £2.29 billion in the first quarter.During the quarter, the British government also continued to reduce its stake in the lender through share sales and now owns about 20.95 percent of Lloyds. The British government had held as much as a 40 percent stake after its £17 billion bailout.Advertisement
