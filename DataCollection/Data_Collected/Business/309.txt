SABMiller has said that the unsolicited proposals have substantially undervalued the company, “its unique and unmatched footprint and its stand-alone prospects.”The announcement of higher cost-cutting ambitions on Friday was the latest salvo in an increasingly contentious back-and-forth between SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest brewer. SABMiller said that it expected to cut its annual costs by at least $1.05 billion by March 2020, after originally setting a target of cutting costs by $500 million by March 2018.On Thursday, Anheuser-Busch said it was “surprised” that SABMiller’s board still believed the latest takeover offer undervalued the company and said that the claim “lacks credibility.”Under British takeover rules, Anheuser-Busch has until Wednesday to make what is considered a formal offer for SABMiller or walk away for up to six months. Under British law, the proposals so far have not been considered formal offers.The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.On Friday, SABMiller said that about 70 percent of the anticipated cost savings are expected to come from its procurement operations and the remaining 30 percent would come from its manufacturing and distribution arms.“The measures we are announcing today are a continuation of our existing cost-saving program,” Alan Clark, the company’s chief executive, said in a news release.“We are continuing to remove duplication across markets, bringing specialist expertise in areas like procurement under one roof, and standardizing common processes,” he added. “It results in our markets being freed up to concentrate on what they do best — growing revenue with local consumers and customers.”The new cost targets came as SABMiller this week gave investors an earlier-than-expected look at its performance in the second quarter, which ended Sept. 30.The brewer said that revenue, minus the impact of currency translation, increased 6 percent in the quarter, driven by gains in Latin America and Africa. Including the effect of currencies declining against the United States dollar, revenue was down 9 percent in the quarter, SABMiller said in a news release. But the company did not provide any information on profitability.SABMiller said that it would meet with investors on Friday to discuss its recent trading statement and update them on its operations.The shareholder update came as the American tobacco giant Altria Group, which owns about 27 percent of SABMiller, said this week that it was willing to support the Anheuser-Busch InBev deal. SABMiller’s board, minus directors nominated by Altria Group, rejected Anheuser-Busch InBev’s latest approach on Oct. 7.Under the terms of the latest bid, Anheuser-Busch InBev said that it would be willing to pay 42.15 pounds, or about $64.56, a share in cash for SABMiller. That would value the company at as much as $104 billion.But the bid includes a precondition that would require SABMiller’s largest shareholders to agree to support the deal and accept shares in lieu of cash at a rate of £37.49 a share, a discount to the cash price. As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would most likely pay £65.1 billion.Anheuser-Busch InBev is hoping to entice SABMiller’s two largest shareholders — Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia — to accept the deal by offering shares. Both would face huge tax bills if they sold their holdings.Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, said this week that it “does not currently have the support” of the Santo Domingo family, whose BevCo owns 14 percent.The deal, if it were to be completed, would create a combined company with $64 billion in annual revenue that commands 30 percent of global beer sales. Any deal between the brewing giants would most likely face significant regulatory scrutiny.Advertisement
