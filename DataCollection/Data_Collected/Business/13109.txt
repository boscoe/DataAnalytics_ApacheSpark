PETERSBURG, Fla. — A judge agreed on Monday to release a trove of previously sealed documents related to the Hulk Hogan sex tape trial against Gawker Media, which concluded in March with a jury awarding the former wrestler $140.1 million in damages after three and a half years of litigation.Judge Pamela A. M. Campbell of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of Pinellas County, who called the trial and its follow-up motions “unusual” and “crazy” during Monday’s proceedings, ordered the release of dozens of documents that were sealed during the trial. They were sought by a legal team representing a group of news media outlets that have covered the case.Gawker Media’s flagship website, Gawker.com, posted a nearly two-minute excerpt from a secretly recorded video of Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, having sex with a friend’s wife in 2007. Mr. Bollea had sued for $100 million, claiming invasion of privacy.Alison Steele, a lawyer for the media organizations and lead counsel for The Tampa Bay Times, said it normally took one to two days for records to be unsealed and made public.In addition to the Tampa paper, The Associated Press, CNN, First Look Media Journal Broadcast Group and Scripps Media fought to have the documents released.Advertisement
