It was the second time the two firms had taken the business private.Late last year, a rival, PetSmart, agreed to sell itself in a buyout led by the investment firm BC Partners for about $8.7 billion.Petco’s other investors include the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, an arm of the emirate, and Freeman Spogli & Company, another private equity firm.According to an initial prospectus, Petco has recorded steadily rising sales, though profits have been more volatile. The company earned $75.3 million in its 2014 fiscal year, down 11 percent from 2013 and down 24 percent from 2012.The company said that as of Aug. 1 it operated 1,409 stores across the United States and Puerto Rico and 13 stores in Mexico through a joint venture.Other details, including how much the company planned to raise or on which exchange it will trade, were left blank. The prospectus listed a preliminary $100 million fund-raising target to calculate filing fees.The offering will be led by Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase.Advertisement
