Eramo, an associate dean of students, is also suing the author of the article, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and Rolling Stone’s parent company, Wenner Media. She is seeking nearly $8 million in damages.Rolling Stone declined to comment.The article, titled “A Rape on Campus” described a brutal gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity. It was initially praised for shedding light on the issue of campus rape, and the problems that some students have in pursuing their attackers. But it later emerged that the magazine had not tried to independently verify allegations, some of them explosive, made by one source, identified as Jackie in the article.On April 5 the magazine retracted the article, and presented a report it had commissioned from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, which described a series of reportorial failings.The lawsuit, filed in the Charlottesville Circuit Court, asserts that the magazine made defamatory statements about Ms. Eramo, a prominent character in the article, to present a narrative that she had “discouraged the reporting of a violent rape to law enforcement because she was more concerned with protecting the university’s reputation than with assisting victims of sexual assault,” the statement said.In an interview, Libby Locke, one of the lawyers representing Ms. Eramo, said that she began working with Ms. Eramo shortly after the article was published last November. Though the First Amendment provides protection to the media and such lawsuits are hard to win, she said, “we are confident in this case.”Advertisement
