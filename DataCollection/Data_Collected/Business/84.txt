Attorneys general from at least 30 states and the District of Columbia are organizing a bipartisan coalition to undertake an investigation into the possibilities of consumer fraud and environmental violations by the German automaker Volkswagen.At least two of the attorneys general, from New York and Illinois, have served subpoenas on the company, according to people briefed on the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The multistate inquiry is taking shape unusually quickly after last week’s announcement by Volkswagen that it had installed software in 11 million diesel cars that was designed to trick emissions testers, making it appear that the vehicles met pollution standards.Typically, it takes attorneys general in such multistate inquiries weeks to organize and agree on a preliminary strategy. One difference this time is that the target of the investigation, Volkswagen, has admitted that it intended to deceive regulators.Advertisement“From the standpoint of an investigator, this case is like arriving at a buffet table that has everything spread out, and it’s just a question of choosing which course to taste first,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat and a former state attorney general from Connecticut who has worked on multistate cases.AdvertisementA spokesman for Volkswagen, John Schilling, said, “I cannot comment on pending or active litigation.”In the days since its admission, Volkswagen has become the target of a flurry of legal inquiries. Several law firms have said they have filed lawsuits on behalf of unhappy vehicle owners and lessees. German prosecutors are looking into possible criminal fraud.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            The United States Justice Department has opened an investigation into the company’s deception that could result in criminal or civil charges, or both. While the section of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to automakers does not mention criminal liability for emissions violations, federal prosecutors may still be able to bring criminal charges under another provision of the act or other laws, including those relating to lying to regulators.As part of a congressional investigation, a House subcommittee has scheduled a hearing on Volkswagen’s emissions issues for next week.Criminal investigations have also begun in Europe. On Friday, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor’s office confirmed that French authorities had opened a preliminary inquiry against Volkswagen’s French subsidiary on accusations of “aggravated deception” of consumers in connection with the revelations. If found guilty, the company could face a fine of up to 600,000 euros, or $675,000.Volkswagen has said that close to one million diesel cars sold in France, including VW, Audi, Skoda and SEAT models, were fitted with software designed to rig their performance during emissions tests.Italy’s antitrust office also said on Friday that it had opened its own investigation. “Consumer choice might have been distorted by the Volkswagen group’s claims concerning the class of emission standards in both its advertising campaigns and the brochures distributed by dealers,” the Italian Competition Authority said in a statement. Volkswagen has said the scandal affects roughly 650,000 vehicles sold in Italy.AdvertisementThe multistate investigation in the United States will follow two parallel tracks, one focusing on possible instances of fraud against consumers and one focusing on potential violations of environmental laws, according to people in several states who were briefed on the investigation. Attorneys general from as many as seven states, including New York, Connecticut, Oregon, Tennessee and Massachusetts, are expected to lead the charge, these people say.In addition to the District of Columbia, the states joining forces include: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.California will not join the group, according to a person at the state’s Justice Department, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Instead, it will pursue its own inquiry.This week, the office of the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, served subpoenas on Volkswagen, its Audi unit and Volkswagen’s American affiliate, according to people briefed on the investigation, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. The subpoenas seek communication records related to the testing of diesel vehicles and the development of the so-called defeat devices used to trick the emissions testers, along with the company’s communications with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.In addition, they seek documents detailing the people or companies that designed, manufactured and programmed the defeat devices and records on Volkswagen’s decision not to install technology in many of its diesel vehicles that would use a chemical known as urea to combat smog-forming pollutants, as some automakers do. The subpoenas also seek examples of advertising and marketing materials, including those that appeared on the web and in social media, and records of Volkswagen’s organizational structure in its engineering and marketing divisions.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Other states said they, too, expected to send subpoenas in the coming weeks.“We’re going after them,” said Ellen F. Rosenblum, the attorney general of Oregon, which has more affected Volkswagen vehicles per capita than any other state. She said her office was drafting subpoenas that would address the consumer and environmental sides of the inquiry. She said she expected the case to move quickly, given that Volkswagen had acknowledged its actions.James E. Tierney, a former attorney general in Maine who now runs a program at Columbia University that conducts research on state attorneys general, is less optimistic that the cases will move swiftly. While the company has been forthright in describing its deception, he said, it will still be motivated to minimize any potential cost.Potential damages for the company, Mr. Tierney said, might be “incalculable,” with each false advertisement to consumers, for example, carrying a potential penalty. “This product was designed to operate illegally, and that is very serious,” he said.Nicola Clark and Danny Hakim contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on October 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Volkswagen Is Targeted in Inquiry by 30 States .
