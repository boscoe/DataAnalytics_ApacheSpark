The American economy turned in a better performance last quarter than first thought, expanding at a 2.1 percent rate, the government said on Tuesday.Nearly all of the improvement was because of revised data on inventories, which showed businesses restocking shelves at a faster pace than the government first estimated. The improvement in inventory levels was offset by a slight downward revision in consumer spending last quarter.Although well below the 3.9 percent pace of growth recorded in the spring, the economy’s advance was better than the initial 1.5 percent rate for the third quarter that the Commerce Department reported late last month.Wall Street economists had been expecting the upward revision for gross domestic product, which is the second of three estimates for growth that the government will release. The final set of numbers will come out on Dec. 22.AdvertisementFor all of 2015, the rate of economic growth is expected to be about 2.5 percent, not much different from the 2.4 percent rate in 2014.AdvertisementThe tepid pace prompted Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, to call this the “tortoise recovery” in a recent note to clients. But that sobriquet does not mean the economy has been uniformly lackluster.“While this expansion may go uncelebrated, growth in fact has been good enough to achieve a great deal of cumulative progress in the labor market,” he added. “We now expect that the U.S. economy will reach full employment within the next 12 months — the ‘tortoise recovery’ looks to be approaching the finishing line.”As for the third quarter, the more refined inventory numbers provided a lift to growth, but they are likely to slow down reported economic activity in the current fourth quarter as manufacturers and retailers cut back on restocking of warehouses and backroom stores.

“The inventory revision was even bigger than we expected,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.One mildly downbeat note on Tuesday was an unexpected drop in consumer sentiment this month, with the Conference Board reporting that its index for consumer confidence fell to 90.4 from 99.1 in October. Despite a strong advance in hiring last month, consumers expressed more caution about the job market and future economic conditions in the most recent survey.Consumer attitudes in the United States should rebound. “U.S. consumers are cash-rich and increasingly secure in their jobs,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Confidence won’t remain at the soft November level.”Nothing in the latest data is expected to derail plans by Federal Reserve policy makers to raise their benchmark interest rate at their meeting next month. The Fed’s key lever for influencing the economy has been stuck at close to zero since December 2008.AdvertisementWith the unemployment rate falling to 5 percent in October and employers bolstering payrolls by 271,000, Fed officials are likely to conclude when they meet next month that the economy is strong enough to handle the first increase in interest rates in nearly a decade.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

On Saturday, the president of the San Francisco Fed, John Williams, echoed that view.“The data, I think, have been overall encouraging, especially on the labor market,” he said. “If that continues to happen, there’s a strong case to be made in December to raise rates.”In a separate report on Tuesday, the release of the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for September showed a seasonally adjusted gain of 0.6 percent in home prices around the country, double the 0.3 percent increase economists were expecting and the biggest monthly gain since March.

Of the 20 cities surveyed in the index, prices were up in 19 in September; the Detroit area was unchanged. On a yearly basis, home prices in 20 cities in the Case-Shiller index are up 5.5 percent.Some cities, especially tech hot spots, are posting even larger gains. Home prices in San Francisco are up 11.2 percent over the last 12 months, and Portland registered a 10.1 percent jump.Most economists expect the pace of interest rate increases by the Fed to be gradual and predict steady gains to continue for the housing market in the next 12 months, especially if the recent uptick in wages gathers strength and the stock market remains buoyant.As the unemployment rate has fallen, there are signs that wages are finally beginning to pick up as well. That should help overall economic growth next year, especially if consumers who did not see gains earlier in the recovery finally have more disposable income.While still relatively modest, the pace of growth last quarter was in some ways better than the numbers might suggest. Revised down to 3 percent from 3.2 percent in the initial estimate for the third quarter, consumer spending remained healthy, with an especially strong performance from the auto sector.AdvertisementConsumption during the current fourth quarter, including the holiday shopping season, is expected to increase at an annualized rate of about 3 percent. But the overall economic growth rate for the months of October, November and December is forecast by many analysts to be closer to the third-quarter figure.The final big economic clue before the Fed meets on Dec. 15 and 16 is scheduled for Friday, Dec. 4, when the Labor Department reports data on unemployment and hiring in November.On Tuesday, Barclays predicted November’s data would show a healthy gain of 200,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.9 percent, breaking the 5 percent threshold that many economists consider close to full employment.“Although a far weaker-than-expected outcome for this employment report could still cause the Fed to push rate hikes past year-end,” Barclays said in a note to clients, “we view such a scenario as a low probability event.”A version of this article appears in print on November 25, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Economic Growth for 3rd Quarter Is Revised Up, to a 2.1% Clip.
