The warehouse club Costco has chosen Citigroup and Visa to run its co-branded credit card starting next year, replacing American Express, which lost the coveted deal last month. Citigroup will exclusively issue the Costco branded cards and Visa will provide the payment network in the United States and Puerto Rico from April 1, 2016, Costco said. The deal means that Costco customers will be able to use only Visa credit cards at its stores, as is currently true with American Express cards.A version of this brief appears in print on March 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Costco To Offer Citigroup and Visa Co-Branded Cards.
