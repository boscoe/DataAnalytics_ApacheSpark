For years, financial planners have advised their clients to reduce their stock market plays as they age. Buying and holding high-quality bonds may seem less rewarding, but it could protect retirees from gyrations when a big loss of principal would be devastating.Now one of America’s biggest pension funds is considering whether to apply that principle to its giant portfolio, as record numbers of its members are reaching retirement age and drawing their benefits.The board of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as Calstrs, is discussing whether it would be best to shift as much as $20 billion of its portfolio out of stocks and even out of some fixed-income positions, in favor of something new, a “risk mitigation strategy.”The strategy is not a new asset class but an approach. At a meeting on Wednesday, consultants told the trustees that it could involve holding very safe securities like Treasury securities, using hedge funds, or shifting money into assets expected to rise in value during stock bear markets.AdvertisementMany corporate pension funds have adopted some form of risk mitigation, but the approach is seldom seen among public pension funds.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The number of California teachers who are drawing their benefits has been rising every year, and they are enjoying longer, healthier life spans than actuaries predicted in the past.AdvertisementNot surprisingly, the payouts to the retirees have grown every year as well. The average payment to a retiree last year was $44,328, while in 2005 it was $31,404.The problem is that annual contributions to the pension fund, from the state and its many school districts, have stayed more or less flat.The employees of Calstrs said that they would continue with modeling and that the trustees did not have to make a decision until the end of the year.A version of this article appears in print on September 3, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Calstrs Eyes a Strategy to Cut Risk.
