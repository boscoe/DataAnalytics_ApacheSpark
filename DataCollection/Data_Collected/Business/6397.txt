AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks fell slightly on Thursday after a sell-off in the Chinese market and as worry continued over the approaching debt-payment deadline for cash-starved Greece.The overall market was quiet. Energy and industrial stocks were among the biggest decliners. Most investors appeared to be in a “wait and see” mode.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 36.87 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,126.12. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index edged down 2.69 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,120.79, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 8.62 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,097.98. In corporate news, the chip makers Avago Technologies and Broadcom agreed to merge in a $37 billion deal. Avago shares rose 89 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $142.38. Broadcom shares fell 90 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $56.25. Both stocks jumped sharply on Wednesday — Broadcom by 22 percent and Avago by 8 percent — reflecting speculation about a deal.In Greece, progress in talks between that country and its creditors remained unclear. Greece said it expected to reach a deal to receive more bailout loans in time to make a crucial debt payment on June 5. Its creditors were quick to temper expectations.The fiscal problems in Greece have been a recurring headache for investors, and many are skeptical that this round of talks will resolve the country’s debt problems.“They’re likely to kick the can down the road, as they have been,” said Scott L. Wren, a market strategist with Wells Fargo. “At this point, I think we’re likely looking at Greece leaving the eurozone.”In European markets, Greek stocks fell 1.7 percent. Germany’s DAX lost 0.8 percent, France’s CAC-40 lost 0.9 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 percent. Investors are also searching for insight into when the Federal Reserve might start raising interest rates. The central bank is expected to increase rates as early as September, but its policy makers say any increase will depend on how the United States economy is progressing.Investors were also unnerved by the sell-off in Asia. Chinese shares plunged on Thursday after big gains over the last three months. The Shanghai Composite dropped more than 6 percent, but it is still more than double what it was a year ago.The stock market commentator Hexun attributed the fall to several factors, including brokerage firms tightening lending to individual investors, selling by speculators and a Chinese sovereign wealth fund’s selling shares in two state banks.Despite an economic slowdown in China, the Shanghai index has gained 40 percent in the last three months. The Chinese government has tried to slow the stock market boom, worried that it could run out of control and disrupt changes in economic policy. In the United States, government bond prices inched down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.14 percent from 2.13 late Wednesday. The price fell 2/32, to 99 29/32 from 99 31/32. In energy markets, oil ended slightly higher after the government reported larger-than-expected declines in United States oil and gasoline supplies. The price of United States oil rose 17 cents to $57.68 a barrel after being down $1 a barrel earlier. Brent crude, used by many refiners in the United States in the production of gasoline, rose 52 cents to $62.58 in London. In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline gained 4.1 cents to $1.985 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1.4 cents to $1.87 a gallon, and natural gas fell 14.1 cents to $2.706 per 1,000 cubic feet.In the metals markets, gold rose $2.50 to $1,188.10 an ounce, silver rose 2 cents to $16.67 an ounce, and high-grade copper was unchanged at $2.77 a pound.Advertisement
