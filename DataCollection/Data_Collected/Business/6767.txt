After years of increases, home prices in China have begun to drop. This is good news for buyers, but bad news for residents of the Xixi Moho apartment complex that developers stopped building.HONG KONG —  Renhe Commercial appears to have a well-fortified business model: It builds air raid shelters across China for the government, outfitting them as underground shopping malls for use during peacetime.But that strategy has not been enough to protect the company from the fallout from China’s property market slump.Like many Chinese developers, Renhe is struggling with financial losses and debt, and it has been looking for other sources of income. This week, it said it was buying a collection of farmers’ markets for $800 million, even after sharply reining in spending on new property projects.The company’s problems highlight a broader challenge that the property market poses to China’s economic growth. Despite recent signs that housing prices are stabilizing, a backlog of unsold homes and unleased shops means that builders simply are not doing much building.AdvertisementData released Thursday showed that investment in residential and commercial real estate development rose 5.1 percent in May compared with a year earlier, its slowest pace since early 2009. Land purchases by developers continued a sharp decline, falling 31 percent by area and 25.8 percent by value last month. Housing starts fell 16 percent, measured by floor area.Advertisement“Real estate developers are speeding up destocking but not starting new projects,” said Haibin Zhu, the chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong.
            Despite recent signs that housing prices are stabilizing, China's builders are spending more slowly, creating a drag on the economy.

By some economists’ estimates, real estate and related industries account for more than 20 percent of China’s gross domestic product. The sector directly affects industries as diverse as construction companies, steel and cement plants, banks and property brokerages.Signs are increasing that prices and sales volumes are stabilizing. The property market appears to be responding to recent moves by China’s central bank to lower interest rates and free banks to lend more. Policy makers in recent months have also unwound several restrictions on mortgages and purchases of second homes that had been introduced years earlier to prevent the market from overheating.Last week, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its outlook for China’s property sector, forecasting modest housing sales growth of up to 5 percent in the next 12 months, compared with a decline of 7.8 percent in 2014.That is good news for developers and for banks that issue mortgages. But it does not mean a flurry of new construction will follow. China’s huge oversupply of unsold homes — mostly outside the biggest cities — and builders’ large holdings of undeveloped land mean that the potential lift from rising housing prices for the broader economy will be muted.For example, China’s least-developed cities, so-called Tier 3 and 4 localities, have nearly three years’ worth of sales in unsold homes on the market, according to a recent paper published by the International Monetary Fund.Advertisement“Over all, developers are more cautious in buying land, given the expectation of slower growth going forward,” said Simon Wong, a vice president at Moody’s, a credit-rating agency. “The majority of rated developers have a land inventory of about three to five years, and that’s quite ample.”The effects of lackluster activity in the property sector can be seen across the economy. On Tuesday, economists at China’s central bank lowered their economic growth target for the year to 7 percent, from 7.1 percent, citing the drag from the housing market as a major factor.Data released Monday showed that imports continued to decline, falling 18.1 percent in May from the level of a year earlier. Officials have blamed weak global commodity prices, but China’s imports of key materials like iron ore and copper have also started falling in volume terms. That is a sign of weak domestic demand, as diminished construction activity means decreased demand for steel girders and copper wiring, for example.That has left Chinese developers scrambling to find new moneymakers.Evergrande Real Estate Group, a heavily indebted developer based in the southern city Guangzhou, has recently branched into new businesses, including bottled mineral water, grain and edible oils and a cosmetic surgery clinic.

The company has accumulated debt, reporting net losses and negative cash flow for the past several years.With only about 900 million renminbi, or about $150 million, in cash on hand, Renhe will have to find a way to repay or refinance a $1 billion bond it sold to international investors, which comes due for repayment in nine months.The company’s “cash position has declined quite significantly,” said Mr. Wong of Moody’s. “I think Renhe’s business model is quite difficult to sustain.”Renhe’s deal for eight farmers’ markets in six cities across China is meant to generate minimum annual profit from rents of 625 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $80 million. But it comes with a twist. Renhe is buying the markets from one of its directors, who is also the wife of the company’s chairman and controlling shareholder.The developer said it saw the potential for more than just rental yields. The company wants to create an agricultural e-commerce business “by bringing together traders through an electronic trading platform and network to create virtual market places.”A version of this article appears in print on June 12, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Idle Property Developers Hold Back the Chinese Economy.
