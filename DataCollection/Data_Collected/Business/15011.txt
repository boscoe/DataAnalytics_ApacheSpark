Dozens of former Credit Suisse advisers who have been fighting for their deferred compensation after leaving the bank last year scored a partial victory on Friday when the brokerage industry’s main regulator said member firms cannot make workers waive their rights to settle disputes in the regulator’s own arbitration forum.The advisers had been forced by Credit Suisse to use two other arbitration services they didn’t want. Now the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority says members have the right to request arbitration at Finra “at any time and do not forfeit that right” by signing an agreement saying they must choose otherwise.The notice comes four months after a group of the advisers sent a letter to Finra asking it to weigh in on the matter. Credit Suisse had required that disputes go through either the American Arbitration Association or JAMS (which was once the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service), instead of Finra, something lawyers for the advisers said put them at a disadvantage.Many of the dozens of advisers that left Credit Suisse last year went to a Swiss wealth management rival, UBS, and others went to Morgan Stanley or other big banks, leaving behind what one lawyer estimates as hundreds of millions in accumulated deferred compensation that Credit Suisse said they forfeited because they left voluntarily.AdvertisementCredit Suisse said last year it was shutting down the private bank where the advisers worked, eventually striking an agreement for its nearly 270 advisers to move to Wells Fargo.Some of the advisers might begin filing for arbitration at Finra next week, said Barry Lax, a lawyer who represents 30 of them. “They are going to have an unbiased panel of arbitrators to determine their claims,” Mr. Lax said on Friday after the notice was put up on Finra’s website.AdvertisementA spokeswoman for Credit Suisse had no comment.Finra said its rules did not permit firms to require that workers waive their rights, and added that member firms might be subject to disciplinary action if they failed to submit disputes to Finra arbitration.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
