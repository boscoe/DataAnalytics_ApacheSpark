Doral Financial, the troubled Puerto Rico bank with offices that were raided by the F.B.I. last month, has run afoul with banking regulators over its plans to restore its depleted capital levels.For the second time in a little more than a month, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has rejected the bank’s capital restoration plan, Doral said in a securities filing on Monday.The F.D.I.C. took issue with the fact that Doral’s capital plan includes a $230 million tax refund, which the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is refusing to pay, according to the securities filing. Doral has told regulators that including the refund as part of its capital plan is appropriate because a Puerto Rico court has ruled that the refund is legitimate. The government is appealing the ruling.The refund, which was negotiated between the bank and the Puerto Rico Treasury department, is one of Doral’s most valuable assets.On Monday, the bank warned that if it cannot satisfy the regulators’ concern, it “may be subject to additional regulatory enforcement actions up to and including the appointment of a receiver or conservator for the bank.”Doral has faced many challenges since it was recapitalized by a group of Wall Street investors in 2006.Late last month, agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Doral’s office in San Juan as part of an ongoing investigation. The United States attorney in Puerto Rico did not rule out that the raid could be related to the murder of a top Doral executive in 2011.Shares of Doral were down more than 3 percent in late afternoon trading on Monday.A version of this article appears in print on 01/13/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Capital Plan Rejected.
