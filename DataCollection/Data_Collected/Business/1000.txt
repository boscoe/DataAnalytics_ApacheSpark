DETROIT —  The American auto industry reported its best October sales in a decade on Tuesday, led by double-digit growth at all three Detroit carmakers.But one automaker that did not benefit from strong consumer demand last month was Volkswagen, which had to take some diesel models off the market after it admitted to cheating on regulators’ emissions tests. Sales at VW were virtually flat.Industry analysts projected that the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate would exceed 18 million vehicles for the second consecutive month as consumers continued to splurge on new pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.“We’ve officially passed recovery mode and are now into record new-car sales,” said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book. “All the key factors, including pent-up demand, low interest rates, easy credit and cheap gas, were in place.”AdvertisementOver all, automakers said they sold 1.46 million vehicles during the month, which was a 13.6 percent increase over the 1.28 million sold in the same period a year ago, according to the market research firm Autodata Corporation. However, there was one additional selling day this October compared with last year.AdvertisementSome automakers said their sales for the month were the highest since October 2001, when the industry started zero-percent financing after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, said it sold 263,000 vehicles during the month, a 15.9 percent increase from a year ago. The company said its performance was fed by strong demand for its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, particularly newer models like the Chevrolet Colorado midsize truck.“Our timing couldn’t be better with industry sales at record levels,” said Kurt McNeil, head of G.M.’s United States sales.Nearly all of G.M.’s S.U.V.s posted gains during the month, which more than compensated for declines in compact cars like the Buick Verano and Chevrolet Cruze.Ford Motor, the second-largest American carmaker, said it sold 213,000 vehicles — in October, a 13.4 percent increase over a year ago. The company reported big gains in the heart of its S.U.V. lineup; sales of the Explorer were up 30 percent and sales of the Edge rose 39 percent.Ford’s F-series pickup continued to be the country’s best-selling vehicle with sales of 65,500 during the month.MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMOCT. 2014SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesOCT.2015 SALES596,231685,0821,281,313OCT. 2014620,733834,7831,455,516OCT. 2015%F-SeriesSilverado1500-3500CamryAccordCR-VRAV4CorollaCivicRogueMalibuEscapeFusionEquinoxAltimaExplorerFORDCHEVROLETRAMTOYOTAHONDAHONDATOYOTATOYOTAHONDANISSANCHEVROLETFORDFORDCHEVROLETNISSANFORD65,50051,64740,93134,78130,12129,03228,25627,95127,78924,93924,72524,71923,66822,08620,94820,723+   3.3+ 10.0+   2.8+   4.9+ 11.0–   0.8+ 31.3+ 12.0+ 15.0+ 69.8+122.1–    0.8+    3.6+  25.5–  11.0+  25.6+4.1%+21.9%+13.6%CHANGE   18.24ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+122.1%ChevroletMalibuHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDOCT. 2015SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE262,993            213,105                   204,045              195,545                                                               131,651                                     116,047                                         60,005         51,629       50,044                                                          48,273     +15.9+13.4 +13.0+14.7+  8.6+12.5 +19.8  +20.0+12.0+  5.2  %18.114.614.013.49.08.04.13.53.43.3%GENERAL MOTORSFORD MOTORTOYOTAFIAT CHRYSLERHONDANISSANHYUNDAISUBARUKIAVOLKSWAGENBIGGESTLOSER–11.0%NissanAltimaNOV. 3, 2015
“Gains in our truck business were especially strong, with F-series delivering its best October retails levels since 2004,” said Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president for United States sales and marketing.AdvertisementFiat Chrysler Automobiles reported that its sales increased 14.7 percent from last year to 195,500 vehicles. The company said the results were its best in any October since 2001 and were the 67th consecutive month of year-over-year sales gains.The biggest contributor was the Jeep brand, which had an increase in sales of 33 percent.Volkswagen, dealing with the impact of its emissions testing scandal, said it sold 30,000 vehicles during the month (excluding the Audi luxury brand), which represented a gain of less than 1 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The company said that sales of Lexus luxury S.U.V.s improved by 34 percent and that two of its Toyota S.U.V.s set records for the month.Honda reported that it sold 131,700 vehicles, an increase of 8.6 percent over a year ago. While its S.U.V. sales hit record levels, the company said its Accord and Civic sedans posted double-digit growth during the month.Among other manufacturers, Nissan said its sales rose 12.5 percent, and Hyundai reported nearly a 20 percent improvement.The demand for luxury cars was not as robust as the demand for trucks and S.U.V.s.Mercedes-Benz said that its sales (excluding its Smart brand) improved only 3.3 percent, while BMW reported a drop of 3.8 percent, excluding the Mini. By comparison, Land Rover, which sells S.U.V.s exclusively, reported a 98 percent increase in sales.The strength of the truck and S.U.V. market is tied closely to low gasoline prices, as well as the need by consumers and businesses to replace aging models.“Today’s landscape, including continued low interest rates and gas prices, works in favor of larger vehicles — a strength of full-line manufacturers including Fiat Chrysler, Ford, G.M. and Toyota,” said Tom Libby, an analyst with the firm IHS Automotive.AdvertisementSales of trucks and S.U.V.s typically generate larger profits for manufacturers than sales of cars. Auto companies have been steadily adding production of the larger vehicles to cash in on the surging demand.The sales performance in October virtually ensured that the overall industry totals would exceed 17 million vehicles for the full calendar year.According to Autodata, automakers have sold 14.5 million vehicles so far this year, compared with 13.7 million in the first 10 months of 2014.A version of this article appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Automakers, With Exception of VW, Report Strongest Sales in a Decade .
