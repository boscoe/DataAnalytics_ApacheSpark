To the Editor:Re “Writing Off the Warhol Next Door” (Jan. 11), about the growth of private art museums around the United States, including the Hall Art Foundation in Reading, Vt.:While it is true the foundation operates a space in Vermont, this is a small part of its activities, which include opening a building on the campus of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art and collaborating with other institutions here and abroad to organize exhibitions in their public and heavily attended spaces. The foundation has also made hundreds of loans to public museum exhibitions around the world.The impression your article creates is that the Vermont museum is in my backyard. In reality, I spend but a few weeks a year in Vermont, and when I do it is miles from the foundation’s space. And while 1,500 visitors may not sound like a lot, for a rural community I think it is actually quite impressive — especially as the space has been open for barely more than a year. Our programming is widely advertised, and we offer personalized tours to the general public free of charge. Our seasonal schedule is based on the weather.Making a space available to the public entails complying with many codes and regulations, including, for example, providing accessibility for the disabled and emergency egress. These requirements can be costly. That might be a reason that some collectors choose instead to exhibit their collections to the public “unofficially.”Andrew J. HallPalm Beach, Fla., Jan. 15The writer is the president of the Hall Art Foundation.A version of this letter appears in print on January 25, 2015, on Page BU5 of the New York edition with the headline: Private Museums and Public Access.
