Additionally, it said, the type of drying kennel Colby had been placed in had been removed from service in all Petco stores.But the company denied that excessive heat from a dryer had killed Colby. The investigation “confirmed that no heat was used, and is not used in any of our grooming salon dryers,” the statement said.Ms. Marks did not immediately return phone calls and text messages. She has told a number of news media outlets that when she called the store to ask if Colby was ready to be picked up, she was told to go to a local animal clinic, where an employee would meet her. There she found the lifeless dog.She said the Petco employee said her dog had been left in a drying kennel by a worker who left to attend a graduation.Petco operates more than 950 stores in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Some consumers used Twitter to call for boycotting the business.In its statement, Petco said it was “heartbroken over Colby’s untimely passing. Pet parents place their trust in us, and we realize that trust is earned. We understand there is no way to make up for the loss of Colby, and our thoughts continue to be with his family during this difficult time.”Advertisement
