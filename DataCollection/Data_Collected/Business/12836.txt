A series of online ads last year featured three sisters debunking old wives’ tales about diesel, including that it was dirty and that it smelled bad.But in the latest headache for the German automaker — which admitted last year that it had lied about the performance of its diesel technology — those ads have come under regulatory scrutiny. On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against the Volkswagen Group of America, saying the company’s “clean diesel” advertising campaign was deceptive.In the long-expected complaint, which was filed in Federal District Court in San Francisco, the F.T.C. accused Volkswagen of selling or leasing more than 550,000 diesel vehicles over a seven-year period, at an average price of about $30,000, using a duplicitous campaign that asserted the cars were environmentally friendly, met emissions standards and had a high resale value. The ads ran online and on television, including during prominent events like the Super Bowl.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Collectively, the F.T.C. said in the suit, VW’s customers “suffered billions of dollars in injury.”The agency is seeking a court order that would require Volkswagen to compensate American consumers who bought or leased an affected vehicle between 2008 and 2015.The Justice Department sued Volkswagen in January over the emissions cheating scandal. Volkswagen also faces hundreds of lawsuits from diesel car owners and dealers.Shortly after Volkswagen admitted in September that it had equipped 11 million diesel cars with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests, it removed its clean diesel ads from its YouTube channel and appeared to have stopped running them on television. In November, Volkswagen ran print ads in roughly 30 newspapers across the country, including The New York Times, promising customers that it was “working to make things right.”In a statement, Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said the company had “received the complaint and continues to cooperate with all relevant U.S. regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission.”Advertisement
