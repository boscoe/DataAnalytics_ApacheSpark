If it missed the deadline, it was not allowed to make another approach for up to six months.On Wednesday, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in Britain extended the deadline to Nov. 11, the companies said, marking the third time the talks have been extended.“SABMiller and AB InBev have made good progress in agreeing the terms of the possible offer, which will be set out in detail in any announcement of a firm intention to make an offer,” the companies said in a news release.The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.The companies are negotiating to potentially create a behemoth in the beer industry with annual revenue of about $64 billion.Under the terms of the latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev is offering to pay 44 pounds, or $67.81, a share for SABMiller. That would represent more than a 50 percent premium to SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September, before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was first announced.As part of the deal, SABMiller’s two largest shareholders — the American tobacco giant Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia — would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at £39.03 a share, a discount to the cash price. That would allow the company’s largest shareholders to avoid a huge tax bill after the merger.As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay £67.9 billion, or $104.6 billion.The merger would face significant regulatory scrutiny, and the brewers may be forced to sell off some assets where they overlap, including the United States.The deal would potentially bring some of the world’s most popular beers under one roof, including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois from Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Grolsch, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsner Urquell from SABMiller.It would also give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure in the faster-growing emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Latin America.Advertisement
