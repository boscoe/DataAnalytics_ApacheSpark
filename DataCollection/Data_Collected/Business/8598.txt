Even seven years after the financial crisis, Wall Street has lost none of its ability to stir partisan rancor.The Republican presidential candidates are almost entirely unified behind repealing the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation approved by a Democratic-controlled Congress after the 2008 collapse, which was brought on by reckless mortgage lending. That rollback would undoubtedly allow for more unfettered trading and lending.Pushing in the opposition direction, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s two challengers for the Democratic nomination have made it a priority to bring back a Depression-era law that would force the biggest banks to break up.Mrs. Clinton has joined the chorus of Democrats demanding more oversight of Wall Street, recognizing that the issue has become a rallying cry among progressive activists and is bound up in the broader debate on income and wealth inequality.AdvertisementBut Mrs. Clinton, who has won strong financial support from Wall Street in the past, has been piecing together a more unexpected set of policy proposals — including a change in the way capital gains, or profits on investments, are taxed. Her proposals so far strike a more moderate note than those of her fellow Democrats, but they also have a more realistic chance of becoming law if she is elected president.Advertisement“The things she is talking about are very different than what the left is talking about,” said Matt McDonald, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies who has worked on financial issues for the Republican candidates in the last two presidential elections. “The different ways that the candidates are approaching it are very interesting.”The array of views emerging from the presidential primaries suggests that the financial industry — as well as investors and consumers — could face sharply different futures depending on which party ends up in the White House.The most sweeping proposals have come from Mrs. Clinton’s two challengers for the Democratic nomination. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley kicked off his candidacy in May with a speech that pointed a finger at the “bullies of Wall Street” and followed up with an open letter to the “Wall Street megabanks,” which he labeled “too big to fail, too big to manage, and too big to jail.”Mr. O’Malley’s primary policy proposal would bring back the Glass-Steagall Act, which was introduced as part of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal and forced a separation between commercial and Wall Street banks. If that were re-enacted, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, among others, would all have to be essentially cleaved in two.Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist, has made a similar call for the return of Glass-Steagall in his proposals for changing finance, which is at the top of his campaign’s list of issues.Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley are taking advantage of the surge in enthusiasm that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has captured through her own criticism of the biggest banks, which hold an even larger portion of American assets than they did before the financial crisis.While this has largely been an issue for the left, the populist appeal of the position across party lines was underscored when Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, also raised the prospect of separating the banks, along the lines of Glass-Steagall, in a speech he gave in late July as he tried to win more attention for his faltering candidacy.AdvertisementLast month, at Mrs. Clinton’s first major speech on the economy, a heckler in the audience stood up and demanded to know if she, too, would push for a reimposition of the 1933 law. She did not answer the question at the time, but at a later event she said that the problems in the industry could not be solved by a single solution like a new version of Glass-Steagall.This is tricky territory for Hillary Clinton. For one thing, Bill Clinton signed off on the 1999 law that essentially did away with Glass-Steagall — a change that some have blamed for encouraging the consolidation of the financial industry and ultimately the government bailouts of 2008.Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that the continuing power and influence of the financial industry is a major issue. In her first speech on the economy, she said that “ ‘too big to fail’ is still too big a problem.” But perhaps more significantly, Mrs. Clinton hired, as her campaign treasurer, Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive who developed a reputation for cracking down on Wall Street — and allying himself with Ms. Warren — during his time as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
                Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention.            Last month, Mr. Gensler sent a fund-raising letter to Mrs. Clinton’s supporters emphasizing her drive to “advance Wall Street reform,” and prosecute wrongdoing in the financial industry.But it is not clear what specific measures she would pursue on that front. While the Obama administration has been light on prosecution for wrongdoing, it has already put in place regulations that have forced banks to cut back their trading activities and holdings of risky assets. Mrs. Clinton’s proposals recognize the change that has already occurred and do not appear to be intended to cause a big shake-up of the industry.Her most concrete proposal introduced late last month would sharply increase the capital gains tax rate that investors pay on assets held for less than six years. A wealthy speculator who sells a stock after holding it for two years, for instance, would pay a 39.6 percent tax rate on any gains — the same top rate that is taxed on ordinary income. Currently, the top tax rate on capital gains held for more than a year is 20 percent, about half the rate on ordinary income.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In the same vein, Mrs. Clinton has advocated rules that would encourage companies to share profits with employees as well as investors.William Gale, the co-director of the Tax Policy Center, said the tax change proposed by Mrs. Clinton would narrow a popular tax break and increase the amount of taxes paid by wealthy Americans. But in itself, the plan would not change much behavior on Wall Street.Many of the most powerful investors are pensions and endowments that don’t pay capital gains taxes. For those that do pay taxes, Mr. Gale noted, the big and increasingly important private equity funds rarely engage in short-term trading, generally hold their investments for more than five years and would thus be unaffected by the proposed change.AdvertisementMrs. Clinton and her Democratic challengers have also argued for policy that would help check extremely short-term investors like high-frequency traders who rely on complex computer programs.Mrs. Clinton, unlike Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley, has not called for a tiny tax on all financial transactions — a levy commonly used in Europe, including London, that would be likely to limit high-speed trading. But she has left open the door to such a move. In a speech she gave in New York in late July, she said she would be introducing more proposals for “reining in excessive risk on Wall Street.”Mrs. Clinton’s focus on so-called short-termism is unlikely to alienate most donors from the financial industry. Her policy suggestions pick up on proposals that have recently been made by overhaul-minded executives in the financial industry, including Warren E. Buffett and the chief executive of BlackRock, Laurence D. Fink, who have long bemoaned the fixation on quarterly financial results at the expense of long-term investment and growth.Even Republican executives on Wall Street suggest that given Mrs. Clinton’s proposals so far, she is unlikely to turn into a foe of the industry. She is also avoiding some of the antagonistic rhetoric — like references to “fat cat bankers” — that won President Obama enemies in the industry.“There’s an overarching sense among the senior people at the banks that she’s not going to be too harsh about us,” said a politically connected Republican executive at a large financial institution, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating other Republicans.But industry analysts are alert for any shift in Mrs. Clinton’s tone, particularly given the changing flow of donations from the industry toward Republican candidates over the last six years. So far, Mrs. Clinton has raised slightly less money from the big banks than the Republican Jeb Bush and is more reliant on progressive-minded political action committees.Mr. Bush, a paid adviser to Lehman Brothers and Barclays immediately before the financial crisis, is now seen as the favorite among Wall Street Republicans.He has largely avoided talking about the financial industry, though he has criticized the Dodd-Frank law for allowing the largest banks to get even bigger. The Republicans Marco Rubio and Scott Walker have gone even further, calling for a full repeal of Dodd-Frank.AdvertisementStill, none of the Republican candidates have shown any sign of wanting to ally themselves with Wall Street. Republicans like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Walker have explained their opposition to Dodd-Frank by pointing to the harm they claim it has done to smaller banks. But their position is likely to be popular among big banks as well, who have borne most of the costs of the new law.While many working-class Republicans share a distrust of Wall Street, Mr. McDonald said that pro-business sentiment among most Republican voters would limit attacks on big banks during the primary. The same won’t be true on the Democratic side, however.“This is the challenge for Hillary,” Mr. McDonald, the Republican adviser, said. “Her challenge and her limitation is her ability to come across on these issues where people want to hear a certain type of anger.”A version of this article appears in print on August 31, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Candidates’ Divergent Views on Wall Street.
