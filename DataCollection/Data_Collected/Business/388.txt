SYDNEY, Australia — The Australian winemaker Treasury Wine Estates said on Wednesday it would buy the majority of the United States- and Britain-based wine assets of the alcoholic beverage company Diageo for $552 million in cash to bolster its sales in the world’s biggest wine markets.Treasury Wine will acquire brands such as Sterling Vineyards and Blossom Hill through a $306 million debt sale and a share sale worth 486 Australian dollars, or $351 million. The deal also includes the assumption of leases worth $48 million.“We remain committed to our strategic road map of transitioning our business from an order-taking agricultural company to a brand-led and capital-light marketing organization,” said Michael Clark, chief executive of Treasury Wine, in a statement.Diageo’s American-based wine business produces about four million cases of wine a year, and its sales in Britain include about five million cases of wine sold in the British Isles and 28 other markets. Treasury Wine said the planned acquisition would double its sales of luxury wine in the United States and allow it to avoid an $80 million investment in its American bottling facility.AdvertisementTreasury Wine, based in Melbourne, fought off a $3.2 billion takeover offer from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company in 2014 after Mr. Clark said he would turn around the business by spending more money on marketing and selling off wineries and packaging plants.Diageo said the sale of its wine business would give the company about $489 million in net proceeds, which will be used to pay back debt.Advertisement“Wine is no longer core to Diageo, and this sale gives us greater focus,” said Ivan Menezes, Diageo’s chief executive, in a statement.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
