 WHAT S.&P.’S SETTLEMENT MEANS  |  Standard & Poor’s $1.37 billion settlement with prosecutors, announced on Tuesday, will settle an array of government lawsuits against the giant rating agency. But it does not represent closure for the broader ratings business, DealBook’s Ben Protess and Nathaniel Popper report. An uncertain future still lies ahead for S.&P., as well as its main rivals, Moody’s and Fitch.“In the wake of the financial crisis, when rating agencies were blamed for feeding a subprime mortgage frenzy, Congress used the Dodd-Frank Act to adopt a battery of changes for the rating industry. S.&P., Moody’s and Fitch announced their own cultural overhauls and struck a competitive tone about whose ratings were the strictest,” Mr. Protess and Mr. Popper write. “Eventually, however, that spirit of reform began to collide with the realities of Wall Street.” S.&P., Moody’s and Fitch still dominate the market, and pension funds still consider ratings to be a cornerstone of the financial system.Some lawmakers say the problem lies in the rating agency business model. The agencies are paid by the same banks and companies they rate. S.&P. argues that ratings are meant to be opinions, not fact. Still, the Securities and Exchange Commission has imposed a number of new checks on conflicts of interest. And the agencies themselves have adopted their own reform measures. In the end, however, the government did not require S.&P. to admit wrongdoing, an admission that “could have unleashed a flood of additional lawsuits, a real threat to the rating agency’s future,” Mr. Protess and Mr. Popper write.

A LESSON FOR DEAL MAKERS  |  The sale of the New York brokerage GFI Group and missteps along the way by Michael Gooch, its founder and executive chairman, have “raised the question of why supposedly intelligent leaders time and again do dumb things when they sell their companies,” Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. Issues began when GFI announced it would be acquired by the CME Group. At the same time, the companies organized a side deal that would see GFI’s wholesale brokerage and clearing businesses sold separately to GFI’s management, including Mr. Gooch, for $165 million in cash.
The deal was a clear conflict, Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. But the acquisition of GFI was approved by a special committee of independent directors, and the deal was made contingent on approval by a majority of GFI’s shareholders other than Mr. Gooch. Not long after, BGC Partners announced a hostile bid. The special committee considered the BGC deal and declared it to be superior. Then things got hairier. Eventually, Mr. Gooch even invoked his former wife to get shareholders to vote for the deal with CME.
“Corporate executives and even boards lose control of their companies once they start down the sale path. Once a decision to sell has been made, the intricate system of law takes over, dictating that boards are in charge of the process, particularly the independent directors,” Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. “A process that initially seemed to be going right has been exposed by the harsh light of the deal world to be less than ideal.” He adds: “Corporate executives should regard the GFI mess as a cautionary tale about the limits of their supremacy.”



SMUCKER GETS INTO PET FOOD  |  J.M. Smucker, a company best known for jams and peanut butter, is moving into the world of dog biscuits and cat soufflés, DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced writes. The company announced on Tuesday that it would buy Big Heart Pet Brands from its private equity owners for about $5.8 billion, including debt. The deal, Smucker’s biggest in its 118-year history, will add $2.2 billion in sales and the top maker of pet snacks. It could also help revive Smucker’s sales, which have been relatively flat since 2012.
With the deal, Big Heart gains another new owner this decade. The company, then known as Del Monte Foods, was acquired more than four years ago by a group that included the investment firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview Capital for $5.3 billion. In late 2013, David J. West, the company’s chief executive, sold its human food division to Del Monte Pacific, an Asian company, for nearly $1.7 billion. What remained took on the name Big Heart and continued focusing on new lines of pet products. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Smucker will give to Big Heart’s owners 18 million newly issued shares and $1.3 billion in cash. It will also assume $2.6 billion in debt.

STAPLES AND OFFICE DEPOT IN DEAL TALKS  |  Staples is in advanced talks to buy Office Depot in a deal that would combine two of the biggest names in office supplies, David Gelles and Michael J. de la Merced write in DealBook, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. A deal could be announced as early as this week, but the talks are continuing and could still fall apart. Shares of Staples, which has a market value of more than $12 billion, rose 11 percent in trading on Tuesday. Shares of Office Depot, with a market value of about $5 billion, rose 22 percent.
Pressure for a combination of the two companies has come from the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, which owns about 10 percent of Office Depot and 6 percent of Staples. Analysts have also contended that a combined company would be able to cut costs while having increased size to compete with rivals. Any deal is likely to draw close scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who previously moved to block a merger of the two in 1997.
