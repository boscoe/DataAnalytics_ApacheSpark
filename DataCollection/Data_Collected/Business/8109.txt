We believe they deserve an opportunity to consider it.”Baxalta’s largest shareholder is the company that it was spun out of, Baxter International, which has a 19.5 percent stake. The spinoff, which was announced in September, was completed on July 1.A merger would create a giant in the treatment of rare diseases. The combined companies would generate $20 billion in product sales by 2020 — 65 percent of that on drugs focusing on rare diseases, Shire said.“We believe the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta would be strategically and financially attractive for both of our companies, accelerating our respective growth ambitions and creating the leading global biotech company in rare diseases,” Mr. Ornskov said in a news release.But Baxalta, which is based in Bannockburn, Ill., disagreed with Shire’s stated strategic logic for a merger and emphasized that it had been an independent, publicly traded company only since July 1.“A transaction at this time would be severely disruptive to our young organization and the implementation of a wide variety of critical commercial, R.&D. and operational initiatives, and thus carries with it significant risks for our shareholders,” Ludwig N. Hantson, the chief executive of Baxalta, wrote in a letter to Mr. Ornskov.If Shire ultimately prevails, it would be the latest acquisition in what has been an active deal-making slate since the $54 billion sale of Shire to AbbVie, another big drug maker based in Illinois, fell through last year. AbbVie walked away from the deal after the Treasury Department announced new rules aimed at reining in inversions, in which a company reincorporates in a country with lower corporate taxes.In January, Shire acquired NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion. Shire also reportedly considered a bid for Salix Pharmaceuticals this year before Valeant Pharmaceuticals International clinched a deal for the company.And Shire agreed on Monday to acquire Foresight Biotherapeutics, a privately held maker of drugs to treat eye conditions, including a drug in late-stage development to treat pink eye, for $300 million.Under the terms of the offer disclosed on Tuesday, Shire said it would pay $45.23 a share for Baxalta, representing a 36 percent premium to its closing price on Monday.Shares of Baxalta rose 12 percent, to $37.10. In London trading, shares of Shire fell more than 5 percent.After the transaction closes, Shire said it would initiate a share buyback program and, within two years, repurchase up to 13 percent of the combined company’s outstanding shares.Evercore and Morgan Stanley and the law firms Ropes & Gray and Slaughter and May are advising Shire.Goldman Sachs and Citigroup and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are advising the board of Baxalta.Advertisement
