It was the first time in years that Target did not move up its holiday opening times.Still, Target did announce a 10-day sale across entire departments that will start four days before Thanksgiving and run through the Black Friday weekend. And its website will feature Thanksgiving “doorbusters” starting early in the morning that day, Target said.Tina Tyler, Target’s head of stores, said in a call with reporters on Monday that a 6 p.m. opening time was “a sweet spot” that allowed shoppers to take part in the Thanksgiving tradition and also shop.Target is among many stores grappling with their holiday sales strategy as discontent grows among some consumers over earlier-than-ever holiday sales times, as well as fatigue over a calendar bursting with sales events.The outdoor gear and sporting goods retailer REI was praised last month when it announced that it would close its stores, and even its website, on Black Friday.Ms. Tyler said that she did not think opening on Thanksgiving, or having many days of sales, would dilute spending on Black Friday, the traditional day of deals.“We don’t believe we’re shifting away,” she said, but rather, “we’re adding to.”videoAdvertisement
