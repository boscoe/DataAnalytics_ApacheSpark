A mixed batch of first-quarter earnings reports offered traders little direction.The chemical giant DuPont said the rising dollar weighed on its results in the first quarter as earnings and sales shrunk. The company also lowered its forecast for full-year profits, and its stock fell $2.15, or 3 percent, to $70.69.“It seems the market is in a holding pattern as investors are waiting to see just how much the dollar impacts corporate earnings,” said Russell Price, Ameriprise Financial’s senior economist. “So far, things are a bit better than expected, but we’ll see how it plays out.”AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.11 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 2,097.29.

They expect sales to sink 1.8 percent. Over the past week, Johnson & Johnson, American Express and General Electric cited the strong dollar when reporting weak results.
