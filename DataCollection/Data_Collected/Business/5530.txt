They see this macho male, but this female side is part of me, it’s who I am. I was not genetically born that way.” For the purpose of the interview, Mr. Jenner said he preferred to use the pronoun “he.”The wide-ranging two-hour interview appeared during a special edition of ABC’s “20/20” news program. It attracted a much larger audience than the average episode of “20/20,” which is about 6.2 million.The highly promoted interview was noteworthy because Mr. Jenner is among the most prominent people to come out as transgender. He said that the transition, which has captured headlines, was not a publicity stunt.Advertisement
