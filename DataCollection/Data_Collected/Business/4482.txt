HONG KONG — The average price of a new home in China fell at the fastest pace on record in February from a year earlier, hurt by slower sales during the Lunar New Year holidays. But developers and analysts expected prices to slowly recover — particularly in top-tier cities.The average prices for new homes in China’s 70 major cities dropped 5.7 percent last month from a year ago, the sixth consecutive monthly fall, following January’s 5.1 percent decline. It was the biggest annual decline in the nationwide survey since it began in 2011.The monthly fall in February from January was 0.4 percent, the same as in the previous month, and pointed to sustained risks to the government’s 7 percent economic growth target for the year. The property sector accounts for about 15 percent of China’s gross domestic product.The decline coincided with news that Chinese banks have extended Evergrande Real Estate Group 100 billion renminbi, or $16 billion, in credit, as the real estate slump extends to one of the country’s biggest and most indebted property developers.AdvertisementChinese real estate stocks jumped in response to the price news, with the Bank of Communications expecting the government will announce more measures to bolster the market, including lowering taxes and loosening requirements for mortgage lending.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
