AdvertisementSupported byBy John KoblinDisney and Fox took another swipe at Verizon on Thursday, informing the telecommunications company that they would not run a commercial for FiOS’s new cable package on some of their channels. Disney, Fox and NBCUniversal objected this week to the FiOS cable package, which offers a slimmer version of basic cable. The product, called FiOS Custom TV, made its debut on Sunday. A Verizon spokeswoman, Deidre Hart, said Disney told the company that it would not run ads for FiOS Custom TV on local stations, including WABC, A&E and ESPN Radio in New York and the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia. Likewise, Fox will not run the ad on its New York affiliate, WNYW, and on the sports cable channel YES, Ms. Hart said. The FiOS ad began airing on Tuesday on local broadcast stations. “This anticompetitive tactic is only hurting consumers,” Ms. Hart said. “As we’ve been saying, FiOS Custom TV is a product consumers want, and it’s all about consumer choice. We believe we are allowed to offer consumers and small businesses this choice and flexibility under our existing contracts.” A Fox spokesman said that the company preferred “to keep our commercial discussions confidential.” Disney declined to comment. The FiOS Custom TV package gives customers a base package of 35 channels and then allows them to choose two additional category-specific tiers, like sports and children’s programming. Most of the channels offered in those bundles, including popular networks like ESPN, Comedy Central and Lifetime, have typically been offered as part of basic cable channel offerings. The package costs $55 a month, and is trying to appeal to so-called cord cutters, who are moving away from conventional TV and relying more on streaming services like Netflix. Advertisement
