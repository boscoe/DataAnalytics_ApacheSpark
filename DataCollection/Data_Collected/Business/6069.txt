WASHINGTON —  Seven environmental groups filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging safety rules issued this month for trains carrying oil, arguing that the regulations are too weak to protect the public.The groups, including the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity, said the rules, issued on May 1, would allow the industry to continue to use “unsafe tank cars” for up to 10 years. They also said the rules failed to set adequate speed limits for oil trains.“We’re suing the administration because these rules won’t protect the 25 million Americans living in the oil train blast zone,” said Todd Paglia, executive director of ForestEthics, one of the groups filing the lawsuit.The United States and Canada issued the safety standards in response to a string of explosive accidents that have accompanied a surge in crude-by-rail shipments.AdvertisementUnder the rules, tank cars built before October 2011 known as DOT-111 are to be phased out within three years. DOT-111 tank cars are considered prone to puncture during accidents, increasing the risk of fire and explosions.AdvertisementTank cars without reinforced hulls built after October 2011 and known as CPC-1232 will be phased out by 2020.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Two-thirds of that amount would go to retrofit or retire existing tank cars.A version of this article appears in print on May 15, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Environmental Groups File Federal Suit Challenging Rules for Trains Hauling Oil .
