KesslerThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will hold a public meeting on Oct. 22 to provide updates on the latest progress, or lack thereof, in the sweeping recall of defective Takata airbags. The airbags, linked to at least eight deaths and scores of injuries, contain faulty inflaters that can explode and spray metal into the cabin of a vehicle. Last week, the safety agency said the recall affected 23.4 million inflaters in 19.2 million vehicles. So far, only 4.4 million of those inflaters have been replaced. In a statement on Wednesday, the agency’s administrator, Mark R. Rosekind, said the meeting would be “an opportunity to provide the information we’ve gathered since launching the coordinated remedy proceeding in May.” Advertisement
