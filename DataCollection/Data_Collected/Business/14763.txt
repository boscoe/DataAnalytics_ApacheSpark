Federal regulators are investigating whether more than 600,000 Ford Explorers, in model years 2011 to 2015, should be recalled because exhaust fumes can enter the passenger compartment.Ford made efforts twice before to fix the problem, sending dealers bulletins in 2012 and 2014 alerting them to the possibility of complaints of “an exhaust odor in the vehicle” and telling them how to fix the vehicle.But unlike the procedure in a recall, owners were not notified of a possible problem. Only if owners complained would Ford and the dealers respond.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said this week on its website that it had opened the inquiry after receiving 154 complaints from Ford Explorer owners. That included one driver who said he passed out, but was going slowly enough that he was not seriously injured.AdvertisementUnder federal regulations, once a manufacturer is aware of a safety hazard it must, within five working days, inform the safety agency of its plan for a recall, or face civil penalties.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Instructions told mechanics to “apply a generous amount of Motorcraft Seam Sealer.”However, some owners told the national safety agency that the repair did not work.A version of this article appears in print on July 8, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Exhaust Fumes Inside Ford Explorers May Lead to a Recall.
