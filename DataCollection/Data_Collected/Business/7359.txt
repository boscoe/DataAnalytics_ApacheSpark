Starting next May, Carnival plans to offer trips from Miami to Cuba, pending approval of the island’s government, the company announced on Tuesday. Carnival said it would become the first American cruise company to visit Cuba since the 1960 trade embargo. The trips will be through its new brand, Fathom, which focuses on trips where passengers sail to a destination in order to volunteer there. Carnival’s chief, Arnold Donald, called the Cuba plans “an important first step” for his company and for the cruise industry. The weeklong cruises will be aboard the Adonia, which carries 710 passengers, much smaller than the ships in the company’s namesake line that carry nearly 3,000 passengers. Prices start at $2,990 per person, plus taxes and port fees. A similar service-oriented trip on the same ship to the Dominican Republic starts at $1,540 per person.A version of this brief appears in print on July 8, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Miami-to-Cuba Cruises Planned for Volunteers.
