In the late 1990s, Jay Walker invented a new way to buy airplane tickets as the founder of Priceline.com.Now he has invented a new way to manage inventions.On Wednesday, Mr. Walker introduced a service for companies to license the use of their patents or to obtain a license to use patents owned by others. The service, the United States Patent Utility, charges a monthly subscription fee and has attracted a handful of initial users, including Microsoft.Mr. Walker, who holds hundreds of patents, said he wanted to create a way for patent owners to get paid without having to take users of their patents to court. “I’ve experienced it so painfully firsthand,” said Mr. Walker, who has sued numerous companies over his patents through the years. “There’s nothing like a lot of pain to motivate you.”The patent service is run by a small company called Patent Properties, of which Mr. Walker is executive chairman. The company, whose shares are traded over the counter, has a market value of about $45.6 million.Apart from Microsoft, the initial customers of the patent service include the electronics company Harman International Industries and Goodway Technologies, which makes heating and air-conditioning maintenance equipment.
