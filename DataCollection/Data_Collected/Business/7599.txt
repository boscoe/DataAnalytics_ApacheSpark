The results are expected to be released in the third quarter of 2016.The regulator said in March that it would not run stress tests this year but would instead conduct a transparency exercise intended to provide detailed data about banks’ balance sheets and loan portfolios. That exercise will be similar to one the authority conducted in 2013.The results of the regulator’s last stress tests were released in October. Those tests identified 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and would need additional buffers to be prepared for a potential economic downturn.The tests were conducted at the same time as a separate review by the European Central Bank, known as an asset quality review, that focused on 130 big banks in the eurozone.The European Banking Authority’s tests included banks in Britain, Sweden and other European Union countries that are not part of the eurozone.Advertisement
