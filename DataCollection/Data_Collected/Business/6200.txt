McDonald’s shut down a restaurant near its headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., on Wednesday after the area was swamped by hundreds of protesters calling for higher wages and union representation. The company said the restaurant was closed because of traffic concerns. The demonstration comes ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, which will also be the first for the new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook. Last year, McDonald’s closed a building because of a protest, and more than 100 people were later arrested after refusing to leave corporate property. The campaign for pay of $15 an hour and a union began in late 2012 and has involved a range of tactics. Earlier this year, McDonald’s said it would raise its starting pay for workers at company-owned stores to $1 above the local minimum wage. McDonald’s owns only about 10 percent of its stores in the United States.A version of this brief appears in print on May 21, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: McDonald’s Location Shuttered After Wage Protesters Descend.
