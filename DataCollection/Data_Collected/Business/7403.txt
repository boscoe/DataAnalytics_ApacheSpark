The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday that consumer borrowing increased $16.1 billion after a gain of $21.4 billion in April; the April increase was the strongest monthly increase since July 2014. The gains pushed total borrowing to a fresh record of $3.4 trillion. In May, borrowing in the category that includes autos and student loans rose by $14.5 billion. Borrowing in the category that covers credit cards rose by $1.6 billion after an increase of $8.5 billion in April. Economists believe that solid gains in employment should translate into stronger consumer borrowing and spending that will help lift economic growth in the second half of this year. Advertisement
