WASHINGTON —  Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Thursday that she regarded domestic economic conditions as sufficiently strong to start raising the Fed’s benchmark interest rate later this month.Ms. Yellen, making her final public remarks before the Fed’s policy-making committee meets Dec. 15 and 16, did nothing to diminish expectations that the Fed is about to end a seven-year stretch of near-zero rates.She affirmed the Fed’s inclination to press ahead even as the European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would cut rates and extend its stimulus. The Bank of Japan also continues to press for stronger growth.The divergence among the world’s major central banks is creating a significant drag on the American economy. The dollar has gained strength as investors seeking higher returns invest in the United States. That has reduced demand for American exports, weighing on manufacturing and other sectors.The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, cited labor gains and progress on inflation as the Fed considers raising its benchmark interest rate.But Ms. Yellen said increased spending by American consumers continued to drive a domestic economic expansion. While problems in the rest of the world may induce the Fed to raise rates more slowly, it is unlikely to wait.Advertisement“Domestic spending is on a solid course,” Ms. Yellen told the Joint Economic Committee. “It’s been growing around 3 percent. Over all, on balance that’s led — and I think it will continue to lead — to growth that is somewhat above trend.”AdvertisementThe Fed has held rates near zero since December 2008 as the main force of its measures to stimulate the economy. Low rates encourage lenders to take larger risks, and businesses and consumers to borrow more money. As the Fed begins to raise rates, those incentives will fade. The Fed’s hope is that the economy is now strong enough to continue growing without quite so much help.The Fed’s march toward an increase still is drawing resistance from some Democrats and liberal groups. Inflation remains sluggish, the share of Americans with jobs remains lower than before the recession, and they argue there is little harm in pressing on.Ms. Yellen, pressed by Democrats on Thursday about any lingering hesitations, said the Fed continued to look at new economic data, and would pay particular attention to the government’s first estimate of November job growth.
                More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.            But she added that the impact of any single economic report was limited, and that an accumulation of evidence suggested that the economy had gained strength.“I think we’ve seen some welcome hints” of wage increases, Ms. Yellen said, although she cautioned, “it’s tentative evidence; we don’t know if it will last.”Her testimony repeated portions of a speech she gave on Wednesday, laying out in greater detail her reasons for economic optimism. Both closed on the same note, referring to raising rates as “a day that I expect we all are looking forward to.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ms. Yellen responded that investors already had priced in much of the divergence, but she declined to forecast where the dollar was headed.A version of this article appears in print on December 4, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Yellen Says the Economy Is Ready for a Rate Increase.
