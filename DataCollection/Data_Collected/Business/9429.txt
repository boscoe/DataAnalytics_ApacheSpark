Those new employees will focus on several technologies, including self driving vehicles.Both companies said they were partly attracted to Canada’s largest city because of the software skills of graduates from Ontario universities, notably the University of Waterloo. Immigration laws also make it easier for companies to import skilled workers to Canada compared with the United States.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told a news conference that no financial government assistance was provided.“This was about smoothing red tape,” Mr. Trudeau said.Thomson Reuters, a publicly traded company, is already based in Toronto. The members of Thomson family mainly live in the city, and their private holding company is based there.Cameron Ahmad, Mr. Trudeau’s press secretary, said the prime minister and Chrystia Freeland, the international trade minister, had held several meetings with Mr. Smith in New York and Davos, Switzerland, to discuss the move.Ms. Freeland previously held senior editorial positions at Reuters and was also deputy editor of The Globe and Mail, a Toronto newspaper owned by the Thomsons’ private holding company.Advertisement
