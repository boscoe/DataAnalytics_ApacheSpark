The O.E.C.D., representing mostly advanced economies, lowered its forecast for worldwide economic growth to 3 percent this year from the 3.3 percent it estimated in November. “These kinds of numbers mean we are not going to make good on these commitments,” Catherine Mann, the group’s chief economist, told reporters. She said that to jump-start growth, countries need continued stimulus from central banks, government spending and tax policies that encourage expansion and economic overhauls.Advertisement
