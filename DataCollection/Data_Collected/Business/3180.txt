S.&P. WALKS BACK ‘RETALIATION’ CLAIMS  |  The giant credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s, which was accused of inflating the subprime mortgage bubble, had portrayed a Justice Department lawsuit as an act of “retaliation” for its decision to cut the credit rating of the United States in the summer of 2011. Now, it is walking back that claim, Ben Protess writes in DealBook. As part of a $1.37 billion settlement deal expected this week, S.&P. has agreed to acknowledge that it never found evidence supporting its accusations of retaliation, people briefed on the matter said.The Justice Department, Mr. Protess writes, which had “long scoffed at S.&P.’s claims, had emphasized the retraction as a sticking point in the settlement talks. S.&P. eventually agreed, the people said, though its acknowledgment does not address whether additional depositions would have yielded a different conclusion.” The concession will appear as one element in a statement of facts that S.&P. negotiated with state and federal authorities. On a related note, after more than four years of investigating the role of Moody’s, S.&P.’s rival, in fueling the mortgage crisis, the Justice Department recently secured a breakthrough, the people briefed on the matter said. But it is too soon to tell whether the recent developments will revive the long-running inquiry that may result in a lawsuit against Moody’s.

 E.C.B. AGAIN PONDERS AIDING GREEK BANKS  |  The fear that the new government in Greece, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, could be even more radical than expected has prompted a small bank run, raising questions about whether the European Central Bank will again come to the aid of the country’s banks, DealBook’s Landon Thomas Jr. reports. The E.C.B. will meet on Wednesday to decide if it should approve a move by Greece’s central bank to provide emergency loans to some of the country’s biggest banks, a measure used as a last resort when banks are hemorrhaging deposits and cannot obtain funds from their usual lenders. 
Over the weekend, Yanis Varoufakis, the government’s finance minister, said it was halting discussions with the “committee of technocrats” that have been coming to Greece since 2010 to oversee the government’s austerity measures. But he also made clear that Greece would maintain broader debt discussions with its primary creditors: Europe, the E.C.B. and the International Monetary Fund. Greece must make 20 billion euros in debt payments to these entities in 2015, according to an analysis by Brean Capital, an investment firm.
“E.C.B. watchers say that the central bank has learned from its experience in Cyprus, where it bailed out the island’s second-largest lender despite evidence that the bank was bust, which would be a violation of the E.C.B. charter,” Mr. Thomas writes. Now, Mario Draghi, the president of the E.C.B., faces a crucial question, Mr. Thomas adds: “Is it really the E.C.B.’s responsibility to keep Greek banks ‒ or any of the eurozone banks ‒ afloat in the face of a defiantly noncooperative government?”



 TWO RULINGS TO PROTECT BORROWERS  |  Two judges recently issued opinions intended to free homeowners from the maw of a financial giant, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. Last Monday, a Missouri judge ordered Wells Fargo to pay over $3 million in punitive damages and other costs for abusing a borrower, David and Crystal Holm, who battled the bank for the last six and a half years over a foreclosure sale of their $142,000 property. Then on Thursday, Wells Fargo lost a five-year-old disclosure dispute when a federal judge ruled on behalf of another borrower, concluding that there was substantial evidence the bank forged documents when it foreclosed on a property. 
Lawyers in both cases contended that Wells Fargo had moved to foreclose on both properties even though the bank had no proof that it possessed the notes underlying the mortgages.  “Another common element in such cases ‒ conflicts of interest in mortgage loan servicing ‒ also seemed to disturb the judge overseeing the Holm matter. An employee of Freddie Mac testified that it would have welcomed a reinstatement of the Holms’ mortgage. But Wells stood to make more money foreclosing on the couple’s home, an expert witness in the case testified,” Ms. Morgenson writes. 
She adds: “What’s depressing is that it has taken so long for these cases to be resolved. Many people ‒ especially officials at the banks themselves ‒ want us to move on from the foreclosure mess. And no doubt those stuck ‒ out of the limelight ‒ in its unrelenting and crippling machinery would like to do so. But they can’t.”

CEMENT MAKERS TO SELL ASSETS  |  The European cement makers Lafarge and Holcim agreed on Sunday to sell assets to CRH plc, an Irish manufacturer of building materials, for about $7.3 billion to help pave the way for their own merger, DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced reports. The deal is intended to help Lafarge and Holcim satisfy requirements by antitrust officials. Together, the two would create the world’s biggest maker of cement, with combined sales of $44 billion in 2013.
The two companies had needed to sell assets that generated about $5.6 billion in revenue to assuage government regulators. Lafarge and Holcim’s proposed combination has already won approval from the European Union’s competition arm, provided they sell businesses in more than six countries in the region, Mr. de la Merced writes. The companies expect the transaction to be completed by June 30.
