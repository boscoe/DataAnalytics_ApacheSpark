The king of beers is sizing up an even bigger crown.The world’s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, struck an agreement in principle on Tuesday to acquire its closest rival, SABMiller, for about $104 billion.The deal — creating a behemoth in the beer industry with annual revenue of about $64 billion — is expected to garner extensive regulatory scrutiny given the size of the combined company and its potential dominance in several markets worldwide, including the United States.The agreement came after weeks of back and forth between the two companies, and just before a deadline on Wednesday that would have required Anheuser-Busch InBev to make what is considered a formal offer under British takeover rules or not make another approach for up to six months.Behind the scenes, shareholders of the two companies had been holding their own sets of talks. Over the weekend, representatives of 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that helped create Anheuser, held discussions with the Santo Domingo family, which owns 14 percent of SABMiller, according to people briefed on the matter. The Colombian family is also an investor in 3G.AdvertisementIt was 3G that had negotiated with SABMiller’s other big shareholder, the American tobacco giant Altria, which holds a 27 percent stake, and secured its support for a takeover. Having the Brazilians handle the negotiations with a fellow South American beer dynasty made sense, given the Santo Domingos’ close ties to 3G.AdvertisementBy Sunday night, Alejandro Santo Domingo, the 38-year-old scion of his clan and one of the family’s two representatives on the SABMiller board, had agreed to a price of £43.50, these people said.
                The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.            Having won over a shareholder critical for any deal, Carlos Brito, the Anheuser-Busch InBev chief executive, and Olivier Goudet, the Anheuser-Busch chairman, flew to London from New York to meet with Jan du Plessis, the SABMiller chairman, Monday morning, people briefed on the discussions said.In the unassuming brick offices of an SABMiller adviser — the boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw — the men held a series of face-to-face meetings to try to negotiate a deal. Mr. Goudet had not joined previous in-person meetings between Anheuser-Busch and SABMiller, these people said.SABMiller was not only seeking a high premium for its shareholders, but it wanted assurances that a deal could be completed, seeking a commitment from Anheuser-Busch InBev that it would undertake its “best efforts” to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, these people said. By mid-evening, the talks concluded with a handshake agreement in place.On Tuesday, SABMiller said its board, including representatives from both Altria and the Santo Domingo family, was prepared “unanimously to recommend” the offer, subject to an agreement on other terms and conditions.British regulators agreed to extend the deadline for two weeks to Oct. 28, so that Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller could continue their talks. The two sides hope to have a definitive merger agreement in place by then.In London trading on Tuesday, shares of SABMiller closed up more than 9 percent, at £39.48.A merger would bring some of the world’s most popular beers under one roof, including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois from Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Grolsch, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsner Urquell from SABMiller.AdvertisementThe deal would also give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure to faster-growing emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Latin America.The research firm Euromonitor International estimated on Tuesday that the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev-SABMiller would account for 29 percent of global beer sales, after selling assets to win regulatory approval. It also would be more than three times as large in terms of sales as its next closest competitor, the Dutch brewer Heineken, according to Euromonitor.“With all the major M.&A. targets now taken, and M.&A. so important to brewers’ growth, it raises the question of where next for global brewers as they bid to carry on growing,” said Jeremy Cunnington, a senior analyst for alcoholic drinks at Euromonitor.As part of its latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev also agreed to pay a $3 billion fee to SABMiller in the event that the deal failed to receive regulatory approval, the companies said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That partnership owns several major brands in the United States, including Miller Lite, Coors Light and Blue Moon.Under the terms of the joint venture, Molson Coors has the right to make the first offer and match the last for SABMiller’s stake in the joint venture, should it choose to sell. Molson Coors also could save hundreds of millions of dollars in costs by taking full control of the partnership, according to analysts.Another hurdle could be China, where SABMiller holds a 49 percent stake in a joint venture that owns Snow, China’s best-selling beer brand. China Resources Enterprise, its joint venture partner, would be a likely buyer, according to analysts.
            Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller are the world’s largest brewers. Their brands include:        “Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller will have to spend many months convincing regulators in the U.S., Europe, China and Latin America that this is a good deal for beer drinkers,” said Brian J.M. Quinn, a law professor at Boston College Law School.AdvertisementAnheuser-Busch InBev itself was required to restructure its $20.1 billion takeover of Grupo Modelo of Mexico in 2013 after the Justice Department sued to block that deal. Among the concessions at the time, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to sell the rights to Corona beer and other Grupo Modelo brands in the United States to Constellation Brands, one of the world’s largest wine companies, for $2.9 billion.Anheuser-Busch InBev was created seven years ago in a move orchestrated by 3G Capital, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s largest shareholder. The founding partners of 3G used AmBev, their Brazilian company, to merge with InterBrew of Belgium and then orchestrate a surprise takeover of Anheuser-Busch, in 2008.The company, 3G, also has been the driving force behind the combination of Burger King with the Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons into a new company, Restaurant Brands International, in 2014, and the merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz earlier this year.Under the terms of the latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev is offering to pay 44 pounds, or about $67, a share for SABMiller. That is up from an offer of £43.50 a share in cash made on Monday, and it would represent more than a 50 percent premium to SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September, before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was first announced.As part of the deal, Altria and the Santo Domingo family’s BevCo would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at £39.03 a share, a discount to the cash price. Under that proposal, they would receive 0.483969 of a restricted share and £3.78 a share in cash for each share they hold in SABMiller.As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay £67.9 billion.By accepting shares and remaining invested in the combined company, Altria and BevCo would avoid the large tax bills they would incur if they sold their entire holdings.The proposal also included a possibility for SABMiller shareholders to receive dividends ahead of the deal’s completion, up to $1.22 a share.An earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of one of the companies that advised Anheuser-Busch InBev. It is Robey Warshaw, not Robey Warsaw. An earlier version also rendered incorrectly part of the name of a brand produced by a partnership of SABMIller and Molson Coors. It is Coors Light, not Coors Lite.A version of this article appears in print on October 14, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Brewing Rivals to Join.
