General Motors is recalling about 478,000 trucks, including almost 427,000 in the United States, because the brake pedal could fall off, the automaker said on Wednesday.The recall covers the 2015-16 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups known as the 2500 or 3500 models. Also included is the 2015-16 Chevrolet Tahoe police model.The automaker said the brake pedal’s pivot nut could loosen, which could make the brake pedal “inoperative,” allowing it to fall off and possibly interfere with the gas pedal.The automaker is not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the problem, a spokesman, Tom Wilkinson, said in an email.AdvertisementHe said G.M. had detected the problem when it was “analyzing a report of a noise in three of our durability test trucks.”Almost 48,000 vehicles are being recalled in Canada and about 3,500 in Mexico.In a separate action, Subaru is recalling about 77,000 2006-14 Tribeca models because rust could cause the hood latch to fail, allowing it to open while the vehicle is in motion, said a report from the automaker posted on Wednesday on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.AdvertisementThe automaker is not aware of any injuries related to the problem, a spokesman, Michael McHale, said in an email.A version of this article appears in print on February 11, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; G.M.
