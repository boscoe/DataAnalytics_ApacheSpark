SchwartzAppearances can be deceiving.Even as the economy decelerated last quarter, mostly because of more cautious stockpiling by companies as economic turmoil overseas intensified, the American consumer kept right on spending. And most American businesses, in making their longer-term investment decisions, weren’t far behind.While the overall rate of growth was a decidedly lackluster 1.5 percent last quarter, according to the Commerce Department report on Thursday, spending by consumers on goods like furniture and services like health care and insurance advanced at more than twice that pace.“The good news is that the important engine of personal consumption remains strong,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. “The headline data was slightly disappointing, but the persistent strength of personal consumption bodes well for a continued modest expansion in the U.S. economy.”The tempo of growth over the summer, which was in line with analysts’ expectations, represented a marked drop from the 3.9 percent pace of expansion in the spring.But the downshift was mostly the result of slower inventory accumulation as businesses let stockpiles of goods in warehouses and on store shelves unwind rather than making big additions as they did in the first half of 2015. Nonfarm inventories increased at half the rate they did in the second quarter, a reduction that shaved 1.44 percentage points off the overall figure for growth in the third quarter.Business activity presented a mixed picture — investment in equipment and intellectual property rose, but spending on structures fell, a trend experts attributed to cutbacks in the energy industry in response to the sharp decline in oil prices over the last 12 months.In addition to buoyant consumer activity, residential investment was also healthy, a sign that the housing market, after a long period of suffering, is now providing the economy with a fresh tailwind. Government spending also provided a small kick to growth.Stocks traded slightly lower, but bond yields ticked up, indicating that traders are once again leaning toward the view that the Federal Reserve may raise its benchmark interest rate in December.“Outside of the inventory correction, this was a solid report,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. “It bolsters the case that we will see a bounceback in growth,” he added, noting that his bank expecting a growth rate in the current quarter of about 2.5 percent.In terms of the drag from stockpiles, “companies scaled back their expectations,” Mr. Anderson said, but looking ahead to the final quarter this year, inventories “should diminish as a headwind.”Inflation also remained tame, according to the Commerce Department. The index for core consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent last quarter, well below the 2 percent target set by the Federal Reserve.“The combination of strong demand growth and low inflation leaves the prospect of a December rate hike in close balance,” said Ryan Wang, economist at HSBC. “We see the chances as slightly better than 50 percent.”In a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the government reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 1,000 to 260,000 last week, less than expected. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which can be more reliable than the week-to-week snapshot, fell to its lowest level since 1973 and suggested that hiring should be fairly strong.The pluses and minuses buried in the fine print of Thursday’s reports on economic output and hiring highlight the contradictions that economists, Federal Reserve policy makers and ordinary consumers all have to contend with after more than six years of tepid economic growth.Some industries — technology, health care, finance — are enjoying conditions that echo the booming 1990s or the housing bubble of a decade ago.Things could not be more different, however, in areas of the economy that depend on commodity prices, like the oil and gas industry, which has been cutting jobs, reflecting a downturn in energy prices. Manufacturers that service those industries, like steel makers, have also felt a chill.Echoing this pattern, economic conditions are best on the coasts, led by places like New York, Boston, the Research Triangle in North Carolina, Silicon Valley and the Seattle area, while broad areas of the once-thriving midsection of the country are now struggling.“We’ve got a lot of folks moving into the Bay Area getting jobs, and you see the growing pains that come with that, like traffic and housing affordability,” Mr. Anderson, the economist at Bank of the West, said. “The incubator is the tech sector, but it’s broader-based than that.”At the same time, he said, “the decline in energy and commodities is having a detrimental effect on growth from Texas north to Minnesota.”Thursday’s report is the first of three estimates the government will make, and the numbers are bound to be revised upward or downward as more data comes in.Fed officials are still trying to determine when economic conditions will justify a long-anticipated increase in short-term interest rates, which the central bank has held near zero for nearly seven years.On Wednesday, as expected, the Fed left rates unchanged. But officials signaled that an increase could come when they meet in mid-December, especially if economic growth and employment pick up in the fourth quarter. The Labor Department will issue two monthly reports on the job market before that meeting, with the first, for October, to be released on Nov. 6.For the current quarter, experts are anticipating that the economy will bounce back as the drag from slower inventory-building fades. The consensus view today is for gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, to advance at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent, a little better than the overall performance of the economy since the Great Recession ended.“The Q3 G.D.P. report was soft with respect to the headline figure, but the underlying domestic demand data was in line with the pace seen in recent quarters,” said Omair Sharif, rates strategist at SG Americas Securities. “On balance, this report probably does little to change the Fed’s perception that the economy continues to advance at a ‘moderate’ pace.”Advertisement
