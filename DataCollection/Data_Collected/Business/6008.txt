EasyJet’s shares slid nearly 10 percent in afternoon trading in London.The news came as easyJet, Europe’s second-largest low-fare carrier after Ryanair, said it had swung to a net profit of 5 million pounds, or about $7.74 million, in the six months to March 31, from a loss of £41 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose nearly 4 percent, to £1.8 billion. EasyJet reported net profit of £450 million last year, up 13 percent from a year earlier, on revenue of £4.5 billion.“Forward bookings are in line with last year and, as we predicted, passengers are benefiting as fares fall to reflect a more competitive operating environment and lower fuel costs,” Carolyn McCall, the easyJet chief executive, said in a statement.Winter is frequently an unprofitable season for European airlines, as cooler weather curbs demand for leisure travel. But easyJet, which is based in Luton, England, said it had received an unexpected jolt from increased traffic to popular European skiing destinations like France and Switzerland — where the carrier has a strong presence — as well as from a more favorable currency environment.The airline said it expected revenue per seat in the second half of its financial year, which ends Sept. 30, to slip “by low single-digit percentage points” in the face of more intense competition, a weaker euro against the pound and the adverse impact of a strike in April by French air traffic controllers that forced the airline to cancel more than 600 flights.Lower oil prices, however, are expected to reduce the airline’s fuel bill this year by as much as £120 million.In an effort to squeeze further revenue from each flight, easyJet announced plans to add six additional seats to each of its A320 single-aisle jets, beginning in 2016, taking advantage of a higher-density cabin configuration offered by Airbus.The airline said the move should reduce its operating costs per seat by about 2 percent, which it hopes will offset expected rises in other costs, including airport usage and air navigation fees in countries like Germany and Italy.Despite the slightly weaker outlook for summer leisure travel, easyJet said demand from business travelers, which now make up close to 20 percent of its passenger base, continued to be strong. The airline said demand for its business products, which include flexible tickets, allocated seating and priority boarding, had more than doubled in the first half compared with the period a year earlier.Over the last year, easyJet has increased its presence at several airports popular with business travelers, particularly at Gatwick Airport near London, where a quarter of its fleet of 230 single-aisle Airbus planes is based. This year, it added a new base at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam, and it now has 13 daily flights to the Dutch hub from Gatwick, making it the airline’s highest-frequency business route.Advertisement
