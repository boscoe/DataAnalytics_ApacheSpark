The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, is underlining the bank’s willingness to add more monetary stimulus if needed at its December meeting to push inflation higher. Mr. Draghi told members of the European Parliament in Brussels on Thursday that signs of a turnaround in low inflation had “somewhat weakened.” Low annual inflation, currently zero in the 19 countries that use the euro currency, points to weak demand and makes it harder for indebted companies and countries to recover. Mr. Draghi said at the central bank’s last policy meeting on Oct. 22 that it would review whether more stimulus was needed. It has purchased 1.1 trillion euros ($1.2 trillion) in bonds with newly printed money through September. The next European Central Bank meeting is Dec. 3.A version of this brief appears in print on November 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Seeing Weakness, Europe Considers More Stimulus .
