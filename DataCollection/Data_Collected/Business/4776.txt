The hour won’t be a curb on cravings next month in the San Diego area, where McDonald’s plans to test an all-day breakfast. The company, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said in a statement that the test was in response to long-running customer demand. McDonald’s said the test would use a partial menu, featuring hash browns and some breakfast sandwiches. Offering both the breakfast and lunch menus had been considered logistically too difficult for some of its restaurants. The chain said on Twitter in February that its grills “just aren’t big enough for breakfast and lunch.” But the change reflects McDonald’s efforts to keep pace with shifting consumer habits and stay ahead of flagging sales. The company said Monday that it was too early to speculate on any outcomes from the test. Advertisement
