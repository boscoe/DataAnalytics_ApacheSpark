Both companies provide communications and services like data, voice and video transmission for large enterprises and each is trying to scrape away market share from rivals AT&T and Verizon.The $25 billion deal would make the combined company the second-largest provider of communications to business in the United States, after AT&T. It brings CenturyLink an additional 200,000 route miles of fiber and potentially big commercial customers. In 2010, Level 3 struck a multiyear agreement with Netflix to help it stream its video content to consumers. Level 3 would not comment on whether Netflix was still a customer.CenturyLink’s investors were not quite convinced that acquiring Level 3 was the ticket to turn around the company’s recent misfortunes, including competitive pressures from larger cable providers. Shares of CenturyLink fell 12.5 percent on Monday, while shares of Level 3 were up 3.9 percent.Under the terms of the deal, CenturyLink, based in Monroe, La., will acquire Level 3 for $26.50 in cash and 1.4286 shares of CenturyLink stock for each Level 3 share, according to a statement issued by the companies on Monday.Based on the closing price of CenturyLink’s shares from Friday, this represents a price of about $69.92 a share. Including Level 3’s $10.9 billion in debt, the transaction amounts to about $36 billion. That represents a premium of almost 50 percent from Level 3’s share price last Wednesday before reports surfaced of a potential deal.CenturyLink’s shareholders will own 51 percent of the combined company, while Level 3’s will hold the rest.“This transaction furthers our commitment to providing our customers with the network to improve their lives and strengthen their businesses,” Glen F. Post III, CenturyLink’s chief executive and president, said in a statement. “It is this focus on providing fiber connectivity that will continue to distinguish CenturyLink from our competitors.” Mr. Post will continue to serve in his executive role of the combined company.The transaction would significantly lower CenturyLink’s tax expense over the next few years. Level 3 has almost $10 billion of so-called net operating losses, a tax relief generated from periods of unprofitability.The companies also plan to achieve about $975 million a year in cost savings by eliminating duplications and improving operations, the companies said in the statement.The combined company would be based in Monroe, where CenturyLink was founded in 1968. However, they plan to keep a “significant presence” in the Denver area, where Level 3 has its headquarters.CenturyLink has received financing commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley for $10.2 billion.The companies expect to complete the transaction by the end of September 2017, subject to approvals by the Federal Communications Commission, certain states and the majority of both companies’ shareholders. STT Crossing, a subsidiary of ST Telemedia, which holds 18 percent of Level 3’s outstanding shares, has pledged to vote in favor of the transaction.Bank of America and Morgan Stanley gave financial advice to CenturyLink, while Citigroup advised Level 3, with Lazard providing a fairness opinion. Evercore gave a fairness opinion to CenturyLink. The law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Jones Walker worked with CenturyLink, while Willkie Farr & Gallagher advised Level 3. Latham & Watkins and Credit Suisse advised ST Telemedia.Advertisement
