LONDON —  The latest episode of Greece’s debt crisis has revived doubts about the long-term survival of the euro, nowhere more so than in London, Europe’s main financial center and a hotbed of euro-skepticism.The heightened risk of a Greek default and/or exit comes just as there are signs that the eurozone is turning the corner after seven years of financial and economic crisis and that its perilous internal imbalances may be starting to diminish.To skeptics, the election of a radical leftist-led government in Athens that is committed to tearing up Greece’s bailout agreement looks like the start of an unraveling of the 19-nation currency union, with southern countries rebelling against austerity while the European Union’s paymaster, Germany, rebels against further aid.A last-ditch deal to extend Greece’s bailout for four months — after much kicking and screaming between Athens and Berlin — did little to ease fears that the eurozone’s weakest link may end up defaulting on its European creditors.AdvertisementAn aphorism of the American economist Milton Friedman — “What is unsustainable will not be sustained” — is cited by those who believe market forces will eventually overwhelm the political will that holds the euro together.AdvertisementCountries that share a currency cannot devalue when their economies lose competitiveness, as occurred in southern Europe in the first decade of the euro’s existence. And in the eurozone, there is no mechanism for large fiscal transfers between member states.So the only option has been a wrenching “internal devaluation” by countries on the periphery of the euro area, involving real wage, pension and public spending cuts and mass unemployment, causing deep social distress.Austerity has fueled radical forces of political protest and may be running out of democratic road — not just in Greece — but none of the alternative ways out of the eurozone’s economic divergence dilemma looks remotely plausible.“The history of the gold standard tells us that an asymmetric adjustment process involving internal devaluation in debtor countries, with no corresponding inflation in the core, is unlikely to be economically or politically sustainable,” the economic historians Kevin O’Rourke and Alan Taylor wrote in The Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2013. “What is desirable for the eurozone may not be feasible.”Germany has so far been unwilling to accept higher inflation, debt forgiveness, issuing common eurozone bonds or cross-border fiscal transfers. There is scant support for closer political and economic integration of the euro area.“The strategy of the eurozone has been to wait for something to turn up,” said a senior figure in the British financial establishment who has observed the eurozone crisis from up close. “In the 1930s, World War II turned up. Maybe something else will turn up.”The European Central Bank has acted at key moments to hold the eurozone together, vowing in 2012 to do “whatever it takes” to save the currency and now launching a massive program of buying government bonds in an effort to spur the economy and avert deflation.AdvertisementCentral bank action can only buy time for governments to implement structural economic reforms that could close the competitiveness gap by raising potential growth over time. But countries like France and Italy largely failed to use that breathing space in 2013-14 to shake up their labor markets and pension and welfare systems.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Portugal, too, is perking up.German wages are rising faster than prices, giving a lift to consumer spending and raising the prospect that inflation in the bloc’s biggest economy may outpace the rate in southern Europe for several years. That would make economic adjustment more symmetrical, and less agonizing for the south.There are also signs that France and Italy, the eurozone’s second- and third-largest economies, are finally tackling some of the economic reforms that politicians long feared to touch, albeit at a slow and gradual pace.In France, the government of President François Hollande has just rammed through a bill to loosen some shackles on business, like a prohibition on Sunday store openings, and plans new steps to ease labor regulation.The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has introduced a jobs act to ease hiring and firing and is making progress on reform to streamline Parliament and the electoral system.“Spain shows that reform is possible to create a growth environment and significant job creation,” said Luigi Speranza, co-head of European economics at BNP Paribas bank in London. “The return of growth could make it easier for Renzi to make reforms in Italy, and Hollande in France.”The European Commission’s budget leniency for Paris and Rome may assist that process by rewarding them for planned growth-enhancing reforms with more time to cut their deficits and debt.AdvertisementAnother encouraging sign is that lending to businesses in Italy and Spain is picking up following last year’s central bank stress tests of European banks, and their interest rates are falling, narrowing the gap with the eurozone core.A Greek default or exit from the eurozone — whether by accident or intention — could shatter that returning trust, even though Athens accounts for just 2 percent of the bloc’s economy. So Greece’s fate remains entwined with the euro’s survival.Paul Taylor is a Reuters correspondent. A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2015, in The International New York Times.
