One upstart hoping to challenge Bloomberg, Money.net, quickly sent out a message complaining about Bloomberg’s dominance, with the title: “Too Big to Fail: Lack of Competition on Trading Floor.”The traders who use the Bloomberg terminals have remained attached to their trademark colorful keyboards and orange on-screen text. But bank executives said the failure would force everyone to listen more seriously to potential alternatives.The bigger fear on European trading desks was that regulators may determine that Bloomberg’s dominance is actually a systemic risk, in need of some regulatory fix, on top of other recent technology additions.“We recognize that Bloomberg is a monopoly, and we probably lean on them too hard, but it’s a hard nut to crack,” the head of a credit trading desk at a large bank said on Friday, speaking on the condition of anonymity.Bloomberg said the problem was caused by “a combination of hardware and software failures,” accompanied by failure in the company’s “multiple redundant systems.”Traders said that the failure was taken seriously, in part, because Bloomberg’s systems were normally so robust that many customers assumed they would never go down.“This is the first sign of what we should have known all along, which is that Bloomberg is not infallible,” said David B. Weiss, an analyst at the Aite Group.The Bloomberg data terminals are the core of the business empire that Michael R. Bloomberg founded in 1981. He returned unexpectedly last year to lead the company after serving three terms as mayor of New York City.When Mr. Bloomberg came back, banks were already looking for ways to decrease their reliance on his company. Last year, Goldman Sachs completed an effort involving several banks to create a messaging system that could compete with Bloomberg’s chat program — one of the most popular elements of the network.The problems on Friday began just as the trading day was about to close in Asia. In Hong Kong, bankers reported that their terminals crashed not long after 3 p.m.Many larger banks and financial companies have backup systems and alternative data suppliers, like products from Thomson Reuters, to avoid a serious disruption.But even if banks had backups, many of their smaller clients did not, which shut off potential trades.One sales trader, based in Geneva, said his company had a few dozen Bloomberg terminals and used them mainly for buying and selling exchange-traded funds and credit and for research. None of the firm’s terminals were able to connect for about 2 hours 20 minutes but worked later in the day, he said.When asked what problems the failure created, the trader said: “Problems? Simple: No prices. Nothing. So you can’t do anything at all.”He said that simply switching to a Thomson Reuters terminal was not an option for some. “People are used to going through ’Berg and so it’s confusing for a lot of us who never use Reuters,” he said.It was hard to immediately determine the failure’s effect on specific financial markets. Some traders said that the failure encouraged the negative sentiment that pushed stock prices around the world lower.But many of the markets where Bloomberg is most heavily used are the so-called over-the-counter markets in which there is little good data on the volume of trading, making it hard to gauge the decline in trading activity.The shutdown did prompt the postponement of some bond sales, including one of about 3 billion pounds, or about $4.46 billion, in short-term debt issued by the British Treasury.The Debt Management Office in London said it briefly delayed the sale Friday morning because of “ongoing technical issues” with a third-party platform supplier, which it later confirmed was Bloomberg.The auction of the Treasury bonds, ranging from one month to six months in length, was conducted Friday afternoon in London after Bloomberg services resumed for most customers.In the markets for corporate and government bonds, especially in Europe, almost all of the communication between banks and investors happens through the Bloomberg chat program.An employee of a Hong Kong financial firm said that traders had resorted to using “old-fashioned emails” to communicate.“Longest it’s been out that any of us can recall,” he added, referring to the service disruption.But other traders said they depended on Bloomberg chat so heavily that they weren’t able to easily reach out to clients through other means.“People might call this the Chat Crash,” Mr. Weiss said.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement
