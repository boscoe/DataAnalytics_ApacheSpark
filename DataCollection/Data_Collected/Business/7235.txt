Puerto Rico’s power authority, which supplies electricity to the island’s 3.6 million people, made a $415 million debt payment that was due Wednesday after reaching a deal with its bond insurers to borrow more money.The payment, which was made from debt service reserve accounts and a cash infusion from the island’s general fund, is the first test case for the commonwealth’s new approach to restructuring its debt.Gov. Alejandro García Padilla is seeking a vast restructuring of the island’s $72 billion debt after concluding that the island cannot afford to pay all of it.Negotiations between creditors and government officials over the $9 billion owed by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as Prepa, have been taking place for more than a year. But the warning by the governor about a broad restructuring raised new questions about the government’s willingness to pay the debt owed by Prepa and other government enterprises on the island.AdvertisementPrepa said on Wednesday that it was financing its principal and interest payment with $153 million in cash and the rest from its debt-service reserve accounts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
