December’s figure was also revised higher to show a decline of only 1.5 percent, compared with a previously estimated drop of 3.7 percent. The index is now 8.4 percent above its level one year ago and is at the highest level since August 2013. The data points to a rebound in the sales of existing homes in the coming months, particularly as the spring buying season gets underway. Measures of sales and construction fell last month, raising concerns that the housing market would continue to struggle after a weak 2014. But economists expect that strong job gains, low mortgage rates and solid consumer confidence will provide a moderate increase to home sales this year. “Through the volatility, the trend in home sales is probably up modestly at least,” Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.
