WASHINGTON —  Retail sales in the United States barely rose in September, and producer prices recorded their biggest decline in eight months, data released on Wednesday showed.The weak reports were the latest suggestion that the economy was losing momentum in the face of slowing global growth, a strong dollar, an inventory correction and lower oil prices, which are hampering capital spending in the energy industry. Job growth braked sharply in the last two months.The Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month largely as cheaper gasoline pushed service station receipts down 3.2 percent. Giving the report a weak tone, sales in August were revised downward to show them unchanged instead of rising 0.2 percent.Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services slipped 0.1 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in August.AdvertisementThese so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously said to have advanced 0.4 percent in August.

Last month’s weak core sales and the downward revision to August’s figure, together with another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories again unchanged in August, prompted JPMorgan to cut its estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product by half a percentage point, to an annual rate of 1 percent.AdvertisementThe economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter. Some economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the soft retail sales report, noting that discretionary spending remained fairly healthy.Consumers bought more automobiles and furniture and spent more on hobbies, clothing and eating out. Those increases point to underlying strength in domestic demand, which should provide some cushion against softening global growth.“The overall message is that consumer spending has remained extremely strong,” said Harm Bandholz, a chief economist at UniCredit Research.Sales of electronic goods were soft despite the introduction of Apple’s latest iPhone.A report from the Federal Reserve showed that the economy was expanding modestly from mid-August through early October. It described consumer spending as growing “moderately” during the same period and noted that the strong dollar was hurting manufacturing.In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index fell 0.5 percent in September, the largest drop since January, after being unchanged in August.

The central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since late 2008.“It is the uncertain course of inflation that could keep the Fed from hiking rates this year,” said Joel L.
