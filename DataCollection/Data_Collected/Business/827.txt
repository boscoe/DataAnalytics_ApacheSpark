The Miss Universe Organization finally has a new television partner: Fox.The partnership, announced Wednesday, should put an end to a monthslong drama after the organization, and its various beauty pageants, lost a TV home and then its two owners after Donald J. Trump made comments about immigrants as he started his presidential campaign.The comments ignited an outrage. NBC, which owned the organization along with Mr. Trump, refused to broadcast the Miss USA beauty pageant in July, and fired Mr. Trump as host of “The Celebrity Apprentice.” (He has since been replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger.) Then, in September, NBC sold its share of the Miss Universe Organization to Mr. Trump who, in turn, sold the entire organization to the talent agency WME-IMG.IMG will now team up with Fox. The network will broadcast the Miss Universe pageant on Dec. 20, and the Miss USA pageant next year, the network said. Fox did not disclose how long its contract with IMG was.After Miss USA was pushed from NBC this summer and the broadcast went to the cable channel Reelz, poor ratings followed. The pageant was watched by 925,000 people, down from 5.6 million the year before.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
