BERLIN — For years, YouTube users in Germany have searched for music videos on the online streaming service, only to be confronted with one of the most hated icons on the internet here: a small red TV-shaped symbol informing them they were unable to view the video.On Tuesday, the long-running dispute over royalties between YouTube and Germany’s main music rights organization that set off the error message finally came to an end.The two sides said they had reached a deal on compensating artists, resolving a dispute that began in 2009, long before stars like Katy Perry and Pharrell Williams began accusing YouTube of paying too little in royalties and seeking to change laws.The resolution comes with European officials revamping the region’s copyright rules to give more power to music labels, publishers and other content producers over the likes of Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook.AdvertisementBoth YouTube and the music rights organization, known by its German acronym GEMA, hailed the deal. YouTube declared it a victory for musicians, saying they could reach “new and existing fans in Germany,” while GEMA said its 70,000 members would receive “fair remuneration” when their works were played over the platform.AdvertisementNeither side published the details of the agreement.“We remained true to our position that authors should also get a fair remuneration in the digital age, despite the resistance we met,” Harald Heker, GEMA’s chief executive, said in a statement. He added that the agreement covered future royalties, as well as those accrued over the last seven years.The dispute has played out in a series of court cases.In 2012, a Hamburg court ordered Google, YouTube’s owner, to install filters to detect and stop people from watching material to which the internet conglomerate did not own the rights, or face a fine of 250,000 euros, or about $275,000.In January, however, a Munich court ruled against GEMA, which was seeking €1.6 million in damages over a selection of music that was to be compensated with 0.375 euro cents each time a song was played.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The plans are under discussion and will not come into force until 2018, at the earliest.The proposals — part of an attempt to create a single digital market across the 28-member bloc — also would demand that services like YouTube beef up their copyright protection tools so that protected music content could not be streamed online without permission.They also may lead to online video services having to pay more to music rights holders when their content is viewed online.AdvertisementEuropean officials and some industry groups say the changes are required to give publishers and music labels greater control over their copyrighted material, though many American tech giants say the proposals go too far and will probably hamper innovation and investment.Follow Melissa Eddy on Twitter @meddynyt.Mark Scott contributed reporting from RomeA version of this article appears in print on November 2, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: YouTube Agrees to Pay Royalties, Ending German Music Rights Dispute.
