The large mutual funds that helped fuel rapid growth in developing countries have begun hastily retreating from those investments, contributing to the recent sharp decline in global markets.In the last week alone, investors pulled $2.5 billion from emerging-market bond funds, the largest withdrawal since January 2014.The world’s fastest-growing economies — led by China — have been propelled by soaring commodity prices, robust currencies and access to cheap loans, primarily through the sale of high-yield, high-risk bonds. But China’s decision to devalue its currency has set off a chain reaction of panicked selling around the world that contributed to the biggest one-week loss on Wall Street since 2011, sending the Dow Jones industrial average into correction territory (10 percent below its recent peak). The index was down 531 points on Friday and nearly 6 percent for the week.The currency devaluation increased concerns that growth in China was slowing and that other countries might follow with their own devaluations. The notion unnerved bond investors, who began to retreat out of fear they would not be repaid. General uneasiness about a global economic slowdown spread to stocks, which many have believed to be overvalued and due for a decline.Advertisement“The growth rates for many of these countries were vastly overstated,” said Dani Rodrik, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who has studied the impact of foreign capital flows in developing economies. “It was all very unsustainable.”AdvertisementThe selling spree has raised concerns among regulators and economists about a broader contagion that could make it difficult for individual investors to withdraw money from their mutual funds.While these funds do not use borrowed money, as did the banks that failed during the mortgage crisis, they have invested large sums in a wide variety of high-yielding bonds and bank loans that are not easy to sell — especially in a bear market.If investors ask to be repaid all at once — as happened in 2008 — a run-on-the-bank scenario could unfold because funds would have difficulty meeting the demands of people wanting their cash back.During previous global investment booms and busts, large commercial banks were the dominant overseas lenders. These institutions were just as prone to making bad lending decisions as bond investors, but they also tended to have longer-term relationships with their borrowers and were less likely to cut and run.Because large global banks suffered significant losses during the financial crisis and were forced to rein in their lending, more nimble — and fickle — bond investors stepped in.In January, economists at the Bank for International Settlements, or B.I.S., a clearinghouse for global central banks, published a study that highlighted how fast dollar-based lending to companies and countries outside the United States had increased since the financial crisis — doubling to over $9 trillion.What struck the authors most was that this growth was coming not from global banks but from American mutual funds buying the bonds of emerging-market issuers.AdvertisementLarge fund companies like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Pimco and have been inundated with money from investors eager to invest in the high-yielding bonds of emerging-market corporations and countries.For example, Pimco’s Total Return bond fund, which last year suffered the loss of its star manager, William H. Gross, and is a mainstay for investors with fairly conservative investment goals, has 21 percent of its $101 billion in assets invested in emerging-market bonds and derivatives.Among the many beneficiaries of this largess were commodity-driven borrowers such as the state-owned oil companies Petrobras in Brazil and Pemex in Mexico, the Russian state-owned natural gas exporter Gazprom, and real estate developers in China.One of the more extreme cases of this bond market frenzy was Mongolia. In 2012, with expectations high that the relatively tiny economy would reap the benefits from China’s ceaseless appetite for raw materials, the government sold $1.5 billion worth of bonds, with demand from investors reaching $10 billion.That meant, in effect, that the country was in a position to borrow an amount twice the size of its $4 billion gross domestic product.Three years later, the International Monetary Fund is warning that Mongolia may not be able to make good on these loans — 14 percent of which are owned by Franklin Templeton, according to Bloomberg data — and the yields have shot up to about 9 percent from 4 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But it illustrates the risks global mutual fund investors were willing to take on in their desire to load up on high-yielding securities.Mongolia, which was able to sell an additional $500 million in bonds this spring, was not the only dubious borrower to attract cash from global bond investors. Russian train companies easily sold dollar bonds, despite the fact that their revenues were earned in rubles. Even Ecuador, a country that defaulted in 2008, was able to raise $2 billion last year.Brazil, China, Malaysia, Russia, Turkey and others have sold more than $2 trillion in bonds, mostly to American mutual fund companies, since 2009. As this money flowed into their countries, financing skyscrapers in Istanbul and oil exploration in Brazil, economies and currencies strengthened.AdvertisementNow the reverse is occurring, led by a slowing Chinese economy, and as that money heads for safety, local currencies are plunging.In a follow-up paper this month, B.I.S. economists warn of the consequences if bond investors sell these positions in a panic at more or less the same time. And they point out that because bond funds have become so large and own so many of the same securities (many of which tend to be hard to sell), a bond-selling panic can spread quickly.For example, there has been explosive growth in so-called unconstrained bond funds, which operate somewhat like a hedge fund, with a mandate to buy any security in any part of the world.According to Morningstar, these funds have increased to $154 billion from $9 billion in 2009, with many of them invested in emerging-market bonds. Because these funds tend to take on more risk and buy securities that are harder to sell — such as emerging-market bonds — the fear is that the managers of these funds will not be able to provide cash to investors when they demand it.Pimco’s unconstrained bond fund, to name one, has 42 percent of its $7.9 billion in assets in emerging-market bonds — mostly Brazilian government securities. (Last month, investors withdrew $492 million from the fund.)Exchange-traded funds, a type of mutual fund that trades like a stock and promises instant liquidity, have also been large investors in emerging markets.What worries many regulators and economists is how much mutual fund money is now tied up in these hard-to-sell bonds — an amount that far exceeds the exposure investors had to these markets in earlier emerging-market crises.EPFR Global, a fund-tracking company, calculates that global bond funds have allocated 16 percent of their holdings to emerging-market bonds. Relative to the 2.5 percent recommended benchmark for these securities suggested by the Barclays aggregate bond index, that is a very aggressive bet.Ricardo Adrogue, an emerging-markets-debt investor at Babson Capital in Boston, says it is the extreme declines in the currencies of Malaysia, Mexico, Russia and Turkey that worry him — not so much the Chinese devaluation.Advertisement“People are saying, ‘I want out,’ ” he said. “It is difficult to see the bottom with all these depreciating currencies.”A version of this article appears in print on August 23, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Investors Race to Escape Risk in Global Bonds.
