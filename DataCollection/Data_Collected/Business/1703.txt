Taking on the role will be Jeff Toig, a former SoundCloud executive.The announcement comes after months of management upheaval at Tidal. And the service is undoubtedly looking to Mr. Toig to right a company that has lost its footing in the months since Jay Z reintroduced it in March at a star-studded news conference in New York.The service, which Jay Z bought for $56 million, said in April that Andy Chen, the chief executive of Aspiro, Tidal’s corporate parent, had left. His replacement, Peter Tonstad, departed in June. And Vania Schlogel, a former private equity executive who represented Tidal to investors as chief investment officer, said last month that she had resigned over the summer.Tidal was envisioned as a hub for high-fidelity audio and exclusive content. Jay Z said a majority of the company would also be controlled by the artists themselves, which made waves in an industry grappling with the value of music in the digital age.But the company has stumbled in a market dominated by Apple, Spotify, Pandora and YouTube, even as it has celebrated some successes. In October, for example, a Tidal concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn featuring top artists including Lil Wayne and Beyoncé raised $1.5 million for charity.Mr. Toig, the former chief business officer for the streaming service SoundCloud, will take over his new role on Jan. 4.Advertisement
