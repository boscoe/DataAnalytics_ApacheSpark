Pfizer is buying Medivation for its heavily used prostate cancer drug Xtandi, which generates roughly $2 billion in sales a year.The Medivation deal pushed other biotechnology stocks higher as well, helping the Nasdaq do better than the S.&P. 500 and the Dow. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Alexion Pharmaceuticals all rose 3 percent or more.Monday’s trading was extremely light — as it has been for most of the month, which is typical in August — as many investors remain on the sidelines until after Labor Day.

Yellen, the Federal Reserve’s chairwoman, speaks at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.While investors do not expect the central bank to raise interest rates at its September meeting, there is always the possibility that it will, as well as the increasing likelihood of a rate increase after the presidential election.“We are in the calm before it gets much busier after Labor Day,” said David Lebovitz, a global market strategist with J. P. Morgan Funds.Oil prices fell sharply. Benchmark crude lost $1.47 to settle at $47.05 a barrel, and Brent crude, used to price oil internationally, declined $1.72 to settle at $49.16 a barrel.
