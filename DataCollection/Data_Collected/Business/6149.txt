The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 6.47 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,129.20, and the Nasdaq rose 30.15 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,078.44.While the S.&P. 500 notched nominal record highs for three straight days, strategists caution that it will be difficult for the stock market to move substantially higher from here.

Lebovitz, a global market strategist with JPMorgan Funds.Shares of Urban Outfitters, the clothing and accessories retailer, tumbled in aftermarket trading as higher expenses, including marketing costs, dragged down first-quarter results.
