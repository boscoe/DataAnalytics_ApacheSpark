The company, best known for its printers and copiers, said its board approved a review of its businesses and spending plans. “Although we already have taken steps to accelerate cost reductions and prioritize investments to drive improved productivity and higher margins, our board determined that undertaking a comprehensive review of structural options for the company’s portfolio is the right decision at this time,” the company’s chairwoman and chief, Ursula Burns, said in a statement. Also on Monday, Xerox reported a third-quarter loss of $34 million, or 4 cents a share, after reporting a profit in the same period a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges and amortization costs, the company, based in Norwalk, Conn., posted an adjusted profit of 24 cents a share, better than expected. Advertisement
