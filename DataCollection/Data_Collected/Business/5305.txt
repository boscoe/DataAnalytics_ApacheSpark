Verizon Communications is introducing a television offering through FiOS that gives customers more options to pay for the channels they watch and not for those they don’t.The move is the latest attempt by the television establishment to introduce more flexibility in the face of a flurry of new competition from streaming rivals. A growing number of people are forgoing traditional television service in favor of streaming options that can be cheaper and provide more choice.Verizon’s new service, called FiOS Custom TV, starts at $55 a month and offers a base channel package with more than 35 channels, including local broadcasters and networks like CNN, HGTV, AMC and the Food Network. In addition, customers can select two of seven genre-specific packages — like sports, children or entertainment — that include about 10 to 17 additional channels and are part of the $55 monthly charge. Customers also can add channel packages for $10 a month and change their selections after 30 days.With the new TV service, available on Sunday, Verizon will also sell Internet and phone service in a bundle for additional fees.AdvertisementVerizon’s new offering is a discount on the typical monthly cable bill, which comes to an average of $90 a household, according to the data firm SNL Kagan.
                Here are some prominent services offering live TV, à la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.

Angelakis, chief financial officer at Comcast, the largest cable operator in the country, said in a recent conference that the company had also thought about “more flexible packaging, more streaming, lighter packages in order to provide those alternatives and those choices to our customers.”Verizon’s new offering could usher in a series of similar offerings from other traditional providers, analysts said. The cable and satellite industry negotiates deals based on “most favored nation” status, meaning that if some companies land distribution deals with TV groups, their rivals are often entitled to reach similar terms. “If Verizon has this ability, it implies that you will shortly see others do it to,” said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research.New choices could pose a threat to the established economics of the television industry. The business is built on big TV groups’ selling bundles of television networks to cable and satellite companies, which in turn package those networks for subscribers. The fraying of that bundle could disrupt that model.There also are questions as to whether the new packages — while offering more choice — provide savings to customers, who could end up paying more once they add together all the channels and networks they wantA version of this article appears in print on April 18, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Verizon to Offer Service Letting Customers Pick and Choose Channels.
