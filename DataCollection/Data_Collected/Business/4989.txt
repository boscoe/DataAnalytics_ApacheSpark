Consumers increased their borrowing to a record high in February, driven by a large jump in auto and student loans. The Federal Reserve reported Tuesday that consumer borrowing expanded $15.5 billion in February after a $10.8 billion gain in January. The February increase pushed borrowing to a new high of $3.34 trillion. Borrowing in the category including auto and student loans increased $19.2 billion, the biggest monthly gain since July 2011. That offset a $3.7 billion decline in the credit card category. Consumer borrowing has risen 6.8 percent over the last year.A version of this brief appears in print on April 8, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Loans for Cars and Tuition Push Borrowing to Record High.
