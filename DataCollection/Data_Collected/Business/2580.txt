Not that it will do passengers any good. You cannot fly AirTran anymore. The low-fare carrier has finally been folded into Southwest Airlines, which bought it in 2011. The Transportation Department said on Tuesday that 80.6 percent of domestic flights on the 14 biggest airlines arrived within 14 minutes of schedule in November. That was better than Octoberâ€™s 80 percent on-time rate but down from 83.5 percent in November 2013. AirTran had a 90.4 percent rating, a jump of about 10 percentage points, mostly because it flew only about a third as many flights. Hawaiian was second at 89.4 percent. Among the four largest airlines, Delta performed best at 86.6 percent. Envoy Air finished last among all airlines, with an on-time rating of 69.3 percent. Advertisement
