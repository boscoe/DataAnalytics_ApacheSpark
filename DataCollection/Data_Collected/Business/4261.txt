Procter & Gamble could not immediately be reached for comment.China has been trying to strengthen consumer protection laws and beef up punishment for businesses found to have misled shoppers. Global companies like Apple, Nikon and Volkswagen have been under the regulators’ glare in recent years.Crest is a leader in China’s fast-growing toothpaste market, where Procter & Gamble competes with its American rival Colgate-Palmolive, which also sells the local brand Darlie through a joint venture. Crest said in its Sina Weibo post on Tuesday that all the brand’s products went through rigorous testing in China before going to market, to comply with Chinese law.”Crest has always done its utmost to produce and sell high-quality, safe products for consumers,” the brand said, adding that its standards were the same around the world.Advertisement
