Automakers have been expanding manufacturing in China as the market there has been booming. Although car sales are projected to rise again this year, the Chinese economy has been slowing down, which could extend to a slowdown in the car market.

Auto sales have soared in China as millions of households become prosperous enough to afford them.

Chinese buyers of new cars are turning their backs on thrifty small cars and are choosing ever larger models that also tend to have bigger profit margins for manufacturers. But because China charges automotive sales taxes that rise steeply with engine size, even the largest cars and sport utility vehicles in China tend to have smaller engines than in the West.
