The company is trying to gain more international customers.Michael Evans, Alibaba group president, said that the company was “very disappointed” to be put back on the list, and that Alibaba was far more advanced in protecting intellectual property rights than it was four years ago. He added that the decision ignored Alibaba’s work to remove more than twice the number of product listings this year than in 2015.“We question whether the U.S.T.R. acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate,” Mr. Evans said.Taobao, China’s most popular consumer-to-consumer shopping website, was put on the trade representative office’s blacklist in 2011 but removed in 2012 after addressing concerns of intellectual property rights holders and committing to cut the amount of pirated and counterfeit goods for sale online.The trade representative’s office acknowledged that Alibaba had taken steps to combat piracy, including addressing the misuse of brand keywords, blurring trademarks in product images and developing technology to prevent counterfeit sellers from reopening under new names.It added that current levels of reported counterfeiting and piracy were “unacceptably high,” with such goods posing a “grave economic threat” to American creative and innovative industries and posing public health threats in some cases.Advertisement
