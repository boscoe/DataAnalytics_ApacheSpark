LONDON — On a soggy morning in late June, as Britain absorbed the staggering news that it had voted to abandon the European Union, a stone-faced Canadian took to national television to offer assurances that the world was not ending.Mark Carney, the first foreigner to head Britain’s central bank in its 322 years of existence, was suddenly a crucial figure in the improvised effort to manage the fallout of the so-called Brexit vote.No one knew what the referendum meant, but markets worldwide were plummeting in fear and confusion. Much of the British government was in tatters. The central bank was wielding 250 billion pounds, or about $345 billion, to throw at the financial system. “We are well prepared for this,” Mr. Carney said that morning.In the weeks after, Mr. Carney led the Bank of England to drop interest rates to a record low while stepping up its purchases of bonds to expand credit through the economy — all in a bid to spur spending and investment. He vouched for the ability of the British financial system to withstand a shock.AdvertisementBut as the central bank held course with interest rates and bond purchases on Thursday, Mr. Carney finds himself confronting political controversy along with pointed questions over the effectiveness and legitimacy of his activist course.AdvertisementEven those who lavish praise on his leadership suggest the bank may be out of ammunition. Whatever happens from here — whether Britain slides into recession or escapes that fate — may depend more on whether the Treasury unleashes government spending than on anything Mr. Carney may be considering.“He’s a very cool, collected person, and he indeed rose to the occasion, but there are clear limits to what he can do,” said Richard Portes, an economist at the London Business School, who counts Mr. Carney a friend. “They can’t seriously counteract the underlying real economic effects of this.”His detractors in the Conservative Party argue that Mr. Carney tried to scare the electorate into voting to stay in Europe with exaggerated forecasts of economic damage, then acted precipitously to cut interest rates even as the economy proved resilient.“You begin to think that all his actions have a political spin to them, and therefore people make the criticism that he cut rates in a panic to prove himself right,” Mr. Carney’s principal critic, Jacob Rees-Mogg, a supporter of the decision to leave and a member of the House of Commons Treasury Committee, told Bloomberg News last week. “He has undermined the perception of impartiality of the Bank of England.”If Mr. Carney feels misgivings, he betrayed none during an appearance at a Parliamentary committee last week.“I’m absolutely serene,” he said. “I absolutely feel comfortable in the decision that I supported and the committee took in August to supply monetary policy stimulus.”
                Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how “Brexit” has affected business so far.            Economists generally dismiss talk that Britain is safely past troubles caused by the referendum.“It’s rubbish,” said John Van Reenen, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. “We haven’t had any Brexit yet. In terms of the economic effects, we are looking at what happens when we leave the European Union.”AdvertisementStock markets and consumer spending have held up better than anticipated, but the full impact will not be known for at least several months.A slowdown in investment is expected, as multinational companies hold off on expanding operations in Britain until its future trading relationship with Europe is clear. Major banks are actively exploring shifting parts of their businesses out of Britain, a potentially significant blow.But one worry does seem to have been dispatched — the threat that the vote could deliver a shock to the global financial system. Here, Mr. Carney draws plaudits for the performance art aspects of central banking.As the referendum result reverberated on the morning of June 24, markets plunged from Tokyo to London to New York, erasing $2 trillion in global wealth. The sell-off conjured talk of another Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that collapsed in 2008, setting off the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.The vote ostensibly kicked off torturous divorce proceedings with Europe that jeopardized Britain’s exports while threatening to send major banks scrambling to abandon London.No one appeared to be running things. Prime Minister David Cameron would soon declare his pending resignation. The man in charge of the budget, George Osborne, disappeared from the scene. The opposition Labour Party commenced bloody recriminations.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Britain had just taken a leap into the wild unknown. Here was the one person who had remembered to pack provisions.“There was a general need to bring about some restoration of confidence in the economy,” said Charles Goodhart, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee, and now a professor at the London School of Economics. “Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England was one of the few remaining figures of authority in place who could tell people that things were not falling apart.”AdvertisementThat Mr. Carney operates with a North American accent appears to have lent him some immunity as politicians who supported the referendum have accused him of stoking fears.“If he’d been a Brit, people would have been able to say, ‘Oh, you would say that, because you went to that school, or belong to this club,’” Mr. Van Reenen said. “Having someone who’s a bit of an outsider, it gave him more robustness in defending what he was doing.”Born in Canada’s remote Northwest Territories (population, 44,340), Mr. Carney grew up primarily in Edmonton. He spent 13 years traveling the globe for Goldman Sachs and assumed the governorship of Canada’s central bank in 2008.If bankers expected that his Goldman ties would make Mr. Carney a pliable regulator, they were in for disappointment. His central bank forced Canadian institutions to reserve more of their capital than lenders elsewhere. That limited Canada’s exposure to the global financial crisis.In 2011, as central bankers drafted new rules aimed at preventing another financial crisis, Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously excoriated Mr. Carney behind closed doors: The proposed rules discriminated against American bankers, Mr. Dimon charged.Mr. Carney held his ground. “If some institutions feel pressure today,” he declared in a speech two days later, “it is because they have done too little for too long.”Most observers assume Mr. Carney prefers to avoid more monetary loosening, allowing the Treasury to take the lead, but will not hesitate if economic growth deteriorates.Given that the vote was, on one level, a call for limits on immigration, some celebrate Mr. Carney’s prominent role as a sign that British openness endures.Advertisement“The only grown-up in the room turns out to be an immigrant,” said Ricardo Reis, an economist at the London School of Economics.But if the electorate had in mind limiting the influx of Polish plumbers and Syrian refugees, Mr. Carney presents a different sort of immigrant. He bears degrees from Harvard and Oxford. He is married to the British economist Diana Carney. His pay package runs 874,000 pounds a year, or nearly $1.2 million.Still, the presence of a Canadian heading the institution that watches the money attests to Britain’s continued willingness to import high-level talent.The English Premier League, the pinnacle of global soccer, is stocked with top players from every shore. Chefs, architects and theater directors flock to London.“The U.K. is the epicenter of what is frequently known as the Wimbledon effect,” Mr. Goodhart said. Before Andy Murray won the tennis tournament for the first time in 2013, no Briton had taken the trophy for 77 years, yet people cheered the winners.“We don’t care about the identity of the person,” Mr. Goodhart said, “as long as they are doing the right thing for us in the U.K.”A version of this article appears in print on September 16, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Polished Outsider Takes Reins Amid Chaos of ‘Brexit’.
