CreditLauren Justice for The New York Times        How far will an aging ultradistance runner go?On March 1, the day after his 80th birthday, Bill Dodson of Mountain View, Calif., tested his limits.On a frigid day in Caumsett State Park on Long Island — competing in a 50-kilometer (31-mile) race that was also serving as the USA Track & Field National 50K Championship — Mr. Dodson made a dogged effort to set a record for the 80- to 85-year-old age group.Judging from some of his previous performances, the existing record — 5 hours, 54 minutes, 59 seconds — seemed well within his grasp.But as the wintry day wore on, flakes began descending, and by the time Mr. Dodson was on his final 5K loop, it was snowing heavily.AdvertisementHe struggled on, slipping and falling twice on the slick pavement. Both times, he arose and continued to shuffle along.Advertisement“I pushed myself to the absolute limits,” he said afterward.Indeed: With the finish line in sight, he fell again. And this time, crawled across the finish line.He missed the record by eight seconds.That day, Mr. Dodson, a retired computer programmer and grandfather of six, was exposed to the elements more than twice as long as the overall winner of the 50K, a man young enough to be one of those grandchildren, 23-year-old Zachary Ornelas of Ann Arbor, Mich., who covered the distance in 2 hours, 52 minutes.So was Mr. Dodson’s all-out effort admirable or foolhardy? An example of determination at its best, or a case of an older adult stubbornly putting himself in danger?Probably the former and not the latter, says a longtime researcher of ultradistance runners. “It seems to me like he’s just driven towards a goal,” said Dr. Martin D. Hoffman, a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of California at Davis and principal investigator in a continuing study of such runners.That study, involving 1,212 subjects, has yielded three published papers since it began in 2011. Among the findings is something that would surprise even typical weekend distance runners — many of whom regard the ultrarunners as a bit of a lunatic fringe: “The injury incidence in the ultrarunners wasn’t higher than what had been reported in other studies of runners in shorter distances,” Dr. Hoffman said. Another finding was that runners who were younger and less experienced in ultramarathons — generally, races longer than the standard 26.2-mile marathon — appeared to be most at risk of injury.Theories abound as to why: Ultrarunners, especially older ones, tend to run long, but not very fast. They know how to pace themselves. They are experienced and can marshal their resources appropriately for the big day as opposed to grinding out the miles in training day after day. And, since ultras are often held on trails, the pounding the runners’ joints endure could be less severe than it would be in a big-city marathon on unforgiving pavement.According to Bryon Powell of Moab, Utah, who keeps statistics on ultrarunners on his website iRunFar.com, about 20 percent of all ultradistance race finishers in the United States last year were 50 and over. (Although far fewer in number than marathoners, runners who have finished an ultramarathon have risen an estimated 50 percent in the last five years, to about 25,000 to 30,000 in 2014.) In certain areas, including California and New York, the percentage of ultrarunners over 50 may even be higher.Advertisement“Ultrarunners are typically older than your average runner, no question about it,” says Mike Polansky, president of the Greater Long Island Running Club, the organizer of the 50K in which Mr. Dodson competed in March.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Scarpinato, an orthopedic surgeon who treats many runners in her practice in Melville, N.Y. “They have the same routine.”Based on what she sees, the older ultramarathoners do not seem to suffer injury to any greater degree than those running shorter distances, an observation that squares with Dr. Hoffman’s study. For example, Dr. Scarpinato notes, the incidence of stress fractures — a common injury in runners, because of the repetitive trauma of running, especially on pavement — is low among her older ultrarunning patients.“If I see one stress fracture a year among the ultrarunners, that’s a lot,” she says.At the same time, while they may be consistent in their habits, aging ultrarunners are exploring new boundaries for physical activity that previous older generations would never have imagined, much less tried.“We’re all pushing the envelope,” Dr. Hoffman says. “Those of us who exercise regularly are expecting more, expecting different outcomes from what we saw with prior generations. No reason we shouldn’t.”This is not to say that every retiree with the time should go out next weekend and start training for a 50K. “They should understand the commitment needed to run these distances,” Dr. Scarpinato said. “Certain people, their body types might not allow them to do this.”But if not this, then something: As study after study has shown, regular physical activity — not necessarily running 30 miles once or twice a year, but walking for 30 minutes four or five times a week — has many health benefits for older adults.“Aging is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition,” says Dr. William Roberts, a professor of family medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, and the medical director for the Twin Cities Marathon. “Continued exercise throughout a lifetime will reduce the rate of loss of strength and endurance, likely improve quality of life and help maintain balance, which reduces falls.”AdvertisementAs for ultrarunning, Dr. Roberts adds, referring to Mr. Dodson’s superlong-distance races, “most 80-year-olds can’t do that, but if you can’t, you ought to be doing whatever you can.”Mr. Dodson, who at 5 feet 9 inches tall and 145 pounds was blessed with a physique suited to a runner, has competed for years without problems. His one major injury, a herniated disc at 70, came from pulling at an awkward angle on a particularly stubborn weed in his backyard.Just because older runners run more slowly and exhibit more caution and consistency in their training and racing habits, it doesn’t mean they are any less driven. On April 11, Mr. Dodson was back in the hunt for another ultrarecord, this time at the National 100K Championship (just over 62 miles) in Madison, Wis. For 15 hours on a sunny, 60-degree day, he circled a 10K (6.2-mile) loop around Lake Wingra and the University of Wisconsin Arboretum. He finished in 15 hours, 5 minutes and 47 seconds, beating the national record for 80- to 85-year-olds by more than two and a half hours.Mr. Dodson called it the high point of his 30-year running career. And, he added, recalling his long, cold day at Caumsett State Park six weeks earlier, “it was great to finish standing up.”A version of this article appears in print on May 14, 2015, on Page F2 of the New York edition with the headline: Why Older Runners Are Ultrarunners.
