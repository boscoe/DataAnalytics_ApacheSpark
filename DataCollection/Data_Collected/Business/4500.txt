PARIS —  A French court on Wednesday blocked an insider trading trial of seven current and former executives of the Airbus Group, as well as two of its former shareholders, arguing that the defendants had already been cleared by stock market regulators, making any further prosecution of the case a violation of European double jeopardy rules.The decision by France’s Constitutional Council ends nearly a decade of legal battles that ensnared several stars of the European aviation world, including Noël Forgeard, a former co-chief executive of the group, and John Leahy, the chief commercial officer at Airbus and the chief negotiator of hundreds of billions of dollars in jet sales with the world’s biggest airlines.All the defendants denied allegations that they were aware of serious problems with two major Airbus jet development programs when they sold shares in the company, then known as European Aeronautic Defense and Space, or EADS, in March 2006. That was three months before those troubles became public and the company’s stock price fell more than 25 percent in a day, erasing nearly 5.5 billion euros, or nearly $6 billion at current exchange rates, in market value.Wednesday’s ruling obliges the Paris criminal court to dismiss its case against the executives, as well as two leading European corporations, the German carmaker Daimler and the French media conglomerate Lagardère, which once owned sizable minority stakes in EADS. The companies sold some of their EADS stock during the period in question.AdvertisementThe defendants were accused of having known about serious technical problems and cost overruns with two Airbus programs — the A350 and the A380 “superjumbo” jet — at the time they sold their shares. The A380’s troubles eventually snowballed into a devastating three-year delay in deliveries, prompting the resignation of several top managers, the elimination of 10,000 jobs and more than $6 billion in losses.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
