Taco Bell says it will serve beer, wine and “mixed alcohol freezes” at a new location set to open in the Wicker Park area of Chicago this summer. The chain, owned by Yum Brands, says the restaurant design planned for Chicago has already been tested in South Korea, Japan and Britain. The chain says the Chicago store “will highlight the work of local artists” to give it a neighborhood feel. A representative for Taco Bell, Ashley Sioson, declined to provide more details on what drinks would be available. She said there were no plans to bring alcohol to other Taco Bell locations in the United States. The move is an additional sign that Taco Bell is working to shed its fast-food image and appeal to millennials, who marketers say prefer places and products that seem less standardized and more authentic. Wendy’s, which is also trying to recast itself as a step up from traditional fast food, has been promoting a remodeling of restaurants that features more inviting and mixed seating options. Last month, Taco Bell announced it would drop artificial flavors and colors from its menu by the end of the year, although products with other brands, like Doritos Locos Tacos, would be exempt.A version of this brief appears in print on June 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Taco Bell to Serve Beer and Wine at Chicago Site.
