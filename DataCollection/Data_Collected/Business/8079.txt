HONG KONG — Chinese stock market regulators have suspended more than 30 trading accounts, including one owned by the brokerage unit of the big American hedge fund Citadel, as they continue trying to stabilize the country’s volatile markets.“We can confirm that while one account managed by Guosen Futures Ltd. — Citadel (Shanghai) Trading Ltd. — has had its trading on the Shenzhen exchange suspended, we continue to otherwise operate normally from our offices, and we continue to comply with all local laws and regulations,” Citadel wrote on Monday in an email.The suspension came amid continued volatility in the markets, with Shanghai’s main share index closing an additional 1.1 percent lower on Monday. A week earlier, the index had plunged 8.5 percent in its biggest single-day loss in eight years.Chinese regulators have been taking exceptional measures to help halt the recent slide in the country’s markets, including buying shares directly and barring major shareholders of companies from selling their stakes. Despite these efforts, shares have continued to tumble. From their peak in mid-June, the total value of all domestically listed stocks has declined by about a third, shedding more than $3 trillion in market value.AdvertisementThe China Securities Regulatory Commission, which has in recent weeks pledged to crack down on “malicious” short-sellers and market manipulators, appears to be expanding its scrutiny to other types of trading.
                The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country’s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.            On Friday, the commission said it would strengthen its supervision of so-called program trading, which can include high speed, algorithmic or other computer-driven trading strategies. It said 24 such trading accounts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had been suspended on suspicion of harming the market with rapid-fire share purchase or sale orders that were canceled before they could be fulfilled, a strategy known as spoofing.By the time markets closed on Monday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had announced suspensions for more than 10 additional accounts, bringing the total number of targeted accounts to more than 30.AdvertisementSpoofing “has the effect of boosting or pushing down the market, and during the recent period of market volatility the impact of this has been amplified,” Zhang Xiaojun, a spokesman for the regulator, said Friday in a statement on the agency’s website. Mr. Zhang was speaking generally about program trading and did not identify the accounts that had been suspended.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The company has not been accused of wrongdoing.“Citadel has been actively investing in the region for 15 years, and has always maintained a constructive dialogue with regulators, including during the recent market volatility,” Citadel said on Monday.The entity that owns the suspended account, Citadel (Shanghai) Trading, is a locally registered firm wholly owned by Citadel and incorporated in 2010. Citic Securities, one of China’s biggest state-owned brokerages, once had a small stake in the unit, according to filings with the local government agency that regulates industry and commerce.China’s capital markets are still largely closed to foreigners.Although overseas investment firms face restrictions on buying stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as strict limits on moving funds to and from mainland China, a small but increasing number of them, mainly hedge funds, have followed Citadel in recent years. Their strategy: incorporating local units in China so they can trade more freely as domestic entities, according to Chris Powers, a senior consultant at Z-Ben Advisors, a financial consulting firm based in Shanghai.It was unclear whether any of the remaining suspended trading accounts were tied to foreign investors. But the authorities’ action appears in line with a general campaign in recent weeks to give stock markets a lift — either by state-directed buying or by discouraging would-be sellers.“In the last six weeks obviously you’ve had a lot of direct intervention into the market in terms of actually buying shares,” Mr. Powers said.“But a lot of the other measures are more about trying to instill confidence and encourage people to behave a certain way,” he added, “and preventing them from doing what Beijing considers are activities detrimental to the stock market.”A version of this article appears in print on August 4, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Accounts Suspended.
