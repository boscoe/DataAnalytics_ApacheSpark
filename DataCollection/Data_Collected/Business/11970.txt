Its share of the countries’ retail banking markets is less than 5 percent, while its share of their corporate banking markets is about 15 percent to 20 percent.Citigroup wants to sell the retail divisions, where local banks and competitors like Santander Río are stronger, so that it has more capital to expand corporate lending, an area that it already leads. The retail divisions include about $6 billion of assets.“We allocate our resources where they can generate the best possible returns for our shareholders,” Michael L. Corbat, Citigroup’s chief executive, said in statement.Argentina was the first country in which Citigroup opened a branch outside of the United States, in 1914, although it is unclear whether that branch offered retail services. The group has often drawn attention to this history in local marketing campaigns. It expanded into Brazil in 1915 and Colombia in 1916.The move fits into Citigroup’s broader maneuvers to shrink its international retail banking division, according to Nicholas Watson, who monitors Latin America for Teneo Intelligence, a global advisory firm based in New York.“I think this is more about Citi’s strategy of slimming down its consumer banking arm than it is about any intrinsic market weaknesses in Argentina, Brazil or Colombia,” Mr. Watson said in an email, highlighting similar moves about a year and a half ago to pull out of countries in Latin America, including Peru, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and other regions.Brazil’s economy is experiencing a brusque downturn, and Argentina’s has been sluggish in recent years, made worse by a debt dispute that has blocked the government’s access to global lending markets and led Citigroup to close its custody business last year.But sweeping market-oriented economic changes by the country’s new president, Mauricio Macri, which were intended to foster a healthy investment climate, are being viewed favorably by banks. The steps include a devaluation and the scrapping of export taxes and currency controls. Citigroup is looking to strengthen its corporate arm so it is in place to pounce on the opportunity to provide financing to a potential wave of investors and public institutions, said Juan Pablo Ronderos, an economist at Abeceb, an economic analysis firm in Buenos Aires.Citigroup has not spoken yet to potential buyers for the retail businesses and closing out a deal could take most of the year. It has 71 branches in Argentina and 71 in Brazil.Advertisement
