The New York Times said on Tuesday that it had developed an app to provide brief news reports for the Apple watch when it is released next month.The reports, which will consist of a sentence accompanied by bullet-point summaries and photography or graphics, “will provide the news at a glance across many Times sections, including business, politics, science, tech and the arts,” the company said in a statement.The Times’s breaking news alerts will also appear on the watch, the company said.The Times decided to extend its iPhone app to include the watch, said Andrew Phelps, a senior product manager, because it is a potentially useful platform for news. Watch owners, he said, will be given a selection of about half a dozen reports written specially for the app. “Readers can swipe through these stories and get a quick glance, if they only have a few seconds and want to get caught up,” he said.Mr. Phelps said readers would also be able to immediately continue reading on their iPhones the reports they saw first on the watch, or save them for later.The Apple watch will be available at the end of April. Since the company announced it late last year — in aluminum, steel and gold, with prices ranging from $349 to $17,000 — many have pondered what role the device, which requires connection with an iPhone to work fully, will play in the lives of connected consumers.Like the first iPhone, some analysts have said, the watch is likely to be defined by those who develop apps for it.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
