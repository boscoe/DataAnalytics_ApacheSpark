Boeing must also take a series of actions to improve the safety certification of its planes and its aircraft production quality control, the agency said. The settlement is the second largest for regulatory violations in the history of the F.A.A. Boeing said in a statement that the fine “fairly” addressed the matter. The fuel tank instructions are part of an effort to address problems that caused a Boeing 747 fuel tank to explode over the Atlantic Ocean off Long Island in 1996. All 230 people aboard the plane, TWA Flight 800, were killed. Advertisement
