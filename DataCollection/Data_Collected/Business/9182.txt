She will lead a team that the company said would simplify processes across the business to help Target react quickly to shoppers’ needs. Ms. Gupta will report to John Mulligan, the company’s former chief financial officer, who was named last month to a new position of chief operating officer. Ms. Gupta joins Target from the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman. She previously served as vice president for process and profit improvement at Michaels Stores and held operational leadership roles at Safeway. The personnel change is the latest in a string of moves that Brian Cornell, Target’s chief executive, has made as he aims to restore Target’s position as a purveyor of cheap chic. Advertisement
