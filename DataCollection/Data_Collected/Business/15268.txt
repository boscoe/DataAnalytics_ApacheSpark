The deal would create the world’s largest mattress retail distribution company.Steinhoff said it would pay $64 a share, more than double Friday’s closing price of $29.74, for Mattress Firm. The boards of both companies have approved the deal, the companies said in a statement.The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, the companies said.Mattress Firm, founded in 1986, has about 3,500 stores across 48 states with 80 distribution centers.Steinhoff is a German-listed $22 billion furniture conglomerate led by the South African retail mogul Christoffel Wiese. He is Steinhoff’s chairman and largest shareholder.Steinhoff, which owns brands in Africa, Australia, Britain and across Europe, agreed last month to pay nearly $800 million for the British discount chain Poundland after two previous attempts to expand in Europe fell through this year.The Mattress Firm deal would give Steinhoff access to the growing American market, help diversify its operations and guard against possible repercussions in the wake of Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union.Markus Jooste, chief executive of Steinhoff, said the deal “will allow Steinhoff to not only enter the U.S. market with an industry-leading partner and a national supply chain, but it will also expand Steinhoff’s global market reach in the core product category of mattresses.”In February, Mattress Firm solidified its position as a leader in the mattress retail market in the United States when it completed a $780 million acquisition of HMK Mattress Holdings L.L.C., the holding company of Sleepy’s. Sleepy’s was the second-largest specialty mattress retailer in the United States.Advertisement
