The split is expected to be completed by the end of October.The commercial business, which reported $8.1 billion in revenue in its 2015 fiscal year, will focus on servicing private sector clients. The other new publicly traded concern will be a consultant to federal and state government agencies, which reported $4.1 billion in sales in the 2015 fiscal year.In splitting itself, the information technology services provider will join a long line of companies that have turned to such corporate divorces as a way to improve returns for shareholders. A huge number of companies, including Hewlett-Packard and the Madison Square Garden Company, have bet that smaller and more focused businesses will fetch higher valuations from Wall Street investors and analysts.“Our analysis shows significant benefits of going with a pure-play strategy,” Mike Lawrie, Computer Sciences’ chief executive, said in a statement. “We expect this change to enable both businesses to enhance innovation and improve delivery in ways that are consistent with the rate and pace of the markets they serve.”It is a strategy that has been advocated in recent years by activist shareholders, who buy up positions in companies’ stocks and urge for sometimes drastic changes to corporate strategy.In February, the hedge fund Jana Partners, a notable activist, disclosed that it owned more than 5 percent of the company and had been in discussions with management about potential strategies.“We strongly support C.S.C.’s decision to separate its global commercial and U.S. public sector businesses, which we think positions both businesses for success and will unlock significant shareholder value,” a spokesman for Jana said in a statement, referring to Computer Sciences’ stock ticker. “We applaud the C.S.C. board and senior management team for taking this decisive step for shareholders.”Shares of Computer Sciences, which had risen 11 percent over the last 12 months, jumped nearly 5 percent, to $71, in aftermarket trading on Tuesday.Advertisement
