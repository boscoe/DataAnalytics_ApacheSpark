Fiat Chrysler is recalling more than 467,000 vehicles worldwide to fix a problem that could prevent the vehicles from starting or result in unexpected stalling.The problem, which affects the fuel pump relay, is found in some 2012-13 Dodge Durangos and 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokees, the company said on Friday. The recall is an expansion of a September 2014 recall that covered more than 230,000 Grand Cherokees and Durangos from the 2011 model year.In the previous recall, the automaker, through a “routine internal data review,” had discovered a pattern of repairs involving fuel pump relays in the affected models. The company said the condition did not affect airbag deployment and that it knew of no injuries or deaths related to the problem.A different stalling defect spurred a record number of recalls across the automobile industry last year, as well as multiple congressional hearings. Last February, General Motors began recalling millions of Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars with a defective ignition switch that could cut off engine power and deactivate airbags.G.M. is also recalling more than 59,000 vehicles for two separate defects affecting roof panels and parking brakes.The bigger of the two actions involves 58,000 Cadillac ATS models from 2013-15 with roof panels that may close unintentionally, increasing the risk of injury. The smaller action covers about 1,000 Chevrolet Impalas from the 2014 model year with a braking defect that could lead to excessive brake heat and potentially result in a fire.A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Fiat Chrysler Recalls 467,000 S.U.V.s to Fix Fuel Pump.
