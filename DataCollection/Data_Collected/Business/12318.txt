Federal regulators are investigating reports of brake failure that may affect about 420,000 Ford F-150 pickup trucks.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a report on its website that it had received 33 consumer complaints, including reports of four crashes. The affected trucks are the F-150 with the 3.5 liter V6 engine from the 2013-14 model years. No injuries have been reported.One owner from Saugus, Calif., wrote the agency last September saying that the brakes failed while the truck was being driven in heavy traffic.“I was able to exit the freeway by down shifting and using the emergency brake,” the owner wrote. “I see I’m not the only person with this issue, yet nothing – as far as I can tell – is being done about it. Does someone have to be injured or killed?”AdvertisementIf the agency finds additional cause for concern it would upgrade the investigation to an “engineering analysis,” which is more likely to result in a recall.“The complaints allege symptoms of brake pedal going to the floor with complete loss of brake effectiveness, brake warning lamp illumination and/or low or empty master cylinder reservoir fluid level with no visible leakage,” the report said. “Several complaints allege repair facilities diagnosed the problem as brake fluid leaking from the master cylinder to the brake booster.”AdvertisementJohn Cangany, a Ford spokesman, wrote in an email that the automaker took “the safety of our customers very seriously and we will cooperate with N.H.T.S.A.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
