The offer represents a 37.6 percent premium to HCC’s closing price on Tuesday.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter. It is subject to approval by HCC’s shareholders and regulators.Tsuyoshi Nagano, the Tokio Marine president, noted that HCC’s businesses were “largely noncorrelated, have limited catastrophe exposure and are less dependent on property and casualty market cycles.”“HCC will further expand the revenues, profits and capabilities of Tokio Marine,” he said in a news release.The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions to expand Tokio Marine’s business in the United States in recent years.It acquired Delphi Financial Group for $2.7 billion in 2012 and the Philadelphia Consolidated Holding Corporation for $4.7 billion in 2008. Tokio Marine also bought the Kiln Group, an insurer based in London, for $898 million in 2008.Other Japanese companies seeking to grow outside their home country include Dai-ichi Life Insurance, which agreed to buy the American company Protective Life Corporation in 2014 for about $5.7 billion. And over the past few years, Nippon Life Insurance Company, Dai-ichi and Sumitomo Life Insurance Company have each taken stakes in several Indonesian insurers in hopes of tapping the rapidly expanding Southeast Asian market.Founded in 1879, Tokio Marine is one of Japan’s oldest insurers. It offers life, property and casualty insurance in Japan, as well as insurance and financial products internationally. The company had net written premiums of 2.87 trillion yen, or about $23 billion, and posted profit of ¥184.1 billion in the 2013 fiscal year.
