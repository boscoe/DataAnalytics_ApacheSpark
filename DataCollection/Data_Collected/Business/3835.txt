TOKYO —  Honda Motor said on Monday that it would replace its president and chief executive, Takanobu Ito, a sign the Japanese automaker may be trying to draw a line under recent quality problems.Honda has grappled with a series of safety issues and development delays. Although the origins of some of the problems — notably faulty airbags made by the Japanese supplier Takata — predate Mr. Ito’s tenure, other complications have been easier to attribute to him and his management team.Last year, in response to an embarrassing string of events, Mr. Ito appointed a senior managing officer to oversee quality. Those problems included a half-dozen recalls over one year for one of Honda’s best sellers, the Fit subcompact, after a redesigned model was introduced in 2013, and revelations that Honda waited years to recall cars with airbags that could explode.Mr. Ito, 61, said the decision to step aside had been his, and he acknowledged that there had been difficulties during his tenure.Advertisement“At a time of rapid change and increasingly harsh global competition, I thought it was a good opportunity to bring in young energy to lead Honda,” he said at a news conference.AdvertisementMr. Ito will be replaced by Takahiro Hachigo, 55, whose recent duties have included overseeing the automaker’s European and Chinese operations. The change will take effect after Honda’s annual shareholders meeting in June, Honda said. Mr. Ito will remain on the board, with the title of senior adviser.Mr. Hachigo is little known outside the company, but his career path resembles those of past Honda presidents, including Mr. Ito. He is an engineer who has spent his whole career at Honda, and he has overseen the development of popular models like the Odyssey minivan and CR-V crossover.“He’s the sort of person who listens to everyone and promotes other people’s opinions,” said Koji Endo, a longtime car-industry analyst at Advanced Research Japan. He said Mr. Hachigo’s style was “180 degrees away from Ito’s,” which he described as more “dictatorial.”

His three most recent predecessors had filled the chief executive position for five to eight years.Still, the timing of the move, coming during the quality problems, struck some as an indication of diminishing confidence in Mr. Ito’s leadership.“There’s a strong element in this personnel move of taking responsibility for Honda’s recent problems, including the recalls,” said Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst and head of the Nakanishi Research Institute. “It indicates a change of direction, and that’s positive.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In some cases, Honda owns minority stakes in the suppliers, a common practice in the Japanese car industry.Under Mr. Ito, Honda bought parts from an increasingly diverse group of suppliers, including American and European companies, and Japanese companies affiliated with rival carmakers like Toyota. Mr. Ito also pushed the company’s engineers to develop models faster.AdvertisementCritics worried that the moves could come at the expense of Honda’s longstanding reputation for quality. But Mr. Ito broadly defended his policies, saying they were necessary to keep Honda competitive. “I’ve changed the system, and I think I’ve opened up a path to stability,” he said.The Takata crisis has been the most glaring of Honda’s problems, leading to the recall of millions of cars and to Honda executives’ being summoned to testify before Congress in the United States. Takata’s airbag inflaters can explode violently when they deploy, spraying metal fragments. At least six deaths worldwide — all from accidents in Honda vehicles — have been linked to the defect.On Friday, American regulators said that they would begin to fine Takata $14,000 a day, saying it had not fully cooperated in an investigation into the airbags. Last month, Honda cut its profit forecast for the year by more than $400 million because of recall-related costs.While the crisis could not have helped Mr. Ito’s standing, it hardly argues against his policy of diversification. Honda is Takata’s biggest customer; it owns a 1.2 percent stake in the company and has been buying its airbags for decades.“Takata is the perfect example of a closely affiliated Japanese supplier,” Mr. Endo said.Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Honda, Grappling With Quality Problems, Will Replace Its President.
