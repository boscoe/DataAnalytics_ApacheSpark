Another drop in oil prices kept the indexes’ gains in check, however.First Solar shares soared 17 percent, the biggest gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, after the company, the country’s largest solar business, posted quarterly results that beat estimates and raised its outlook for full-year profits. First Solar shares jumped $7.42 to $51.92. Better corporate earnings have helped support the stock market in the last month. Entering the second-quarter earnings season last month, investors were braced for a sharp drop in profits. But now, with the bulk of results in, earnings are on track to slip just 0.2 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ. “The expectations were that things would be terrible,” said Brad McMillan, the chief investment officer for the Commonwealth Financial Network. “And while they’re not great, they’re certainly better than expected.”The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 6.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,099.84. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 10.22 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,540.47, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 34.40 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,139.95. The market has looked listless in recent weeks as investors have traded one set of concerns for another. Worries about Greece have faded, said Burt White, the chief investment officer at LPL Financial. But concerns about China’s economy and the Federal Reserve’s next interest-rate increase remain. “I don’t think the economy has a confidence problem,” Mr. White said. “I think investors are having a confidence issue here.”Among other companies reporting quarterly results, Walt Disney dropped 9.2 percent, weighing on the Dow, after posting sales that fell short of estimates. Disney’s stock fell $11.16 to $110.53. Shares in the Priceline Group, the online-booking service, climbed 5 percent after it posted profit and revenue that easily beat analysts’ forecasts. Rising reservations for hotel rooms and rental cars helped results. Its stock gained $67.22, or 5.2 percent, to $1,351.21. In Europe, an encouraging economic survey and improving corporate earnings helped raise major markets. Germany’s DAX surged 1.6 percent, France’s CAC 40 gained 1.7 percent, and Britain’s FTSE 100 added nearly 1 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.7 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.4 percent.
