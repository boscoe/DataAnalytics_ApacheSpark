The problem with the 2015 Focus, C-MAX and Escape models is a computer malfunction. “When I tried to shut the engine, it didn’t,” the owner of a 2015 Escape wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in May. “The motor was still running when it was being towed.” Ford said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries.
