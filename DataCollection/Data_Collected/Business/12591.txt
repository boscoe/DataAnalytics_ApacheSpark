HarperCollins will offer a discount on its trade paperback of Harper Lee’s 1960 classic “To Kill a Mockingbird” through retail accounts that sell directly to schools.The announcement came days after the news broke that the cheaper, mass-market paperback edition, which is popular in schools, would be discontinued next month, apparently in accordance with the wishes of Ms. Lee, who died in February at age 89. The mass market edition, which was published by Hachette, cost $8.99 and was often sold to schools at a discount. That edition has sold more than 20 million copies.HarperCollins will offer the trade paperback, which costs $14.99, at the price of $8.99. The price promotion starts on April 27 and is open ended, according to HarperCollins. HarperCollins also published hardcover and e-book editions of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and published Ms. Lee’s second novel, “Go Set a Watchman,” last year.“We are happy that schools will be able to acquire our trade edition of ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ — a superior reading experience, with its larger trim size and greater durability — at the lower price they have become accustomed to,” Michael Morrison, the president and publisher of HarperCollins, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on March 17, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ Edition Will Be Offered at a Discount.
