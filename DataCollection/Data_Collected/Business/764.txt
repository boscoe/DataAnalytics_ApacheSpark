He was 83.His wife, Barbara, told The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, Calif., that he died of cancer on July 28. A formal announcement was delayed when the couple’s daughter, Karen Coset, suffered a cancer recurrence around the same time. She died on Oct. 4.Mr. Maugg was the silent, fictional sidekick, Ed Jaymes, to Frank Bartles in commercials known for their homey style. Mr. Bartles was played by Dave Rufkahr, a cattle rancher from Alfalfa, Ore., who died in 1996. The two would typically appear sitting on a rural-looking front porch as they extolled the brand. Mr. Rufkahr would end each commercial saying, “Thank you for your support.”The commercials, which ran for several years, helped fuel the brand’s initial success. Introduced in 1981 by the E & J Gallo Winery, Bartles & Jaymes became a leader in an expanding market for wine coolers, a sweetened wine beverage generally low in alcohol content. But the phenomenon was short-lived; industry sales plummeted in the early 1990s, though Gallo continued to produce its brand in lower volumes.The Press Democrat reported that Mr. Maugg had built the San Francisco headquarters for the advertising agency hired to make the Bartles & Jaymes ads. The agency was run by a childhood friend, Hal Riney. With shooting about to begin and nobody yet cast to play Ed Jaymes, somebody suggested Mr. Maugg.Outside of his brief stint in acting, Mr. Maugg, who lived in Santa Rosa, spent his career as a contractor and developer.Besides his wife, survivors include three daughters, Kathryn Toms, Kristina Maugg and Johanna Kousoulas, and several grandchildren.Advertisement
