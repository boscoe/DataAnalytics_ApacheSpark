A new study released on Thursday has backed up many parents’ complaints, finding that only a handful of vehicles deserved the highest rating for ease of installation.The study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, rated 102 vehicles for how easily a child safety seat could be installed. It focused on the vehicles’ so-called Latch system, which consists of three anchors that the seat is secured to.Only three models received the highest rating of Good: the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and the Volkswagen Passat.Forty-four others received the next-highest rating, Acceptable; 45 were Marginal; and 10 received the lowest rating, Poor.Children are safer when in an age-appropriate child restraint, but these are not always easy to install, especially when using a vehicle’s seatbelts. And if the restraint is not properly anchored to the vehicle, a child could be severely injured in a crash.The federally mandated Latch system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children, was meant to remedy the problem with using seatbelts by having an alternative, generic attachment system that was simpler to use.Latch has two components: One includes the lower anchors, which are two metal bars in the folds of rear seats where a vehicle’s seat cushion meets the seat back. This is where a child seat’s lower attachments connect.The second is tether anchors, which are found on the seat back, floor, cargo area or ceiling.Latch has been required in the rear seats of all passenger vehicles since the 2003 model year but has fallen short of its promise.One reason is that automakers design seats in ways that make Latch hardware difficult to find and to use, according to a 2012 joint study by the Insurance Institute and the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. Their research identified key elements of vehicle design, which made this task either easy or difficult; those elements are used in the Insurance Institute’s rating program.The ratings consider criteria like how deeply the lower anchors are buried in the space where the seat cushion and seat back meet, how easy the anchors are to maneuver around and how much force is required to attach the lower connectors of a child seat. Ratings also include how easy it is to find the top tether anchor.The most common problem identified was that lower anchors were buried too deeply in the space where the seat cushion and seat back meet. Nearly three-fourths of the vehicles rated had this problem.But the Insurance Institute said the Toyota Sienna was the “most glaring” offender. Three of its four Latch positions had lower anchors that were buried too deeply in the seat, and the tether anchors were poorly located at the bottom of the seat back near other potentially confusing hardware.In an e-mail, Toyota said all its vehicles met federal standards for safety and strength of Latch attachment points. Based on the new assessment method, the company said, “we will continue to enhance the ease of installment of child restraints in future model Siennas.”Other cars that received a poor rating include the Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Accent, Volkswagen Jetta, Mazda 6, Nissan Altima, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, GMC Sierra 1500, Lexus ES and the Toyota Tundra. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers did not respond to a request for comment.The Insurance Institute’s website includes a diagram for each of the 102 vehicles rated. It shows a map of Latch positions in each vehicle and details what makes each one difficult or easy to use.Advertisement
