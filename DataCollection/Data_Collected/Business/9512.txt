The Federal Reserve expects to increase its benchmark interest rate “relatively soon” if the economy continues to advance at a reasonable pace, according to an account published Wednesday of the bank’s most recent policy meeting.The account strengthened expectations that the Fed may raise rates at its final meeting of the year, in December. But it also underscored that a majority of Fed officials did not see sufficient economic evidence to warrant an increase right away. And some expressed doubt that the economy would be strong enough for the Fed to move this year.The Fed said in a statement after its September meeting that the case for a rate increase had “strengthened.” The account published Wednesday of that meeting said this was intended as a signal that a rate increase was likely if “economic developments unfolded about as the committee expected,” referring to the Fed’s policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee.But the account also cautioned that the decision would depend on the continued progress of the economic recovery. Some officials were “concerned that the new sentence might be misread as indicating that the passage of time, rather than the accumulation of evidence, would be the key factor” in the Fed’s December deliberations, it said.AdvertisementThe September meeting was a contentious affair. Seven Fed officials voted to leave rates unchanged while three voted for an increase, the largest bloc of dissents in several years. The account, released after a standard three-week delay, said some of the officials who voted to wait viewed the decision as a “close call,” underscoring the momentum for a rate increase.“It was noted that a reasonable argument could be made either for an increase at this meeting or for waiting for some additional information on the labor market and inflation. A couple of members emphasized that a cautious approach to removing accommodation was warranted given the proximity of policy rates to the effective lower bound,  as the committee had more scope to increase policy rates, if necessary, than to reduce them.”“It was noted that a reasonable argument could be made either for an increase at this meeting or for waiting for some additional information on the labor market and inflation,” the September meeting account said.AdvertisementThe Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, but it has not moved this year. The economy continues to grow, but officials see little sign of overheating. The labor force continues to expand as people who gave up on finding work in the years after the recession return to the job market. And inflation remains sluggish.“We’re at a point where the economic expansion has plenty of room to run,” William C. Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said on Wednesday. “I think we can be quite gentle as we go in terms of gradually removing monetary policy accommodation.”The minutes underscored that most Fed officials feel relatively little urgency about raising interest rates.Many officials “expressed the view that recent evidence suggested that some slack remained in the labor market,” the minutes said. “With inflation continuing to run below the committee’s 2 percent objective and few signs of increased pressure on wages and prices, most of these participants thought it would be appropriate to await further evidence of continued progress toward the committee’s statutory objectives.”
                Federal Reserve officials have delayed raising rates this year as they wrestle with three critical questions. But they may soon be about to act.            Despite the split over the timing of the next rate increase, there is broad agreement among Fed officials that the pace of rate hikes is likely to remain slow. The Fed raised rates once in 2015. It may raise rates once in 2016. And most officials expect no more than two increases next year.Among those who voted to wait, moreover, there remains a further divide. Some described the decision not to move in September as a “close call,” the account said, while others saw less of a case for higher interest rates.Advertisement“Some participants believed that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon if the labor market continued to improve and economic activity strengthened,” the account said. “Some others preferred to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation was moving toward the committee’s 2 percent objective.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Fed entered the year predicting four rate increases, only to back off in March, and again in June, and again in September.The Fed’s next meeting is in November, but the group is viewed as unlikely to act at that meeting because it is scheduled just a few days before the presidential election. The Fed, already the target of repeated attacks by the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, is viewed as likely to avoid drawing attention to itself.That leaves the December meeting.A version of this article appears in print on October 13, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fed Momentum Builds for Rate Rise in 2016.
