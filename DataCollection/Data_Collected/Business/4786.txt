WASHINGTON —  Consumers spent just slightly more in February even though their income rose by a healthy amount, the Commerce Department reported on Monday.But economists hope the bigger paychecks will give spending a greater boost in the coming months. And there were signs that a jump was already underway.A separate report showed that more Americans signed contracts to buy homes in February, evidence that the spring buying season could open strong after sluggish sales for much of the winter.Consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after declines of 0.2 percent in both January and December, the Commerce Department reported Monday. The result reflected a 0.4 percent increase in spending on nondurable goods, like food and energy, coupled with a 0.1 percent fall in durable goods like automobiles.AdvertisementIncome grew 0.4 percent in February, matching January’s rise. With income growing faster than spending, the saving rate jumped to 5.8 percent of after-tax income — the highest level since December 2012.AdvertisementEconomists said the rise in the saving rate reflected in part the big drop in gasoline prices in recent months, which leaves more money in consumers’ pockets. Falling gas prices and continued growth in employment set the stage for stronger consumer spending in the months ahead.

The weather-related weakness is expected to dampen overall economic growth during the January-March quarter, with many economists forecasting growth to slow to around 1.5 percent during the quarter.But analysts are also optimistic for a rebound in coming quarters to growth of 3 percent or better. If the economy does hit 3 percent growth this year, it would be the fastest pace for the economy in a decade.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.The upturn suggests a solid spring sales rebound after a lackluster winter. But unlike last year when sales fell, the spring buying season opens after more than a year of economic recovery.“What’s different this time is that the surge in the pace of payroll growth means that the pool of prospective home buyers is now rising more rapidly than at any time since the crash,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
