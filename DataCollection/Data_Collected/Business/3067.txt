The group criticized Google’s software as hampering the use of speed traps, which it said help reduce highways deaths. Waze operates like a free GPS navigation tool. Users can tag locations of traffic congestion and accidents, but also parked police cars and traffic cameras. A spokeswoman for Waze, Julie Mossler, defended the app and said, “Most users tend to drive more carefully when they believe law enforcement is nearby.” Advertisement
