AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersAmerican consumers’ confidence in July took its biggest tumble in four years on a less upbeat jobs outlook. Home appreciation in major cities stalled in May, suggesting a spring pause in housing demand.The disappointing information comes as Federal Reserve policy makers meet Tuesday and Wednesday to consider whether the economy is strong enough to warrant ending the Fed’s near-zero interest rate policy, perhaps in September.The Conference Board, an industry group, said on Tuesday that its index of consumer attitudes fell to 90.9 this month from a downwardly revised 99.8 in June. It fell far short of a forecast reading of 100.The latest figure was the lowest since September 2014, and the decline was the steepest since August 2011. The report’s jobs hard-to-get index rose to 26.7 from an upwardly adjusted 26.1 for June.Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pa., said the slump in confidence probably reflected recent upheavals in the global economy.“This seems to be an aberration,” he said. “Consumers were probably freaked out by the problems in Greece and the Chinese stock market, and the volatility on Wall Street.”The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller composite home price index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.9 percent year over year in May, matching the pace in April. Economists polled by Reuters had projected a 5.6 percent increase.The index covers roughly half of American homes, measures prices compared with those in January 2000 and creates a three-month moving average.“As home prices continue rising, they are sending more upbeat signals than other housing market indicators,” David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement.He called first-time home buyers “the weak spot” for the price plateau.Analysts said other indicators showed continuing improvement in the housing and job sectors, which would allow the Fed’s policy makers to consider normalizing interest rates from the emergency low level it adopted in December 2008 in the global financial crisis.“As long as the general tone of the data shows improvement and inflation is moving toward its 2 percent target, they will feel comfortable to raise rates in September,” Mr. Sweet said.Advertisement
