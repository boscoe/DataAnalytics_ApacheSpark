Those revisions are suspected of making the units more likely to jam when hit head-on, causing the metal rail to spear the vehicle.Under the new rules, which were published on Monday and take effect next year, if a manufacturer makes a modification to an existing roadside device, it must be crash-tested in accordance with the strictest safety measures, even if it has already been deemed safe in the past under older guidelines.The new guidelines also require roadside device makers and crash-testing facilities to disclose any financial conflicts of interest, said Tony Furst, the agency’s associate administrator for safety, wrote in a letter sent to members of the industry on Monday.Trinity declined to comment.In the whistle-blower case against Trinity, it was accused of making changes to a guardrail unit called the ET-Plus and not disclosing them, even though it was required to do so. The case was filed by a competitor, Joshua Harman, on behalf of the F.H.A. , but the agency chose not to participate.The day after the verdict was announced, the agency demanded that Trinity’s guardrails undergo additional crash tests, but under older guidelines, rather than the stricter standards that were put in place in 2011. The guardrails were deemed to have passed the tests, even though some outside experts questioned the final crash, which resulted in significant damage to the car door.Before the verdict, the federal agency defended the guardrail units for more than two years, even after it learned that Trinity had not disclosed the design change in 2005. At one point in 2012, agency officials drafted a letter asking the manufacturer to conduct additional testing, but the letter was never sent.The Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Trinity and its dealings with the F.H.A. and, in April, sent a subpoena to Trinity, seeking more than 10 years’ worth of records on its guardrail products.Advertisement
