The development comes after the board consulted its merger agreement with the Meredith Corporation — the media conglomerate that Media General agreed to acquire for $2.4 billion in September — enabling the company to explore a takeover.The current proposal, Media General said, ignores the value in the company’s excess spectrum and does not reflect the synergies that the combined company could achieve.Nexstar said on Sept. 28 that it submitted a proposal to the Media General board to acquire the company for $14.50 in cash and stock. The offer came after Nexstar’s initial bid in August, which Media General rejected; two weeks later, Media General announced an agreement to acquire Meredith.In a statement on Monday, Perry Sook, the chief executive of Nexstar, said, “We are surprised that Media General’s board considers the value of our proposal to be inadequate today, however, we are willing to engage with them to hear their perspectives.”The bidding illustrates the rapid consolidation sweeping the broadcast industry, as television operators seek scale to help garner negotiation leverage.RBC Capital Markets and Goldman Sachs are providing financial advice to Media General. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson as well as Weil, Gotshal & Manges served as legal advisers. In the announcement of its offer in September, Nexstar said Bank of America Merrill Lynch was the financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis provided legal advice.Advertisement
