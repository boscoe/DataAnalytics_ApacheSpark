The recall covers 470,000 Sonata sedans from the 2011 and 2012 model years equipped with 2-liter or 2.4-liter gasoline engines. At the time, the Sonata was Hyundaiâ€™s top-selling vehicle in America. The company also is recalling nearly 100,000 Accent small cars because the brake lights can fail. In documents posted on Friday by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Hyundai says that metal debris may not have been fully removed from the crankshaft area during manufacturing. That can restrict oil flow to the connecting rod bearings, potentially causing them to fail. If that happens, the engine could stall and cause a crash. So far, Hyundai said it had no reports of crashes or injuries from the problem. The Accent recall, an expansion of an action from 2013, covers certain 2009 to 2011 models. Advertisement
