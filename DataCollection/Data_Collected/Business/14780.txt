U.S. stocks surged Friday, finishing just short of a record high, as investors responded enthusiastically to a strong June job market report.The buying accelerated throughout the day after the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 287,000 jobs last month. That was far more than analysts expected, and after weak reports from April and May, it suggests the economy and job market haven’t run out of steam.“It was a strong report and it put to bed worries that we were seeing the job market sputter,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist for Edward Jones.Mining and materials companies, which would stand to benefit more than other industries from an accelerating economy, took the biggest gains. Machinery makers also jumped. Only eight stocks on the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock finished lower.AdvertisementThe Dow Jones industrial average surged 250.86 points, or 1.4 percent, to 18,146.74. The S.&P. 500 rose 32 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,129.90. The Nasdaq composite advanced 79.95 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,956.76.AdvertisementThe S.&P. 500 is less than a point away from the record high it set in May 2015. The Dow, too, is close to a record. They reached those peaks before investors got worried about the slowdown in China’s economy, before the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates for the first time in almost nine years, and before anyone thought Britain might really vote to leave the European Union.While all of those concerns have hurt stocks, they have recovered. But it’s been an uneasy rally. The stocks that have done the best in the last year are phone companies and utilities, which pay big dividends and are considered safe. U.S. bond yields have set all-time lows in the last few days. Gold is at its highest price in two years.U.S. economic growth has been steady but uninspiring, and corporate profits and revenues are in a slump. China has been shaky. The economies of Japan and Europe are weak, and the yields on some European bonds are negative as nations try to boost their economic growth.“I don’t think investors are nearly as excited as they would typically be in an environment where stocks are close to record highs,” said Warne.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.36 percent from 1.39 percent. That’s far below the 2.29 percent level it began the year at. When demand for bonds is high, their prices rise and yields fall. That has the effect of sending interest rates on many kinds of loans including mortgages lower, since those rates are tied to bond yields.Among material and industrial companies, paint and coatings maker PPG Industries added $3.29, or 3.2 percent, to $106.32 and aluminum producer Alcoa picked up 48 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $9.82.

Sales at those stores are considered an important measure of retailers’ results, and Thomson Reuters said it was the first improvement in that gauge for Gap in more than a year. Analysts expected another decline this month. Gap stock rose $1.07, or 4.9 percent, to $22.70. The stock is down 8 percent this year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
