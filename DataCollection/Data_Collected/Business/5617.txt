The British government has a roughly 80 percent stake in the bank after it extended a bailout of 45 billion pounds, or about $68 billion.Williams & Glyn is one of several businesses the bank is exiting or selling as part of an overhaul of its operations. R.B.S. spun off its Citizens Financial Group retail bank in the United States in an initial public offering last year.Advertisement
