Gross, may have violated federal securities laws.Pimco on Monday disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was considering filing an enforcement action over potential trading infractions that took place during the early days of the Pimco Total Return E.T.F., which started in February 2012.The firm said securities regulators were focused on the “fund’s performance and disclosures” for the period from Feb. 29, 2012, to June 30, 2012. It said regulators were looking at the pricing of small positions taken by the E.T.F. in some mortgage-backed securities.The investigation into the E.T.F. came to light in September 2014 around the time Mr. Gross abruptly resigned from the firm he co-founded and led for decades in the midst of dispute over his management style.Mr. Gross, known as “Bill” on Wall Street, now manages a bond fund at Janus Capital. When he was at Pimco, Mr. Gross managed the Total Return E.T.F. as well as the firm’s once-giant Total Return bond fund.The Total Return E.T.F. was the first exchange-traded fund started by Pimco. E.T.F.s are securities that trade throughout the day on stock exchanges.Pimco did not indicate in its news release whether any individuals received a so-called Wells notice from the S.E.C. Such a notice is a warning that regulatory action is likely to be taken.A spokesman for Pimco, based in Newport Beach, Calif., and officially known as Pacific Investment Management Company, declined to comment beyond the news release. A Janus spokesman did not return a request for comment.In the months since Mr. Gross left Pimco, the firm has been hit by a wave of investor redemptions. Tens of billions of dollars have been withdrawn from the Total Return bond fund.Advertisement
