Bank of America reached a similar, slightly larger settlement with regulators in 2014, and JPMorgan Chase was fined in 2013. Under its agreement with the consumer agency, Citi will issue refunds to 8.8 million consumers, and will pay separate $35 million fines to the bureau and to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Some of the illegal activity by Citi goes back to 2000, the agency said, and covers a range of products sold by Citi and third-party affiliates.For example, Citi telemarketers were said to have sold consumers identity theft protection services with a 30-day free trial when no such free trial existed. Others reportedly signed up consumers for add-on services when it was ambiguous whether consumers actually said they wanted them. Citi also was said to have sold credit monitoring services when it was not performing such services.Citi also reportedly misrepresented a $14.95 expedited payment fee to customers who paid by phone and did not tell them about no-fee options.Credit card add-on services were a lucrative source of revenue for banks. But marketing of such services largely ended after increased regulatory scrutiny.“Add-on services, for the most part, provide no benefit to consumers and people should be very careful to sign up for them,” said Nick Bourke, who specializes in consumer lending issues at the Pew Charitable Trusts. In a statement, Citi said it stopped the practices and had been issuing statement credits since 2013 to affected customers. Advertisement
