Malone, about exchanging assets between the companies.The talks had been viewed as part of the consolidation of the European telecom industry, which has seen the likes of Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Telefónica of Spain scoop up smaller rivals. But the trend has come under threat recently after the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, started to take a more negative stance on acquisitions in the sector.Vodafone, second in the world only to China Mobile as measured by subscribers, did not give an explanation about why it had ended discussions with Liberty Global. But Vodafone, which is based in London and whose operations extend from Germany to India, had said that the talks might not lead to a deal.“Vodafone today announces that discussions with Liberty Global have terminated,” the company said in a brief statement on Monday.Analysts said the collapse of that deal might reflect the new reluctance among European regulators to allow similar deals to go forward if they could potentially lead to less choice — and higher prices — for the region’s consumers.This month, the Nordic telecommunications companies Telenor and TeliaSonera called off plans to merge their Danish businesses after the companies could not win approval from Europe’s antitrust authorities.Despite a growing chill over future European telecom deals, some of the region’s companies are continuing to expand, looking beyond Europe’s borders for potential acquisition targets.That includes Altice, the Pan-European cable and mobile operator controlled by the French-Israeli billionaire Patrick Drahi. The company, which is based in Amsterdam, has spent almost a combined $27 billion in recent months to buy two American cable operators, including Cablevision, which operates in the New York City area.Mr. Malone’s American cable business Charter Communications has also agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $56 billion.The failure to strike a deal between Vodafone and Liberty Global — both companies have substantial telecom businesses in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands — could lead to potential problems for the British company. That is because Vodafone’s operations are mostly limited to wireless telephony compared with Liberty Global’s broadband services in the region.As people across Europe increasingly rely on their smartphones and other mobile devices to surf the web, analysts say telecom operators have been eager to expand into high-speed cable to complement their mobile services.It remained unclear whether Liberty Global, which has traditionally offered its customers mobile coverage through licensing deals with other operators, and not through owning physical assets, would have been interested in swapping some of its cable units for wireless businesses.By failing to reach an agreement with Liberty Global over potentially swapping assets, Vodafone will probably have to rely on its existing infrastructure just as local rivals increasingly depend on their competing broadband offerings.Advertisement
