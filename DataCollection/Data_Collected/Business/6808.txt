The company said on Monday that it was expanding a previous recall of passenger airbag inflaters from high-humidity states to the entire nation. That will add just over a million 2001 to 2005 Civics and 2003 to 2007 Accords to the recall, Honda’s No. 2 and No. 3 sellers so far this year in the United States. Two weeks ago, Honda said it would recall about 350,000 cars in high humidity areas, but the safety agency demanded that it be done nationally. A driver’s-side recall already is being conducted nationally. The propellant in airbag inflaters made by Takata can burn too quickly, blowing apart a metal canister and sending metallic debris into drivers and passengers. The problem has been linked to at least seven deaths and over 100 injuries. The recall covers airbags in cars and trucks made by 11 automakers. Advertisement
