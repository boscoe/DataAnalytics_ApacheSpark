The latest numbers should ease concerns among policy makers after reports last week showed weakness in household spending and consumer inflation. Those areas have kept pressure on the Bank of Japan to increase its already huge stimulus efforts. The Trade Ministry said on Monday that factory output rose 1.4 percent in October from the previous month; economists had estimated 1.9 percent. Separate data showed retail sales rose 1.8 percent in the year ended October, more than the expected gain of 0.8 percent. Advertisement
