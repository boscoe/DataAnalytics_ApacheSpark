But four years ago, it announced $1 billion in cost cuts as it tempered those ambitions.The latest changes are expected to include job cuts in Europe and the United States, but it is unclear how many. Nomura employs about 3,500 people in its European business, the bulk of which are in London, and about 2,500 in the Americas.Nomura is expected to provide more details on April 27, when it will also announce its results for its 2015 fiscal year.On Tuesday, the bank said that the reshaping of its international businesses would enable it to remain profitable as it faces stricter regulations put in place after the financial crisis, as well as the continued uncertainty and volatility in the markets that began in the second half of last year.“We are taking decisive action to refine the services we offer to our clients, while continuing to leverage our dominance and unique strengths in Asia,” Tetsu Ozaki, the Nomura Group chief operating officer, said in a news release. “This exercise will deliver significant efficiencies and cost savings for Nomura, refocusing the firm’s activities and reallocating resources toward its areas of expertise and most profitable business lines.”In February, Nomura said that revenue declined 4.6 percent to 1.12 trillion yen, or about $10.4 billion, for the nine months ended Dec. 31, 2015.Jonathan Soble contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement
