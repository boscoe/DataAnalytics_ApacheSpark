Mr. DiCaprio received an award for his foundation, which focuses on climate change and saving wildlife, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.DAVOS, Switzerland — Though the World Economic Forum may draw more than a thousand veteran boldface names — many who have attended countless times — among the biggest draws at this year’s gathering are some of the newest members of the global leadership club.Few names have attracted more attention here this year than Justin Trudeau, the newly elected prime minister of Canada. Marketing materials for the forum prominently name Mr. Trudeau, 44, and he is scheduled to speak on at least two occasions. (One is a panel devoted to “A New Chapter for Canada,” also featuring several of his ministers.)Another highly promoted name is Mauricio Macri, who took over as Argentina’s president last month. His ascension, as well as his goal of bringing his country back to the global markets after years of battling with investors in Argentine government bonds, has been watched closely by the hedge fund moguls who fly to Davos for the forum each year.More established members of the political elite are drawing attention, too, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who spoke here Tuesday about expediting approval for new cancer treatments.Yet not all the big names here hail solely from the world of politics. The forum bestowed its Crystal Awards — given to artists who best embody “the spirit of Davos,” in the organization’s own words — on Leonardo DiCaprio and the musician Will.i.am, among others.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
