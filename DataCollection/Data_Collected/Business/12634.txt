LONDON — Steinhoff International Holdings of South Africa said on Friday that it had abandoned its pursuit of the Home Retail Group as a potentially lengthy bidding war loomed and instead agreed to acquire the French electronics and appliance retailer Darty.The decision to walk away came as a deadline approached on Friday for Steinhoff and J Sainsbury, one of Britain’s largest grocery store chains, to make formal bids for the Home Retail Group, which is based in Britain.British takeover regulators said on Thursday that if one of the companies made a formal offer for Home Retail on Friday that the competing bidder would be granted an automatic 53-day extension to respond.On Friday, Steinhoff said that it would “not announce an offer” for Home Retail and had instead agreed to acquire Darty for 673 million pounds, or about $965 million.AdvertisementSteinhoff said it would seek to combine Darty with Conforama, a French household goods retailer it bought five years ago.Advertisement“The offer represents an attractive opportunity for both companies to develop their combined footprint, particularly in France, through an expanded offering of household goods and complementary products for the end consumer,” Alexandre Nodale, the Conforama chief executive, said in a news release.Darty said its board would recommend that shareholders accept the offer from Steinhoff, which outbid Groupe Fnac of France for the company.News that Steinhoff was ending its pursuit sent shares of Home Retail down 11 percent in late afternoon trading in London on Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
