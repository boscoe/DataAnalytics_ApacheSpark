AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedSeeking to fend off an unwanted takeover bid by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mylan raised its bid for its Irish rival Perrigo a second time — but the drug maker was again rejected.The offer, valued by Mylan at more than $34 billion, is the latest volley in a three-way merger battle among major manufacturers of generic drugs. Both Mylan and Teva are seeking to bulk up by buying rivals and adding new treatments to their offerings.Yet both pursued companies have called the takeover bids for themselves too low.Under the revised terms announced on Wednesday, Mylan is offering Perrigo shareholders $75 in cash and 2.3 of its ordinary shares for each of the shares they own. Mylan valued the bid at $232.23 a share, up from its original proposal of $205 a share.“With this enhanced offer, I look forward to meeting with Joe Papa and his team to finalize the implementation of this truly compelling combination, which is a win-win for both Mylan and Perrigo shareholders and all other stakeholders,” Mylan’s executive chairman, Robert J. Coury, said in a statement.Two days earlier, Mylan formally rejected Teva’s $40 billion takeover offer for itself in a sharply worded letter that took aim at its unwanted pursuer.Nevertheless, Perrigo was swift to respond to Wednesday’s new offer, declaring it too low and advising shareholders to take no action.“Based on Mylan’s unaffected price of $55.31 per share on March 10, 2015, the last day of trading prior to widespread public speculation that Teva was considering an offer for Mylan, the value of the revised offer is $202.20 per Perrigo share,” Perrigo said in a statement.Because it is incorporated in Ireland, Perrigo has few takeover defenses other than to persuade its shareholders that the takeover bid is too low.Shares of Mylan closed up 2.5 percent on Wednesday, at $74.50, while Perrigo’s shares fell slightly, to $184.74.Teva said in a statement that it had no intention of walking away from its own pursuit of Mylan. Though Mylan said that it would entertain only a takeover bid over $100 a share, Teva contended that its offer of $82 a share was fairly priced.And it argued that a combination of the two — which would create the biggest maker of off-brand drugs worldwide — would pose no problems with antitrust regulators.“We are fully committed to pursuing this transaction and we believe the best path forward is constructive, good-faith dialogue between our respective teams,” Erez Vigodman, Teva’s chief executive, wrote in a letter to Mr. Coury. “We encourage you to put the best interests of your stakeholders first by engaging in productive negotiations with us.”Advertisement
