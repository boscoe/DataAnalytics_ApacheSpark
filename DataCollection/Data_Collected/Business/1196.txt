Close to half the corporate law departments that responded to a recent survey plan to cut spending on outside legal work, according to Altman-Weil, a legal consulting firm that surveyed 258 corporate law departments. Instead, corporate counsel offices plan to parcel out more work among their own employees and to contract lawyers.This cannot be good news for law firms. While their revenue was up 3.6 percent in the first nine months of 2015, according to the findings of a newly released Citi Private Bank survey of 178 large law firms, the modest rise was a result of higher billing rates, not an increase in demand, which was up only 0.6 percent.The reason for the cutbacks, according to Altman Weil’s survey, is that corporations are taking a harder look at costs and risk. The trend to curb costs set in following the 2008 financial crisis, with companies parsing their bills more closely and trimming back what they were willing to pay to law firms.The push for further cutbacks, noted Jim Wilber, an Altman Weil principal, is the result of the completion of litigation or transactions, but “some of the decreases will come from work that chief legal officers have decided is simply no longer necessary.”AdvertisementHe added: “This more aggressive rebalancing of cost and risk is an important evolution in strategic thinking for many” chief legal officers.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At the top of their wish lists were conversations about pricing and budgets, conversations about management efficiency and about project staffing.Altman Weil concluded: “Chief legal officers want to work more collaboratively with law firms to rethink how their work is priced, managed and staffed. They don’t want to be only buyers of law firm services — they want to have a strategic voice in how that work is done.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
