The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.When the Playboy Mansion was listed for sale earlier this year, the person said, it prompted potential buyers to begin expressing interest in buying the entire company, and Playboy decided to explore that interest. Those potential buyers are based both in the United States and abroad but none are domestic media companies, the person said. They have not yet met with Playboy, which would be valued at around $500 million.Playboy, which was founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, now makes most of its money from licensing its ubiquitous brand and logo across the world, for bath products, fragrances, clothing, liquor and jewelry among other things. About 40 percent of that business comes from China, though the magazine is not available there.Advertisement
