JetBlue Airways is taking applications for 24 slots in a new program to train novice pilots to fly passenger jets. The airline said on Monday that the program, the first of its kind at a large UnitedStates airline, will cost about $125,000 for entrants and take four years to complete. CAE, a maker of flight simulators, will provide the training. Graduates could wind up flying 100-seat passenger jets. Warren Christie, JetBlue’s senior vice president for safety and training, said the program would not replace the airline’s traditional pipelines for pilots, many of whom come from smaller airlines. JetBlue hired more than 300 pilots last year. Applicants will be judged with tests measuring hand-eye coordination, multitasking, critical thinking and other skills. There also will be a “personality assessment” but no psychological screening. JetBlue expects the first group of six prospects to begin training in late summer in Orlando.A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: JetBlue Is Seeking Applications to Train New Pilots to Fly Jets.
