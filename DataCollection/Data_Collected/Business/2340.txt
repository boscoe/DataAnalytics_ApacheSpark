A Connecticut brewery, the New England Brewing Company, apologized for using Mohandas Gandhi’s name and likeness on one of its beers, an India pale ale it calls Gandhi-Bot that it had been selling for about five years. The label features a cartoon image depicting a robot version of the Indian leader, who favored prohibition. “Our intent is not to offend anyone but rather pay homage and celebrate a man who we respect greatly,” the company wrote on its Facebook page after being criticized, including by lawmakers in India. The brewery’s website promotes the beer as “fully vegetarian” and “an ideal aid for self-purification and the seeking of truth and love.” Proloy K. Das, a Hartford lawyer, said that the issue was not just the use of Gandhi’s name but also his depiction as a robot.A version of this brief appears in print on January 6, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Brewery Apologizes for Gandhi Beer.
