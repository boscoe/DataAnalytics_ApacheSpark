AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks moved slightly higher on Thursday as markets calmed after recent turmoil. Investors were encouraged by comments from European Central Bank policy makers, who said they were willing to provide more stimulus to the region’s economy, if needed.Attention now turns to Friday, when an important jobs report will be released that could help determine whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates this month.“There’s a lot of trepidation in the market over what the Fed will do, and it’s only getting worse as we get closer to the meeting,” said Kristina Hooper, head of investment strategies at Allianz Global Investors. The two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee begins Sept. 16. The Dow Jones industrial average added 23.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,374.76. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 2.27 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,951.13, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 16.48 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,733.50. Stocks started Thursday solidly higher, but momentum waned as the day progressed. Major indexes dipped briefly into the red by midafternoon before ending mostly higher.Investors were initially encouraged by news from the European Central Bank, whose president, Mario Draghi, said was prepared to give the eurozone a bigger dose of stimulus if inflation across the 19-country bloc did not pick up. Along with keeping interest rates low, the central bank is pumping 60 billion euros a month into the region’s economy by buying government and corporate bonds. The program is to run at least through September 2016.“Draghi said in 2012 he would do whatever it takes to grow the eurozone economy, and he’s holding to that promise,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. European markets jumped on the news. Germany’s DAX closed up 2.7 percent, France’s CAC-40 rose 2.2 percent and U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 1.8 percent. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates in the United States for the first time since the financial crisis. While chances of a rate increase in September have diminished because of signs of weakening global growth and a sell-off in Chinese stocks, many contend the growing United States economy may be ready to withstand higher interest rates.Friday’s jobs report for August, an important gauge of how the United States economy is doing, could play a big role in guiding the Fed’s decision. Economists are forecasting that employers created 220,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent.The price of oil followed the stock market higher. United States crude rose 50 cents to close at $46.75 a barrel in New York.
