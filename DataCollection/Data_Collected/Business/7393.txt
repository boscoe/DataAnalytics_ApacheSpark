The United States budget deficit shrank by $52 billion, or 14 percent, during the first nine months of the 2015 fiscal year versus year-ago figures as tax receipts grew faster than spending increases, the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday. Individual income taxes were up $153 billion over a year ago, with a whopping 16 percent gain in nonwithheld receipts that include tax payments for stock market gains, the office said. Outlays in the October-June period grew 5 percent as military and net interest spending fell. For the month of June, typically a month with high tax collections, the C.B.O. estimated that the Treasury recorded a surplus of $51 billion, down $20 billion from June 2014.A version of this brief appears in print on July 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Budget Deficit Is Down $52 Billion, C.B.O.
