Turmoil in the global markets took a toll on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses in the third quarter.The bank, the nation’s largest by assets, said on Tuesday that revenue fell in all its major business lines in the quarter from both the previous quarter and the quarter a year earlier. That left overall revenue down 6 percent, to $23.5 billion, from a year ago — a sharper decline than analysts had expected.The results, which, unusually, came after the market close, kicked off the earnings season for the Wall Street banks. Shares of JPMorgan slipped in after-hours trading.JPMorgan did have a higher profit for the quarter, but that was largely a result of a one-time tax benefit of $2.2 billion.Putting aside that benefit and other irregular items, the bank earned $5.4 billion, or $1.32 a share — lower than the Wall Street estimate of $1.37 a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. When the one-time items were included, the bank’s profit rose 22 percent, to $6.8 billion, or $1.68 a share, in the third quarter.Advertisement“Underlying results were somewhat mixed,” JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with investors.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            The bank’s best-performing division was its consumer bank. While overall revenue was down slightly in the division, the consumer bank has been originating more loans. That, the bank’s executives said, is a good sign for the American economy, despite some recent data suggesting that employment growth may be slowing.Advertisement“The U.S. economy is doing pretty well,” Ms. Lake said. “We are seeing good demand for loans.”The bank issued 41 percent more mortgages than it did a year ago, and 2 percent more than it did last quarter.The improving outlook for consumers allowed the bank to reduce the pool of money it has put aside to cover loan losses.The bank also emphasized the continuing expansion of its mobile and digital tools for customers. That is allowing the bank to spend less on branches.The biggest concerns for JPMorgan came from its Wall Street operations, which have already been shrinking as a result of new regulations and uncertainty in the markets.Revenue from the bond and fixed-income trading desks, which have been bearing the brunt of the changes, fell 11 percent from a year earlier.AdvertisementIn the most recent quarter, questions about the strength of the Chinese economy set off a bout of market volatility in August. But Ms. Lake said that since the beginning of the fourth quarter, trading activity had been quiet. If that continues, she said, it will pull down the bank’s future results more than analysts have been anticipating.Ms. Lake also blamed the volatile markets for the struggles at JPMorgan’s asset management division, which has been a steady outperformer in recent years and is an important part of the company’s future strategy.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The amount of money the company is managing for clients is now lower than it was a year ago.The $2.2 billion tax benefit that the company received in the third quarter was a result of issues stemming from the financial crisis that have just been resolved, Ms. Lake said, though she did not provide much detail on the number.Last quarter, the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, warned analysts that he could stop joining future conference calls with them, praising Ms. Lake’s competence in such presentations.Mr. Dimon, however, apparently could not resist on Tuesday and often jumped in on the call to add his own thoughts.A version of this article appears in print on October 14, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: JPMorgan Chase Reports Decline in Revenue but a Surge in New Mortgages.
