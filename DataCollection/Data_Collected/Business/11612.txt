Analysts predicted profit of €6.5 billion, according to an average of 27 estimates.Total sales were €35.7 billion ($38.8 billion) for 2015, a growth of 6 percent in organic terms compared with 2014 — and more than twice the estimated 2 to 3 percent growth in the global luxury market as a whole.A strong performance in the United States, Europe and Japan offset weakness in China, where LVMH has recently shuttered stores, the company said in a statement after the Paris markets closed.Robust sales in the last three months of the year of €10.4 billion ($11.3 billion), up 5 percent on an organic basis, also topped analyst estimates of 3.9 percent.“The 2015 results confirm the capacity for LVMH to progress and gain market share despite economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Revenue and operating profit reached new record levels,” said Bernard Arnault, the company’s chief executive.The global market for luxury personal goods in 2015 was heading for its weakest year since 2009, according to research conducted by Bain & Company, a management consulting agency, as a combination of volatile stock markets, a strong dollar, slowing economic growth in emerging markets and geopolitical turmoil hurt bottom lines.LVMH, which has weathered the storm better than rivals like the Italian fashion house Prada, pointed to an increase in revenue at its fashion and leather division, which accounts for the bulk of sales and profits.It said that it was now enjoying “a positive impact” from exchange rates, and that it was “well-equipped to continue its growth momentum across all business groups in 2016.”LVMH also mooted raising the dividend on 2015 results by 11 percent to €3.55 a share. The latest full-year results come three weeks after LVMH and Mr. Arnault’s family holding company, Groupe Arnault, announced a partnership with Catterton, the United States private equity group, to start a consumer-focused investment firm seeking assets under management of $12 billion.The combined company, to be called L Catterton, will be 60 percent owned by the partners of the new firm, with the remainder held by LVMH and Groupe Arnault, and based in Greenwich, Conn.Advertisement
