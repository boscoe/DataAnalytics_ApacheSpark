It plans to cut more than 4,000 jobs this year.AmEx, which raised interest rates for a large number of its credit cards for the first time in five years in February, also lost a case filed by the U.S. government and 17 states, which accused it of violating antitrust laws by prohibiting merchants from steering consumers to use cheaper credit cards.AmEx shares closed at $80.91 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
