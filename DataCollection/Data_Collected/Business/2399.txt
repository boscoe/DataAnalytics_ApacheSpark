A record harvest in the United States depressed prices, leading farmers in South America and elsewhere to sow fewer corn seeds. The company said lower corn plantings in the United States would probably reduce its second-quarter earnings by 5 to 10 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. “The long-term demand fundamentals for corn and soybeans are intact,” said Brett D. Begemann, Monsanto’s president and chief commercial officer, in a call with analysts. The company reported a profit of $243 million, or 50 cents a share, down from $368 million, or 69 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted to account for discontinued operations, came to 47 cents a share. The average estimate among analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 34 cents a share.
