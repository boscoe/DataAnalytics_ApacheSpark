LONDON – The Irish government said on Monday that it had hired Goldman Sachs to advise it on potential capital restructuring at Allied Irish Banks, the first step ahead of any sale of a portion of its stake in the lender, which was nationalized in 2010.“Given the significant progress made by A.I.B. in 2014 and the expectations for 2015, my officials are engaged in discussions with the bank’s management team to explore how best to reconfigure the bank’s capital structure to make it fit for purpose and agree on a road map that will see the bank begin to return cash to the state,” Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, said in a news release.Goldman was selected after a “mini tender competition” in December among a group of banks seeking to advise the Irish government on its stake.The Irish government said that Goldman would provide advice on how to make sure the bank was appropriately capitalized to maximize the potential return for taxpayers.Allied Irish Banks received 21 billion euros, or about $25 billion, in 2010 as a part of a government bailout. The Irish government now owns about 99 percent of its shares.“While no decisions have been taken regarding a reduction of the state’s ownership in the bank at this time,” Mr. Noonan said, “the delivery of a work program around capital structure during 2015 is an essential prerequisite for any future decisions in that regard.”
