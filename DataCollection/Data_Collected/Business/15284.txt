AdvertisementSupported byBy John KoblinLawyers for the former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes have agreed to keep the sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him by the former anchor Gretchen Carlson in New Jersey, according to a court filing on Monday.Mr. Ailes’s lawyers had previously tried to move the case out of federal court in New Jersey and into Manhattan. Nancy Erika Smith, a lawyer for Ms. Carlson, accused Mr. Ailes’s lawyers of “judge shopping.”With the jurisdiction settled, it will be up to the New Jersey federal court to decide whether the case will go to trial or to arbitration. Mr. Ailes’s lawyers have said that the dispute has to be settled in arbitration because of a clause in Ms. Carlson’s contract; Ms. Carlson’s lawyers have argued that her arbitration clause did not explicitly mention Mr. Ailes. She named Mr. Ailes in the lawsuit, and not Fox News.In the month since Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, many other women have accused Mr. Ailes of harassment, including the Fox anchor Andrea Tantaros, according to a report in New York magazine published on Monday.Mr. Ailes, who has denied the accusations, resigned as the Fox News chairman on July 21.Advertisement
