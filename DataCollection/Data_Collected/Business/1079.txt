New applications for unemployment benefits last week in the United States recorded their largest increase in eight months, but they remained at levels consistent with a fairly healthy labor market.Other data on Thursday showed an unexpected rise in productivity in the third quarter after a drop in self-employment led to a decline in overall hours worked for the first time in six years.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000 for the week that ended Oct. 31, the Labor Department said. It was the largest weekly increase since late February.Still, last week was the 35th consecutive week that claims were below the 300,000 threshold normally associated with a strong jobs market. Claims had hovered near 42-year lows for much of October.

“There is no evidence that there has been a pickup in involuntary job separations, and we continue to expect an increase of 200,000 in private payrolls in October,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.AdvertisementThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends because it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,500 last week, to 262,750.AdvertisementLast week’s claims report has no bearing on the October employment report to be released on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls rose 180,000 in October, well above the average gain of 139,000 jobs for August and September. The unemployment rate is forecast at 5.1 percent.Solid payroll gains in October could seal the case for a December interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve.The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 17,000, to 2.16 million, in the week that ended Oct. 24. The four-week moving average of continuing claims, however, fell to the lowest level since November 2000.

The trend in continuing claims suggests that more long-term unemployed are finding work, consistent with a low jobless rate.In a second report, the Labor Department said productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate after advancing at an upwardly revised 3.5 percent rate in the second quarter.Manufacturing productivity grew at its fastest pace in four years, led by the durable goods sector. Economists had expected productivity to contract at a 0.2 percent rate in the July-September quarter after expanding at a previously reported 3.3 percent pace in the second quarter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Productivity increased only 0.4 percent from the same period last year. That was a slowdown from 0.8 percent in the second quarter.Economists blame a lack of investment for softer productivity, saying it has led to a decline in capital intensity.“The nature of much tech investment these days may not be doing much to help productivity,” said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. “Mobile apps that make it easier to waste time at work may be leisure-enhancing, but they don’t support labor productivity.”A version of this article appears in print on November 6, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Jobless Claims Jump, and Productivity Increases .
