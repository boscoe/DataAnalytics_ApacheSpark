LONDON — The Italian investment company Exor said on Tuesday that it was making a competing bid for the reinsurer PartnerRe, which agreed to a merger with Axis Capital Holdings earlier this year.Exor, which is controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, said it would be willing to pay $130 a share in cash for PartnerRe, valuing the company at $6.4 billion.The proposal represents a 16 percent premium to the implied value of the PartnerRe-Axis deal of $112.53 a share, Exor said.“Our proposal provides superior value for PartnerRe shareholders with the certainty of a cash offer,” John Elkann, the Exor chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “We have every confidence that the PartnerRe Board, employees and shareholders will support our proposal and create the conditions for us to bring this offer to fruition swiftly.”AdvertisementExor said that its proposal would allow PartnerRe’s management and employees to develop the business as a stand-alone private company.
