A New York State Appeals Court on Thursday revived most of Macy’s lawsuit accusing J. C. Penney of interfering improperly with its exclusive merchandising contract with Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan restored two claims by Macy’s that a lower court judge had dismissed. It also agreed that Macy’s third claim against J. C. Penney was valid, but that Macy’s did not deserve punitive damages. Thursday’s decision is the latest action in an unusual legal dispute. Macy’s settled with Martha Stewart in 2014. At issue was a 2011 agreement in which she was to design bed, bath and kitchen products for sale by J. C. Penney. Macy’s complained of interference with its own exclusive deal. Last June, State Supreme Court Justice Jeffrey K. Oing said Penney had violated Macy’s exclusivity rights, but he dismissed Macy’s claims that Penney breached confidentiality provisions of its contract with Martha Stewart, or that its actions amounted to unfair competition. The appeals court said these dismissals were wrong because J. C. Penney used its “financial leverage” over Martha Stewart to learn about Macy’s contract, and then began selling Martha Stewart designs to which Macy’s was entitled. J. C. Penney declined to comment, except to say it was pleased that punitive damages were not warranted. A Macy’s spokesman, Jim Sluzewski, called Thursday’s decision a “resounding victory,” and said it would resume its pursuit of damages.A version of this brief appears in print on February 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Judge Revives Macy’s Suit Against J.C.
