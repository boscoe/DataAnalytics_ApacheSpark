TOKYO — The Bank of Japan trimmed its forecast for economic growth on Wednesday but offered no new stimulus, convinced that an expected increase in consumption would help accelerate inflation toward its target of 2 percent.Defying market skepticism over its rosy outlook, the central bank roughly maintained its forecasts that inflation will reach its target in the fiscal year beginning in April 2016.The Bank of Japan’s governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, reiterated his optimism about the global economy, pointing to data showing that China’s economy had grown a better-than-expected   7 percent in the second quarter.“Export and output growth have moderated somewhat, but we expect this to be temporary,” he told reporters after the two-day rate review. “But as for the outlook, exports are expected to increase moderately, albeit with some fluctuations, due to improvements in overseas economies and the boost from a weak yen.”AdvertisementAs widely expected, the Bank of Japan kept intact its pledge of expanding base money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen, or $648 billion, via aggressive asset purchases.AdvertisementJapanese policy makers, who had braced for market turbulence from Greece’s debt crisis and China’s stock market rout, were relieved when Beijing’s rapid-fire support steps restored a measure of calm to its markets and Athens clinched a last-minute conditional bailout.But nodding to signs of weakness in external demand, the bank offered a slightly gloomier view on exports and output, saying that they have been “picking up, albeit with some fluctuations.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
