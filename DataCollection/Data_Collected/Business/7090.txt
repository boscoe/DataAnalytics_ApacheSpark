It urged customers to stop wearing tops with the elastic drawstrings and remove the draw cord, or request a new, nonelastic cord from Lululemon.“When the elastic draw cord with a hard tip in the hood or around the neck area is pulled or caught on something and released, it can snap back, impact the face area and result in injury,” the notice said.Alecia Pulman, a spokeswoman for Lululemon, said: “Our main priority is ensuring our product works for our guests, and we believe this is the necessary proactive action.”She said none of the reported injuries were serious and no lawsuits had been filed. She said that Lululemon had voluntarily contacted safety regulators over the defect.“We are committed to making our product right for our guests and regret any inconvenience this may have caused them,” she said.About 133,000 drawstrings in the United States and 185,000 in Canada are affected by the recall. Twenty-three products, including Lululemon’s “Carry and Go” hoodie, “Savasana” tunic and “Wear With All” jacket, are listed in the recall.In a safety notice on its website, Lululemon said customers should check whether their tops were fitted with an elastic or stretchy drawstring in the neck area, with hard metal or plastic tips. Tops that fit that description are affected by the recall, the notice said.Shoppers can report injuries involving Lululemon tops on the commission’s website.Lululemon, the Canadian athletics wear company, was embroiled in a recall controversy in 2013 over its signature black yoga pants, which customers complained were excessively see-through. Some women who tried to return the pants at Lululemon stores reported being told to put them on and bend over, so staff members could determine how sheer they were.Dennis J. Wilson, the founder of Lululemon, initially fanned the flames by suggesting that some women were just too large to wear the pants. The company eventually recalled about 17 percent of the yoga pants, and Mr. Wilson announced later that year that he would step down as the company’s chairman.Also this month, Lululemon disclosed that Mr. Wilson may sell his entire stake in the company.Advertisement
