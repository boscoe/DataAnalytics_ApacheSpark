WASHINGTON —  Fewer people sought unemployment benefits last week in the United States, evidence that strong hiring should continue despite signs of slower economic growth at the start of 2015.The Labor Department said on Thursday that weekly applications for jobless aid fell 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000. The decrease suggests that a recent slowdown in manufacturing, housing starts and retail sales has not trickled into the job market, a possible indication that economic growth will rebound after a harsh winter.The four-week average, a less volatile measure, tumbled 7,750 to 297,000. Over the last 12 months, the average has fallen roughly 7 percent.

The relatively low average shows that employers are holding on to workers and may increase hiring. Applications below 300,000 are generally consistent with solid monthly job gains.AdvertisementThe economy was struck by some setbacks during a frigid February. Factories turned out fewer long-lasting goods, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. Builders broke ground on fewer homes last month, while retail spending has fallen.Those reports indicate that growth will be substantially lower than its annual average of 2.2 percent during the final three months of last year, which was already a decrease from growth averaging more than 4 percent in the middle of 2014.AdvertisementThe Atlanta Federal Reserve forecasts that first-quarter growth will be at an annualized rate of 0.2 percent. On Tuesday, the private firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimated, somewhat more optimistically, growth of 1.4 percent.A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Jobless Claims Decline, Pointing to a Rebound.
