Now, the pharmaceutical manufacturer is weighing a potential breakup of itself.The company, now known as Allergan, is considering selling or spinning off at least some of its generic drug business, a person briefed on the matter said on Friday.It would be a change of course for the company, which had built itself into a $124 billion powerhouse in large part through repeated deals, for companies like Forest Laboratories.But buying Allergan was perhaps the drugmaker’s biggest coup. The Botox manufacturer had been seeking to fend off an unwanted takeover bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, an aggressive serial acquirer that had partnered with the hedge fund magnate William A. Ackman.Actavis had served as a white knight, paying $66 billion, well above the $53 billion that Valeant had offered. Among the reasons Actavis could pay so much more was that it had moved its corporate home abroad, to Dublin, meaning it pays lower taxes on its international sales.Now the company is weighing parting with one of its major business lines, which had previously been its foundation. The Allergan deal last year was aimed in large part at diversifying beyond the generic drug business, which has become saturated with lower-margin products.A spokesman for Allergan, Alex Kelly, declined to comment.News of the company’s deliberations was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.Advertisement
