The company has severed its ties to him.Subway’s investigation included a review of more than a million online comments and interviews with past and present employees and managers of the company and an advertising fund, the statement said.A spokeswoman for Subway, Kristen McMahon, said the company received the “serious” complaint in 2011 from Rochelle Herman-Walrond, a former journalist from Florida who revealed publicly to WWSB-TV in Sarasota last month that she has also taken her concerns to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and secretly recorded her phone conversations with Mr. Fogle to assist the agency’s investigation.Ms. McMahon said the 2011 complaint “expressed concerns about Mr. Fogle” but included “nothing that implied anything about sexual behavior or criminal activity involving Mr. Fogle.” She declined to elaborate on the nature of the complaint.Nevertheless, the company said in its statement, it regretted that the complaint was “not properly escalated or acted upon.”“It is important to note that the investigation found no further evidence of any other complaints of any kind regarding Mr. Fogle that were submitted to or shared with Subway,” the company said.Neither Ms. Herman-Walrond nor Mr. Fogle’s lawyers responded to phone messages left on Friday night seeking comment.Advertisement
