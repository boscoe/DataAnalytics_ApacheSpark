LONDON —  By catapulting to power an improbable alliance of the hard left and nationalist far right, Greece has shaken up Europe’s political kaleidoscope and may have signaled the end of an era of centrist consensus.With eight general elections due in the European Union this year, as well as regional votes, the earthquake in Athens may be a harbinger of other shocks to come.Expect the unexpected in 2015 from Britain to Finland and Denmark to Spain as voters who have endured five years of economic crisis, falling real incomes and welfare cuts vent their anger, anxiety or apathy at the ballot boxes.Mainstream center-right and center-left parties that have dominated European politics since the end of World War II are bleeding support to populists at both ends of the spectrum, and to mavericks like the Italian comic-turned-politician Beppe Grillo.AdvertisementIn many countries, voters feel the established parties offer no real alternative. Many are determined to punish a “ruling caste” perceived as being out of touch with ordinary people’s concerns and as helping themselves rather than their electors.AdvertisementWhat unites many of the new forces is hostility to the European Union and to policies of austerity driven from Brussels and Berlin.“We’ve reached the end of a 30-year cycle of liberal individualism and wealth accumulation that began with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher,” Denis MacShane, a former British minister for Europe, said in an interview. “We’re in for at least half a decade of turbulence and uncertainty in Europe.”Mr. MacShane, whose latest book, “Brexit: How Britain Will Leave Europe,” is due out this month, says the last such period of flux was in the 1970s, with the crumbling of a postwar consensus on the welfare state, a mixed economy with a big government role and collective bargaining — at least in Britain and the United States.Whether antiestablishment outsiders will win power anywhere other than Greece remains to be seen. But they seem set to make government more awkward and less stable everywhere.“In hindsight, the governments we have had in Europe since 2011 may have been as good as it gets,” said Tina Fordham, chief global political analyst at Citigroup. “The outlook everywhere is for weaker governments with significant unpredictable, untested, non-mainstream components.”Greeks have suffered higher unemployment, deeper poverty and more social dislocation than any other Europeans since they became the first eurozone country to seek an international bailout in 2010.Greece is also probably the country where the traditional political class has been most discredited by corruption scandals and tax avoidance, nepotism and fiddled statistics.AdvertisementSpain’s two mainstream parties, which have alternated in power since the fall of fascism, have also been tarnished by a string of sleazy affairs. The parties are seen by many Spaniards as sharing the blame for the collapse of a real estate bubble that triggered tough austerity measures.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That has fueled the rise of the year-old utopian left-wing Podemos (Yes We Can) party, led by a charismatic young academic, Pablo Iglesias. Podemos leads both Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party and the opposition Socialists in opinion polls.Mr. Iglesias, 36, who is close to the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, may gain credibility from Syriza’s victory, especially if the new Athens government is able to negotiate some debt relief and an easing of austerity.However, Mr. Tsipras’s alliance with the hard-right Independent Greeks has jarred leftists in southern Europe: It would be hard to imagine France’s anticapitalist Left Party, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, teaming up with Marine Le Pen’s National Front.The prospect of months of confrontation between Athens and Brussels amid potential financial instability may deter Spanish voters from risking a vote for Podemos by the time the election comes around in December, or drive the Popular Party and the Socialists to form a German-style grand coalition government.Another country where antiestablishment radicals could upset the apple cart is Britain, which votes on May 7. The governing Conservatives and the opposition center-left Labour Party are neck and neck in opinion polls, suggesting neither is likely to win an overall majority.That could make for an unstable government dependent on one or possibly two smaller parties for its survival. If Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservatives come out on top, expect two years of uncertainty and market jitters ahead of his promised referendum on whether Britain stays in the European Union.With the centrist Liberal Democrats facing big losses after five years of coalition with the Conservatives, potential kingmakers range from the anti-immigrant UK Independence Party, which wants to take Britain out of the European Union, to the Scottish National Party, which has gained ground since narrowly losing a referendum on independence last year.The veteran political scientist David Butler, the father of British opinion polling, says he has not seen a more uncertain election since 1945.AdvertisementTwo other countries where untested nationalist forces could be knocking on the door of government are Finland, where Timo Soini’s euro-skeptic Finns party is bidding for a share of power in April, and Ireland, which votes in early 2016, with the leftist Sinn Fein surfing a wave of anti-austerity sentiment.Even countries such as Ireland and Spain, which are now seeing the return of healthy economic growth, may not reward the parties that led them through the crisis because most ordinary citizens still feel worse off.Paul Taylor is a Reuters correspondent.
