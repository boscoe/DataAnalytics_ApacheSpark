Jim VandeHei’s new media company, which he says is intended for dedicated news consumers, is scheduled to make its debut early next year. In the meantime, Mr. VandeHei, one of the founders of Politico, is keeping himself occupied with a more plebeian venture: a Snapchat channel.On Sunday, he and NowThis, a company that makes short videos for social platforms, introduced We The People, a Snapchat Discover channel focused on the final stages of the presidential campaign. It is running Sunday through Thursday until the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20.Mr. VandeHei will provide editorial guidance for the channel, while NowThis, which already has its own Snapchat channel, will create the content.The channel is separate from Mr. VandeHei’s new media company, as yet unnamed, which has raised $10 million and will cover a wide range of subjects, including technology, business, media and politics. But there is a link between the two: Kenneth Lerer’s firm, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, is an investor in both NowThis, whose short videos are all over social platforms including Facebook and Instagram, and Mr. VandeHei’s new company.Advertisement“As we were discussing that new company, we also were discussing this new product,” Mr. Lerer, one of the founders of The Huffington Post, said about We the People. NowThis is providing the money for the channel.AdvertisementMr. VandeHei said he viewed the Snapchat channel as an experiment that, if successful, could potentially “inform what we do with our new media company.”The channel also underscores a bigger shift in the media industry. Over the last few years, Facebook has had little competition when it comes to wooing both established publishers and newer media companies that want access to the platform’s vast user base and sophisticated targeting capabilities.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Many, including BuzzFeed, The Wall Street Journal and Cosmopolitan magazine, have flocked to Snapchat Discover, where they can publish videos, graphics and text within the mobile app.“Snapchat is now, and will grow to be, another very significant avenue to distribute content,” said Mr. Lerer, who is also the executive chairman of BuzzFeed. “If you have an opportunity now to get on the Discover platform, you take it.”Mr. VandeHei’s Snapchat channel is different from other Discover channels in that it will focus on one topic for an extended period of time. “The channels that we’ve launched to date have been around broader subject matters,” said Nick Bell, vice president of content for Snapchat. “This is very specific and very pointed.”(Snapchat does have Specials — Discover channels that tend to focus on one topic and are live for only one or two days. Mr. Bell described those more as “one-offs.”)Mr. VandeHei did not define measures of success for the channel, but, he said, “we’re all curious to see how big an audience we can get” and whether users will return day after day.A version of this article appears in print on September 26, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Snapchat Venture Focuses on Campaign’s End.
