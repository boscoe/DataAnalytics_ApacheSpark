Domino’s Pizza, one of the largest United States pizza chains by store count, on Tuesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street’s estimate, as higher costs took some of the shine off better-than-expected sales at established restaurants. Domino’s said on Tuesday that net income rose 7 percent to $48 million, or 85 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 28. Excluding items, Domino’s earned 91 cents a share, 2 cents less than the average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue jumped almost 14 percent to $643 million. Sales at stores open at least one year rose 11.1 percent in the United States and 6.1 percent in international markets.A version of this brief appears in print on February 25, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Profit at Domino’s Pizza Falls Short of Forecast.
