A setback in talks between Greece and its creditors helped knock the stock market lower on Friday, in the face of renewed concerns that the country could default on its debts.Despite the drop, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index eked out a 1-point gain for the week, ending a two-week slump.An unexpected decision by the International Monetary Fund to walk away from talks with Greece spurred the selling. At a summit meeting in Brussels late Thursday, the fund withdrew its negotiators from the talks with Greece, saying there had been no progress and that major differences remained on key issues.Without a deal by the end of the month, Greece faces the prospect of going bankrupt and dropping the euro currency.AdvertisementMarkets are likely to make sudden turns until Greece and its creditors reach a deal, said Ninh Chung, head of investment strategy at SVB Asset Management. Earlier in the week, stocks on both sides of the Atlantic rallied on reports of progress in the talks.Advertisement“There had been optimism over Greece, and now it seems like we’ve had a complete 180,” Mr. Chung said.The S.&P. 500 slipped 14.75 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 2,094.11. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 140.53 points, or 0.8 percent, to 17,898.84, and the Nasdaq lost 31.41 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,051.10.The losses were modest but broad: All 30 companies in the Dow and all 10 industries in the S.&P. 500 finished with losses.
