AdvertisementSupported byBy Mary Williams WalshDemocrats in the Senate said they would introduce two bills on Monday to give Puerto Rico broad powers to shed some of its $72 billion of bonds while also giving its public workers’ pensions priority over the bonds.The legislation includes ideas that the Obama administration first put forward in October, when senior Treasury and White House officials said Puerto Rico risked a humanitarian crisis if it did not soon get the power to unilaterally reduce its debt. (As a United States territory, Puerto Rico currently has no ability to file for bankruptcy protection.)Certain elements of the bill will probably meet stiff opposition from Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and who have expressed concern about the fairness and constitutionality of any island-wide debt restructuring. Many investors in Puerto Rico’s bonds acquired their holdings years ago, when the island’s laws made restructuring impossible.The draft legislation proposes to designate Puerto Rico’s public pensions as “senior secured debt,” which is quite likely to be contentious. Some American lawmakers have already questioned whether Congress can change the priorities of Puerto Rico’s pensions and bonds without adverse legal consequences.Proponents of the assistance package said there was no time to lose, as Puerto Rico’s cash dwindles and major debt payments loom this spring and summer.“For the 3.5 million American citizens living on the island of Puerto Rico, time is running short,” said Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat who is a sponsor of both bills. “Congress has to act immediately to fix the federal funding shortfalls and give Puerto Rico the tools it needs to fully restructure its debt.”The bills, which were reviewed by The New York Times, would give Puerto Rico the power to restructure all of its bond debt — not just the debts of the big public corporations that operate its drinking water systems, toll roads, ports and other services.That would mean adjusting even the principal and interest owed on general-obligation bonds, a type of debt now given absolute top priority by Puerto Rico’s Constitution. The bill would give the governor of Puerto Rico the power to “submit a restructuring proposal which specifies the ordering and amount of debts to be paid,” according to a legislative summary.Giving the governor the power to reorder the hierarchy of debts will probably be controversial, as the sponsors acknowledge.“The creditors can then object (which they will),” states the legislative summary.It goes on to say that a bankruptcy judge, chosen by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, would then decide whether to approve the restructuring plan or demand changes to meet certain criteria.“In order to approve the restructuring proposal, the judge would have to confirm that it complies with the fiscal plan, treats pensioners as senior secured debt, and if feasible, does not unduly impair general obligation bondholders,” according to the legislative summary.The creditors would get no chance to offer alternative restructuring proposals. And once the restructuring was approved, the judge would have the power to impose it on any dissenting creditors.The bill would also establish a “chief financial officer” for Puerto Rico, appointed by the island’s governor, and would put its financial affairs under a nine-member “fiscal stability and reform board.”Many Puerto Rican residents and officials have been wary of any such oversight board, arguing that it would carry unacceptable colonial overtones.But the bill contains a number of provisions intended to allay such concerns. It would allow such a board to be established, for instance, only if the Puerto Rican legislature requested it first. Six of the nine members would have to be residents of the island, four would be named by the Puerto Rican legislature, two by the Puerto Rican governor and one by the island’s Supreme Court.The board members’ terms would be staggered to promote continuity, and to separate the island’s financial affairs from electoral politics.During the restructuring period, the governor of Puerto Rico would also have the power to submit annual budgets to the board for approval, as well a five-year fiscal plan, which would attempt to set “levels of debt, spending, and tax policy necessary to restore solvency and fully fund pensions,” according to the summary of the bill. The board would have the power to certify or deny each budget’s compliance with the fiscal plan.Puerto Rico’s public pension system is almost exhausted, and fully funding its workers’ pensions at this point will cost billions of dollars. Precise amounts are not known, because the pension reports now in the public domain contain out-of-date numbers.Under these circumstances, treating the pensions as “senior secured debt” would represent a sharp departure from existing bankruptcy jurisprudence in cases where the debtor is a company. In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a pension is a secured credit only to the extent that it has been funded; the money in the bankrupt company’s pension fund is treated as the collateral securing the company’s promise to its retirees.Companies are also required by federal law to fund their pension plans, and it would be unheard of for a company to strip all the assets out of a pension fund, as Puerto Rico appears to have done. Pensions that are not funded constitute unsecured credit in the corporate world, worth pennies on the dollar in a bankruptcy.In addition to setting out a framework for an island-wide debt restructuring, the bill proposes to make certain federal tax and health care provisions in Puerto Rico more comparable to such programs in the 50 states. For example, Puerto Ricans on the island would be able to claim the earned-income tax credit if they work; under current law, they must leave Puerto Rico and get jobs on the United States mainland to claim the credit.Advertisement
