PARIS — France's energy minister said on Monday that an overhaul of the country’s state-controlled nuclear energy industry was imminent, after one of the country’s main builders of nuclear power plants warned of a loss that could hamper its ability to continue operating independently.The minister, Ségolène Royal, told reporters that France’s main nuclear power companies “should organize themselves to refocus on their core business, to forge alliances between major French enterprises and to win bids at the international level.”Ms. Royal spoke after Areva, one of the world’s leading nuclear technology companies, said in a preliminary statement that it expected a 2014 net loss of about 4.9 billion euros, or $5.6 billion, compared with a loss of €500 million a year earlier.The French government — which has continued to be a proponent of nuclear power when many other big industrial nations have been more equivocal or have come to oppose it outright — owns 87 percent of Areva, and nearly 85 percent of the other big French nuclear power company, EDF, once known as Électricité de France.AdvertisementEDF has been facing its own problems, including lengthy delays and steep cost overruns on a flagship plant that it is building at Flamanville, in the northwest of the country. There are also uncertainties about whether a showcase project in Britain will proceed — one in which both EDF and Areva would participate.AdvertisementThe French nuclear industry’s travails underline the gloomy state of the nuclear industry since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011. Moreover, the French industry, though long a world leader, has in recent years been threatened by its own mistakes. It has also had trouble coping with the emergence of new challengers like China to sell nuclear plants in countries in emerging markets and the West that value the clean-energy possibilities of nuclear power more than they fear the technology’s potential dangers.The loss that Areva warned of on Monday would be substantially larger than its stock-market value of about €3.7 billion, suggesting that the troubled company, plagued by cost overruns and write-downs, may need new funds to continue operating. Areva’s capabilities are vital to France’s ambitions to remain a world provider of nuclear plants and services like supplying fuel.With few new nuclear plants being planned to replace the older ones that are being phased out in the West, “Europe will see a gradual decline in nuclear’s share of electricity supply,” said Antony Froggatt, an analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organization.Instead, the momentum is shifting eastward, with industry growth over the next few decades most likely to center on companies in China, India, Russia and South Korea.Although the United States is building few new plants, it still leads the world in power generated by nuclear plants, followed by France and Russia, according to the World Nuclear Association, a trade group. But the rising force in the industry is China, the site of about half of the nuclear stations being built or planned. India also has big nuclear plans and like China tends to favor its domestic companies.France, though, currently gets a larger share of its electricity from atomic power than any other country.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A decision on whether to proceed with construction, in which would be the first such plant to be built in Britain since the 1990s, might not be made any time soon, EDF said this month.Areva is listed as a partner and contractor in the Hinkley Point project, but the company’s recent losses raise questions about how much capital it can contribute. The companies had hoped to have the Hinkley Point plant operating by 2018, but now even 2023 looks optimistic.All of the European projects by Areva or EDF feature the EPR reactor, a 1990s design that was supposed to lock up a big share of global orders for France but is proving exceedingly complex and expensive to build.Areva noted that its announcement on Monday was made a week early “in view of the financial information recently appearing in the media.” Unsourced reports in the French media, including in the newspaper Le Figaro, had said in recent days that a big loss was expected. The company emphasized that the data was based on “unaudited preliminary financial information” that could change over the next week.​Areva shares closed down 2.1 percent in Paris trading on Monday.The company, which is based in Paris, had previously warned that it was facing trouble; it said in November that it was suspending its financial guidance for 2015 and 2016. Standard & Poor’s cut the company’s debt rating to junk soon after that, citing the company’s “limited headroom.”David Jolly reported from Paris, and Stanley Reed from London.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: France Likely to Revamp Nuclear Energy Industry.
