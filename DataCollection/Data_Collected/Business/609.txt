Valeant Pharmaceuticals is shaping up to be the next big Wall Street brawl.Its shares soared to new heights earlier this year after investors followed big-name hedge fund managers like William A. Ackman and John P. Paulson into the drug company. Mr. Ackman even likened it to Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.In recent months, however, Valeant has lost momentum as media and regulatory scrutiny of its aggressive drug pricing policies has grown. The company disclosed last week that it had received subpoenas from federal prosecutors seeking information about its pricing policies and its distribution procedures.Against that skeptical backdrop, a research firm’s report that all but called Valeant the pharmaceutical equivalent of Enron hit the stock market like a bomb Wednesday morning.The report from Citron Research, a favorite of short sellers who bet against stocks, set in motion a tidal wave of selling. At one point, shares of Valeant were down as much as 40 percent.AdvertisementCitron claimed it had evidence that Valeant was secretly controlling two little-known drug distribution companies, and it speculated that this arrangement was meant to create “phantom sales” and false revenues in an effort to deceive auditors and investors.AdvertisementValeant’s biggest shareholders were staring at steep losses by midday, but the stock price recovered a bit in the afternoon after the company issued a news release calling the Citron report “erroneous.”And Mr. Ackman, who already owned a 5.7 percent stake in the company, doubled down, buying more than 2 million additional shares, according to a spokesman for Mr. Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management.By the end of the day, Valeant’s shares closed down 19.1 percent, at $118.61, in very heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, indicating that the skepticism about Valeant goes beyond the research report. Valeant’s response on Wednesday did not answer some of the questions that investors have about its relationships with affiliates. The tumultuous day followed several months of heavy selling in the stock, which has halved in value since July. In addition to Mr. Ackman, hedge funds like Mr. Paulson’s Paulson & Company, as well as ValueAct, Lone Pine Capital and Viking Global, are among the top 20 holders in the stock. The biggest owner of Valeant stock is the Sequoia Fund run by Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb, which was once recommended by Mr. Buffett.But the proof offered by Citron for its explosive charge that Valeant is another accounting fraud like the onetime energy highflier Enron was more circumstantial than conclusive.Citron said it arrived at its conclusion after examining the relationship between two entities, Philidor Rx Services and R&O Pharmacy, so-called specialty pharmacies that fill prescriptions for certain types of drugs made by Valeant. Citron’s eight-page report noted that the two small companies shared a common customer service number even though Philidor is based in Pennsylvania and R&O has its headquarters in California. The report also noted similarities in websites for both companies.This led Citron to assert that they are the “same company” and part of a scheme to create false sales.
            The drug company is known for growing through acquisitions and cutting costs.        In past accounting frauds, companies have recorded revenue in their public financial statements by making false sales to affiliates. In its report, Citron said that Valeant appeared to be creating fake revenue through “phantom sales” to affiliated entities.AdvertisementValeant pushed back against the notion that it might be booking fake revenue. The company said that its consolidated net revenue does not include sales to Philidor and its network, which, it said, includes R&O. Valeant added that it records sales in its consolidated revenue only “when the product is dispensed to the patient.”A person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said neither Valeant nor Philidor own R&O. Corporate records in California list Russell Reitz as one of the owners.In a wrinkle, Philidor said that while it did not currently have direct equity ownership in R&O or affiliated pharmacies, it had “a contractual right to acquire the pharmacies now or in the future subject to regulatory approval,” according to a statement Wednesday evening.Andrew Left, founder of Citron, confirmed in a phone conversation that he had placed a bet against Valeant. Mr. Left said he thought Valeant’s response “has a lot of holes in it.”It has been a difficult time for Valeant, which sells an array of specialty drugs and generic pharmaceuticals. Over the past several weeks, the company, which has its headquarter in Canada, has found itself drawing criticism for its pricing policy for certain drugs amid a broader public concern about pharmaceutical companies taking advantage of consumers by rapidly escalating prices for certain specialty drugs.Even before Citron’s critical report roiled the market, Valeant’s dealings with Philidor had begun to unnerve Wall Street. On Monday, a top executive for Valeant disclosed during a quarterly earnings conference call that a year ago it had purchased an option to buy the small drug distributor based in Hatboro, Pa.In the call, J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, said Valeant had begun consolidating Philidor’s financial results in its own finances.AdvertisementValeant’s disclosure prompted a number of Valeant skeptics, including some hedge fund managers, to post information online about Valeant and Philidor.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Hempton, the founder of Bronte Capital, has been an outspoken bull on shares of Herbalife, the nutritional supplement manufacturer. Conversely, Mr. Ackman’s hedge fund has a major bet that shares of Herbalife will collapse and that the company will be proved to be an unlawful pyramid scheme.In some ways, the bitter bullish and bearish arguments over Valeant are starting to mirror the long-simmering dispute between investors over Herbalife’s prospects.In a post on his blog, Mr. Hempton focused attention on a lawsuit that R&O filed against Valeant in federal court in California. In the lawsuit, R&O is seeking a declaratory judgment that it did not owe Valeant $69 million in payments for selling some of its drugs. The Camarillo, Calif., based company filed the lawsuit after Valeant’s lawyers sent it a letter demanding payment.R&O, in its lawsuit, said that until the letter from Valeant’s lawyer arrived, it had “never received a single invoice or a single demand for payment from Valeant in any amount.”The lawsuit said that either Valeant and R&O were both victims of a fraud, or Valeant was “conspiring” with another party to defraud R&O.Gary Kaufman, a lawyer for R&O, declined to comment on the Citron report.But he did note there is some confusion because there are two websites that claim to be for R&O. He said the company’s official website is the one with the web address r-opharmacy.com. Mr. Kaufman would not discuss the other website, with the web address randopharmacy.com.Internet records report the second website for R&O was created in May and is hosted by a web operator in Pennsylvania.AdvertisementValeant, in its response to the Citron report, said that R&O was part of the Philidor pharmacy network and made use of “a common call center phone number serviced by Philidor.”In the lawsuit, R&O said Valeant submitted a voucher for a payment of $69 million. In its response to the Citron report, Valeant said the net amount of the revenue owed to it is about $25 million.In theory, if the companies are indeed separate, those sales should be immediately recorded in Valeant’s consolidated revenue, even before the drugs are dispensed to the patient. The fact that Valeant said it sales to R&O were not recorded in its revenue suggests that R&O is closely tied to Valeant nonetheless.Andrew Pollack contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Valeant’s Shares Fall on Report’s Fraud Claim.
