His comments stand in sharp contrast to those made by John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX Networks, in August.Mr. Landgraf said then that the exorbitant amount of television had created a malaise felt by executives and viewers. The competition — digital providers like Netflix, premium channels like Showtime and cable channels like AMC – has made it harder to “cut through the clutter and create real buzz,” Mr. Landgraf said at the time.But Mr. Hastings said there was not “nearly enough” content and that Netflix was trying to “expand significantly.”“There’s a lot more food than ever before,” he said. “We have a lot of choice, but if you do great content, you’ll find great viewers.”The Internet, he said, enables Netflix to make more segmented shows that appeal to niche audiences, and he said he aspired to one day create a range of programming, including a Bollywood show and an anime show.He did concede that making high-quality shows was “very challenging.”Advertisement
