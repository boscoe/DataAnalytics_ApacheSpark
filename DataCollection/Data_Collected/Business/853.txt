Excluding changes in international exchange rates, Live Nation said its revenue would have been $2.76 billion.The company had $266 million in adjusted operating income, a measurement of profitability that excludes acquisition expenses, stock compensation and other costs. Its net income was $89 million, or 39 cents a share, down 15 percent from its net income for the same period last year.The summer months are usually the most critical for the concert business, and in recent years the market has grown substantially as ticket prices climb ever higher and musicians turn to live performances to make up for declining record sales.Live Nation said it had put on some 5,852 events around the world in the third quarter, up 13 percent from the year before. In a letter accompanying the results, Michael Rapino, the company’s chief executive, said that as of Oct. 26 Live Nation had sold 54 million tickets to its events, up 8 percent from the same point last year.The company’s biggest profit drivers are its ticketing and sponsorship divisions, both of which had substantial growth in the quarter. Its ticketing services, which include Ticketmaster, had $97.1 million in adjusted operating income, while sponsorship brought in $95.8 million.“As we look forward, we see tremendous opportunities to continue consolidating concerts and ticketing on a global basis,” Mr. Rapino said in a statement, “with further growth in our advertising and ticketing businesses from the concerts flywheel.”Advertisement
