Trump and Hillary Clinton tuned in on Tuesday to see their running mates square off.About 37 million Americans watched in all, Nielsen reported Wednesday, compared with a record 84 million viewers for last week’s debate.Widely perceived as a matchup between two relatively mild-mannered politicians, Tuesday’s debate between Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana generated more fireworks than expected.But it is now on track to be the lowest-rated vice-presidential debate since Dick Cheney and Joseph Lieberman met in 2000.Ratings also fell off after the first half-hour of Tuesday’s encounter, which was moderated by Elaine Quijano of CBS News. That was a contrast from last week, when the vast majority of viewers stayed for the full 95 minutes of the debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump.Statistics from the Nielsen Company, which conducts the ratings, did not include Americans who watched the debate on the internet or on mobile devices. Viewers of C-Span, which is not rated by Nielsen, were not included.videoAdvertisement
