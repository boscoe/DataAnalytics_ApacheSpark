Fearful investors put their money in government bonds, especially U.S. Treasurys. Another measure of fear in the markets, the so-called Vix index, jumped and is now up 70 percent in just five days.Investors worry the sharp fall in the price of oil and other commodities is a sign of weakness in the global economy, especially China, and that will cut into profits at big energy companies and suppliers of raw materials as well as other companies.“We’re stockpiling commodities and demand is not picking up,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors. “It’s kind of a depressing market.”Energy shares, already decimated this year, fell 3.4 percent on Friday. Southwestern Energy plunged 14 percent. Freeport McMoRan, a mining giant, dropped 6 percent.The trouble began with a report from the International Energy Agency that said the oversupply in oil would persist until late next year even as demand continues to weaken.

Their prices have fallen sharply as investors fear the companies that issued the bonds might default. A fund that tracks the bonds, the iShares iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, dropped nearly 4 percent in five days.Investors were also focused on a Federal Reserve meeting next week where the central bank is widely expected to announce an increase in its benchmark interest rate from a record low.Recent economic reports indicate that the U.S. economy is healthy enough to withstand a rate hike, but investors are still nervous because it would be the first rate rise in nearly a decade.“It’s anticipation of the Fed, it’s oil, it’s credit ... all of these factors are putting fear and confusion into the investor,” said Jonathan D. Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners.In a sign of trouble among commodity producers, Dow Chemical and DuPont on Friday announced a $130 billion deal to merge their businesses to counter falling prices.
