Several traders have lost their jobs as a result.But the Serious Fraud Office, which investigates fraud in Britain, said its inquiry had determined there was “insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.”“Whilst there were reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of offenses involving serious or complex fraud, a detailed review of the available evidence led us to the conclusion that the alleged conduct, even if proven and taken at its highest, would not meet the evidential test required to mount a prosecution for an offense contrary to English law,” the agency said in a news release.“It has further been concluded that this evidential position could not be remedied by continuing the investigation,” the agency added.The fraud office noted that its investigation included the review of more than a half-million documents.The agency began its criminal inquiry in July 2014 after a referral from the Financial Conduct Authority, a financial regulator in Britain.Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.In November 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority reached a settlement with five global banks after it accused them of conspiring to manipulate foreign currencies, with the banks paying the regulator 1.1 billion pounds, or about $1.5 billion, in penalties.The Financial Conduct Authority accused lenders of failing to have proper controls in place to prevent misconduct in the trading of currencies of the so-called Group of 10 nations.The civil inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority focused on chat-room conversations between traders at multiple banks, who used code names to identify clients and shared private information about clients including pension funds, hedge funds and big asset management firms.A lack of criminal prosecutions of banks and their leaders fueled a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants are “too big to jail.”The conclusion of the Serious Fraud Office inquiry without any criminal charges brought against individuals will again raise questions about the resolve of British authorities to pursue and prosecute financial crime.The Serious Fraud Office suffered a setback in January when six former brokers were acquitted of criminal charges in a separate investigation into the potential manipulation of a benchmark interest rate known as Libor.The agency said on Tuesday that it would continue to work with the Justice Department, which is continuing to investigate the currency market.Advertisement
