LONDON — TSB Banking Group, the lender spun out of Lloyds Banking Group last year, said on Thursday that it had received a preliminary takeover offer from Banco Sabadell of Spain.The deal, if completed, would greatly expand Sabadell’s presence in Britain, where it primarily offers business accounts and banking services to Spanish companies.Under the terms of the offer, Sabadell would pay 3.40 pounds in cash for each share of TSB, valuing the company at £1.7 billion, or about $2.6 billion, TSB said.Shares of TSB jumped 21 percent to £3.20 in early trading in London on Thursday.TSB said its board of directors had indicated to Sabadell that it was willing to recommend that shareholders accept an offer at the proposed price, subject to reaching an agreement on other terms and conditions.AdvertisementThe transaction would be subject to regulatory approvals, and TSB said the discussions “may or may not result in a formal offer for the entire share capital of the company.”AdvertisementLloyds, which is partly owned by the British government after a bailout during the financial crisis, spun out TSB in an initial public offering in June. Lloyds now holds about 50 percent of the TSB’s capital after a sale of TSB shares in September.The takeover approach by Sabadell is the latest evidence that Spanish banks, bolstered by recent capital increases, are looking to expand again overseas. The country’s banking sector required a European bailout in 2012 to keep Bankia and other ailing savings banks afloat.Caixabank, which, like Sabadell, is based in the northeastern region of Catalonia, is pursuing a full takeover of BPI, a Portuguese bank, despite opposition from BPI’s second-largest shareholder, Isabel dos Santos, who is pushing for an alternative merger plan with another Portuguese bank.Banco Popular, another Spanish bank, considered buying some of Citigroup’s businesses in Central America, although news reports on Wednesday said it had dropped out of the bidding.Sabadell was not among the Spanish banks that required European bailout money. Instead, it snapped up, for the symbolic sum of 1 euro, one of the suffering savings banks — Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo — as part of a sweeping consolidation of the savings banks, or cajas, encouraged by the Madrid government.In late 2013, Sabadell strengthened its capital when it brought in Latin American investors, including Jaime Gilinski, a Colombian billionaire, as part of a capital increase that involved selling 1.4 billion euros, or $1.49 billion, in new shares.​After being briefly suspended from morning trading on Thursday, shares in Sabadell continued their slump and were down about 9 percent to €2.26 by midday in Madrid.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In 2013, it acquired the retail Spanish subsidiary of Lloyds for about €84 million in a stock deal that also resulted in Lloyds becoming a shareholder in Sabadell, with a stake of 1.8 percent. In a separate deal a month later, Sabadell then agreed to buy the private banking unit of Lloyds, which is based in Miami.AdvertisementTSB said in a news release that any offer by Sabadell “will be subject to the completion of due diligence and Lloyds Banking Group P.L.C. agreeing to enter into an irrevocable undertaking with Sabadell in respect of its entire holding in TSB.”Lloyds is required to divest itself of the TSB network of 631 branches under the terms of its £17 billion bailout. Lloyds had said before that it planned to sell its remaining stake in TSB by the end of this year.Lloyds said on Thursday that it was in discussions with Sabadell over a sale of its holdings in TSB and “would be minded to accept an offer at this price,” subject to certain terms and conditions.With about 4.5 million retail customers, TSB is the seventh-largest retail bank in Britain. In 2014, the lender posted a profit of £134.5 million.TSB said its directors believed that Sabadell would “support and accelerate TSB’s retail growth strategy” and its expansion into lending for small to medium businesses.“Sabadell recognizes the achievement of TSB’s management and employees and would continue to operate TSB as a robust competitor in the U.K. banking market, building on the TSB brand name,” TSB said.Founded in 1881 in Catalonia, Sabadell is one of Spain’s largest lenders. It posted a profit of €371.7 million in 2014 and has about 17,500 employees.The company provides international business banking services in 22 countries outside Spain, including the United States.Sabadell opened its first office in Britain in 1978 and its first operating branch in London in 1986. In Britain, it primarily provides business banking services but sees the market as attractive for future investment.AdvertisementCitigroup and Rothschild are acting as financial advisers to TSB, while Goldman Sachs is advising Sabadell.Chad Bray reported from London, and Raphael Minder from Madrid.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
