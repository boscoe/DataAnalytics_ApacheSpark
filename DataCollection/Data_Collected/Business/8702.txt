One of the first toys to emerge from a tightly held cache of merchandise tied to the next “Star Wars” movie is already the target of a viral crush online: It’s the BB-8 droid, a small, round robot that rolls along the floor at the touch of a smartphone.The droid, from the Colorado start-up Sphero, is among hundreds of toys related to Disney’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which opens in December. BB-8 is seen speeding along in a trailer that has already been released for the movie.With a smartphone as a controller, users can steer the little bot along paths, smash it into walls, feet and chairs, and watch as it angrily lights up if its head comes loose.Stores including Target, Toys “R” Us and Walmart will open at midnight on Friday, when many of the new items go on sale.News of the BB-8 leaked early, and the toy became the darling of several technology sites on Thursday. With a smartphone as a controller, users can steer the little bot along paths, smash it into walls, feet and chairs, and watch as it angrily lights up if its head comes loose. BB-8 works as a “connected” toy, meaning that consumers can maneuver it wirelessly via an app on their hand-held devices.But BB-8 is not cheap. It will retail for $150.As part of its marketing efforts to build anticipation for the film, Disney has instructed retailers and toymakers to keep tight-lipped about new “Star Wars” products. The company has granted toy licenses to industry giants like Hasbro and Mattel, as well as to upstarts like Sphero and Jakks Pacific.Still, the new toys can give fans hints about new characters in the movie: If the BB-8 droid is any indication, R2D2 may have competition as the franchise’s most beloved robot.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
