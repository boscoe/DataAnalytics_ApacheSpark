McDonald’s is replacing its discount “Dollar Menu & More” with a feature called “McPick 2,” which will let customers pick two of the following items for $2: a McDouble, a McChicken, small fries and mozzarella sticks. It is another effort by McDonald’s to revive slumping sales, but also to attract deal seekers after moving away from the Dollar Menu introduced more than a decade ago. “Customers are looking for choice and flexibility,” said Deborah Wahl, senior vice president for marketing for the United States. “That’s sort of the new definition of value.” The offering has gained the necessary votes from franchisees to make it onto the national menu, and will be available in American restaurants for a five-week run starting Jan. 4. After that, McDonald’s said, it may change the details of the offering, but it planned to stick with the McPick concept.A version of this brief appears in print on November 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mcdonald’s Exchanging $1 Menu for 2 for $2.
