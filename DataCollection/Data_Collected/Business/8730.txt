LONDON — The battle for Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment took another turn on Friday as the online gambling company said its board of directors would now recommend that shareholders approve an offer from its rival GVC Holdings over a previously agreed-to deal with 888 Holdings.The latest offer from GVC is worth 1.12 billion pounds, or about $1.71 billion.The bidding appeared to be wrapped up in July when Bwin.Party said it had agreed to be acquired by the Gibraltar-based 888 Holdings for £893.3 million.GVC, however, made several counteroffers as it continued to negotiate with Bwin.Party’s board. That led 888 Holdings to come back with another bid this week.Following Friday’s announcement, 888 Holdings said that it would no longer pursue a takeover of Bwin.Party.Advertisement“The 888 board has concluded that, as a result of its own extensive due diligence on bwin.party, it cannot see sufficient value in bwin.party to warrant a revision to its offer,” 888 Holdings said in a news release. “Consequently, 888 confirms that it is no longer in discussions regarding the acquisition of bwin.party.”AdvertisementUnder the terms of GVC’s latest offer, Bwin.Party shareholders would receive the equivalent of 129.64 pence in cash and shares for each of their shares. That represented a 45 percent premium to its closing price on May 14, the last day before GVC first announced its takeover approach.“In recommending the offer from GVC, the board has taken into account many factors including, but not limited to, the headline value per share and the consideration being offered, the level, timing and deliverability of the financial synergies to be generated and the enlarged group’s growth strategy in an increasingly competitive marketplace,” Philip Yea, the Bwin.Party chairman, said in a news release.The directors of Bwin.Party said they intended to unanimously recommend that shareholders approve the transaction, the companies said. Directors and other investors who collectively hold 10.8 percent of the company’s shares have agreed to support the deal.Bwin.Party shareholders would receive 25 pence a share in cash and 0.231 of a share in the combined company for each share of Bwin.Party, and they would own 66.6 percent of the combined company.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
