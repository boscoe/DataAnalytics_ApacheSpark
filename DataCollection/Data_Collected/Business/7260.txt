LONDON — The BBC said Thursday that it was cutting 1,000 jobs to help plug a budget gap of 150 million pounds caused by a larger decline than expected in the number of households owning televisions, as viewers increasingly choose to watch content free online.The BBC is financed in part by a license fee system in which every British household with a television pays £145.50, or about $230, a year to the BBC. That helps generate about £3.7 billion for the corporation. Television owners 75 or older are exempt.The BBC said viewers were increasingly using their hand-held devices or going online to catch up on missed programs, suggesting that the BBC needed to update its business model for the digital age by extending the license fee to include digital services.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, was quoted by the BBC News website as saying that more than one million fewer people had a television set than had been forecast by the corporation in 2011, creating the shortfall.AdvertisementHe said the organization faced a “difficult choice” because of the challenging economic environment, the BBC reported.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The cuts should generate savings of £50 million, he said.The BBC has faced several challenges in recent years that have dented public confidence, including criticism over its handling of the allegations of sexual abuse against the television personality Jimmy Savile; attacks by conservative politicians against a perceived left-wing bias; and a debate about the future viability of the license fee system, whose revenues some critics have argued should be shared with other broadcasters.A version of this article appears in print on July 3, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Shortfall in User Fees Prompts BBC to Cut Jobs.
