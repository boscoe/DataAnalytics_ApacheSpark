Winters, reshapes the company.The decision to wind down those businesses followed the bank’s decision to close its institutional cash equities, equity research and equity capital markets operations in January.Ending the equity derivatives and convertible bonds businesses will take place in a phased manner to ensure that the bank’s “responsibilities toward our clients, counterparties and the market are appropriately discharged,” Standard Chartered said.Mr. Winters, the former head of JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank, became chief executive in June as part of a broad leadership shake-up. He was brought to succeed Peter Sands, the bank’s longtime chief executive, and to turn around Standard Chartered, which generates most of its earnings in Asia.“We are taking action to position the bank for growth and driving a step change in performance,” Standard Chartered said in a news release. “This move aligns with our priority to kick-start performance by focusing on superior execution for our clients, making strategic investments, innovation in our product and process design and divestments from noncore initiatives.”Standard Chartered did not disclose how many employees might be affected by the closing of the equity derivatives and convertible bonds operations.Standard Chartered has been hit hard by a slowdown in emerging markets, as well as by impairments for bad loans and what it has called “challenging” trading conditions in some business lines in recent quarters, including currency hedging products.The bank said this month that it planned to reduce senior staff positions by 25 percent while cutting costs as part of a plan it had announced in July to streamline its business, realign its management and cut costs by $1.8 billion by the end of 2017.As part of the overhaul, Mr. Winters had said that the bank would have three main divisions — corporate and investment banking, commercial and private banking, and retail banking — and that the management team would report directly to him.Standard Chartered is expected to update investors on its reorganization when it reports its third quarter results on Nov. 3.Advertisement
