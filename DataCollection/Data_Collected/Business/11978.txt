Mr. Esteves, who has denied wrongdoing and remains under house arrest awaiting trial, has since resigned from the company.In December, BTG agreed to sell its distressed debt unit, Recovery do Brasil Consultoria, to Itau Unibanco, Brazil’s largest private banking group, for about 1.2 billion reais, or $300 million.Founded in 1873, BSI, whose initials stand for Banca della Svizzera Italiana, is based in Ticino, an Italian-speaking region of Switzerland, and it has traditionally had many clients in Italy.The Swiss bank had 92 billion Swiss francs, or about $92.6 billion, in assets under management as of the end of 2014, and it has offices in Europe, Latin America, Hong Kong and Singapore.If an agreement is reached, the sale would come less than two years after BTG agreed to acquire the business from the Italian insurer Generali Group for about $1.7 billion in cash and stock in July 2014.A BSI deal would significantly bolster EFG’s business. It comes amid an expected push for consolidation in Switzerland’s private banking industry.EFG, which is based in Zurich, provides private banking and asset management services at about 30 locations worldwide and employs about 2,100 people. As of the end of 2014, it had 85.1 billion francs in assets under management.Advertisement
