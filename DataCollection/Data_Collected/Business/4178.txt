Staples reported a drop in sales in the fourth quarter, a decline it hopes to reverse through a merger with its rival Office Depot.Both companies, struggling with sluggish consumer spending that has hurt the broader retail industry, are waiting for regulatory approval for their $6.3 billion merger. The union would create an office supply behemoth that could better compete with online competitors, which have taken away sales from traditional brick-and-mortar stores.Staples closed 169 stores last year, and said it would continue its plan to close at least 225 stores by the end of this year. At the end of 2014, Staples operated nearly 2,000 stores, mostly in the United States and Britain.In the fourth quarter, Staples said that sales fell 3.7 percent, to $5.7 billion. Excluding currency fluctuations, same-store sales in North America fell 4 percent in the fourth quarter; online sales rose 9 percent.AdvertisementThe company reported a loss of $260 million, or a loss of 41 cents a share, compared with $212 million, or 33 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.AdvertisementTotal sales for the year fell 2.7 percent, to $22.5 billion, in 2014.The fourth quarter included a $410 million write-down related to Staples’ businesses in China, South America and Australia. Excluding that charge, the retailer reported net income of $198 million, or 31 cents a share, and sales grew 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter.Staples announced a deal to buy Office Depot in February, and the merger is awaiting regulatory approval. If all goes according to plan, the companies expect to merge by the end of the year.The Federal Trade Commission blocked the companies when they tried to merge 18 years ago, citing antitrust concerns. Since then, however, the retailers have been battered by the growth of online competitors like Amazon, as well as discount chains like Walmart and Target.A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing: Sales Dropping, Staples Reports a $260 Million Loss.
