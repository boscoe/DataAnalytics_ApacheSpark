Mylan’s defensive fight against its unwanted suitor, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, has claimed an unusual casualty: a big corporate law firm that has advised both drug makers.Teva has switched legal advisers in its pursuit of Mylan, dropping Kirkland & Ellis after a Pennsylvania federal magistrate judge recommended that the firm be stripped of its role because it previously counseled Mylan on other matters.The judge’s comments, made in Mylan’s lawsuit against the firm, are an unusual blow against a deal adviser for the not-uncommon practice of having worked for both sides in a dispute.It also represents a potentially big twist in the dust-up between Mylan and Teva, since Mylan is not only fighting off the takeover bid, but is also pursuing its own unsolicited takeover of the drug maker Perrigo.AdvertisementBanks and law firms routinely work for multiple companies in an industry and maintain committees to clear conflicts when they appear to arise.AdvertisementA number of advisers have been criticized by courts for improperly working both sides of a deal, such as advising the seller while also providing financing to the buyer. However, in 2010 the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore was allowed to keep advising Air Products in its pursuit of Airgas, despite having done work for the latter over the years.In the Mylan case, Kirkland & Ellis was found to have overstepped its bounds by taking on Teva as a client after having previously represented Mylan on a number of matters, including legal and regulatory strategies involving key drugs like EpiPen allergy treatments. (Teva is making a rival product.) Kirkland & Ellis had also represented Teva before.Such knowledge meant that the law firm possessed material confidential information that was sufficiently related to Mylan’s battle to stave off Teva’s unsolicited advances, according to Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A representative for the drug maker said that the company had switched advisers to Sullivan & Cromwell.A version of this article appears in print on June 11, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Teva Switches Adviser.
