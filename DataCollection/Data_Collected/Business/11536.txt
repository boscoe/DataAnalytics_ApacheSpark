HONG KONG — Takata, the Japanese company whose faulty airbag inflaters have been linked to 10 deaths and led to the global recall of millions of cars, said on Friday that its chief executive had no current plans to resign.The statement came after a meeting in Tokyo between Takata and some of its largest customers, which include Japan’s biggest carmakers. A Takata representative declined to disclose details of the meeting, while customers including Toyota, Nissan and Honda declined to comment.Still, Takata, in its statement after the meeting, addressed news media reports that Shigehisa Takada, who is also the chairman and the grandson of the company’s founder, might resign to take responsibility for the company’s problems.“This is not what we announced, nor is there any intention of his resignation as of now,” it said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Airbags made by Takata have ruptured violently in recent years, in some cases killing the drivers and passengers of cars. Last week, safety regulators in the United States announced a 10th death linked to Takata airbags, a man who was killed in December when the airbag in the car he was driving exploded.Also last week, United States officials announced a major expansion of the recall of cars with Takata airbags, adding five million more cars to the 19 million already under recall.Makiko Inoue reported from Tokyo.
