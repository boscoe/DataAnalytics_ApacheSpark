If the deal is completed, ICAP and its shareholders would own about 56 percent of Tullett Prebon, with the remainder held by Tullett Prebon’s existing investors.Tullett Prebon said it intended to cooperate with the Justice Department and that it still expected the transaction to close this year.ICAP’s global brokering unit acts as an intermediary for businesses and people wanting to trade a broad range of asset classes, including bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates and stocks.The global brokering business focuses on so-called voice brokering — in which orders are negotiated on the telephone, rather than through electronic orders — as well as a hybrid of voice brokering and electronic trading. It had 1,458 voice brokers as of the end of March. The business operates in 35 locations in 22 countries.Advertisement
