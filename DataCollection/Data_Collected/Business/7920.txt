HONG KONG — Instability continued to roil China’s stock markets on Tuesday in spite of new pledges of support from the government.Coming off its biggest one-day decline since 2007, Shanghai’s main share index seesawed throughout Tuesday — falling as much as 5 percent as trading opened and rising 1 percent at one point — to end down 1.7 percent.The precarious display on China’s bourses after several weeks of relatively calm movements has shaken global financial markets. Prices for metals like copper, of which China is a major buyer, fell to six-year lows during the past two days. Oil has also slumped, trading closer to the six-year lows it reached this spring.“This is not the first time that massive volatility has found its way into the Chinese equity market,” said Peter Alexander, the founder and managing director of Z-Ben Advisors, a financial consultancy based in Shanghai. “But this is the first time in modern history that the Chinese markets are on the global radar screen.”AdvertisementThe renewed volatility came despite reassurances from the government that it would continue to support the stability of the markets.AdvertisementAfter the 8.5 percent plunge in the index on Monday, China’s central bank issued a statement on Tuesday before markets reopened, saying that “stable financial markets are expected to continue supporting steady gains in the real economy.”
                The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country’s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.            In the coming months, the bank pledged to “be flexible in putting to use various monetary policy tools to maintain liquidity at a reasonable level.” The People’s Bank of China, the central bank, has cut interest rates four times since November. It has also moved several times to free banks to lend more of their deposits.But the recent unraveling of China’s stock rally, which had added around $7 trillion in market value in the year ended in mid-June, could weigh on the country’s economic growth in the coming months.The authorities responded to the sell-off, which began in June, by introducing a 120 billion renminbi, or $20 billion, market stabilization fund that is backed by the central bank. They also suspended initial public offerings of stock and encouraged executives to buy company shares, while promising to crack down on short-selling, or bets against a stock, and market manipulation.Those measures appeared to reassure investors. Before plummeting on Monday, markets had been rebounding modestly in recent weeks.As the turbulence continued, 64 percent of the 1,125 stocks that make up the Shanghai composite index closed lower on Tuesday. The companies whose shares rose included state-backed stock brokerage houses, which rebounded strongly from the plunge on Monday. Shares in Citic Securities, Haitong Securities and Guotai Junan Securities all rose significantly.Laggards included the CRRC Corporation, a state-owned train maker whose shares fell 5.7 percent on heavy trading, and Ping An Insurance, which closed down 4 percent.Analysts attributed the sell-off that started on Monday to a number of potential factors. They included lackluster economic data and fears that the state may be removing some support for share prices. But most analysts expect the government to continue its intervention.Advertisement“The government intervened on the way up; they tried to avoid a bubble when the market was rallying quite quickly,” Herald van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy in Hong Kong for HSBC, said Tuesday in a telephone interview. “They’ve obviously also intervened on the way down, so I suspect that they’ll try to do that again in order to stabilize the market.”In fact, the message from Beijing has so far been clear on this account. For example, late Monday evening, the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued a statement responding to recent news reports that the state was retreating from its market rescue operations.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
