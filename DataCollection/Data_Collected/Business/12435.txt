LONDON — Britain’s highest court has found that UBS and Deutsche Bank must pay tax on shares awarded to employees as bonuses more than a decade ago that British tax authorities said were intended to avoid taxes.The two cases before the Supreme Court of Britain revolved around shares awarded to employees at UBS and Deutsche Bank as bonuses during the 2003-04 British tax year. The redeemable shares were in offshore vehicles set up for the tax plan and based in Jersey, the largest of the Channel Islands, and in the Cayman Islands.The offshore vehicles were created to meet British rules for restricted shares, which would mean they would not be subject to deductions for income tax or national insurance contributions. The setup included conditions under which the shares could potentially be forfeited or the value of those shares could be reduced.The Supreme Court found that a restrictive condition in the UBS case that would have potentially lowered the value of the shares if the FTSE 100 stock index moved higher than a trigger point in a three-week period in 2004 was “completely arbitrary.”Advertisement“It had no business or commercial rationale beyond tax avoidance,” the court said in its judgment on Wednesday.AdvertisementIn the Deutsche Bank case, shares would be forfeited if the person who was awarded them was fired for misconduct or voluntarily resigned within a six-week period after the shares were awarded.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
