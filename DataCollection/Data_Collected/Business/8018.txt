LONDON — BNP Paribas, France’s biggest bank, said on Friday that it swung to a profit in the second quarter because of higher revenue in its investment bank and international financial services business, less than a year after being hit by a huge settlement for doing business with countries that face United States sanctions.For the three months that ended June 30, BNP Paribas, based in Paris, reported a profit of 2.56 billion euros, or $2.8 billion, from a loss of €4.22 billion in the same period a year earlier.The prior-year results included a €5.95 billion charge related to the settlement with the authorities in the United States, who had accused the bank of transferring billions of dollars on behalf of Sudan and other blacklisted countries.BNP Paribas, which was accused of hiding the names of Sudanese and Iranian clients when sending transactions through its New York operations between at least 2002 and 2012, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and ultimately paid an $8.9 billion penalty to federal and state authorities last year.AdvertisementExcluding one-off items, profit rose 13.7 percent in the second quarter of this year, BNP Paribas said.AdvertisementDuring the second quarter, BNP Paribas booked a gain of €420 million from the sale of a 7 percent stake in May of Klépierre, a French shopping mall operator and commercial real estate company.“BNP Paribas had a very strong performance this quarter,” Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, the BNP Paribas chief executive, said in a news release. “Revenues were up in all the operating divisions with continued increase in the domestic markets and strong growth in the specialized businesses, retail banking outside the eurozone and the large client businesses.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
