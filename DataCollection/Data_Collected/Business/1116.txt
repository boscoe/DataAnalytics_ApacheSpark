Drug makers have used mergers to acquire promising treatments in late-stage development, hoping to claim the next blockbuster.The move comes nearly 18 months after Pfizer tried to buy AstraZeneca in a deal that valued the drug maker at about $107 billion. In the agreement for ZS Pharma, AstraZeneca agreed to pay $90 a share, a 42 percent premium from the American company’s closing price on Thursday.“This acquisition complements our strategic focus on cardiovascular and metabolic disease by adding a potential best-in-class treatment to our portfolio of innovative medicines,” Pascal Soriot, the AstraZeneca chief executive, said in a news release.The transaction was unanimously approved by ZS Pharma’s board of directors.The deal is subject to regulatory approval and to a majority of ZS Pharma’s shareholders agreeing to sell their shares in a tender offer. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.ZS Pharma, based in San Mateo, Calif., employs about 200 people in three states. ZS-9 is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration, with a decision expected in May. Sales of ZS-9 are expected to exceed $1 billion annually, AstraZeneca said.“This agreement will allow us to maximize the potential of ZS-9, drawing on AstraZeneca’s longstanding expertise in developing and commercializing medicines for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases,” Robert Alexander, the ZS Pharma chief executive, said in a news release.Advertisement
