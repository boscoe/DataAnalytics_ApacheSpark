The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index climbed 3.4 percent, to 112.4 last month, for a fourth consecutive monthly gain. The index is now at its highest since May 2006. “The confidence has returned to housing, not only as shelter but as a good long-term investment,” said Ronald J. Peltier, chief of Berkshire Hathaway’s real estate affiliate, HomeServices of America. Also on Thursday, the Labor Department said that more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week. The overall level remained low, though, with weekly applications increasing by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 282,000. Advertisement
