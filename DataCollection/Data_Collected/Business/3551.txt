STANDOFF OVER GREEK DEBT  |  The Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has asked Germany’s finance chief and eurozone finance ministers to renegotiate Greece’s 240 billion euro bailout deal, but the answer has repeatedly been a firm “no,” Landon Thomas Jr. and Jack Ewing write in DealBook. Greece must follow the rules, they have said. Although Greece’s debt woes pose less of a threat to Europe than they did two years ago, an abrupt default would agitate markets and complicate efforts to kick-start growth in the region. As they face off, all sides in the negotiation are betting others will blink first. 
There may be a method to Mr. Varoufakis’s madness, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Ewing write. “He calls himself an ‘erratic Marxist,’ and is putting his extensive study of game theory to the test in the real world,” they add. “With a ‘nothing-to-lose approach,’ he is wagering that Germany and the rest of Europe will eventually make concessions, rather than risk a Greek departure from the euro and a new wave of contagion.” For now, however, the three officials who control Greece’s purse strings ‒ Wolfgang Schäuble of Germany, Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands and Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank ‒ are loath to bend the rules lest a troubling precedent is set.
But things may be looking up. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece agreed on Thursday to meet with representatives of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Friday, ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday. The move helped cheer markets in Europe, putting global equities on track for a second week of gains. Asian markets also rallied on the day.



LYFT IN TALKS TO RAISE $250 MILLION  |  The ride-sharing service Lyft, a smaller rival of Uber, is in talks to raise about $250 million in new financing, putting a value for the three-year-old start-up at $2 billion, Michael J. de la Merced and Mike Isaac report in DealBook, citing people briefed on the matter. If it closes the round, that would be a second wind of fresh capital for Lyft, which says it experienced rapid growth in 2014.
Some of the new capital is expected to come from existing investors like the Alibaba Group of China, though the round has not been completed, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of ties to the company. Alibaba itself was not expected to lead the round and would contribute a relatively small portion of the new money. Depending on investor interest, Lyft could seek to raise up to $500 million.
Raising capital has been difficult for Lyft this time around as it continues to battle Uber, which has previously tried to persuade venture capitalists not to invest in Lyft. Some investors and analysts have also questioned whether Lyft can continue to draw new interest as a clear but distant No. 2 competitor in its industry. Lyft, which operates in 60 American markets, is dwarfed by Uber, which operates in about 250 cities and 54 countries. Uber’s coffers are also much deeper. The company has raised more than $4 billion from large institutional firms and is valued by investors at more than $40 billion.



EXPEDIA TO BUY ORBITZ  |  The online travel booking company Expedia agreed on Thursday to buy Orbitz Worldwide for about $1.3 billion in cash, its second acquisition in two months, DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced writes. The transaction further solidifies the United States market for online travel booking to two companies, Expedia and the much bigger Priceline Group, though both continue to face competition as new rivals like Google and the start-up Hipmunk enter their business.
Since the summer, Expedia has announced deals for Travelocity and Wotif.com of Australia. And in a conference call with analysts, the company hinted that its deal-making streak may continue as it seeks to bolster its barriers against competitors. Expedia plans to run Orbitz’s searches against its much bigger inventory, particularly of hotels and car rentals, to secure more bookings.
Under the terms of the deal, Expedia will pay $12 a share in cash, 24 percent higher than Orbitz’s closing price on Wednesday. Over all, Expedia said that it expected the acquisition to contribute about $75 million in cost savings. Investors in both companies applauded the transaction. Shares in Orbitz rose nearly 22 percent, to $11.72, while those in Expedia rose more than 14 percent, to $89.57.

LAW SCHOOLS GET INTO BUSINESS  |  Law schools, including Brooklyn Law School, Cornell and the University of Maryland, are adding business-oriented offerings to better equip students to compete in a redefined and contracting job market, Elizabeth Olson writes in DealBook. These schools are introducing focused sessions that aim to bring students up to speed on business practicalities, like accounting, to prepare graduates for the teamwork, business strategy and client interaction that is fundamental to running a corporation.
For its boot camp-like session, Brooklyn Law joined with Deloitte Financial Advisory Services, which had developed a program to give new hires at law firms some business background. Cornell University Law School started a similar business-focused workshop, called “Business Concepts for Lawyers. Still, Ms. Olson writes, “few  law schools have taken steps to change their curriculum, in part because first-year courses are seen as indispensable to legal learning and also because some professors typically resist teaching courses that seem vocational.”
