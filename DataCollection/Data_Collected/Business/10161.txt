But the question was always whether investors in Tesla would approve a takeover of the embattled solar company, which had been seen as a bailout of sorts.But in the end, Tesla shareholders placed their bets on the billionaire entrepreneur. The carmaker announced that more than 85 percent of its independent shareholders — that is, those unaffiliated with Mr. Musk, who holds leadership positions at both companies — voted in favor of the deal.Putting the two together will yield a green-energy company whose products include electric cars and solar panels for homes.“We would like to thank our shareholders for continuing to support our vision for the future,” Tesla said in a statement. “We look forward to showing the world what Tesla and SolarCity can achieve together.”From Zip2 to OpenAI, a look at the entrepreneur’s many companies.Under the terms of the transaction, SolarCity shareholders will receive 0.11 of a Tesla share for each share of SolarCity that they own. At Thursday’s closing prices, that offer is worth about $20.75 a share, or just shy of where SolarCity shares closed.While Tesla has been riding relatively high, SolarCity has been buffeted by changes in regulations of solar energy companies and by the more than $3 billion in debt it has racked up to support its business.Critics have argued that the deal would weigh down Tesla financially. James Chanos, the prominent financier, on Wednesday repeated his assertions that the transaction was “absurd” and “ridiculous.”Shares of Tesla have fallen about 14 percent since the company first disclosed its intentions. In after-hours trading on Thursday, shares of Tesla were little changed. Shares of SolarCity rose 2 percent in after-hours trading.The case for combining Tesla and SolarCity received a lift two weeks ago when an influential shareholder advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services, came out in favor of the deal.According to Tesla, the deal is expected to close “in the coming days.”Advertisement
