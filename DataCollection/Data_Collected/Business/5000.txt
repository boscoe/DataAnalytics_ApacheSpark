The shipping firm has agreed to buy its ailing Dutch rival TNT Express for 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in a friendly, all-cash deal. That seems a full price for a troubled target. But cost savings, cheap debt and a strong dollar could help FedEx realize good returns.FedEx’s offer of €8 a share is a healthy 33 percent premium to TNT’s last closing price of €6. It is about 20 times the 40.2 cents of earnings per share analysts expect in 2016.That is far above FedEx’s median multiple of 15.3 times forward earnings over the last decade. The premium looks higher after considering TNT’s fading earnings power. Analyst estimates for TNT’s 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization have fallen 22 percent over nine months, while estimates for earnings per share have dropped 27 percent, according to Datastream.Step back, though, and the FedEx move looks more sensible. It can probably run the business better.Also, the price is considerably lower than United Parcel Service’s offer of €9.50 euros, which Euroepean regulators killed in 2013. With its archrival aside and no subsequent bidders, FedEx presumably did not feel obliged to pay a knockout price.The dollar’s rally makes the deal even cheaper in FedEx’s home currency: 30 percent lower than the UPS bid, analysts at Berenberg say. Any debt financing will be cheap too, since FedEx recently sold 50-year bonds with a 4.5 percent yield.FedEx is paying nearly €1.1 billion more than TNT’s market value before the deal was announced. To have the merger make sense, FedEx does not need to match the €400 million to €550 million in annual synergies that UPS was counting on. With less overlap, it probably can’t cut costs as much. But €150 million of pretax benefits, roughly a third of the UPS goal, with a tax rate of 25 percent, would do the trick, even if the gains are valued at a modest multiple of 10 times.Then consider the backdrop. Europe’s economy is perking up, which should in time benefit delivery firms. In turn, the euro could recover, too. If and when that day arrives, FedEx will have a stronger, leaner business worth considerably more in dollars.Quentin Webb is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.
