HONG KONG — Standard Chartered said Thursday it would close its unprofitable equity sales and research business, eliminating about 200 jobs in an effort to cut about $100 million in annual costs by 2016.The latest round of cuts at Standard Chartered, a British bank that makes most of its money in Asia, is in addition to a program announced in November to cut 4,000 jobs by the end of 2015, for a further annual savings of $400 million.The bank has been seeking to sell or close underperforming or ancillary business units to bolster profit by reducing costs, part of a restructuring announced last year. The process includes the sale last month of its consumer finance business in Hong Kong and China for an undisclosed sum.In addition, the bank is pruning its network and plans to close 80 to 100 branches. It has already sold or closed other businesses in Korea, Germany, Lebanon, Taiwan, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.With the steps announced Thursday, Standard Chartered will quit its institutional cash equities, equity research and equity capital markets business lines, according to a news release. The 200 jobs to be cut are spread across seven of the bank’s 70 markets, with about half of those cuts in Hong Kong, where it employs about 6,000 people.The bank will continue to operate its convertible bonds, equity derivatives, macroeconomic research and fixed-income research units.Investors reacted favorably to the news, with shares in Standard Chartered closing up 2.9 percent in Hong Kong on Thursday.“We are demonstrating action and progress as the management team focuses on delivering returns for shareholders,” Peter Sands, the group chief executive at the bank, said in a news release. “We are continuing to take significant action on costs by exiting or reconfiguring noncore and underperforming businesses and by increasing the efficiency of our core businesses.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/09/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Cuts at Standard Chartered.
