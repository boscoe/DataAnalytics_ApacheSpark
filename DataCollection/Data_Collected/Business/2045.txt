If it were to sell the business, the bank said, it would want a binding agreement in place by the end of next year and to fully divest the unit by the end of 2017.“Separating out the Williams & Glyn business is a complex process,” Ross McEwan, the R.B.S. chief executive, said in a news release. “But we remain focused on meeting our state aid obligation, achieving full divestment by the end of 2017, and reaching the best outcome for shareholders, customers, and staff.”R.B.S. is required to spin off or sell Williams & Glyn by the end of 2017 as part of the government bailout of 45 billion pounds, or about $68 billion at current exchange rates, that it received during the financial crisis.The British government owned as much as 80 percent of R.B.S. after the bailout, but it began reducing its stake this year and now owns about 73 percent.The lender, which is in the process of shrinking and refocusing its business, said that it had applied for a separate banking license for Williams & Glyn at the end of September and that it would plan for the business to spin off from R.B.S. in the first quarter of 2017.Williams & Glyn had £24 billion in deposits at the end of the third quarter, and it has about 1.8 million customers.Advertisement
