Global airlines announced on Tuesday a new guideline that recommends even smaller carry-on bags, in an effort to free up space in packed overhead bins. The guideline, which is not binding, means that many existing bags in compliance with airline rules would not be given preferential treatment in the boarding process. While details of how the guideline will be put into effect are murky, and would vary from airline to airline, it raises the possibility that many fliers will be forced to check their favorite carry-on bag — or buy a new, smaller suitcase. The recommendation, by the International Air Transport Association, suggests an optimal carry-on size of 21.5 inches in height, 13.5 inches wide and 7.5 inches deep. That’s smaller than the maximum size allowed by many airlines. For instance, American, Delta and United Airlines all allow bags up to 22 inches by 14 inches by 9 inches. The trade group says the new guideline will not necessarily replace each airline’s rules on bag size, but gives them a uniform measurement that “will help iron out inconsistencies.”A version of this brief appears in print on June 10, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Global Airlines Move Toward Even Smaller Carry-On Bags .
