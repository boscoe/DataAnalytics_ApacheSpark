The teenage clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch’s fiscal second-quarter results topped analysts’ estimates as an important sales metric improved. The company’s stock jumped 9.5 percent in trading on Wednesday. Abercrombie & Fitch began tinkering with its image earlier this year in an effort to reverse declining sales. Quarterly revenue for the chain fell to $817.8 million from $890.6 million, but still beat Wall Street forecasts. Ten analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had predicted $811.3 million in revenue. While sales at stores open at least a year dropped 4 percent, that was better than the 8 percent decline in the first quarter. For the period ended Aug. 1, the chain lost $810,000, or a penny a share. That compares with a profit of $12.9 million, or 17 cents a share, a year ago. Earnings, adjusted for nonrecurring costs, came to 12 cents a share. The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks was for a loss of 8 cents a share.A version of this brief appears in print on August 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Abercrombie & Fitch Results Surpass Analysts’ Estimates .
