PARIS — A British court on Thursday rejected Ryanair’s latest challenge to a ruling that it sell most of its 29 percent stake in the Aer Lingus, upholding a finding by regulators that the holding gives Europe’s largest low-cost airline undue influence over its smaller Irish rival.The ruling is Ryanair’s third legal defeat of the case in Britain, where the airline has vehemently challenged the authorities’ jurisdiction to impose restrictions on an Irish company. Nonetheless, Ryanair, which is based in Dublin, vowed to appeal the decision to Britain's highest court — on human rights grounds.“Ryanair will now appeal this case to the U.K. Supreme Court,” the airline said in a statement, “as it raises human rights issues of significant public importance, including the scope of protection offered to businesses by the right to property.”In the European Union, companies and other entities can petition the courts as "legal persons" if they believe they have been deprived of a right guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, including the right to a fair trial, the right to an effective legal remedy or the protection of private property.AdvertisementWhether the case will come before the court remains to be seen.Two weeks ago, the board of Aer Lingus recommended that Ryanair, the Irish government, which owns 25 percent of the airline, and other shareholders accept a proposed 1.4 billion-euro, or about $1.6 billion, takeover offer from International Airlines Group, or I.A.G., the parent company of British Airways and Iberia of Spain.AdvertisementAnalysts widely expect that I.A.G.’s offer for Aer Lingus will be successful and that a charm offensive in Dublin this week by Willie Walsh, the I.A.G. chief executive, will allay concerns among some Irish politicians about possible job losses and maintaining Aer Lingus’s crucial landing rights at Heathrow Airport near London.Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has let it be known that he would consider an offer for the company’s Aer Lingus shares “on its merits.” I.A.G.’s offer of €2.55 a share values Ryanair’s stake at just over €400 million, — roughly the amount the carrier spent acquiring its Aer Lingus shares from 2006 to 2008.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The authorities had determined that Ryanair’s large stake gave it sufficient influence to block certain strategic decisions by Aer Lingus management, including prospective mergers and partnerships, and could reduce competition on routes between Ireland and Britain.In its 28-page decision handed down on Thursday, the court failed to find fault with the tribunal’s earlier decision or to set aside the original order by the Competition and Market Authority, previously known as the Competition Commission, requiring Ryanair to slash its stake in Aer Lingus to just 5 percent.Ryanair’s shareholding is the legacy of three unsuccessful hostile takeover bids for Aer Lingus dating to 2006.The European Commission blocked Ryanair’s most recent, €700 million bid for Aer Lingus in 2013. European regulators found that a series of concessions offered by Ryanair, which included ceding dozens of Irish routes to competitors, did not go far enough to allay antitrust concerns.Ryanair has a separate appeal of the European Commission’s decision pending before the European Union’s second-highest tribunal, the General Court of the European Court of Justice, in Luxembourg, which would also become moot in the event of a successful I.A.G. bid for Aer Lingus.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
