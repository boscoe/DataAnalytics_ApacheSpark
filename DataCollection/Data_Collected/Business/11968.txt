James E. Staley, the new chief executive of Barclays, has already made some executive appointments, but picking a new capital-markets chief could give a clear sign about his strategy.Mr. King’s successor will have an unenviable task. Barclays does not rank among the top five investment banks globally for any trading business or capital-raising and advisory businesses tracked by Coalition, a data firm. Barclays, which withdrew from Asia to focus predominantly on its British market and the United States, will have to pick its spots. Settling for mediocrity is hardly going to help it hang on to or recruit top-notch investment bankers.The choice is essentially either to manage the business down or invest to build it. Neither is especially appealing. The Royal Bank of Scotland’s attempt at the former has been painful, and those in growth mode have endured a tough start to the year. Capital-raising volumes are down to multiyear lows.Mr. King, a former Citigroup banker who had been in the role for just three years, disagreed with Barclays’s former chief executive, Antony Jenkins, over plans to let the division wither.Mr. Staley is looking outside Barclays for Mr. King’s successor, IFR reported. Mr. Staley could raid his former employer, JPMorgan Chase, once again, after appointing former JPMorgan employees as his chief risk and chief operating officers.The hard part will be to work out how Barclays can find a way to differentiate itself in an industry that seems overstocked. Who Mr. Staley recruits may provide some insight.Dominic Elliott is a columnist at Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.Advertisement
