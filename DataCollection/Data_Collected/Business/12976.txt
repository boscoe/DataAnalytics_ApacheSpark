The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday that its services index rebounded to 54.5 in March from a two-year low of 53.4 in February. Anything above 50 signals growth. Business activity and new orders grew faster. A measure of export orders surged to the highest level in a year. A measure of employment in services registered 50.3 after contracting in February. Over all, “this is the best reading since December but still a far cry from the torrid figures seen through most of last year,” Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, wrote in a research report. The index averaged 57.2 last year. The institute, a trade group of purchasing managers, covers businesses that employ the vast majority of workers.Advertisement
