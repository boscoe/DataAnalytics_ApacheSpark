WASHINGTON —  Sales of previously owned homes in the United States rebounded modestly in February against the backdrop of a persistent shortage of properties on the market.Sluggish home sales are another sign that economic activity slowed sharply in the first quarter, and the current lack of inventory could undermine the spring selling season. Slow home sales could further diminish expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in June.“Part of the problem is that buyers don’t have a lot of choice. The Fed singled out housing as a sector that remains slow, and it still is, but that doesn’t mean the Fed shouldn’t hike rates,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that sales of used homes rose 1.2 percent last month to an annual rate of 4.88 million units. That failed to reverse January’s 4.9 percent drop.

That was the largest percentage gain since February 2014 and suggested that the pace of home price increases, which had been slowing after double-digit growth for much of 2013, appeared to be re-accelerating.AdvertisementThat is helping to sideline first-time buyers despite a firming labor market and government steps to ease credit conditions.First-time buyers accounted for 29 percent of transactions last month, well below the 40 to 45 percent share that economists and real estate agents say is required for a strong housing recovery.In February, the inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 1.6 percent, to 1.89 million units. Supply was, however, down 0.5 percent from a year ago.

A recent survey by the Realtors association showed homeowners on average staying in their homes for 10 years instead of the typical seven years.At February’s sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear houses from the market, unchanged for a second consecutive month. A supply of six months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.Apart from tight supply, sales last month were also constrained by harsh winter weather. Sales in the Northeast, which was hit by storms for much of the winter, tumbled 6.5 percent last month. Sales in the Midwest were unchanged. Sales rose in the South and West.A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Sales of Existing Homes Rose 1.2% in February.
