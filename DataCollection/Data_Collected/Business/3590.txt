The action expands a recall from last March that covered 1.3 million vehicles in the United States.The automaker is aware of one crash, but no injuries, related to a defect in the cars’ electronic power steering system, Alan Adler, a G.M. spokesman, wrote in an email.The newly recalled models are the 2006-7 Chevrolet Malibu and Malibu Maxx and the 2006-7 Pontiac G6, the automaker said in a report posted Saturday on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website. About 70,000 of the affected vehicles were in the United States, with the rest primarily in Canada and Mexico.G.M. said it was recalling the additional vehicles after an inquiry last April by Transport Canada, that country’s counterpart to the N.H.T.S.A.The Canadian regulators said some owners in Canada had complained of power steering failures on cars not included in the original recall, which covered vehicles in the United States and Canada. That prompted G.M. to investigate, and it concluded last month that there was more than one reason that the power steering might fail, so the problem covered more vehicles than expected.G.M. recalled the vehicles last March after years of trying to handle the problem quietly by sending technical service bulletins to dealers. Those bulletins warned dealers of the problem and told them how to fix it, but only if an owner complained, an investigation by The New York Times found. The owners were not notified, as they would have been in the event of a recall.Advertisement
