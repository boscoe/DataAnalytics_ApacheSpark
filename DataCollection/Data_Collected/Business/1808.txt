A sharp drop in the price of oil on Monday rattled investors and helped push stocks lower across several industries.Investors sold from the start of trading following a decision by OPEC last week not to cut production. Benchmark U.S. crude dropped nearly 6 percent, deepening its year-and-a-half plunge, and closed at its lowest level in nearly seven years. The losses were broad, with seven of the 10 industry sectors in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closing lower.As they have all year, oil drillers bore the brunt of the selling. Chevron and Exxon Mobil, both members of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, each fell nearly 3 percent.“There was a big hope that OPEC would announce a production cut, but it just didn’t happen,” said Steven Ricchiuto, Mizuho Securities chief economist. He added: “The whole world is facing excess supply as the global economy slows.”

                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            The shift in the U.S. to producing more oil has made the stock market more vulnerable to price swings in the commodity.In each of the past three quarters, as oil prices have tanked, earnings per share for energy companies in the S.&P. 500 have dropped more than 50 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ, a financial data provider. After Monday’s drop, their stocks are down 22 percent since the start of the year.Among other stocks making big moves, Chipotle Mexican Grill dropped $9.45, or 1.7 percent, to $551.75.
