Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief since September 2010, is among the witnesses expected to testify on April 27.The committee is holding its third hearing since December on soaring prices for prescription medicines, which are becoming unaffordable for many patients.The high prices for many drugs — some costing $100,000 or more for a course of treatment — also are straining the budgets of insurers and government health programs. The most expensive drugs are generally ones for cancer and rare diseases, but the trend includes many brand-name drugs that have had hefty price increases year after year, as well as old drugs with limited competition.Executives at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., Turing Pharmaceuticals and several other drugmakers have been buying up rights to those old drugs and then raising prices many times over what they had cost. Executives of the companies have been invited or subpoenaed to testify at hearings on the issue held by multiple Congressional committees.Valeant is in crisis, with three ongoing federal probes into its accounting and business practices, insurers demanding bigger discounts from its inflated list prices for many of its drugs and executives leaving. Activist investor Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management, one of Valeant’s largest shareholders, just took over two positions on its board of directors to try to salvage the fund’s investment in Valeant.Advertisement
