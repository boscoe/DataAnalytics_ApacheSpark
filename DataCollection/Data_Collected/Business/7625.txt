Citigroup, the banking behemoth plagued by years of uneven performance and regulatory issues, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations for a second consecutive quarter.The bank said on Thursday that second-quarter profit increased about 18 percent from the quarter a year ago, to $4.65 billion, after adjusting for quarterly changes in certain debt valuations. On a per-share adjusted basis, Citigroup earned $1.45, above analyst estimates of $1.34, according to Thomson Reuters.The better-than-expected earnings were driven partly by cutting expenses and improving credit quality — a formula that has helped buoy the results of other large banks in the second quarter. The bank was also helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate and an increase in the money that the bank releases from its reserves for loan losses — two numbers that can be hard for analysts to predict.The cost of credit, or the drag from soured consumer and commercial loans, fell 2 percent from a year ago. And Citi Holdings, which has essentially functioned as the company’s so-called bad bank, housing once-troubled assets, recorded another quarterly profit.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            “It was a solid quarter over all, and we continued to make good progress towards our strategic and execution priorities,” Michael L. Corbat, Citi’s chief executive, told analysts in a conference call Thursday morning.AdvertisementCitigroup’s shares surged 3.8 percent to close at $58.59 on Thursday, one of the largest daily percent increases for the bank in recent months.AdvertisementThe results are a vindication of sorts for Mr. Corbat and his strategy for Citigroup, which struggled through near collapse after the financial crisis and was slow to regain its footing. Since taking the helm in October 2012, Mr. Corbat has focused on reducing the bank’s size and complexity and cutting expenses. It has been selling off bank branches and entire business units like OneMain Financial, a subprime consumer lender.Excluding adjusting for the debt valuations, Citigroup reported a profit of $4.8 billion, or $1.51 a share.The bank generated about $19.2 billion in revenue, down slightly from a year ago, but higher than the $19.1 billion that analysts had estimated.One of the weaker spots was investment banking revenue, which came in at $1.3 billion, down 4 percent from last year, mostly because of less underwriting activity.Across the banking industry, results in the second quarter have been mixed. Bank of America, another large bank that had struggled to perform consistently, easily surpassed analysts’ expectations in the second quarter. But profits at Wells Fargo, typically one of the best-performing banks, slipped.There are questions about the fundamental ability of the banks to increase their revenue as they face low interest rates and volatile trading markets. Citi said revenue from its equities group, as well as its fixed income, currencies and commodities trading business — once dependable profit centers — were largely flat from a year ago. Still, Citigroup’s trading results were better than those at Goldman Sachs, the gold standard for Wall Street.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Citigroup’s litigation costs dropped sharply from a year ago, a time when the bank was embroiled in negotiations to settle a costly lawsuit by the Justice Department over its role in the sale of faulty mortgage-backed securities.Even after excluding the decrease in litigation costs, other expenses declined across the bank’s operations. One closely watched measure, the bank’s expenses as a percent of revenue — known as the efficiency ratio — was 56 percent for the first half of the year.By comparison, Wells Fargo, a bank known for its expense management, reported an efficiency ratio of 58.5 percent in the second quarter.A version of this article appears in print on July 17, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Profit Grows at Citigroup as Expenses Dwindle.
