PARIS — Crédit Agricole, one of France’s largest banks, on Wednesday reported quarterly profit that beat market expectations, helped by a resurgence in its investment banking activities and a sharp reduction in its provisions against loan losses.The bank, based in Paris, posted net income of 697 million euros, or about $795 million, in its fourth quarter, up 13 percent from the same period in 2013. Revenue rose 2 percent to €3.9 billion. Analysts had been expecting net profit of around €600 million.The bank also said it hoped soon to name a successor to its chief executive, Jean-Paul Chifflet, who retires in May.The results “show sustained commercial momentum in most of our business lines, strict control over costs and a sharp decrease in the cost of risk,” Bernard Delpit, the bank’s chief financial officer, said in a webcast interview.Mr. Delpit said there had been “good resilience” in Crédit Agricole’s mainstay French retail banking business, though interest margins were under pressure from the record low interest rates in Europe.The corporate and investment banking business posted profit of €243 million, up ninefold from the €27 million it posted a year earlier.Crédit Agricole also said it had reduced the amount of money it had set aside against possible soured loans. Its so-called cost of risk, which includes such provisions, fell 42 percent in the fourth quarter, to €499 million. A year earlier, the amount of such provisions had soared as it prepared for the European Central Bank’s examination of its loan books, a test it passed easily.For all of 2014, the bank posted net income of €2.3 billion, down 6.8 percent. Without one-time items, including the €708 million write-down of its investment in the failed Portuguese lender Banco Espírito Santo, net income would have been sharply higher, at €3.4 billion, it said. Revenue came in at €15.9 billion, up 1.1 percent.Crédit Agricole said it had worked over the year to increase its financial strength, partly by reinvesting dividends and accumulated earnings. That strategy allowed it to increase its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its ability to absorb financial shocks, to 10.4 percent at the end of December, up 1.9 percentage points from a year earlier.Shares of Crédit Agricole rose 4.1 percent in early trading in Paris, giving the bank a market value of about €31 billion.
