Avon Products is in talks with investment firms about selling a stake in itself, potentially bringing in a partner to help the cosmetics maker turn itself around, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.The company has discussed bringing in a private equity firm for what is known on Wall Street as a private investment in public equity, or PIPE. Such a move is essentially a negotiated stake sale by a publicly traded company.Bids are expected within the next several weeks, though this person cautioned that Avon was exploring other options and might choose not to pursue a PIPE.The company — best-known for its army of door-to-door sales representatives — managed to fend off an unwanted takeover bid by a cosmetics rival, Coty, three years ago. But it has failed to reverse nearly five years of falling sales and almost four years of losses.AdvertisementAvon’s share price has tumbled nearly 87 percent over the last five years, and its stock closed on Thursday at $4.10. That values the company at just under $2 billion.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
