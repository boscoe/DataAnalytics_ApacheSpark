An arbitrator overseeing a gender discrimination case against Sterling Jewelers, parent of 12 chains in the United States including Kay Jewelers, has certified a class of thousands of women to proceed to trial.Women in the class may pursue a claim challenging Sterling’s pay and promotion practices, the arbitrator, Kathleen A. Roberts, a retired United States magistrate judge at the dispute resolution company JAMS, said in a ruling Monday night.The 12 women who brought the suit did not win in their effort to proceed with claims that Sterling had intentionally discriminated against women, which could have exposed Sterling to punitive damages.A Sterling spokesman, David Bouffard, said, “The arbitrator’s rejection of the monetary class-action claim is consistent with Sterling’s long-held position that Sterling has had strong anti-discrimination policies for decades that include disciplinary action or termination for team members who have violated them.”AdvertisementHe added that the company continued to contest the class-action claim and that in denying class claims for monetary damages, “the arbitrator acknowledged the significant representation of women in management positions.” He also called into question whether there was a culture of discrimination at Sterling.AdvertisementIn her ruling, the judge cited an internal company memo from 2006 that said female hourly sales employees made 40 cents less an hour than their male counterparts on average, adding up to more than seven million annual affected hours. A memo the next year said that men at Sterling’s stores, which include Jared the Galleria of Jewelry, were paid 12.5 percent more base pay than women and that women at the management level were getting higher performance scores but receiving lower pay increases than men.Joseph Sellers, a lawyer for the women, said that if his clients were able to prove that Sterling’s conduct was unlawful, they would have the opportunity to pursue individual claims, “and to change the practices they’re challenging.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Their evidence showed bias and stereotyping in the highest levels of the company, the judge wrote.Women in some cases were expected to undress publicly at company events and “accede to sexual overtures,” the judge wrote. She cited evidence of “references to women in sexual and vulgar ways, groping and grabbing women” and soliciting sexual relations, sometimes as a quid pro quo for job benefits.She said that for the most part, Sterling had not sought to rebut the evidence of improper sexual conduct.She was critical, however, of one of the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses for having drawn conclusions about Sterling’s corporate culture that were “not supported by a reliable methodology” recognized in the professional literature in his field.In denying the claims of intentional discrimination, Judge Roberts relied on the Supreme Court ruling in Walmart v. Dukes, a gender discrimination case in which the court said the women did not have enough in common to constitute a class. Although the Sterling women presented evidence that “may be in some respects stronger” than that of the Walmart women, the judge said it fell short of demonstrating “significant proof that Sterling operated under a general policy of discrimination.”A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Gender Bias Case Against Sterling Jewelers Can Proceed.
