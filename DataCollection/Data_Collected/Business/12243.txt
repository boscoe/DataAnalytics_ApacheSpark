James Staley, chief executive of the British bank, said that cutting Barclay's stake in its African business and its dividend were very painful, but necessary decisions.LONDON — The British bank Barclays said on Tuesday that it planned to cut its stake in its African business, slash its dividend and focus its strategy around two divisions: its British consumer bank and its corporate and investment bank.The strategy shift signals the latest change by James E. Staley, who became the lender’s chief executive in December, as he looks to turn around its operations and move away from a plan outlined by his predecessor two years ago.In the years since the financial crisis, costly new regulations and a series of embarrassing investigations have weighed on the bank’s results, and the lender has since sought to change its culture and improve its profitability.Barclays on Tuesday also reported a net loss in 2015 of 394 million pounds, or about $547 million, compared with a loss of £174 million in 2014. The results were worse than analysts had expected.AdvertisementShares of Barclays declined as much as 11 percent in early trading in London on Tuesday, and ended the day down 8 percent.AdvertisementThe African business was considered one of four pillars of the bank’s strategy, alongside its credit card and its consumer and investment banking operations, under Antony Jenkins, who was ousted as chief executive in July.But on Tuesday, Barclays said it planned to sell down its 62.3 percent interest in Barclays Africa Group over the next two to three years, reducing it so it would no longer have a controlling stake and would be allowed to remove “it from an accounting and regulatory perspective.”During a conference call with journalists, Mr. Staley said that Barclays would be “pleased” to continue to hold a minority stake in the African business. It has operated in the region for more than 100 years.“There are great franchises there; it’s a dynamic continent,” Mr. Staley said. “Really, the decision to sell down is driven by the fact that the current regulations mean we essentially have to respond as if we own 100 percent of Barclays Africa.”In deciding to cut its stake in Barclays Africa Group, the lender cited several challenges to owning the business, including regulatory and capital requirements as well as the reach of a British tax, known as a bank levy.The levy taxes banks based in Britain on their worldwide balance sheet, but international competitors are taxed only on their businesses in Britain.The African business is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and holds majority stakes in banks in 10 countries, with offices in two others.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            Separately, Barclays said in its annual report that Absa Bank, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa Group, had identified potentially fraudulent activity by some customers using “import advance payments” in currency transfers from South Africa to accounts in Asia, Europe and the United States.AdvertisementSince joining the bank, Mr. Staley, who is known as Jes, has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce its costs and accelerate its turnaround.He began a hiring freeze, resulting in a reduction of an additional 5,700 jobs, and Barclays has agreed to sell its retail banking business in Italy and its  risk analytics and index solutions business.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In May 2014, the bank had announced plans to cut as many as 19,000 jobs by the end of this year.On Tuesday, Mr. Staley said that he expected the bank’s work force to decrease further as the lender accelerates a wind-down of businesses and product lines it considers noncore.Over the next two years, the bank said that it also planned to exit its Egypt and Zimbabwe businesses, which are not owned by Barclays Africa Group, to close its card businesses in Southern Europe and to exit its Asian wealth business.“If we can wind down the assets at anywhere near the pace that we’ve done in the first two years, we should be in a very good position,” Mr. Staley said.Barclays also said it intended to reduce its dividend in 2016 and in 2017 to 3 pence a share as it accelerates its rundown of its noncore operations and expects to pay out “a significant proportion of earnings in dividends to shareholders over time.”Mr. Staley spent more than 30 years at JPMorgan Chase, serving as the top executive in its investment banking and asset management units.AdvertisementSince joining Barclays, he has announced plans to hire two JPMorgan veterans for its management team this year, and said that Thomas King, the American in charge of its investment banking business, would retire this month. The investment bank would report to Mr. Staley until a successor is named, he said.Barclays, like many of its British competitors, is preparing to wall off its British retail-banking business from its riskier investment banking operations in a process known as ring-fencing. British banks are required to do so by 2019.The full-year loss reported on Tuesday was driven in part by Barclays’ setting aside an additional £1.45 billion in provisions in the fourth quarter to compensate customers who were improperly sold payment protection insurance.The insurance product was sold to customers taking out mortgages, applying for credit cards or seeking other loans. It has cost British banks billions of dollars, as they were ordered to compensate customers who filed complaints.A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Barclays, Posting Loss, Plans  to Reduce Business in Africa.
