General Motors will stop making the gas-electric hybrid Chevrolet Volt for four weeks in June and July because of slow sales and to deal with a change to an all-new version of the car. The company says the Detroit-Hamtramck plant that makes the Volt and four other cars will probably stay open through the summer despite plans for the Volt. The factory is also undergoing construction so it can build a new full-size Cadillac CT6 and the 2016 Volt starting late in the summer. Sales of electric and hybrid cars have slowed this year, largely because of low gasoline prices. Through March, G.M. sold only 1,874 Volts, down 48 percent from a year ago.A version of this brief appears in print on April 10, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: G.M. to Suspend Making Chevy Volts for 4 Weeks.
