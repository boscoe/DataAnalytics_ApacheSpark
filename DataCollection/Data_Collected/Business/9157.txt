Workers at an auto parts plant in northeast Alabama cited issues such as wage caps and growing use of temporary workers in their vote to join a labor union. Employees at the plant in Piedmont, owned by the Commercial Vehicle Group, voted Wednesday to join the United Auto Workers. The plant makes seats for large commercial trucks. Workers said in a release that they voted 89-45 to join the union because of high health care costs in addition to pay issues and wider use of temps who don’t qualify for benefits. The company’s chief human resources officer, Laura Macias, said in an emailed statement that officials don’t believe union representation is in the best interest of employees, but officials respect workers’ rights to vote.A version of this brief appears in print on September 24, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Workers at Alabama Plant Vote to Join the U.A.W.
