LOOKING BACK ON A YEAR OF DEALS  |  The holidays are over, but a final toast is still in order. First, let’s raise a glass to the deal makers of 2014. Indeed, the year was one of the best for mergers and acquisitions since the passing of the financial crisis, Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook. Some 40,298 transactions ‒ worth nearly $3.5 trillion ‒ were announced worldwide in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. It was the biggest year in deals since 2007. Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom led the global M.&A. tables for financial and legal advising.Sure, debt financing was cheap and stock prices were climbing. But perhaps the biggest change, deal makers say, is that corporate boards and management teams realized that their ability to expand their companies on their own had become more difficult. And with some semblance of predictability in the markets, boards now feel more comfortable taking the plunge, Mr. de la Merced writes. The busiest sectors for the year have been the oil and gas industry and the pharmaceuticals industry. But the biggest deals of the year, including the assumption of debt, have been takeovers in the telecommunications industry, including Comcast’s $45 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Cable.“The question now is whether the confluence of factors that enabled the merger revival will carry over into 2015,” Mr. de la Merced writes. 

STOCK MARKETS END ON A HIGH NOTE  |  The stock markets also deserve a hand. On Wednesday, the last day of trading in 2014, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed with a gain of 11.39 percent for the year ‒ 13.68 percent when reinvested dividends are included, DealBook’s Peter Eavis reports. It was the third-consecutive year that the market benchmark has risen by more than 10 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 7.52 percent for 2014, while the Nasdaq composite index ended up 13.4 percent. 
But can the party in American stocks continue in 2015? “We don’t see a lot on the horizon that could derail the U.S. market in particular,” said Raymond Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital. The skeptics, however, point to other measures. A measure of valuation that Warren E. Buffett has cited, for example, is flashing a warning sign. And profits may not be as strong as they look. In recent years, companies have spent large amounts of cash buying back their shares, which ultimately bolsters its earnings per share, a measure of profitability that investors favor.



ON THE AGENDA  |  The Markit purchasing managers’ manufacturing index comes out at 9:45 a.m. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing composite index is released at 10 a.m. Data on construction spending comes out at 10 a.m.



TOASTING AND ROASTING  |  Andrew Ross Sorkin brings it home with his annual DealBook “Closing Dinner.” Who’s on the guest list? Among others, Jack Ma of Alibaba and Jeff Bezos of Amazon are at table No. 8, as is Michael Pietsch, the chief executive of the publisher Hachette. There’s also Bill Gross, the bond king and co-founder of Pimco, who was ousted from his own firm. Senator Elizabeth Warren is there, and so are Rupert Murdoch and Jeff Bewkes of Time Warner. And don’t forget the activist investors, who have moved to the front of the room this year.
