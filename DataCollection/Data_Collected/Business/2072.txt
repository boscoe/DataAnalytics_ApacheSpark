Excluding those categories results in the so-called core C.P.I. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week that the core C.P.I. increased 2 percent over the last year, compared with 1 percent for the PNC’s Christmas gift index.Despite the modest run-up for the gifts, the price tag would still be a hefty $34,131, an increase of $198 from last year.“Low commodity prices and a decline in energy prices this year are keeping consumer prices down,” said James P. Dunigan, managing executive for investments at PNC.While the cost of the partridge’s perch, the famous pear tree, increased only 1.2 percent, to $190 this year, checking the partridge off the gift list would be significantly more expensive than last year. At $25, it would cost 25 percent more than in 2014, because the game birds are becoming popular among foodies, according to PNC’s research. Higher grain prices pushed up the cost of the two turtle doves in the English Christmas carol by 11.5 percent, to $290.Underscoring the negligible evidence of inflation, this was the second year that the prices of the gifts and services, perhaps whimsical and extravagant by today’s standards, did not rise much, most likely because of the slow economic recovery. Last year, the outlay for the gift extravaganza rose only 0.8 percent from 2013.Flat prices, Mr. Dunigan said, “mean true loves can have their goose and better afford the gas to roast it, too.”Among the fowl, the trumpeter swans, celebrated in the carol as “seven swans-a-swimming” remained stable at $1,875 apiece, after wide swings in demand over the decades prompted volatile prices.The price of the five gold rings listed in the song stayed constant, at $750 total, the same as the last two years even though gold commodity prices have fluctuated, keeping the gift an affordable option for last-minute shoppers.Services, and there are many in the verses of this song from an era of cheap workers, also did not get a lift this year. The costs of nine ladies dancing, at $7,553; 11 pipers piping, at $2,635; and 12 drummers drumming, at $2,855, have not budged in the last two years, in keeping with slow economic growth.The only unskilled labor, the eight maids-a-milking, also costs the same, $58, because there has been no wage increase since the federal minimum wage was raised in 2009.The only workers to catch a break were the 10 lords-a-leaping, whose cost was up 3 percent, to $5,509, from $5,348, according to information supplied by the Pennsylvania Ballet and the modern dance group Philadanco.To catch the fancy of people who may not be interested in the economy’s more prosaic machinations, PNC began collecting the data annually from sources as varied as bird hatcheries, jewelers and dance troupes. Over the decades, PNC has added educational materials for teachers to promote interest among students in factors like labor costs and inflation that affect the current economy.Putting a more modern twist on acquiring the 12 goods and services, the index also tracks how much it would cost to skip shopping in retail stores, and instead order the birds and other items online. Shipping swans and other unruly fowl is not cheap. Relying on e-commerce to assemble and deliver gifts would drive up the price by an additional $9,496 this year, for a grand total of $43,627.But those with mansions equipped with aviaries, barnyards and accommodations for entertainers can shell out much more for the full complement of gifts in the repeated verses of the song — 364 in all.That total would be $155,407, not far off the $150,000 that the Neiman Marcus 2015 holiday catalog of “fantasy gifts” charges for a 121-horsepower motorcycle designed by the actor Keanu Reeves (and a two-day chopper ride along the California coast).Either way, it would be a memorable gift package for the loved one who has everything.Advertisement
