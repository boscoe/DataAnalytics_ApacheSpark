You may have free tuna waiting for you.People who bought certain varieties of StarKist tuna could be eligible for $25 in cash or $50 worth of tuna, after the settlement of a class-action lawsuit. StarKist was accused of underfilling its five-ounce tuna cans. It denies any wrongdoing.Consumers are eligible if they bought any one of four varieties between February 2009 and October 2014: StarKist Chunk Light Tuna in Water, StarKist Chunk Light Tuna in Oil, StarKist Solid White Tuna in Water and StarKist Solid White Tuna in Oil.The plaintiff, Patrick Hendricks, had independent testing done on the cans, determining that they had as much as 17.3 percent less tuna than the federally mandated minimum. StarKist must pay up to $8 million in cash and $4 million in food vouchers as part of the settlement in United States District Court in Northern California.Consumers can file claims for the cash or tuna at tunalawsuit.com.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
