The sweeping consent order also requires the company to buy back some recalled vehicles and submit to outside oversight of its safety practices.In a statement, the automaker acknowledged the safety violations and agreed to the record penalties.“We also accept the resulting consequences with renewed resolve to improve our handling of recalls and re-establish the trust our customers place in us,” the company said.The agency said the civil penalty was broken down into a cash penalty of $70 million, and an agreement that Fiat Chrysler would spend at least $20 million on meeting performance requirements detailed in the consent order. An additional penalty of $15 million will be assessed on the company if an independent monitor, who has yet to be announced, discovers further violations of safety laws or the consent order.Under the order, Fiat Chrysler is required to buy back as many as 500,000 vehicles with defective suspensions that can cause drivers to lose control. Also, owners of more than one million Jeeps with rear-mounted gas tanks that are prone to fires will be given an opportunity to trade in their vehicles at rates above market value.Mark R. Rosekind, who took over as the administrator of the highway safety agency last December, said the heavy fine was a direct result of Fiat Chrysler’s prolonged failures to fix recalled models.“Fiat Chrysler’s pattern of poor performance put millions of its customers, and the driving public, at risk,” he said.The agency is authorized to impose a maximum fine of $35 million for an individual recall that is not completed in a timely manner.The government’s action is the latest in a series of moves by Mr. Rosekind to put more pressure on automakers to fix defective vehicles.“We need a proactive safety culture in this country,” he told reporters at a recent briefing in Detroit.The agency has come under harsh criticism in Congress and by the Transportation Department’s inspector general for lax enforcement of auto safety regulations.The agency is overhauling its internal operations, as well as stepping up its investigations of individual car companies.The moves, Mr. Rosekind said, were set off by the revelation last year that General Motors had failed for a decade to recall about 2.6 million small cars with faulty ignition switches that could suddenly cut engine power and disable airbags. At least 124 deaths have been tied to the defect.“When you have a horrible tragedy, honestly, that’s what triggers big change,” he said.In Fiat Chrysler’s case, this month the government took the unusual step of holding a public hearing to focus on 23 separate recalls that date back to 2009. At the hearing, federal officials said the company had repeatedly failed to notify consumers of recalls and to complete repairs in a timely fashion.The company’s top safety executive, Scott Kunselman, admitted the automaker had made “mistakes and missteps” in conducting recalls. “The agency has raised some legitimate questions,” he said at the hearing on July 2.The automaker has started several new recalls since the hearing, including one on Friday that covered 1.4 million vehicles vulnerable to computer hackers.The agency did not specify all the performance requirements in the consent order, but Mr. Foxx and Mr. Rosekind are expected to provide more details in a conference call on Monday.The consent order calls for unusually close oversight of Fiat Chrysler’s safety practices over the next three years, the agency said. An independent monitor approved by the highway safety agency will “assess, track and report the company’s recall performance” during that period.One auto safety advocate said on Sunday that the financial penalties imposed on Fiat Chrysler should have been higher, given the scope of the automaker’s violations.“The $105 million fine shows the need for an uncapped penalty,” said Clarence Ditlow, an official of the Center for Auto Safety who first petitioned the government to investigate the rear-mounted fuel tanks in Jeeps.Fiat Chrysler is currently recalling 1.59 million Jeeps equipped with the rear-mounted gas tanks, which can catch on fire in high-speed collisions.The company is installing trailer hitches on the affected Jeeps to soften the impact of rear-end collisions. But the rate of repairs in that recall has been slow, government investigators say.Under the consent order, Jeep owners will have the option to trade in a vehicle for above market value or receive an unspecified payment from Fiat Chrysler to install a trailer hitch.It is unclear whether the record penalties will have an impact on Fiat Chrysler in the marketplace.The company was formed last year by the merger of the Italian automaker Fiat and Chrysler, the smallest of Detroit’s car companies, which needed bankruptcy and a government bailout to survive the last recession.Fiat Chrysler’s sales in the United States have consistently outperformed the rest of the industry in recent years. In the first six months of this year, the company’s sales rose 6.1 percent from the same period in 2014, compared with a 4.4 percent increase for the overall market.Advertisement
