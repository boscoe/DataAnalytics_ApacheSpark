Berkowitz, to its board on Thursday after he signaled that he wanted to play a more active role in trying to turn around the retailer. Also on Thursday, Sears announced a $580 million loss for the fourth quarter. While the loss was in line with expectations, it underlined the challenges facing the company, which has now lost more than $8 billion over the last five years. For Sears, which owns the Sears department store and the Kmart discount chain, the quarterly loss included a $180 million noncash charge to write down the value of the Sears trade name. Total revenue fell 9.8 percent to $7.3 billion, partly because of the closing of more than 50 stores.Advertisement
