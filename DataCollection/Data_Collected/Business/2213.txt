Macy’s is recalling two Martha Stewart frying pans after customers said metal discs popped off the pans and caused bruises, burns and welts. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Tuesday that there were seven reports of metal discs flying off the frying pans and three reports of injuries. The metal discs cover the rivets that attach the pan to the handle. The recall covers about 120,000 8-inch and 10-inch frying pans that were sold as part of a Martha Stewart Collection 10-piece stainless steel cookware set. The sets cost about $170 and were sold at Macy’s stores and its website for four years until September. The Martha Stewart brand was bought by the brand management company Sequential Brands Group this month.A version of this brief appears in print on December 30, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Martha Stewart Skillets Are Recalled by Macy’s.
