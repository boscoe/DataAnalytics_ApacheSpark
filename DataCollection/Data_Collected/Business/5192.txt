AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWASHINGTON â€” Retail sales rose in March for the first time since November as consumers stepped up purchases of automobiles and other goods, suggesting that a sharp slowdown in American economic growth in the first quarter was temporary.The Commerce Department's report was fairly sturdy, and other data released on Tuesday showed that producer inflation crept up last month."A rebound in retail sales in March provides evidence that the U.S. economy is pulling out of a soft patch seen at the start of the year," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London.Retail sales increased 0.9 percent in March. That was the largest gain since the same month last year and snapped a three-month streak of declines that had been attributed to harsh winter weather.Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.3 percent, after dropping 0.2 percent in February.The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists shrugged off the mildness of the rebound, saying it reflected the lingering effects of cold weather.With savings at their highest level in just over two years, thanks to a tightening labor market and cheaper gasoline, there is great potential for consumers to bolster spending in the months ahead and cushion the economy against the strong dollar.Data on trade, consumer spending, manufacturing and home building have suggested the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter.But economists could raise their estimates after a second report on Tuesday from the Commerce Department, which showed that retail inventories excluding automobiles rose 0.5 percent in February after gaining 0.2 percent in the previous month.In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for final demand increased 0.2 percent last month; rising prices for goods accounted for more than half of the increase. The index declined 0.5 percent in February.In the 12 months through March, producer prices fell 0.8 percent, the biggest year-on-year decline since the revamped series started in 2009. Producer prices slid 0.6 percent in February.Low inflation and signs of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter have prompted most economists to push back their expectations for the first Federal Reserve rate increase to either September or October, rather than June. Others say they believe the central bank will not tighten monetary policy until 2016.A crucial measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged in February. The core Producer Price Index was up 0.8 percent in the 12 months through March.Retail sales last month were buoyed by a 2.7 percent rise in automobile sales, the biggest increase since March 2014. Sales at clothing stores increased 1.2 percent.Receipts at building material and garden equipment stores advanced 2.1 percent, the largest rise since July 2013.There were also increases in sales at furniture stores, restaurants and bars, and sporting goods and hobby shops. However, sales at electronics and appliance stores slipped, as did receipts at online stores.Advertisement
