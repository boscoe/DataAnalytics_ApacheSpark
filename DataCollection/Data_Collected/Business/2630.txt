CreditGretchen Ertl for The New York Times        John Hamel doesn’t look like someone who would go to a nail salon, let alone tell you what nail colors are in vogue or when women are most likely to book a pedicure. Yet over the last seven years, Mr. Hamel and his business partners have learned a lot about the industry — maybe too much.“Turns out the jets are the worst,” said Mr. Hamel, a general partner at Cue Ball, a Boston-based investment firm, referring to the foot tubs used in pedicures. “There is no way to really clean those things.” Other offenses include reusing tools that aren’t properly sterilized and double-dipping swabs used to wax, well, just about anywhere.Anyone who frequents the typical neighborhood nail salon may conclude that the industry needs a makeover. Such things as scheduling (“Wait five minutes”), fluorescent lighting, smelly acrylics and questionable hygiene can undermine the experience. Still, demand for quick and inexpensive nail and beauty treatments is strong.Enter an unlikely team of management specialists, who in 2007 began to reinvent the nail salon by applying best practices borrowed from other industries. They have trademarked names and applications for nail shapes, developed a line of polish and adopted hospital-grade hygiene practices. They use sophisticated point-of-sales systems and even have a full-time data scientist to better predict how the weather, time of day and other variables affect demand.AdvertisementTheir company, MiniLuxe, now has eight locations in the Boston area and, having just raised $23 million in venture capital, is preparing to expand nationally. The company plans to open eight salons this year, including in and around Dallas.AdvertisementAnd just as Starbucks helped give rise to new coffee drinkers, MiniLuxe thinks its effort to reimagine nail salons, even with higher prices, can create new demand. “There was a time when people couldn’t imagine paying $4 for coffee,” said Sue Thirlwall, a former chief brand officer for Baskin-Robbins who joined MiniLuxe as chief executive in 2011.The idea to reshape the nail business wasn’t born out of Mr. Hamel’s frustrations. Until 2007, he’d never had a manicure or pedicure. Rather, the idea started with a challenge from Cue Ball’s chief executive, Tony Tjan, to find a highly fragmented industry that could do what Starbucks did for the coffee shop: use a combination of smart design, systems and company culture to create a following.The Cue Ball partners had been looking at several industries when Mr. Hamel noticed just how many nail salons occupied the strip malls near his home north of Boston. “After seeing five in a row,” he said, “I thought, ‘This is it.’ ”Mr. Hamel proposed the idea to his partners, who saw the potential to create a place in an industry that, by their estimates, comprises 65,000 salons in the United States, with a collective $10 billion in annual sales.The Cue Ball general partners have experience developing and scaling businesses. Richard Harrington, Cue Ball’s chairman, was the chief executive of the Thomson Corporation (now Thomson Reuters) from 1997 to 2008, a period in which it grew into one of the world’s largest media companies. Mr. Hamel was a director of business intelligence for the business and technology consulting firm Answerthink, and Mr. Tjan founded the Internet services pioneer Zefer and was vice chairman at the Parthenon Group, a Boston-based consultancy.They are joined by Mats Lederhausen, who was managing director of McDonald’s Ventures and oversaw investments in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Boston Market, Pret a Manger and Redbox. “There was no systems approach to nails,” Mr. Lederhausen said. “We thought this was a good idea that we could build systems around and replicate.”The company started with a single salon in Boston, figuring if it could show proof of concept in a city with a short sandal season, they just might be onto something.AdvertisementThe first thing they tackled was hygiene. Nail salons are regulated by the states, but Mr. Tjan says the standards are often inadequate and difficult to enforce. New York, for example, has 27 inspectors for nearly 5,000 salons. Borrowing practices from the medical and dental industries, MiniLuxe uses single-use tools when feasible and sends everything else through in-house clean labs with ultrasonic debris removers and hospital-grade autoclave sterilizers. There are no jets in the foot tubs at MiniLuxe salons. In addition to popular brands, MiniLuxe has its own line of nearly toxin-free polish, introduced last year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

MiniLuxe has roughly 200 part- and full-time employees, all of whom have company health insurance, paid time off, profit-sharing and a company 401(k). “You can’t create affinity for consumers if you do not create affinity for employees,” Mr. Lederhausen said.Scheduling for businesses with walk-in services is notoriously difficult. There are days when a salon doesn’t have enough nail technicians to keep up with demand, and others when technicians sit idle. As one solution, MiniLuxe hired a data scientist to predict what factors drove demand. Not surprisingly, the weather is a big component for the Boston salons. MiniLuxe salons have a 5 percent increase in traffic for every 10-degree increase in temperature, but rain doesn’t slow business.To further help with scheduling and improve the service, MiniLuxe offers 24/7 online booking and is introducing a mobile app that will, among other things, buzz users’ phones when it’s their turn for a service. It is also testing apps that give employees more information about scheduling and client preferences.MiniLuxe has also been strategic about location. It uses data from its stores to map out suitable spots, but Mr. Hamel’s original strategy is one that anyone can replicate. “I went online and looked up the address of every Starbucks in Massachusetts and then looked at the number of nail salons within a half-mile to two-mile radius,” he said. “Whichever had the most density is where I looked for space.”Joseph Michelli, a consultant who specializes in customer experience and has written two books on Starbucks, agreed that MiniLuxe seemed to be adapting the coffee company’s playbook to create a cult following. “Starbucks has inspired lots of businesses to create a value proposition and build an experience around it,” he said. And like Starbucks, the MiniLuxe founders have devised “their own language, their own product lines,” he said. “All of that fits the Starbucks model.”At $20 for a manicure and $39 for a pedicure, MiniLuxe charges slightly more than a typical strip-mall nail salon, but less than a spa for comparable services.The chain’s popularity around Boston indicates the demand for this middle ground. “During peak periods, we’re turning away hundreds of clients a month,” Mr. Tjan said.As it expands, MiniLuxe will need to take care not to lose sight of its original goals, said Sanjay Khosla, a senior fellow at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and co-author of “Fewer, Bigger, Bolder: From Mindless Expansion to Focused Growth” (Penguin Group).“That’s where Starbucks went wrong,” he said. “They started measuring on speed of service rather than the quality of coffee, and the execution got shoddy.”A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Rethinking the Nail Salon by Glancing at the Starbucks Model.
