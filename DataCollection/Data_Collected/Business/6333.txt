Verizon Communications may have reached a deal with AOL, but others were in the hunt as well.In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, AOL disclosed that three other suitors had emerged expressing interest in a potential transaction before the Internet company ultimately chose to sell itself to Verizon for $4.4 billion.According to the filing, Verizon first reached out to AOL executives last June to discuss potential partnership opportunities, leading to talks at Allen & Company’s annual media mogul conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that year.But through early December, the discussions had centered on potential joint ventures or partnerships instead of an outright takeover of AOL. Indeed, Verizon’s chief executive, Lowell McAdam, said that his company “had no interest” in buying control of the potential partner, according to the filing.On Dec. 9, however, AOL representatives and their bankers at Allen & Company held preliminary discussions with an unnamed suitor (known as Company A) about a possible acquisition of some or all of the company.
                AOL, the one-time king of media, is a shadow of its former self. Its deal for Time Warner is regarded as the high-water mark of the dot-com bubble.            Within a matter of days, the AOL board authorized the company’s chief executive, Tim Armstrong, and his management team to begin exploring “strategic alternatives” — meaning a potential sale.AdvertisementBy January, the company was still negotiating a potential joint venture with Verizon, centered on Internet-based video. During that whole time, the telecommunications behemoth reiterated that it wasn’t interested in pursuing a full-on acquisition.AdvertisementWork on that Verizon partnership continued, even as representatives of a second suitor, Company B, reached out to AOL on Feb. 26 for more information about its platforms and brands businesses.By March, an unnamed private equity firm known only as Company C expressed interest in buying some of AOL’s assets as well.AOL videos are among the most popular online, ranking behind Google and Facebook in terms of viewership. AOL’s growth advantage is largely seen in new technology to serve mobile video and advertising.The Huffington Post is one of the most popular media properties online, and Tim Armstrong, AOL’s chief, has said it brings in hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue.In the first quarter of the year, AOL had more than 2 million dial-up Internet subscribers, a group that brought in more than $40 million in revenue a month.Later that month, AOL signed confidentiality agreements with both Company B and Company C, letting the suitors conduct due diligence. In April, Company A signed a nondisclosure agreement as well.By April, both Company A and Company B broke off talks, with representatives of each saying they were uninterested in moving forward after their initial review. But Verizon had changed its tune, with Mr. McAdam suggesting on April 8 that he could be persuaded to consider an acquisition after all.That switch sent AOL and its bankers and lawyers off to work on a potential sale of the whole company. Company C still hung around the hoop, however, having assembled a consortium that presented a proposal on May 4 to buy some of AOL’s businesses. The filing on Tuesday makes no further mention of that offer.On May 11, AOL’s board formally voted to approve a sale to Verizon at $50 a share — up from an initial bid of $47 a share, though Verizon refused to go higher than what it called its final offer.So who were the mystery bidders? It’s unclear, though DealBook previously reported that both the German media company Axel Springer and the private equity firm General Atlantic had expressed interest in acquiring some of AOL’s operations.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
