The deal’s collapse immediately set off a new round of speculation about whether Time Warner Cable would seek out another buyer, pursue an acquisition of its own or remain independent.Robert D. Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s chief executive, said in a conference call that he was not going to respond to questions about mergers and acquisitions but that the company was seeking the option that would maximize shareholder value.“While the termination of our merger with Comcast and speculation of our other M&A continue to grab most of the headlines, this morning I’d like to focus on the fundamental strength of our business,” he said. “In short, I believe we are as well positioned for the future as any company in our industry. To be blunt, that was not the case when we entered 2014 and I couldn’t be more pleased with the strides we’ve made.”Net income for the quarter was $458 million, or $1.59 a share, down from $479 million, or $1.70 a share, during the same period last year. Higher programming costs and investments in technical operations and customer services dragged down profits.Total revenue increased 3.5 percent to $5.8 billion.The company added 205,000 total residential customers, its most ever during a quarter. It added 30,000 video subscribers, its first positive quarter for video growth since 2009.Advertisement
