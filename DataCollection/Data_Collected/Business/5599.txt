AOL and NBCUniversal are also in talks to create and produce programming that could appear on both companies’ platforms.With the agreement, which was announced at AOL’s Digital Content NewFront presentation, consumers would, for example, be able to watch clips of “The Blacklist,” an NBC drama, on AOL On, the company’s video distribution site.“We’re trying to break down the silos between linear and digital,” said Bob Lord, the president of AOL. “You have to have an open ecosystem.”The companies said the agreement would also give advertisers a one-stop shop for reaching consumers across screens, from mobile devices to TV.The partnership represents another attempt by media companies to adapt to the changing viewing habits of consumers, who are increasingly shifting to digital and streaming video. Advertisers as well as media companies are struggling to adjust to so much content on so many kinds of screens, making it difficult to capture the attention of viewers and assess how engaged they are.Linda Yaccarino, the chairwoman of advertising sales and client partnerships at NBCUniversal, said the partnership with AOL would give it another outlet for its content as well as provide a way to help viewers and marketers access content on multiple screens.“We see the opportunity, and I think the rest is a benefit to the advertiser and consumer,” she saidDuring its presentation, AOL also introduced a new strategy to introduce digital content of varying length throughout the year for different devices.In mid-April, AOL unveiled a new advertising platform, called One by AOL, which it said would use data to help advertisers determine the effectiveness of their online ad campaigns across devices.AOL also introduced its slate of original programming. One documentary series for The Huffington Post, called “Now What?” with Ryan Duffy, a former correspondent for Vice, will explore how people are finding solutions to today’s problems. The company also introduced a show about stay-at-home dads, “Fabulous Stay-at-Home Dads,” and a cooking demonstration video series, called “You’re Doing It Wrong.”Last year, AOL introduced 16 original shows at its NewFront event in Brooklyn.Advertisement
