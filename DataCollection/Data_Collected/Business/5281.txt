Blankfein, said that the strong performance during the first quarter was a result of years of efforts to adapt to the new environment, according to a person who attended the meeting.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.Goldman’s chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, said in a conference call that analysts had not properly appreciated the degree to which the firm had been positioning itself for conditions that are likely to become more common.“While you were beating us up, we were spending a lot of time focused on the clients and staying very, very committed to the business, and we’re seeing it translate through,” Mr. Schwartz said.The firm said that it earned $2.8 billion, or $5.94 a share, which easily beat analyst estimates of $4.26 a share. The results were 40 percent higher than the net income of $2 billion, or $4.02 a share, that Goldman reported in the quarter a year earlier. With more activity in financial markets globally over the last few months, investors had recently been ramping up their expectations for a strong quarter from Goldman — so much so that the bank’s stock actually fell on Thursday after the earnings were released, ending the day down slightly.Goldman’s results underscored how volatile Wall Street’s central businesses still are, even after years of efforts by regulators to make the industry less risky and vulnerable to big swings.The amount of revenue that Goldman made from its equity trading desks more than doubled from a year ago, and the money coming in from its bond and currency trading operations more than doubled from the previous quarter, going to $3.1 billion from $1.2 billion.Mr. Schwartz sounded confident that the improvement during the first quarter points toward a more sustained pickup in the type of trading activity Goldman relies on.He said that the big increases in revenue were helped by the divergence in monetary policy in the United States, where stimulus programs are being scaled back, and Europe, where the central bank has recently been stepping up its efforts to stimulate the economy. That led some clients to ask Goldman for structured trades that benefit from markets moving in different directions.But Mr. Schwartz emphasized that the strong results were not a result of a single successful trade or single geographic region, and instead attributed them to “strong contributions across the entire business.”Analysts pushed for more detail on where the performance came from and sounded somewhat unsatisfied by the breakdown on what exactly led to the big numbers over the last three months.“One reason why these companies do not have the greatest multiples is that they don’t disclose this stuff very well,” said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer. “It is very opaque.”The opacity, Mr. Kotowski said, makes it harder for analysts and investors to determine if the results are likely to continue, though Mr. Schwartz sounded confident that they would.Goldman’s results come at the end of a week in which the other big banks also announced that their equity trading desks had a good first quarter. The performance from bond and currency trading operations has been more mixed across the big banks.Advertisement
