The information technology company SAIC advanced $5.33, or 11.5 percent, to $51.88 after its fourth-quarter profit was far larger than analysts expected.Utility and telecommunications stocks, which pay hefty dividends similar to bonds, also traded higher.Financial stocks made only small gains and lagged the market.

So has the weakening price of oil, because investors are worried that loans to energy companies won’t be repaid.
