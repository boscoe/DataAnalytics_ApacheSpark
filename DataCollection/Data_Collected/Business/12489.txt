LONDON — The London-based financial services company Old Mutual said on Friday it would split into four main businesses, a move that strengthened expectations of the sale or public listing of its British asset management arm.The breakup of the company, which is listed in London and Johannesburg and has insurance, asset management and banking operations, follows a strategic review announced in November, when the former Standard Bank executive Bruce Hemphill took over as chief executive.Changes to the regulatory environment in Europe and South Africa have made the company more complex to run, it said in a statement.“It’s a costly structure with insufficient synergies to justify those costs,” Mr. Hemphill said.AdvertisementThe company, which began in 1845 as a life insurance firm in Cape Town, said that it had not yet decided how it would spin off the units, but that it expected the separation to be largely completed by the end of 2018.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
