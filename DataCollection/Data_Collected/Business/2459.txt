The nation’s economy is entering 2015 in its best shape since the recession, but the improving job market has so far failed to help most Americans earn significantly more at work.On Friday, the Labor Department reported that employers added another 252,000 workers to their payrolls in December, capping a year in which total employment rose by 2.95 million, the largest advance since 1999.The unemployment rate also improved, edging down last month to 5.6 percent from 5.8 percent in November. The rate plunged just over a full percentage point between 2013 and 2014, the largest decline since 1984.But a drop in average hourly earnings last month, after a healthy gain in November, sidetracked hopes that a tighter labor market was beginning to lead to broader wage gains.“The rising tide of this economic wind at our back has to lift more boats,” Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez said in a telephone interview. The nation’s wage situation, he said, is a crucial part of the “unfinished business” of the nation’s economic recovery, which began around the middle of 2009.AdvertisementDiane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said the decline in wages came despite December gains in construction and health care jobs and other jobs that typically offered good salaries.Advertisement“This is still a buyer’s market in terms of labor,” she said. “For all the good news on unemployment and the number of jobs we’ve created, if these wage numbers are to be believed, employers still have their pick.”For the Federal Reserve, the mixed message from the jobs reports makes the timing of its first interest rate increase in years more problematic. Robust job growth and the lowest unemployment rate since June 2008 suggest a rapidly improving economy, possibly persuading the Fed that it should move sooner rather than later to raise rates to lessen the risk of speculative bubbles or future inflation.“If the activity data continue to improve, as we expect,” Paul Dales, a senior economist for Capital Economics, said in a note to clients, “then the Fed may not wait for wage growth to rise and could still raise rates as soon as March.”Yet as long as wages lag and ordinary Americans are not enjoying much of the fruits of an improving economy, the Fed should stand pat, many economists say.“The economy clearly has no wage or price pressures that would point towards an early liftoff on interest rates,” Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote in a blog post.William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said he worried that the Fed would raise interest rates too soon, hurting small businesses that could hire more workers as long as they maintained ready access to low-interest loans.“We need a financial environment where that can take place,” he said. “If that gets interrupted, hiring is going to get choked off too early.”AdvertisementStill, economic prospects are clearly improving. Even in the absence of better wage gains, declining oil prices may help bolster purchasing power. One economist likened the lower prices to the equivalent of a pay raise of about $1,000 a person for the year, if prices stay low.The drop in oil prices represents a substantial transfer of income from oil producers to oil consumers, said Kevin Logan, a chief economist for HSBC Bank. While some American oil producers are shutting unprofitable rigs and planning job cuts that could damage oil- and shale-producing regions like Louisiana and North Dakota, the overall economic effect for the nation is positive.“Every dollar gained is a dollar lost, but the benefits are widespread and the losses are concentrated and will be small,” Mr. Logan said.
                Employers added 252,000 jobs in December as the labor market closed out a breakout year on a strong note, the Labor Department said Friday. The unemployment rate fell from 5.8% to 5.6%, lowest since June 2008. The rate plunged just over a full percentage point between 2013 and 2014, the largest decline since 1984.            There are other encouraging signs that the recovery is on solid footing.“At the current pace of job growth, the economy should be closing in on a 5 percent unemployment rate by this time next year, which is consistent with full employment,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Wage growth should also pick up more broadly in coming months.”Better, higher-paying jobs are already are being created. Business and professional services have been adding jobs in recent months, though last month many were in the lower-paying administrative category.Hiring has been vigorous in the health care industry, and last month construction jobs increased. Manufacturing job growth has more than doubled to 16,000 a month in the last year, and those jobs generally have an average weekly paycheck about $170 higher than other private sector jobs, Jason Furman, chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a blog post.Mr. Furman said the estimated 0.7 percent increase in real earnings in 2014 is a bit higher than the average annual increase of 0.5 percent from 2000 through 2007, the period of the last expansion. He calculated the figures using the Consumer Price Index inflationary measures through November, as well as consensus projections for December.“But there is more work to be done to raise wages and address longer-standing challenges around family incomes,” Mr. Furman said.AdvertisementIn addition to December’s new jobs, the number of jobs created in November was revised upward to 353,000 from 321,000.Overall job growth last year averaged 246,000 a month, after 194,000 a month in 2013.But more than eight million workers are still looking for full-time employment, while many others have reluctantly accepted part-time work. The share of men in their prime working years who are not working has more than tripled since the 1960s. Long-term unemployment remains highly elevated, and the work force participation rate, already at historically low levels, slipped in December.Eventually, better wages should draw more people to the working world, said the American Action Forum, which summed up Friday’s economic data as, “Job, No Money.”
                An interactive comparison of a day in the life of 147 men and 147 women without jobs.            “A strong labor market attracts people to participate and pays them rising wages,” the right-leaning policy group said in a release. “It is hard to say the labor market is strong despite the robust top-line numbers. The U.S. economy is healing, but not yet healthy.”The frustration over wages was evident despite the other positive indicators.“The good news is that in 2014, people were increasingly finding jobs,” said Elise Gould, a senior economist for the Economic Policy Institute, in a statement. “The bad news is that we are still digging our way out of the recession, and wage growth remains stagnant and untouched by recovery.”Even as the economic recovery advances toward its sixth anniversary with a strong tailwind, it faces several hurdles. The strong dollar — at its highest point in years — is hailed by many as a sign of America’s improving economic conditions. But the dollar’s strength comes with consequences. American manufacturers may lose their competitive edge as the stronger dollar makes their goods more expensive compared to those from other countries. Demand for American products could wane, and exports over all could suffer.Another potential threat for the United States is the overall weakness in the global economy. Europe’s economy is stagnant, China’s is slowing and Japan’s is struggling to emerge from a recent downturn.“There’s a risk we could see slower job growth if much of the world goes into recession,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide. “It’s unlikely, but there’s a chance.”An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of comments by Federal Reserve officials. They noted the global economy’s weakness in December, according to meeting minutes released this week; they did not meet this week. An earlier version also misspelled the surname of a fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He is Jared Bernstein, not Berstein.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Job Growth Fails to Help Paychecks of Workers.
