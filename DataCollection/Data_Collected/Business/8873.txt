WASHINGTON — United States consumer sentiment hit its lowest point in a year in early September and producer prices were flat in August, signaling moderate economic growth and tame inflation that could weigh on the Federal Reserve’s decision whether to raise interest rates next week.The slump in consumer sentiment and persistently weak inflation reported on Friday are in stark contrast with a tightening labor market. Sentiment was most likely undermined by recent stock market volatility and worries over China’s slowing economy, while a strong dollar is dampening price pressures.“The sharp deterioration in consumer confidence and the re-emergence of the disinflationary thrust in goods prices will factor prominently in the Fed’s deliberations next week, and both are likely to add to the case for caution as they consider raising rates,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.The central bank’s policy-setting committee meets on Wednesday and Thursday. The likelihood of a liftoff in the Fed’s benchmark overnight interest rate has been diminished by recent financial market turbulence.AdvertisementThe University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 85.7 early this month, the lowest reading since September last year, from a reading of 91.9 in August.AdvertisementThe survey’s gauge of consumer expectations also dropped to a one-year low, as households expected slower growth overseas to hit the domestic economy. Consumers’ expectations for current and future personal finances also took a knock.But even as households took a dim view of the economy’s outlook, there were only mild declines in sentiment toward motor vehicle and home purchases.“We look to the final September survey results for any evidence of significant pass-through from weaker sentiment to actual purchasing activity, but expect robust income and job growth to outweigh these factors in actual consumption data,” said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
