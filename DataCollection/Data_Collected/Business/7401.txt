The former Toyota Motor executive Julie Hamp was freed from police custody in Tokyo on Wednesday after prosecutors said that they would not indict her after she was accused of illegally importing the painkiller Oxycodone into Japan. Ms. Hamp, a United States citizen who became Toyota’s chief communications officer and the first female managing officer in April, had been arrested June 18. She resigned from Toyota last week. An official at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office told reporters that prosecutors had taken into account the “social penalty” she had incurred. Prosecutors judged there was little criminal intent in the case, which arose when her father mailed her Oxycodone pills to alleviate knee pain. A former General Motors and PepsiCo executive, Ms. Hamp was promoted to her executive post in Toyota as part of a drive to diversify Toyota’s male-dominated, mostly Japanese senior management.A version of this brief appears in print on July 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ex-Toyota Executive Is Freed in Painkiller Case in Japan.
