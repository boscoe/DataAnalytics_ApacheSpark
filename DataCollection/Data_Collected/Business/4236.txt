That has crushed Russians’ spending power, forcing them to cut back and put pricey holiday plans on hold.Spending on international travel by Russians fell 6 percent in 2014, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, a sharp drop from growth of more than 20 percent in previous years.Russian tourists are major buyers of luxury goods, particularly in European capitals like Milan, where they are regular customers of brands such as Brioni, Ferragamo and Moncler.Clerks in the men’s wear department of the upscale Milan department store Rinascente said Russian clients had virtually disappeared.According to the tax refund company Global Blue, spending by Russian tourists fell 17 percent last year and plunged 51 percent in January after a 44 percent fall in December.Although there was an unexpected increase in sales for some in December, as Russians offloaded fast-depreciating rubles for durable luxury goods like Cartier watches, many brands are preparing for a tough 2015.The Italian fashion group Roberto Cavalli expects Russian sales to drop 20 percent this year, while LVMH’s watch brand Hublot has already noted a sales decline of 20 percent in Russia since January, according to a person close to the company, who was not authorized to speak to the news media.Eager to preserve client relationships, some brands have kept a lid on Russian prices at the expense of their margins.Jerome Biard, who exports Swiss watches to Russia through his distribution company LPI and represents brands like Armani, Burberry, Michael Kors and Raymond Weil, has suffered an extra blow from the surge in the value of the Swiss franc but has held back from passing the costs on to customers.“My strategy was to protect my distributors and help them empty their stocks at the end and beginning of the year, so we all agreed to sacrifice our margins,” Mr. Biard said.Tag Heuer, LVMH’s Swiss luxury brand, whose boutique in Ekaterinburg, Russia, enjoyed record sales in December, said it had kept prices relatively unchanged in Russia last year.The store said it planned to raise prices, however, about 20 percent this month.Several lingerie providers, including Lise Charmel, have also made efforts to keep prices affordable in Russia, which has been one of their top export markets.But some have had to cut costs to cope with the downturn.The midrange French lingerie maker Maison LeJaby, which counts on Russia for 30 percent of its sales, has had to cut 27 percent of its staff members, or 50 people, this month.And the upmarket watchmaker Ulysse Nardin, recently acquired by Kering, put some employees on temporary unemployment last month, blaming the slump in Russian business.The story has been similar for airlines, tour groups and hotels with a big exposure to Russia.Some hotels in Turkey have cut prices to fill beds after arrivals from Russia dropped more than 21 percent in 2014, and by 22 percent in January.“We believe that the Russians won’t come,” to Turkey, said Markus Daldrup, managing director at the German tour operator Alltours, which is offering price cuts of up to 24 percent on summer trips to Turkey.Egypt, whose tourism sector gets 30 percent of its business from Russia, saw a 50 percent plunge in visits from Russians in December, and another 20 percent in January, year on year.The country waived the $25 visa fee for Russians through the end of April and plans to begin a huge campaign in Russia in the next few months to win back customers.Several airlines, like Emirates, have responded to the decline in Russian travel abroad by offering fewer flights or seats to the country.The ski resort of Courchevel, in the French Alps, estimates its Russian clientele has shrunk 20 percent to 30 percent this year and those that have come have spent less.“Before, you would often see Russian clients buying bottles of wine at 6,000 euros. Now they only get those for a few hundred euros,” said Adeline Roux, head of tourism at the resort. Advertisement
