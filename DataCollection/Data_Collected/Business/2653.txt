New York’s attorney general is investigating Saks Fifth Avenue’s treatment of transgender employees after a former saleswoman said that the luxury retailer had harassed and dismissed her over her transgender identity.In a letter to Saks dated Wednesday, the office of the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, asked Saks to provide documents on all existing anti-discrimination policies that apply to Saks employees in New York.The letter also asked Saks to detail how it allows employees to file harassment or discrimination complaints, and to outline training materials it uses to educate its employees on workplace harassment.The inquiry is related to a lawsuit filed in Texas in September by Leyth O. Jamal, 23, who says that managers at a Saks in Houston referred to her as a man and instructed her to use the men’s restroom. She also says that managers pressured her to make her appearance more masculine despite being aware of her transgender identity.AdvertisementSaks terminated Ms. Jamal in July 2012 after she brought a discrimination complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
