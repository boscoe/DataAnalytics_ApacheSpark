Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James Gorman, is receiving a $4.4 million stock bonus for 2014 in addition to his $1.5 million salary.The bonus was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that did not provide Mr. Gorman’s total compensation for 2014. In addition to the stock bonus, Mr. Gorman will most likely also receive a cash bonus and another stock bonus tied to the bank’s future performance. In 2013, Mr. Gorman’s total compensation was $18 million, nearly double what he received the year before. It was, though, less than the pay packages given to the chief executives at his biggest competitors, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase. Since the financial crisis, Mr. Gorman has attempted to remake Morgan Stanley as a less risky business, focused more on its large brokerage division. That strategy has helped bolster revenue and has won over many investors, who pushed the company’s stock up 24 percent last year.The bank, though, did stumble to a relatively unimpressive finish in 2014 and there are still questions on whether the company can capture the same kind of returns as its rivals.
