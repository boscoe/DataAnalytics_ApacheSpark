Mondelez says it will add “Oreo Thins” to its permanent lineup in the United States starting next week; the cookies were introduced in China last year. The cookies look like regular Oreos and have a similar cookie-to-filling ratio, except that they’re slimmer. That means four of the cookies contain 140 calories, compared with 160 calories for three regular Oreos. They also weren’t designed to be twisted open or dunked, even though about half of customers pull apart regular Oreos before eating them, according to the company. The new cookie could help the company’s North American cookie business, which declined in the first three months of this year. Advertisement
