In videos online, some customers said they heard a curse when, by tapping one of the toys against a hard surface, they activated its voice. “To me, it sure doesn’t sound like anything a kid should be hearing,” one commenter said on a YouTube video post. The restaurant chain introduced the toys on July 3 as a promotion of the animated film “Minions,” a prequel to the “Despicable Me” movies that feature small, yellow characters who talk gibberish. In a statement, McDonald’s denied the toy used bad language, and a company spokeswoman said that only a “very small number of customers” had complained. The company, which said there was no plan to remove the toy from distribution, added that the contention that “this toy is saying anything offensive or profane is not true.” McDonald’s says the toy emits three sounds — “para la bukay,” “hahaha” and “eh eh.” Advertisement
