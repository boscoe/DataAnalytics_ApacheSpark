HarperCollins released the cover for Harper Lee’s highly anticipated new novel, “Go Set a Watchman,” on Wednesday, and hinted at new details about the book. The cover — a classic and melancholy image of a dark tree with sparse yellow leaves against a dusky blue sky, with a train approaching from the distance — is emblematic of the opening of the book, which begins with a grown-up Scout’s train ride from New York to her childhood home of Maycomb, Ala.The novel, which comes out on July 14 with a huge first printing of two million copies, has been selling briskly through preorders from Amazon and Barnes & Noble since it was announced in early February. It’s also been the source of some controversy among literary scholars and friends and acquaintances of the intensely private Ms. Lee; some question why she agreed to publish a novel she had set aside in the mid 1950s, while others say she has enthusiastically endorsed the book’s release.The narrative of “Go Set a Watchman” unfolds in the 1950s, 20 years after “To Kill a Mockingbird,” as Scout travels to Maycomb to visit her aging father Atticus Finch. Though the characters and setting will be familiar to fans of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” there is little overlap between the two novels otherwise, Ms. Lee’s publisher and literary agent say.The cover, designed by Jarrod Taylor in the Harper Art Department at HarperCollins, reflects Scout’s journey home, Michael Morrison, the president and publisher of HarperCollins, said in a statement.“There are so many wonderful parts of ‘Go Set a Watchman,’ that it was hard to pick just one iconic image to represent the book,” he said. “ ‘Go Set a Watchman’ begins with Scout’s train ride home, but more profoundly, it is about the journey Harper Lee’s beloved characters have taken in the subsequent 20 years of their lives.”A version of this article appears in print on March 26, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Publisher Reveals Cover for Harper Lee Novel.
