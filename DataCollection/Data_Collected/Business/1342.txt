Buffett, sold some of its Goldman Sachs and Walmart shares during the third quarter, and made several smaller changes to its stock portfolio, according to a report filed on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that the main reason he reduced Berkshireâ€™s Walmart and Goldman stakes was to generate cash for his $32 billion acquisition of Precision Castparts, which is expected to close next year. Berkshire sold 13 percent of its 12.6 million Goldman shares and 7 percent of its 60.4 million Walmart shares. Advertisement
