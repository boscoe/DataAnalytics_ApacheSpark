The economy has been in disarray. People have been out of work for years. The banks have been running out of money. It sounds a lot like the Great Depression in the United States. But it is Greece – and in some ways, the situation is worse.
“Greece is in its own Great Depression. But unlike the United States, it won't be able to get back on its feet as quickly,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Greece “is shackled by onerous rules and regulations, an aging population and a dysfunctional domestic political system,” he added, and the country is “sharing important elements of sovereignty with its own creditors.”1933: Automotive workers in Detroit lining up to cash their checks. 2014: People entering an employment agency in an Athens suburb.

Though the economy slipped back into recession in 1937, the onset of World War II and furious military spending helped the country recover for good.Greece hasn’t had its own currency since it joined the euro, and an inefficient bureaucracy has long failed to improve tax collection or to trim its bloated government. At this point, Greece is just struggling to pay its bills, as it tries to secure aid from Europe.Gross domestic productU.S. 1933Greece 2013–26%–26%+5%0–5–10–15–20–25–301929193019311932193319341935193620072008200920102011201220132014+5%0–5–10–15–20–25–3019291931193319352007200920112013Percentage change in annual G.D.P. since 1929 in the U.S. and since 2007 in Greece1937: Jean Schwartz, a dress finisher, filled out an application for unemployment insurance in New York. 2015: A man begging on the street near a shipyard in the town of Perama.
