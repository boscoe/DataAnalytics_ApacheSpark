But that has not stopped venture capital firms from raising new money to pour into start-ups.The latest is Index Ventures, which announced on Wednesday that it had closed its eighth venture capital fund at $550 million, up slightly from the normal size for the funds earmarked for early-stage investments.Coupled with a $700 million fund that focuses on later-stage growth investments, the total of Index’s latest fund-raising efforts is more than $1.2 billion — seemingly a lot at a time when venture capitalists have become worried that sky-high valuations for start-ups have started to crumble.Yet Mike Volpi, a partner at Index, said that the current environment had not shaken the confidence of the firm. Index focuses primarily on investing in the seed and early stages of a company’s life, leaving the firm less exposed to later fluctuations in that start-up’s value.Moreover, he contends, the investment strategy gives the firm a longer time horizon that is less tied to the vicissitudes of the present.“Obviously, the climate is certainly different today, but since we’re going to be investing this fund over, say, the next three-and-a-half years, things will look differently than they do today,” he said.The current environment, he added, “doesn’t affect us too much, except at the margins.”At the same time, Mr. Volpi said, having valuations come down can swing negotiating leverage — and, hopefully, returns — in favor of investors.Index has been slower to spend money from its growth fund, Mr. Volpi added.“We raised it just as valuations were starting to shift,” he said. “We’ve made one or two investments out of that fund.”As part of the fund-raising announcement, Index also said that it had promoted Shardul Shah, who joined eight years ago, to partner. Last week, the firm said that it had hired Dick Costolo, the former chief executive of Twitter, as a partner as well.Advertisement
