WASHINGTON —  Even as Takata, the Japanese auto supplier, has acknowledged that its airbags are prone to rupture and has vastly expanded their recall, it has maintained that the underlying explosive that powers the airbags can be used safely.At a congressional hearing on Tuesday, lawmakers repeatedly questioned a Takata executive about the safety of the propellant, ammonium nitrate, and the executive maintained that the company would continue to use it.Ammonium nitrate, which Takata has used in its propellant since the early 2000s, has become a central concern over the airbags, which can explode violently when they deploy, sending metal shards into the cabin. According to experts, it is highly sensitive to moisture and to changes in temperature. Over time, the propellant can break down, making it susceptible to combusting violently.At least six deaths and more than 100 injuries have been linked to the defective airbags.On Tuesday, members of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee sharply questioned Kevin Kennedy, an executive vice president for Takata, over the company’s continued use of ammonium nitrate.Advertisement“Can you guarantee that as long as ammonium nitrate is used in those products that the products are safe?” asked Joseph P. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts.“We believe that when properly manufactured and designed, ammonium nitrate — phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate — can be done properly,” Mr. Kennedy of Takata said. He was referring to one of the changes the company’s engineers had made to stabilize the compound to prevent it from breaking down. Takata’s new design would alter the shape of the propellant wafers, but not the composition.AdvertisementHe acknowledged the concerns with the propellant, and added that Takata’s use of ammonium nitrate “would go down significantly.” He also noted that Takata was continuing to investigate the compound as one of the causes of the airbags’ failure.Some lawmakers questioned why the compound should be used at all, given the circumstances.“Why would I buy a car that has a potentially dangerous airbag?” said Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois. “I’m not understanding.”Mr. Kennedy urged some patience. “In a vehicle, it’s not as easy as changing the color of the car,” he said.But many of the lawmakers, who had held a similar hearing last December, were not persuaded in the end. Michael Burgess, the Texas Republican who heads the subcommittee that held the hearing, said afterward that Takata had progressed from its stance at the previous hearing, but that many of the company’s answers remained unsatisfactory.“I couldn’t believe what they were telling me,” he said. “They are still making an airbag with ammonium nitrate as a propellant. And they’re putting that in replacement vehicles.”In the course of reporting, The Times obtained video showing the potentially dangerous consequences of mishandling Takata’s airbags. Millions of vehicles with the airbags have been recalled worldwide.Takata’s competitors use different compounds as their primary propellant, and many are supplying the replacement airbags for the nearly 34 million vehicles with Takata airbags that have been recalled in the United States — the largest auto recall in the nation’s history.AdvertisementTakata engineers have for years struggled to tame the ammonium nitrate, proposing in its patents a host of remedies, some of which it now uses.But despite mounting evidence of the effect of high humidity, the exact cause of the airbags’ failure has remained a mystery. Two parallel investigations, one commissioned by Takata and another by a consortium of automakers, are studying a range of possible reasons.Even as Mr. Kennedy said Takata was abandoning its use of a design feature he called a “batwing,” used in the problematic airbags, he at one point defended the original intent behind the airbags’ design. He argued that whatever the root cause of the ruptures, Takata was simply producing the airbags that automakers had ordered to their specifications.But Mitch Bainwol, president of the automakers’ industry group Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, who also testified Tuesday, responded that those specifications related to performance criteria, not basic safety.“There is an understanding that the supplier will provide a product” that complies with safety regulations, Mr. Bainwol said, “and part of that is making sure that a controlled explosion is a controlled explosion.”
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            Earlier in the hearing, lawmakers pressed the nation’s top auto safety regulator for a resolution to what they saw as continuing confusion over the recalls.Some automakers are still checking which cars need to be included in the expanded recall, leaving many owners confused about the status of their vehicles.“The messaging around these airbag recalls has been tortured at best,” Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, told Mark R. Rosekind, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Automakers, he said, had worked quickly to sort out which cars fell under the expanded recall and would have updated lists within two weeks.AdvertisementHe added that the agency now had access to testing data from Takata, the automakers and expert labs to help identify the root cause of the ruptures. The safety agency’s consent order with Takata also gives it authority to approve future fixes, he said.“Now N.H.T.S.A. is in the driver’s seat,” Mr. Rosekind said. But he added, “This may be the largest and most complicated recall in the nation’s history.”

Under Mr. Rosekind, who was appointed in December, the agency has increased the pressure on Takata and automakers. He cited the company’s acknowledgment that the airbags were defective — something it refused to do at the December hearing — as a sign of progress.Takata has said it has significantly increased its production of replacement airbag kits — to about 700,000 last month from about 350,000 a month in December. Mr. Kennedy said Takata expected to produce one million a month by September.But the toll of the faulty airbags remains. Before the hearing, Angelina Sujata of South Carolina, who was 18 years old when the faulty Takata airbag in her 2001 Honda Civic exploded violently, gave an account of her ordeal. She was traveling at about 25 miles an hour at the time, on her way home, when the car ahead of her stopped short.She required two operations for the metal shards that sliced into her body.“There was so much pain in my chest,” said Ms. Sujata, now 21.Afterward, Ms. Sujata said she was disappointed to hear that the company would continue to use ammonium nitrate.“It was very revealing,” she said. “They’re going to continue to use the same chemicals despite everything that’s happened. That just doesn’t make sense to me.”An earlier version of this article misstated the party affiliation of Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. She is a Democrat, not a Republican.Aaron M.
