The company expects to open roughly the same number of stores and will consider more mergers and acquisitions. The store closings amount to only about 2 percent of the 8,232 drugstores the company runs in the United States, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Walgreens also said it would reorganize its corporate operations and streamline its information technology and other functions. Walgreens also said on Thursday that it earned $2.04 billion, or $1.93 a share, in its fiscal second quarter. Earnings adjusted for one-time gains and costs were $1.18 a share, which beat analyst expectations. Advertisement
