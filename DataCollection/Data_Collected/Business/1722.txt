A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the service sector.The new-orders index fell 4.5 points, to 57.5 last month. There were also declines in measures of services sector employment, backlogs and export orders. Deliveries were slowing and inventories were still considered high, which could constrain order growth in the months ahead.Twelve services industries, including real estate, retail, transportation and warehousing, public administration and finance and insurance, reported growth last month. The six industries reporting contraction included wholesale trade, utilities and agriculture.The report came after news this week from the institute that the manufacturing sector contracted in November for the first time in three years. Still, economists said the soft services sector survey did not signal a slowdown in gross domestic product growth from the 2.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter.“Even after this drop-off, the latest figure was still consistent with real G.D.P. growth of around 2.25 percent,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York.In a second report, the Labor Department said that initial claims for state unemployment benefits in the week that ended Nov. 28 increased 9,000, to a seasonally adjusted 269,000.It was the 39th straight week in which claims were below 300,000, which is normally associated with a healthy labor market. Claims are near levels last seen in 1973, and there is little room for further declines as the labor market normalizes.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750, to 269,250 last week.In another report, the global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said firms based in the United States announced 30,953 job cuts in November, the smallest number since September 2014 and down 39 percent from October. There were 1,355 oil-related job cuts, the fewest since June.The jobless claims from last week have no bearing on the Labor Department’s November employment report, which will be released on Friday, because they fall outside the survey period.“The claims data suggest that the trend in employment growth remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down over time,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. A fourth report, from the Commerce Department, said that new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.5 percent in October, after two consecutive months of declines, on rising demand for transportation equipment and a range of other goods.Advertisement
