The company said on Tuesday that growing demand for expensive specialty drugs helped increase revenue from its pharmacy benefits management business nearly 22 percent in the quarter, to $23.9 billion. The company, which said last fall that eliminating tobacco sales would cut earnings 7 to 8 cents a share, did not elaborate on that move’s impact on earnings. Over all, CVS Health earned $1.32 billion, or $1.14 a share, in the three months that ended Dec. 31. That compares with $1.27 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the final quarter of 2013. Total revenue climbed 13 percent to $37.06 billion. Advertisement
