LONDON —  Volkswagen successfully lobbied to remove two key parts of Europe’s forthcoming auto emissions tests, an internal email shows, including a provision to measure the significant pollution released when an engine is started but hasn’t yet warmed up.The automaker also argued against requiring special, high-speed tests for cars designed to be driven fast. Volkswagen, which owns the Porsche, Lamborghini and Audi brands, is a leading producer of fast cars. “Such topics must be deleted,” a Volkswagen executive wrote in an email last year to the European Commission, the European Union’s executive branch, referring to the two provisions.The new tests, which still face a battle in the European Parliament, will be the first in Europe to require screening car pollution outside of a laboratory and in road tests meant to more closely reflect real driving. The email was included among documents made public by the commission after a request by Corporate Europe Observatory, a Brussels-based advocacy group.The name of the Volkswagen executive who lobbied on the issue of real-world tests was redacted by the European Commission. The email was written by the VW official on behalf of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, a trade group. Cara McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the group, could not say whether other automakers had weighed in on the same topics.AdvertisementRegulations set in Europe have far-flung resonance because European emissions standards are followed by many countries beyond Europe, including India and Argentina. The email reflects the strong hand that carmakers have long had in negotiating over Europe’s auto regulations.AdvertisementThe methods used to test cars for emissions of nitrogen oxides and other airborne pollutants have taken on a new urgency. In September, Volkswagen admitted that it had cheated on traditional lab tests by installing in some 11 million diesel vehicles special software that senses when a car is being subjected to testing. Since then, the loopholes in Europe’s regulations have met scrutiny and criticism.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            As world leaders and activists gathered in Paris this week for the United Nations climate-change conference, the VW scandal and the European Union’s difficulty in agreeing to effective auto emissions tests serve as sobering reminders that goals or agreements can be hard to enforce in practice.In the email, the VW executive wrote that automakers “cannot agree to a regulation including undefined topics like cold start or high speed,” adding that both “must be deleted.” Testing “cold starts” refers to measuring the prodigious emissions that occur during the everyday act of starting and warming up a car when the engine is cool.Lucia Caudet, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, said the commission still intended to develop a plan to measure cold starts in future addendums to the regulation, which is scheduled to take effect in 2017. “The commission is developing a specific cold start test,” she wrote in an email, “which better reflects emissions in real driving scenarios like short city trips.”Fred Baerbock, a spokesman for Volkswagen, said in a statement that the email sent by the VW executive to the commission last year was “part of the normal exchange of expertise that is part of every lawmaking in the E.U.” He said it was sent by the Volkswagen executive on behalf of the automakers’ trade group during technical discussions and “should not qualify” as lobbying by Volkswagen.The trade group spokeswoman said that it was “fully supporting the development of this test in order to ensure that emissions more closely reflect real-world conditions.”The new European road tests will require automakers to meet new emissions targets on the road, in addition to complying with lab tests. Regulators in the United States and Canada recently began their own road tests of diesel car emissions, though the American tests are focused solely on catching automakers cheating on lab tests.Volkswagen has played a major role in shaping automotive testing in Europe. In addition to its lobbying on the real-world tests, executives from its Audi division took the lead in helping shape a second test that is to debut in 2017 — a revamping of laboratory procedures that have long been used to measure tailpipe pollution.AdvertisementAs far back as 2010, an executive at Audi laid out a template for the new tests. In subsequent years, Audi executives, some of them specialists in emission certification, also played leading roles in two committees that helped draft the fine print for the test. In these meetings, engineers representing manufacturers largely outnumbered regulatory bodies. The group working on emission tests was led by a member of the German transport ministry throughout the development process of the test.VW also this year lobbied to give large passenger vehicles like vans and buses more leeway in meeting existing emission regulations. That proposal was dropped after VW’s emissions scandal became public.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It is less for diesels, but still significant.”Mr. Baerbock of VW said that at the time the objection was raised, cold starts “needed to be defined better in order to be included into the regulation,” so automakers “boiled it down to asking” for “the deletion of this issue.”
            VW’s emissions cheating is said to have begun in 2005.        The Volkswagen executive also wrote that a proposal to conduct special road testing at about 100 miles per hour and higher for particularly speedy vehicles was not acceptable and crossed out the proposed language from an excerpt included in the email.The new road tests, as currently conceived, limit the highest speed at which testing can occur. The industry and regulators negotiated that speed because pollutant emissions worsen at higher speeds. The Volkswagen executive told the commission that automakers were willing to allow testing at speeds as high as around 91 miles per hour, instead of about 81 miles per hour, which the industry had previously insisted upon — but only “if at the same time” the plans for a special test for high-speed vehicles “will be deleted.”The industry appears to have largely prevailed because the high-speed test is no longer part of the European plan. The road test is capped at about 91 miles per hour, with a cushion that allows for speeds of up to 100 miles per hour no more than 3 percent of the time. Mr. Baerbock said that “an extra high-speed test is not representative for E.U. driving” because driving at such speeds was rare.AdvertisementPerhaps the most significant difference between the European and American approaches is that regulators in the United States conduct their own tests to check whether manufacturers’ claims are accurate. By contrast, in Europe, testing is left to automakers and their contractors, which will continue to be the case in the new road and lab tests.“It is still the manufacturers themselves testing or testing facilities that are commissioned by the manufacturers, with very little or no oversight by the authorities,” Peter Mock, I.C.C.T.’s Europe managing director, said.The future of the road tests is in some doubt, however, because they face a difficult fight in the European Parliament. Many members oppose a recent move by the European Commission to change the road tests in a concession to the industry, making them far easier to meet.Bas Eickhout, a Dutch lawmaker who sits on the European Parliament’s environment committee, said he expected the committee to vote to reject the road tests as currently drafted. “There is a broad majority in favor of objecting,” he said. The issue would then go before the Parliament at large, where the outcome is less clear. If rejected, the commission will have to redraft the rules.Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, another environment committee member who is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a centrist bloc, agreed, saying he expected “a large majority” in the committee to object. He also criticized the commission’s handling of the new tests, saying, “It’s clear this has become an absolutely political decision.”A version of this article appears in print on December 2, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: VW Fought in Europe on Testing.
