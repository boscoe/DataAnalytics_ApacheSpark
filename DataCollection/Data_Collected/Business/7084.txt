A new round of consolidation in the health insurance industry appeared closer as companies seek to grow larger, driven in part by cost-cutting and opportunities that are part of the Affordable Care Act.In the latest jockeying, Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, is pursuing a deal to sell itself and could reach an agreement by next week, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Among those in the running to buy it are two bigger competitors, Aetna and Cigna.The machinations of Humana — set against a backdrop of frenzied merger discussions within the insurance industry — received an extra jolt from the Supreme Court’s ruling on Thursday that the government could furnish tax subsidies for poor and middle-class Americans to buy health insurance.The long-awaited ruling, in the case King v. Burwell, was a major victory for the Obama administration that will greatly benefit large parts of the American health care system. Insurers, especially, had been counting on those billions of dollars in tax subsidies to draw in new customers, particularly as Medicare and Medicaid turn to private health plans to offer coverage. Many insurers, including Humana, issued statements in support of the court’s decision.AdvertisementInvestors, too, were heartened by the ruling as shares in the major health insurers jumped on Thursday after the Supreme Court announced its decision. Trading in Humana’s stock was briefly halted and its price gained more momentum after Bloomberg News reported that it was near a deal to sell itself.Still, it remains to be seen whether government regulators will bless too many consolidations, because of antitrust concerns. And it is unclear what effect more mergers will have on the prices consumers pay for insurance.Other parts of the American health care sector were also bolstered by the ruling, particularly hospitals, which are expected to benefit from an increase in paying customers who now are covered by Medicaid or subsidized private insurance. Shares in HCA Holdings, the huge hospital operator, rose nearly 9 percent, while those of Tenet Healthcare jumped 12 percent.AdvertisementAffirmation for a signature feature of the Affordable Care Act will make firm for some time the ability of insurers to move into new markets. Yet insurers have also faced pressure to cut their costs, especially since these new customers are more sensitive to the price of health coverage.That has propelled merger talks within the health insurance industry of an intensity unseen for the last several years, as companies vie to find the right partner and the kind of scale that will enable them to reduce costs and gain more negotiating power with health systems.Insurers are also seeking deals with a sense of urgency, lest they risk being left out if government regulators limit the number of mergers that will be allowed to happen.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Anthem itself had also expressed interest in buying Humana, though it is now focused on Cigna.And UnitedHealthcare, the biggest of the health insurers, has made a preliminary approach for Aetna, people briefed on the matter said previously.Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., is seen as attractive because of its big presence in the Medicare market, which has benefited from the Affordable Care Act. Aetna, Anthem and Cigna all have relatively smaller Medicare Advantage businesses.But Humana has struggled to meet Wall Street’s profit expectations for much of the last year, though it enjoyed rises in both its membership rolls and its revenue in the first three months of the year.The company has been working with bankers at Goldman Sachs to sift through its potential deal options, fielding expressions of takeover interest from a number of suitors.While Humana is perhaps the least expensive takeover target within the big five insurers, with a market value of $27.6 billion, it faces a few distinct issues.AdvertisementAmong them is that its rival with the biggest financial resources to pursue a transaction, UnitedHealthcare, would most likely be barred by government regulators because both companies have major operations tied to Medicare.With UnitedHealthcare and Anthem both pursuing two of the most logical buyers of Humana, the smallest insurer risked being left alone — and competing against far bigger rivals — if it did not strike its own deal ahead of other potential transactions.Representatives for Humana, Aetna and Cigna were not immediately available for comment.A version of this article appears in print on June 26, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Court Ruling Seen as a Spur to Consolidation of Insurers.
