His contract was set to expire in 2016. Mr. Dauman, 60, a lawyer and deal maker, became chief in 2006, beating out rivals from the creative side of the company to install himself as the leading candidate to succeed the executive chairman and founder, Sumner M. Redstone, 91. Mr. Redstone said Mr. Dauman had “been an extraordinary C.E.O.” and “his strategic vision and creative leadership have delivered consistently outstanding operational and financial results.” Mr. Dauman received $37.2 million in 2013 in salary, stock and options. In the quarter that ended last September, ratings for Viacom’s networks dropped 15 percent, though Mr. Dauman pointed out that ratings failed to take account of other platforms. Advertisement
