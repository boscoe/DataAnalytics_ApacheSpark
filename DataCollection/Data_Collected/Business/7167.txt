Law firm giving is under pressure to give to clients’ charities and to law school alma maters, the analysis found.Five law firms said they had given more than $1 million each last year to organizations that provide legal aid, but most firms were unwilling to disclose the exact amounts.Four firms that agreed to disclose their legal aid donations were Kirkland & Ellis, which gave $2.6 million; Sidley Austin, with $2.1 million; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, with $1.5 million, and Reed Smith, with $300,000. Paul, Weiss had the highest level of giving as a percentage of its revenue.Most of the top-grossing firms, like Latham & Watkins, which had a 14 percent jump in revenue to $2.5 billion last year, declined to say what they contributed to legal aid. Latham & Watkins, based in Los Angeles, is one of a dozen firms that had $3 million or more in profits per partner.The American Lawyer’s analysis noted that while there was no system to track donations by individual lawyers and that personal giving is important, “institutional giving by law firms is crucial” to the legal aid funding structure.According to American Bar Association data, in 2013 law firms gave $95.8 million out of nearly $1.39 billion in legal aid funding from all sources. But funding of legal services has struggled as a result of federal funding cutbacks for the Legal Services Corporation, which provides the bulk of legal aid funding.Despite the funding pressures and their effect on the legal system, many big law firms prefer to direct their institutional giving toward winning or maintaining client business. While a client’s pet causes may be doing “good and valuable work,” such donations are “more in the nature of marketing or client relationships,” James J. Sandman, president of the Legal Services Corporation, told The American Lawyer.The article cited an example involving Kirkland & Ellis. According to the law firm’s charitable foundation tax filings for 2013, the foundation’s third-largest gift — $298,200 — went to Bain Capital Children’s Charity. Bain Capital is a major law firm client.Advertisement
