Japanese households cut spending more than expected and retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in January, data showed on Friday, a sign the central bank’s radical stimulus has yet to convince consumers that inflation will take hold. Factory output jumped in January as exports rebounded on solid demand in the United States and Asia, but manufacturers expect output to rise only slightly in February and slump in March. The Bank of Japan hopes its aggressive money printing will fuel expectations that prices will rise and prompt households to spend more now. Separate data also underscored the problem the central bank faces with slumping oil prices slowing annual core consumer inflation to 0.2 percent in January, pushing it further away from its 2 percent target. Weak consumer confidence has contained spending as wages have yet to increase enough to make up for the sales tax increase last April, casting doubt on the strength of the economic recovery. The mixed data will keep the central bank under pressure to maintain its stimulus, although Haruhiko Kuroda, the bank’s governor, has emphasized that he sees no need to ease again soon. The bank argues that falling oil prices will lift inflation in the long run by allowing households and companies to spend more on other goods. But analysts doubt that policy makers can meet their pledge of hitting the inflation target in the year beginning in April, as they expect it to take at least six months for the benefits of oil price falls to increase growth.A version of this brief appears in print on February 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Japan’s Inflation Rate Hits a 10-Month Low.
