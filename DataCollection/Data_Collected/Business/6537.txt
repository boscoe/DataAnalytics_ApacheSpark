Following in the footsteps of its rival HBO, the premium cable network Showtime announced on Wednesday that its new Internet streaming service will make its debut in early July on Apple devices for a monthly fee of $11.The service, which does not require a traditional television subscription, will include unlimited on-demand access to Showtime original series as well as hundreds of hours of movies, documentaries and sports programming. It also will include a live feed of the network’s East and West Coast broadcasts.The service will be available on Apple devices in time for the season premieres of the hit series “Ray Donovan” and “Masters of Sex,” on July 12. Other distribution partners are expected. There is a free 30-day trial for new customers who register through Apple in July.“Consumers are looking for options, looking for different ways to consume products,” Matthew C. Blank, chief executive of Showtime Networks, said in an interview.
                Here are some prominent services offering live TV, à la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.            The development is the latest in a flurry of new streaming services from media, telecom and technology companies that are trying to keep pace with the digital competitors Netflix, Amazon and Hulu and stay relevant to a generation of viewers who pay for Internet access but not traditional TV subscriptions. In April, HBO started its new $15 digital streaming service called HBO Now. Showtime’s owner, the CBS Corporation, introduced an Internet-only subscription offering last year.AdvertisementThe new services offer viewers more flexibility to choose which programming they want to pay for and how they want to watch it. Dish Network, for instance, offers a $20-a-month service with about 20 channels in the core package and extra add-on packages for $5 a month. Apple also is in talks to include broadcast networks in a new streaming service.Advertisement“Across CBS, we are constantly finding new ways to monetize our programming by capitalizing on opportunities presented by technology,” Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS, said in a statement.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Showtime now counts nearly 24 million subscribers, and is seeking to greatly expand its base with the new service.The $11 monthly price tag for Showtime’s service falls in the middle of other streaming offerings. HBO priced its service at $15 a month, a value that analysts said represented an effort to balance relationships with current distributors. Netflix starts at $8 a month.Mr. Blank said that Showtime landed at its $11 price tag because it “seemed to be a fair value given the competition.”A version of this article appears in print on June 4, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Showtime Introduces New Streaming Service .
