That would value the company at €18.8 billion at the top end of the price range.If an overallotment of shares is fully exercised, the Dutch government could raise as much as €4.3 billion.“Obtaining a listing is a logical step following the strides we have made in our development since the establishment of ABN Amro in its current form in 2010,” Gerrit Zalm, chairman of ABN Amro’s managing board, said in a news release. “Our business case is solid, we have a moderate risk profile and are able to offer our clients a broad range of services.”The company’s shares are expected to begin trading on the Euronext stock exchange in Amsterdam on Nov. 20.The offering will consist of sales to retail and institutional investors in the Netherlands and a private placement to qualified institutional investors internationally.Proceeds from the sale would go to the Dutch government, not to ABN Amro. The Dutch government would still own 77 percent of the company after the offering.The bank traces its roots to ABN Amro Holding, which broke up in 2007 after a €71 billion deal in which the Royal Bank of Scotland, Banco Santander of Spain and the Belgian bank Fortis bought parts of the company.The Dutch assets of Fortis and the Belgian lender’s share of ABN Amro were nationalized during the 2008 financial crisis, costing the Dutch government more than €21 billion. The collapse of the bank also led to the loss of thousands of jobs.The Dutch government announced plans in May to proceed with a sale of the bank’s shares. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister, delayed a decision on the offering in March over a disagreement with lawmakers about executives’ salaries at the lender.A group of ABN Amro’s top managers eventually gave up a pay increase.ABN Amro’s prospects have improved in recent years, as the company has shed operations and reduced its provisions for bad loans.The bank’s underlying profit, which excludes certain special items, more than doubled in 2014, to €1.55 billion from €752 million in 2013.ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are leading the offering. Lazard is acting as a financial adviser to ABN Amro, and Rothschild is advising NL Financial Investments.Advertisement
