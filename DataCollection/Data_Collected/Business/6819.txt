WASHINGTON —  When Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of the American International Group, brought a class-action lawsuit against the government in 2011, contending that the Federal Reserve overstepped its bounds when it bailed out his company at the height of the financial crisis, the reaction was mainly befuddlement and outright ridicule.When the case went to trial last fall, many legal experts predicted a lost cause, while both the government’s lawyers and elected officials were even more blunt: calling Mr. Greenberg an “ingrate” and the lawsuit, which demanded as much as $40 billion, an embarrassment.But as the bench trial unfolded over nearly two months, Mr. Greenberg’s legal team, led by the prominent litigator David Boies, kept chipping away at witness after witness in pursuit of its own thesis: that the Fed had acted beyond its legal authority. By the time the trial concluded, many legal experts had moved the case from a slam-dunk for the government to too close to call. It would all depend on Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims.On Monday, Judge Wheeler handed down his decision — a split judgment that in many ways agreed with both sides’ main points of contention. Yes, he ruled, the Fed had indeed crossed the legal line by demanding a 79.9 percent equity stake in A.I.G. as a condition of the bailout in 2008. But at the same time, the government was also correct that A.I.G. shareholders had not been damaged; in fact, they had been saved from bankruptcy and certain doom. He declined to award any damages.AdvertisementIn his 75-page opinion, Judge Wheeler found that the Fed’s action indeed “constituted an illegal exaction under the Fifth Amendment” and that it “did not have the legal right to become the owner of A.I.G.”AdvertisementBut he also ruled “the inescapable conclusion is that A.I.G. would have filed for bankruptcy” without the bailout and “the value of the shareholders’ common stock would have been zero.”A.I.G. repaid the bailout, which ultimately totaled $185 billion, and the government even earned a return of about $20 billion. But the lawsuit set up a challenge to the Fed’s power. The government argued that laws from the 1930s and internal precedents since then gave it the authority to take an equity stake in A.I.G. Mr. Greenberg’s suit pointed to other laws governing the Fed’s emergency loans that it argued prohibited such a practice.
                A judge ruled the government does not owe Maurice Greenberg and other shareholders any damages over the company’s 2008 bailout.            During the trial, Mr. Boies confronted the architects of the bailout — including Timothy F. Geithner, Ben S. Bernanke and Henry M. Paulson Jr. — with their own emails, statements and handwritten notes.The documents revealed that more internal doubt existed than was previously known about whether the Fed was crossing legal lines during its A.I.G. rescue.Judge Wheeler’s decision will almost surely lead one or both sides to appeal, and legal and financial experts were divided on Monday as to which side could claim victory.“Greenberg proved he was correct, that the government didn’t have the authority to do what it did,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “I think it’s wrong to say it was a hollow victory because it didn’t come with money attached. It could have huge implications for public policy going forward.”Dennis M. Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, which advocates financial reform, said he thought that Judge Wheeler’s attempts at “legal gymnastics” did not obscure the fact that Mr. Greenberg had been asking for compensation — a lot of it.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In a statement, the Fed said that it “believes that its actions in the A.I.G. rescue during the height of the financial crisis in 2008 were legal, proper and effective” and that it was pleased the court “recognizes that A.I.G.’s shareholders are not entitled to compensation for that decision.”The Obama administration issued a statement saying that Judge Wheeler “confirmed today that A.I.G. shareholders were not harmed by those actions,” but “we disagree with the court’s conclusion regarding the Federal Reserve’s legal authority and continue to believe that the government acted well within legal bounds.”“The Government’s unduly harsh treatment of A.I.G. in comparison to other institutions seemingly was misguided and had no legitimate purpose, even considering concerns about ‘moral hazard.’ The question is not whether this treatment was inequitable or unfair, but whether the Government’s actions created a legal right of recovery for A.I.G.’s shareholders. ” —Judge Thomas C. WheelerTwo sources with knowledge of the government’s legal strategy said that internally the decision was being considered a victory because the ruling against damages could carry the day going forward.Todd Bault, an analyst with Citigroup, said in a research note on Monday that while Mr. Greenberg and the A.I.G. shareholders were “awarded a ‘moral’ win, the case that no damage was inflicted seems plausible, and thus an appeal could be difficult to win.”Even so, Mr. Bault said the case “may set a precedent for less government action during financial crises,” especially given the deep political split that makes it unlikely Congress would act to clarify the relevant issues anytime soon.The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law already prohibits the Fed from bailing out a single institution, thus barring a direct repeat of the A.I.G. situation.But the new laws are also ambiguous about certain methods regulators could use in future bailouts — like taking an equity stake.Mr. Greenberg’s legal team had been outspoken about the case being less about the financial crisis, and A.I.G. in particular, than it was about the limits of executive power. In that respect, experts say he did prevail with Judge Wheeler on that point.Mr. Kelleher, the financial reform advocate, said he still would not call Monday’s decision a moral victory.Advertisement“If Greenberg thinks this is a moral victory, then his moral compass needs some adjustment,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on June 16, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A.I.G.
