Only 195 bids were placed Wednesday for leases in an area comprising 41 million acres in the central parts of the Gulf of Mexico off the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. At last year’s equivalent sale, oil companies submitted 380 bids, and past years have drawn more than 500 bids. Revenue from offshore drilling in American waters was over $7 billion last year, according to the Office of Natural Resources Revenue. Salah Dean Eldarragi, owner of Gulf Ocean Services, an offshore surveying company in Lafayette, La., said, “These companies can’t make any money out there at these prices.” Advertisement
