That is when the San Diego-based Comic-Con and Lionsgate will unveil a free, beta version of their long-planned Comic-Con-themed subscription video service, the two partners said this week.The new, year-round service will be called “Comic-Con HQ,” the companies said in a statement. The beta version will become a paid subscription service in June, in advance of this year’s convention in San Diego, which will run from July 21 through July 24.Comic-Con and Lionsgate did not disclose a price, but they said the service aimed to be “affordable.”In their announcement, the partners said the channel would arrive with a scripted comedy series, called “Kings of Con,” and a pair of unscripted series, called “Impossible Science” and “Her Universe.”Other programming will include entertainment news, convention event coverage and both films and television series licensed from various distributors.The biggest advantage to sampling Comic-Con online? No lines.The second biggest? You can keep a safe distance from that convention center pizza.Advertisement
