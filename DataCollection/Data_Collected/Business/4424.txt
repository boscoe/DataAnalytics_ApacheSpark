LONDON — Trading of shares of Haversham Holdings was suspended on Monday morning as the acquisition vehicle said it was in “very advanced discussions” regarding a takeover.Haversham is in talks to buy the British used-car auctioneer and reseller BCA Marketplace, which is backed by the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, The Sunday Times of London reported. Haversham was putting together an offer worth 1.2 billion pounds, or about $1.77 billion, the newspaper said.Haversham, an investment vehicle, was formed by Avril Palmer-Baunack, the former chairwoman of the British logistics and support services company Stobart Group, and Marwyn, an investment management company. It was listed publicly in London in November.“Trading in Haversham’s ordinary shares has been suspended pending conclusion of these discussions,” Haversham said in a news release on Monday, without naming the target. “There can be no certainty at this time that a transaction will proceed, and we will update shareholders in due course.”AdvertisementHaversham said the transaction would most likely take the form of a reverse takeover, which would allow the acquired company to list its shares publicly.BCA, known as British Car Auctions in Britain, had sought to go public last year. It called off those plans as economic uncertainty weighed on stock markets in the fall and several initial public offerings performed poorly.AdvertisementThe company is one of the largest resellers of used cars through auctions in Europe.BCA operates more than 200 locations in 13 European countries, and it sold more than 900,000 vehicles in 2013. It also operates the brand We Buy Any Car, which purchases automobiles for resale.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
