The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has experimented with different hosts and formats to make the Oscar broadcast entertaining.But in recent years, viewership in America has generally fallen, with only partial rebounds. Ratings have not come near the 55 million who watched in 1998, when the hit “Titanic” swept the awards and Billy Crystal made one of his eight appearances as host. As a rule, more people watch the Oscars telecast when box-office hits are favored or heavily in contention.
This year, viewership for the Academy Awards ceremony was 34.3 million, an eight-year low.

Many of the best picture nominees didn’t come from major studios and thus didn’t have as much advertising muscle. “Brokeback Mountain” was the critics’ favorite and many members of the public were disappointed that it didn’t win best picture even though it was recognized with many other prizes.Host: Ellen DeGeneres Viewers: 40.18 million, a 3% bump from the previous year Best Picture: “The Departed” Host: Jon Stewart returned for a second timeViewers: 32 million, making it the the least-watched Oscar telecast since Nielsen began tracking the data in the 1970sBest Picture: “No Country for Old Men”Notable for: There wasn’t consensus among critics and audiences about the best films.Host: Hugh JackmanViewers: 36.32 millionBest Picture: “Slumdog Millionaire”Notable for: Mr. Jackman was the first the first noncomedian Oscar host in many years, and many awards went to the odds-on favorites.Host: Steve Martin and Alec BaldwinViewers: 41.7 million, up more than 15% from the previous yearBest Picture: “The Hurt Locker”Notable for: For the first time in decades, the Academy expanded its top category to 10 Best Picture nominees. The nominations of popular and populist movies such as “Avatar” helped bring back audiences.Hosts: James Franco and Anne Hathaway Viewers: 38.17 million Best Picture: “The King’s Speech” Notable for: Although the hosts were brought in to inject “fresh, exciting” faces, their performance was widely panned. The film critic Roger Ebert wrote that “this was the worst Oscarcast I’ve ever endured.” Host: Billy Crystal Viewers: 39.34 million Best Picture: “The Artist” Notable for: Mr. Crystal’s appearance provided a much-needed ratings bump. The strong performance of the silent movie “The Artist,” which took home five awards in all, surprised audiences. The academy also further tweaked its guidelines for best picture, saying that between five and 10 movies could be nominated. Host: Seth MacFarlaneViewers: 40.4 million, up 3% from the previous yearBest Picture: “Argo”Notable for: Mr. MacFarlane delivered more ratings but Hollywood expressed unease over his reliance on off-color jokes about race, homosexuality and religion.Host: Ellen DeGeneresViewers: 43.6 millionBest Picture: “12 Years a Slave”Notable for: Ms. DeGeneres interacted with the audience in many ways by offering up pizza and taking a selfie posted on Twitter that broke the record for a retweeted post.Host: Neil Patrick Harris Viewers: 37.3 million Best Picture: “Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance” Notable for: Mr. Harris delivered a lot of musical numbers but some critics regarded his performance as bland and a slog.Audience data from NielsenAdvertisement
