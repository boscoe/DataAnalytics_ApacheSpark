The show, featuring the political journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, will continue to be shown on Bloomberg at 5 p.m. The deal, which takes effect in January, follows recent efforts at MSNBC and Bloomberg Media to revamp their offerings. The deal resulted from an inquiry to Bloomberg from MSNBC, said Justin B. Smith, the chief executive of Bloomberg Media. He declined to specify its terms.Andrew Lack, chairman of NBC News and MSNBC, said in a statement: “I’ve known and respected Mark and John’s work for many years. Collaborating with them on our air will strengthen our already deep and experienced political lineup as MSNBC heads into a pivotal election year.” In response to questions about recent criticism of the show, Mr. Smith said the company was “proud of the show.” He added, “I think there has been a lot of scuttlebutt about people not liking the show, but our owner has gone definitively public, and has put a lot of this gossip to rest,” referring to a statement of support from Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P. and former mayor of New York.Mr. Smith also noted that the show had been expanded to an hour from 30 minutes.Earlier this year, Mr. Halperin apologized for an interview with Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, in which he questioned Mr. Cruz on his Cuban heritage and asked him to speak Spanish. The announcement of the deal confirmed discussions first reported by New York magazine.Advertisement
