Mr. Lewis, who took over in September, cut the company’s dividend and pension plan.Shareholders largely welcomed the moves as a sign that the company, which is also Britain’s biggest private sector employer with 320,000 workers in the country, was finally coming to grips with the threat posed by the discount groups Aldi and Lidl, sending the stock up as much as 10 percent in the biggest one-day jump since 2008.Its bonds, however, fell as debtholders feared the changes might not be enough to prevent downgrades by rating agencies.“There is clearly a long road ahead, but the new C.E.O. is at least showing a determination to make substantive rather than token changes,” said Paras Anand at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which holds a small stake in Tesco.With rating agencies threatening to downgrade Tesco to junk, the group said it would explore a sale of its data company Dunnhumby, halve its investment program to 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) and cut annual costs by £250 million.Tesco’s plan for capital expenditure in 2015-16 of £1 billion compares with the nearly £5 billion it spent as recently as 2008-9.Lower spending and costs will enable the company to lower the prices of hundreds of branded products, after a period when it raised prices to protect profits and confused shoppers with changing promotions.Early moves to cut the prices of some staples like vegetables showed promise, and the group also reported an improvement in trading.Analysts said that Tesco may need to resort to even more price cuts, or sell or spin off more of its businesses. The independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said he wondered whether the eventual verdict on the news would be, “too little, too late.” Advertisement
