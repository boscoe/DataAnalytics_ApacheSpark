WASHINGTON —  New single-family home sales in the United States fell only slightly in January despite big declines in the snow-battered Northeast, while supply rose to its highest level since 2010, hopeful signs for a sluggish housing market.The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that sales dipped 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000 units. December’s sales pace was revised up to 482,000 units, the highest level since June 2008, from 481,000 units.“We are still taking sort of a meandering, bumpy path toward recovery,” said Stephanie Karol, a United States economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Mass.“We expect housing will improve later this year due to the improvement in the labor market and credit conditions.”

Compared with January of 2014, sales were up 5.3 percent.AdvertisementThe housing index rose marginally, outperforming a broadly flat stock market. Shares in Lowe’s, the No. 2 home improvement chain in the United States, fell slightly despite reporting same-store sales well above analysts’ estimates. Increased spending on home renovations also helped Lowes’ larger rival Home Depot post better-than-expected sales and profit on Tuesday.Housing activity has remained lackluster since hitting a speed bump in the second half of 2013, as tight home inventories and higher prices have sidelined first-time buyers, and tepid wage growth also has constrained sales.

Recent data showed a plunge in home resales in January and softer single-family housing starts and permits.The chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, told lawmakers on Tuesday that housing had not “recovered in the way that I would have anticipated.”In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its measure of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, increased 4.6 percent last week, rising for the first time in six weeks.There is more reason to be optimistic on housing. The labor market is gaining steam, and housing activity should be lifted as more people get a paycheck.In addition, home prices are showing signs of accelerating after slowing for much of 2014. That should help more homeowners out of so-called underwater mortgages, giving them more equity in their properties and allowing some to put their houses on the market.A version of this article appears in print on February 26, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Sales of New Homes Dip, but Other Signals Are Strong.
