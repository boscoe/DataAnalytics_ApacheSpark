It was the first full month of sales since the emissions cheating came to light in September.The company’s reputation has suffered further since it admitted last week that it had made exaggerated claims about fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions for about 800,000 vehicles in Europe. That means the company must now go through the embarrassing process of restating the figures for its latest models, which could be damaging to future sales.“The sales drops Volkswagen experienced were expected as the brand and group navigates its way through unprecedented times,” Akshay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in a statement. “Volkswagen’s bottom line will feel the impact for years to come.”While the sales decline in Europe was modest, it was potentially serious for the company because the region accounts for about 30 percent of Volkswagen brand sales worldwide, which totaled 490,000 in October.Volkswagen also continued to suffer from plunging sales in Brazil and Russia because of economic problems in those countries“The Volkswagen passenger cars brand is experiencing challenging times,” Jürgen Stackmann, head of sales for the VW brand, said in a statement. “We not only face the diesel and CO2 issues, but also tense situations on world markets.”Volkswagen said last week that sales of Volkswagen brand cars in the United States were essentially flat in October, even as the overall car market in America soared 14 percent.About half the cars sold in Europe are diesels, far more than in the United States or other major markets. So any problem with diesels is likely to have a more striking effect in Europe than anywhere else. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche and several other car brands, is the biggest automaker in Europe by far.Sales of Volkswagen brand cars in Brazil fell 50 percent during October compared with a month earlier and fell 27 percent in Russia. Sales in China, which account for nearly half of Volkswagen brand sales, rose 2 percent, but that was not enough to compensate for declines elsewhere.Volkswagen sold 30,387 cars in the United States in October, 74 more vehicles than during October 2014. The company has been providing thousands of dollars in incentives to potential buyers to help keep United States sales alive. Because diesels accounted for only about 20 percent of Volkswagen sales in America, the effect of a halt in diesel sales is less significant than in Europe in terms of the absolute number of cars.Volkswagen’s Porsche and Audi units continued to record gains in the United States. As a result, sales of all Volkswagen brands in the United States rose 6 percent during October, to 52,400 vehicles.Volkswagen provided more details Friday about the cars for which it made false claims about fuel economy and emissions of carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming. The company said that 430,000, or a little more than half the total, were from the 2016 model year.The cars for which Volkswagen understated carbon dioxide emissions and overstated fuel economy include its most popular models, including the Volkswagen Golf, Passat, Jetta and Tiguan. The affected cars also include a broad range of models made by Volkswagen’s SEAT and Skoda brands, which are not sold in the United States.One Audi model was included, the A1, a subcompact. No Porsche models were on the list.Volkswagen said it was still trying to determine which older cars are affected. The company said it would cover the cost of repaying tax breaks that car buyers received from European governments, most of which provide incentives for people to buy cars with low carbon dioxide emissions.Advertisement
