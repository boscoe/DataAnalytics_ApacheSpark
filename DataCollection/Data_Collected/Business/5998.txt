It was the largest gain since December.Small businesses historically have accounted for half of private gross domestic product.The economy is clawing back after being hit by a mix of bad weather, disruptions at ports, a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies.Data on employment and consumer sentiment have suggested a pickup in growth momentum at the start of the second quarter, but the dollar and lower oil prices continue to weigh on manufacturing.Nine of the 10 components of the federation’s index rose last month, with the exception of sales.“In spite of the dramatic reversal of economic activity in the energy sector, owners in the shale states remained substantially more aggressive than their counterparts in the other states,” the group said in a statement.Overall business investment has sagged. Energy companies cut capital expenditure budgets and laid off thousands of workers as lower energy prices undermined exploration and drilling activity.The federation’s survey of 1,500 companies found that 60 percent reported capital outlays, a postrecession high. Of those making expenditures, 44 percent said they had bought new equipment, up four percentage points. About 26 percent of owners planned capital outlays in the next three to six months, up two percentage points.This bolsters views that the bulk of the energy spending cuts were front-loaded into the first quarter and hopes that capital spending outside the energy sector will spring back.The government initially estimated that the economy grew at a rate of  0.2 percent in the first quarter. Data on trade and wholesale inventories, however, suggest the economy contracted in the first three months of the year.The federation’s survey also found an increase in the number of owners saying that stocks of goods were too low and that they had plans to increase inventory investment. This could be positive for growth in the second quarter after businesses amassed huge stocks at the start of the year, which was seen as at least partly unintended.Owners were downbeat on sales, but surprisingly optimistic about earnings. The survey’s labor market indicators showed further signs that the job market was tightening; there was an increase in the share of owners saying they could not find qualified workers for open job positions.The Labor Department report said job openings in March slipped 150,000 to five million, in line with weak payroll growth that month. Openings were up 18.6 percent from a year ago, however, and the overall trend painted a solid employment picture.There was an increase in the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, a sign of confidence in the labor market."Confidence in the labor market has obviously returned,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “People are quitting their jobs because they have options and opportunities."Advertisement
