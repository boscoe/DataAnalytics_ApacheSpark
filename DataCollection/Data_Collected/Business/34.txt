The judges also ruled that a court-mandated expert should review the data and submit a report.The court case in France highlights the regulatory maze that Uber, which is now valued at $50 billion, must face as it aims to become a global transport juggernaut. While many of its users applaud the ride-booking service for its ability to offer an alternative to the traditional taxi, Uber has become a target of rivals and global policy makers who believe the company is playing fast and loose with existing transport regulations.UberPop, the company’s cheapest ride-hailing option, is illegal in France since a transportation law passed in 2014 because it connects users of its smartphone app with drivers who do not have a professional license to pick up paying customers.The executives standing trial — Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty and Thibaud Simphal — were read charges on counts of deceptive commercial practices, complicity in operating an illegal transportation service and illegally organizing taxi services by a panel of three judges in a criminal court that specializes in economic offenses. They were questioned by the police and charged in June.Mr. Gore-Coty, Uber’s general manager for Western Europe, and Mr. Simphal, general manager at Uber France, could face up to two years in prison and up to 300,000 euros, or about $337,000, in fines for these charges.But defense lawyers at the hearing, held in an ornate courtroom at the Palais de Justice in central Paris, focused much of their initial attention on other charges, filing motion after motion to dismiss them and have the trial postponed.Those charges, which carry heavier prison sentences of up to five years, involve the illegal storage and processing of personal data — mainly client and driver information — beyond the legal time limit and the illegal storage of personal data relating to criminal arrests and records.The company kept track of UberPop drivers’ arrests and fines after it refused to shut down the service following the passage of the transportation law. Uber suspended the service in July.Before the postponement, the judges rejected a motion by Eric Dezeuze, a defense lawyer, that questioned the constitutionality of the charges. Mr. Dezeuze and his colleagues repeatedly claimed that the case was “hastily” brought to trial after violent summer protests in France and under pressure from the French government, which they said had “given in” to the taxi lobby.Prosecutors rejected the claims and accused the defense of seeking a delay to avoid discussion on the case’s merits.The problems facing Uber’s executives in France are only the latest in the long list of woes that have confronted the ride-booking company. Policy makers and taxi associations from San Francisco to Seoul have questioned the legality of some of Uber’s services, how it manages the drivers who use its online platform, and whether the company represents unfair competition for traditional taxi operators.Those tensions, particularly in Europe, were on show this week after Dutch authorities raided Uber’s European headquarters in Amsterdam on Tuesday, the second time the country has taken such actions in a continuing criminal investigation into the company’s operations there.Transport officials in London, one of Uber’s largest markets outside the United States, have proposed new rules over how ride-booking services can operate in the British capital. The new rules, which are still being completed, could require a five-minute waiting period before Uber can pick up a passenger. London policy makers also are mulling proposals that would allow anyone to prebook a taxi through Uber and other ride-hailing services, something that analysts said could cause additional regulatory headaches for the companies.Uber opponents got a boost last week after France’s constitutional high court ruled that the country’s transport law was legal. Uber had argued before the Constitutional Council of France that the transport law gives too much sway to traditional taxi services.Taken aback by the protests, Uber has been trying to mend fences with French politicians, who have singled out the American service for particular scrutiny.After starting its French operations in late 2011, senior Uber executives at first did not reach out to French policy makers, unlike their counterparts at Airbnb, an on-demand service for vacation rentals, who took particular effort to work with Paris-based officials. That stance has changed in recent months. Several of the company’s senior executives have met with the country’s leading lawmakers in the hopes of finding a solution that would allow the company to again offer its low-cost service in France.Uber has continued to offer its other services, including those that rely on licensed taxi drivers.Aurelien Breeden reported from Paris and Mark Scott from Rome.Advertisement
