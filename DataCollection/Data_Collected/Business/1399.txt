Lew urged legislative action on the issue.“Treasury cannot stop inversions without new statutory authority,” Mr. Lew said in the letter, addressed to Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the committee’s ranking member.Corporate inversions have stoked controversy, renewing debate on corporate tax reform. Last year, the Treasury took action under the tax code to reduce the economic incentives of using an inversion, making it harder for companies to use cash they have accumulated in overseas operations.The letter on Wednesday did not specify what new proposals were coming.“We will continue to review our existing authorities to identify additional ways to address this serious problem,” the letter said. “Until Congress acts, creative accountants and lawyers will continue to find new ways for companies to move their tax residences overseas and avoid paying taxes here at home.”The letter was also sent to Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, and the head of the House Ways and Means Committee; and Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan, the Ways and Means Committee’s ranking member.The recent news that Pfizer and Allergan, whose tax domicile is in Ireland, have had discussions about a possible merger has refueled the debate on the tactic. A takeover could allow Pfizer to cut its 25 percent tax rate by moving its headquarters to Europe.Pfizer tried a similar inversion last year through a proposed combination with the British drug maker AstraZeneca, but walked away from that offer. That and a wave of other attempted and successful inversions prompted the government to crack down on tax loopholes and other incentives.Advertisement
