The sandwich, called the Most American Thickburger, is a beef patty topped by a split hot dog, resting on a layer of Lay’s kettle-cooked potato chips between hamburger buns. The item will sell for $5.79 and contain 1,030 calories, with 64 grams of fat. The Thickburger goes on sale May 20. Brad Haley, chief marketing officer of CKE Restaurants, the owner of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, said, “We’ve had this idea, believe it or not, for a long time.” Fast-food chains have for years been trying to outdo one another with outrageous menu items to stand out.
