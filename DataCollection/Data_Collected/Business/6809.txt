Foreign holdings of United States Treasury securities fell in April for the first time since October. Total holdings slipped to $6.14 trillion, from $6.18 trillion in March, down 0.6 percent, the Treasury Department reported Monday. China, the No. 1 foreign holder of United States government debt, lifted its holdings a slight 0.2 percent to $1.26 trillion in April following a 3 percent rise in the previous month. Japan, which had briefly surpassed China as the top debt holder, trimmed its holdings by 0.9 percent in April to $1.22 trillion. Demand for United States government debt is expected to remain strong this year. Treasury securities are viewed as a safe haven during times of turbulence in other markets, and traders expect interest rates to begin gradually rising this year.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
