Price cuts and better service helped Tesco win back shoppers in its latest quarter, Britain’s biggest retailer said on Friday, suggesting that the turnaround plan of the new boss, Dave Lewis, is starting to have an impact. Tesco has had a terrible 18 months, with competition from the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, compounded by an accounting scandal, driving it to a record annual loss. But Mr. Lewis has cut prices on popular grocery brands, improved product availability and put more employees in stores. Tesco said sales at British shops open for more than a year fell 1.3 percent in the 13 weeks to May 30, its fiscal first quarter. That partly reflected a drop in food prices across the industry. But that was better than analysts’ forecasts for a fall of 1.6 to 3.0 percent, and an improvement on the previous quarter, and it also was better than recent figures from its rivals Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons. Tesco also said 180,000 more customers shopped at its stores in Britain in the quarter, with the volume of goods sold up 1.4 percent on a like-for-like basis and transactions up 1.3 percent. Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail researchers Conlumino, said, “Stemming the defection of consumers is the first, and arguably the most important, battle to be won.”A version of this brief appears in print on June 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Improved Service and Price Cuts Lure Tesco Shoppers .
