The youth apparel retailer said Friday it would stop using use shirtless male models at store openings and events and would remove “sexualized” images from ads and shopping bags.The policy change reflects part of Abercrombie’s struggle to become relevant again as the tastes of teenage shoppers change. Net sales at Abercrombie slumped almost 10 percent to $3.7 billion for the just-ended fiscal year.“A.&F., which was once the cool kid at school, has come to look outmoded and awkward,” Neil Saunders, managing director of the New York-based Conlumino retail consultancy, said in an email.“The new generation eschews heavily branded products emblazoned with logos, instead preferring more understated pieces,” he said. “The brash advertising and marketing that characterized A.&F. for years and marked it out as something of an exclusive brand is very much out of step with today’s more sensitive shopper.”Abercrombie also said that store employees would no longer be hired based on body type or physical attractiveness, and would be called “brand representatives” instead of models. Abercrombie’s Hollister brand will also no longer use shirtless lifeguards, the company said.Instead, the new guidelines for store employees call for them to look “neat, clean, natural and well-groomed.” Excessive jewelry, obscene or large tattoos and bright-colored makeup are now also taboo, as are piercings “in locations other than earlobes.”“It is important that we have guidelines to maintain an appropriate standard in our stores,” the retailer says in the guidelines.By the end of July, Abercrombie will also no longer use sexualized marketing in ads, in-store photos, gift cards or shopping bags, the retailer said.Shoppers who appreciate a little bare skin with their shopping will not be completely deprived, however.According to Abercrombie, bare, toned abs will still grace Abercrombie’s Fierce cologne.Advertisement
