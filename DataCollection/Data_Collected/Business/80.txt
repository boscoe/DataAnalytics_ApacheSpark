News of slower hiring last month jolted the market early Friday, driving government bonds up and the dollar down. But stocks, after slumping in early trading, finished the day with a solid gain.A jump in crude oil helped turn things around, as Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other oil giants charged higher.

The Fed has only two meetings left to make a move this year: one this month and another in December.The government reported that employers added 142,000 workers last month, much lower than the 200,000 anticipated on Wall Street. Employers also hired fewer people in July and August than previously thought.
