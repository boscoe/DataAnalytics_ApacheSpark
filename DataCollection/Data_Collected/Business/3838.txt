LONDON — The British government has further reduced its stake in the Lloyds Banking Group, the bank said on Monday.In December, the government announced that it would engage in a measured sale of a portion of its stake as part of a prearranged trading plan with Morgan Stanley that runs through the end of June.The British government took significant stakes in Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland after the banks received billions of pounds as part of a bailout during the financial crisis.On Monday, Lloyds said that the government reduced its stake in the company to 23.9 percent. The British government had a 24.9 percent stake in the bank when it announced the new trading program in December.Advertisement“Today’s announcement shows further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back,” a Lloyds spokesman said. “This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.”AdvertisementThe government held as much as a 40 percent stake in the British lender, but it had previously reduced its stake through two sales to institutional shareholders since September 2013.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
