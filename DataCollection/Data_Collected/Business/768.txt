The website Gawker named Alex Pareene its editor in chief on Tuesday, ending a search of several months. Mr. Pareene, 30, a longtime Gawker writer and editor who has also had stints at Salon and First Look Media, replaces Max Read, who resigned in July after the website was criticized for an article it published about a married male media executive seeking to set up a liaison with a male escort. Facing the prospect of losing advertisers, Gawker withdrew the article, which prompted Mr. Read and Tommy Craggs, the executive editor of Gawker Media, to resign in protest. Gawker’s founder, Nick Denton, vowed in a series of public statements to make the website nicer and less like a tabloid in its sensibilities. John Cook, who was appointed to replace Mr. Craggs, said in a memo to staff members on Tuesday that Mr. Pareene would “soon have more to say about the direction he intends to take Gawker in over the coming years, but you can expect satire, wit and reporting on the grievous state of our political class.”A version of this brief appears in print on October 28, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Gawker Appoints a Top Editor After Summer Resignations .
