The insurance company American International Group reported a 5.6 percent increase in quarterly operating profit, driven by investments in one of China’s biggest insurers, the People’s Insurance Group of China Limited, as well as earnings from the aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings N.V. A.I.G., the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, also increased its share buyback program by up to $5 billion, and more than doubled its quarterly dividend to 28 cents a share. Operating income after tax increased to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share, in the second quarter, from $1.8 billion, or $1.23 per diluted share, a year earlier.The operating income was bumped up by pretax earnings that more than doubled, to $127 million, from AerCap, the world’s largest independent aircraft lessor. A.I.G., which is trying to exit AerCap, sold most of its 46 percent stake in early June.The insurer, which began in a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People’s Insurance Group of China Limited, PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited. However, A.I.G.’s underwriting operations struggled with plummeting commercial property and casualty insurance rates. Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent, to $1.19 billion, in its commercial property and casualty insurance business, typically a strength. The insurer also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. A.I.G.’s stock closed at $64.14 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
