More Americans bought new homes in April — evidence that the stronger job market is helping the housing market. The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new home sales climbed 6.8 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 517,000. Sales recovered from a 10 percent dip in March to an annual pace of 484,000. In addition, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5 percent in March from 12 months earlier, S.&P. said Tuesday. Prices increased at the same pace in February. Home values are rising at a faster rate than incomes, potentially pricing many would-be buyers out of the market. But the increases have moderated from the double-digit gains of late 2013 and early last year.A version of this brief appears in print on May 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: New Home Sales Rose 6.8%. in April After Decline in March.
