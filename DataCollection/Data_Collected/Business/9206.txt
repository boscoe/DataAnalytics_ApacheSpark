McDonald’s will offer its first 100 percent organic beef hamburger ever for a limited time in Germany as the company revamps its food-sourcing practices. It is part of an effort by the new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, to transform it into a “modern, progressive burger company.” From Oct. 1 to Nov. 18, McDonald’s will offer “McB” burgers, made from organic beef sourced from organic farms in Germany and Austria. “We have made a great effort to secure sufficient quantities of meat which satisfies the organic requirements and our own quality claims,” said Holger Beeck, chief executive of McDonald’s Germany. A McDonald’s spokeswoman in the United States declined to say if the company would offer the burger in other markets.A version of this brief appears in print on September 26, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mcdonald’s to Serve an Organic Burger in Germany.
