Shortly after the financial crisis, even merger bankers and lawyers — among the most optimistic lot on Wall Street — fretted that the good times might never come back.Now those advisers can’t stop working, even as some are privately fretting that the merger cycle has hit its peak — or that an unforeseen crisis could end the party.The number and dollar volume of deals announced in the first half in 2015 have not just surpassed those of last year, which was a healthy one for corporate transactions by any standard. They are also on pace to catch up with 2007, the last year of unbridled merger optimism before the financial crisis quieted Wall Street.Nearly 20,000 deals worth $2.2 trillion have been announced this year as of June 29, according to data from Thomson Reuters. That is about 40 percent higher, in terms of dollar value, than the first half of 2014. And it approached the $2.3 trillion worth of deals announced in the first half of 2007, still remembered as one of the most buoyant times for mergers — just before the first shocks of the global debt crisis hit.AdvertisementBankers and lawyers say that their “pipelines” — their backlog of pending transactions — are more stuffed than ever, claims that are both braggadocio and an acknowledgment of the sheer numbers of companies weighing mergers and acquisitions.Advertisement“What’s been remarkable has been the consistent appetite within boards and management teams for more growth,” Chris Ventresca, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase, said in an interview.But while deal makers sound hopeful about the merger boom continuing through the end of the year, some worry that something might arise to derail the good times. Possible contenders include Greece or another unpredictable event like the “flash crash” that roiled the markets in May 2010.Driving much of the activity is the continued consolidation among huge swaths of industry. The biggest merger announced so far this year was Royal Dutch Shell’s $70 billion takeover of the BG Group, a deal that had been rumored for years.Much of the consolidation this year has arisen within the worlds of telecommunications and health care, where many of the big players have felt compelled to become even bigger by swallowing up competitors. Charter Communications, for instance, finally succeeded in making a deal to buy Time Warner Cable after an aborted takeover run last year.

And the biggest American health insurers are circling one another, eager to find a merger partner to help cut costs and bolster their presence in lucrative areas like Medicare. Anthem has proposed buying Cigna for $47 billion; Humana is weighing takeover approaches from the likes of Aetna and Cigna; and UnitedHealthcare has expressed interest in buying Aetna.Adding special urgency to their deliberations is the possibility of being left out, since government regulators are likely to allow only some, not all, efforts among health insurers to combine.Deal makers say that as companies have exhausted other ways to drive up their stock prices, such as stock buybacks and special dividends, they have turned to mergers to try to jump-start growth.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Investors have rewarded many acquirers by pushing up their stock prices after a transaction is announced.AdvertisementAnd to pay for a deal, companies have made use of both cheap debt, still plentiful seven years after the financial crisis, and rising stock valuations that have made them more comfortable using some of their shares.“Confidence is king, and we’re getting closer to normal,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a recent report on merger activity.At the same time, buyers appear to be more disciplined about the prices they are willing to pay. The price multiple — the ratio of total enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of deals struck in the first half of this year is lower on average than at the same time last year, at 16.3 times compared with 19.9 times, according to an analysis by Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. (The lone exception is the health care industry, where the average price multiple has been 20.6 times.)“They’re not just doing deals for the sake of deal-making,” Mr. Ventresca said of acquirers. “What we’re starting to see now is buyers being a little more disciplined.”Among financial advisers, Goldman is leading the pack in worldwide activity, with 213 deals worth $672 billion, as of June 29. The firm was followed by Morgan Stanley, with $569 billion worth of activity, and JPMorgan, with $476 billion.Among law firms, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom led the league tables with 132 deals worth $433 billion. Next came Cravath, Swaine & Moore, with $370 billion, and Latham & Watkins, with $350 billion.A version of this article appears in print on July 1, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: On Wall Street, Cautious Optimism as Merger Deals Near Peak Level .
