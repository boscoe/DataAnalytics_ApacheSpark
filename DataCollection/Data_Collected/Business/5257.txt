Saudi Arabia’s stock market regulator, the Capital Market Authority, says foreign investors will be allowed to trade shares on the kingdom’s Tadawul exchange beginning on June 15. The announcement on Thursday had been eagerly awaited by investors seeking to tap into the Arab world’s largest economy. The Saudi government last year approved a measure to open the Tadawul to direct foreign investment. Foreign investors outside the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council can now buy Saudi stocks only indirectly, such as through exchange-traded funds. The exchange is the largest among the Persian Gulf states, and it hosts shares of a number of major Saudi companies, including one of the world’s largest petrochemical groups, Saudi Basic Industries.A version of this brief appears in print on April 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Saudi Exchange to Permit Trading by Foreign Investors.
