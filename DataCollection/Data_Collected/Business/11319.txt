But one venture capital firm is still betting that it can profitably put a huge amount of capital to work.Norwest Venture Partners plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised a new $1.2 billion fund, less than two years after it collected roughly the same amount of money for its last fund.Of course, much has changed since then: Initial public offerings for technology darlings have sputtered, while onetime highfliers have begun to raise new rounds of capital at lower valuations, in much-feared “down rounds” that may signal weakness.(For example, Gilt Groupe — in which Norwest was an investor — sold itself to Saks this month for about $250 million, a quarter of a previous valuation.)Yet Promod Haque, Norwest’s senior managing partner, argued that plenty of opportunity for profit still existed, even as he acknowledged the challenges facing the start-up industry.“Yes, valuations are a challenge,” he said in a telephone interview. But he quickly added that in general the firm did not invest in the much-ballyhooed “unicorn” class of companies with valuations of at least $1 billion.But Mr. Haque pointed to the continued growth in enterprise software companies and health care information technology businesses.He also argued that Norwest was well positioned, since it invests in companies as varied as brand-new start-ups and bigger “growth equity” companies looking for bigger checks to spur their growth. The growth equity companies in particular tend to be established Midwestern companies with proven business models, rather than flashy denizens of the Bay Area or New York.That diversity of investment targets, he argued, helped minimize the firm’s exposure to any one weak sector.Mr. Haque also pointed to 22 Norwest portfolio companies that have gone public since the firm last raised money, naming the security services provider FireEye and the Internet-based lender Lending Club as examples.But FireEye has fallen roughly 59 percent since its I.P.O., while Lending Club has tumbled nearly 71 percent. (To be fair, Norwest was an early investor in both companies.)Mr. Haque said that because Norwest still concentrated much of its work in earlier-stage investments, its overall percentage of a highflier would be small, mitigating some problems down the road.Still, he said of Gilt’s low-priced sale, “That’s something we have to worry about.”Advertisement
