In the 12 months through February, it fell 0.6 percent, the first decline since the series was revamped in 2009. Economists had forecast an increase of 0.3 percent last month to a level unchanged from a year ago.Prices for United States government debt gained marginally on the inflation data. United States stock indexes fell sharply, as a strong dollar threatened to erode the profits of multinational companies and tumbling crude prices pressured energy firms. While the weak inflation backdrop would normally be associated with a struggling economy, there appears to be little reason to worry, given the fairly robust labor market.“We would not take the producer prices report as a sign that the economy is secretly rotten if you pull back the tarp and take a look at the hull,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “The economy is creating millions of jobs.” A separate report from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index fell 4.2 points, to 91.2, in early March. Lower- and middle-income households said harsh winter weather had left them with high utility bills and disrupted shopping and general business activity.The inflation data came ahead of next week’s Fed meeting, where policy makers are widely expected to signal the United States central bank’s openness to a June rate increase by dropping a pledge to be “patient” in considering such a move because of strength in the labor market. As price pressures remain muted and retail sales extend their decline in February, the Fed could delay the move until September.“The Fed is probably going to hike even if inflation stays low, whether it’s June or September, because they are confident about the strong labor market conditions ultimately leading to higher inflation,” said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.Services accounted for 70 percent of the decline in the price index last month. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, fell a record 1.5 percent in February.It was pulled down by a 13.4 percent drop in margins at gasoline service stations, reflecting a recent plunge in prices at the pump. Profit margins also fell for apparel, footwear and jewelry retailers, as well as for food and alcohol.There were also declines in machinery, equipment, parts and supplies wholesale margins, signs that a strong dollar — it has appreciated more than 17 percent since July on a trade-weighted basis — was helping to keep a lid on inflation.A 1.5 percent drop in transportation and warehousing services also weighed on producer prices last month. An important measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged after a record 0.3 percent drop in January.“It suggests that the stronger dollar and second-round effects from the decline in energy are still suppressing pipeline inflation,” said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in New York.
