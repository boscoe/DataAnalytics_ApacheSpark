Even as stock markets again tumbled across the world, deal makers — among the most optimistic lot on Wall Street — aren’t ready yet to call an end to one of the biggest waves of mergers and initial public offerings in recent memory.Prolonged market uncertainty, however, could bring a close to what has been a phenomenal time for the business of buying and selling companies.Underpinning that business is a sense of trust that the prices discussed are fair and that such a move is the best way to finance further growth. Sharp gyrations in the broad stock markets could serve to unnerve the corporate chieftains responsible for making those decisions.“Whenever you see this kind of turmoil in the market, it can shake people’s confidence,” said Kenneth M. Jacobs, the chief executive of Lazard. “You could see a pause until the dust settles and conditions become clearer.”AdvertisementThe turbulence that arose out of China and swept across the globe coincides with an unusually powerful boom time for Wall Street firms busy arranging for companies to be sold or listed on the public markets.AdvertisementRoughly $2.9 trillion worth of mergers had been announced worldwide through the end of last week, according to Thomson Reuters, up 40 percent from the same time a year ago. And while initial public offerings have declined 19 percent from the same time in 2014, the $116.6 billion raised so far this year is still a high level.Many of the factors that have underpinned the huge boom in mergers have stayed in place, advisers say. The cost of borrowing money remains cheap, letting buyers take on debt to take over their targets.The enemy of continued deal-making is not necessarily a sustained decline in share prices, according to Rob A. Kindler, a vice chairman and the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. If stocks fall to a new, lower level and stay there, they would represent a new normal that management teams and their advisers could work with.
                A look at the last five times the stock market lost 5 percent in a week.            A steep drop in prices could actually benefit one group of deal makers who have largely sat out the big merger boom: private equity firms, who have routinely been outbid by corporate buyers able to pay more for targets. But some bankers say that the stock markets would have to tumble significantly for leveraged buyouts to come back in a meaningful way.What would pose a problem are erratic shifts — a sharp plunge in the markets one day, a swift rebound the next. That would make any ability to price a takeover more difficult.“The market having a correction, that’s probably neutral for M.&A.,” Mr. Kindler said. “But if there continues to be volatility, with big swings, that’s going to be a difficult M.&A. environment.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Stock-for-stock transactions, which revolve around particular share exchange ratios rather than specific prices, would be largely unaffected by broad market movements. But those involving a big proportion of cash — which is to say, a majority of transactions struck these days — might prompt some hesitation to determine whether a given price is acceptable.For now, bankers and lawyers said that their stables of pending deals remained strong. Several big takeovers were disclosed Monday morning, including the Southern Company‘s $8 billion acquisition of a fellow power utility, AGL Resources, and the $3 billion sale of the department store chain Belk to a private equity firm.AdvertisementAnd a number of prominent private companies are lining up to go public within the next few months. Among them are First Data, the big credit card processor, and Square, the smaller payments company co-founded by Jack Dorsey, the chairman of Twitter.Advisers to companies seeking to go public point out that relatively few I.P.O.s take place in the waning days of summer, when many investors decamp for vacation. Such offerings tend to pick up again after Labor Day.So many hopeful market debutantes will most likely continue to file the paperwork necessary for an initial offering, according to Stacy J. Kanter, a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. They can then wait until the markets improve to proceed with their stock sales.“What I always tell clients is, ‘It’s important to be ready for the appropriate market window,’ ” she said. “As long as we’re not having a wild ride of ups and downs, I suspect we’ll see an I.P.O. or two the week after Labor Day.”A version of this article appears in print on August 25, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Uncertainty in the Market May Imperil Deal-Making.
