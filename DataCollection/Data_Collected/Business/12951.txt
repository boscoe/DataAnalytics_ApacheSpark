AccorHotels, one of Europe’s largest hotel groups, announced on Tuesday that it had bought Onefinestay, a London-based short-term vacation rental company, for 148 million euros, or $169 million.The move is the latest effort by AccorHotels to expand into the so-called sharing economy after companies like Airbnb, the vacation rental website now valued at roughly $24 billion, have made it more popular for people to turn to forms of accommodation other than hotels when traveling on vacation or on business.In February, AccorHotels announced it had bought a minority stake in Oasis Collections, another short-term vacation site.As part of the latest deal, AccorHotels said it would invest a further $73 million to expand Onefinestay’s worldwide presence in vacation rentals.Advertisement“We can help them do in two years what would have taken them seven,” said Sébastien Bazin, AccorHotels’ chief executive. “It’s a recognition that the sharing economy can offer our customers a unique experience.”AdvertisementThe deal will give AccorHotels, based in Paris, control of Onefinestay’s stable of roughly 2,600 luxury properties that it manages on behalf of their owners.Just like its larger rival Airbnb, Onefinestay allows people in certain cities like New York and London to rent out their houses whenever they want. But unlike the United States company, Onefinestay oversees each rental, providing toiletries, bedding and other amenities to serve the high-end house rental market.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Among them is the artificial intelligence company SwiftKey, purchased by Microsoft for a reported $250 million in a deal announced in February.Greg Marsh, Onefinestay’s co-founder, though, dismissed such fears, saying that his company had several potential funding options before choosing to sell to AccorHotels. The start-up is expected to continue operating as a separate entity.“It’s the start of a new chapter,” said Mr. Marsh, who will continue running the business. “We could have continued expanding ourselves. But we were looking for someone who could help us grow.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
