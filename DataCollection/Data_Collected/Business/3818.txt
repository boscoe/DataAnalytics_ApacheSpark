AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedChegg, the textbook rental service, is planning a big reinvention of its operations a little more than a year after going public.The company announced on Monday that it planned to stop managing the physical books that it rented out to students, and completely hand off that part of the business to the Ingram Content Group, a big book distributor, by the end of next year.Customers will still use the company to order textbooks, as well as higher-margin digital services like e-textbooks, test preparation materials and career counseling.Driving the move is the desire to relieve the biggest pressure on the company’s stock: the realization that its practice of maintaining physical textbooks was becoming obsolete. Shares in Chegg have fallen about 30 percent since its initial public offering in November 2013.Housing and shipping the books of geometry and history lessons was consuming nearly all of Chegg’s working capital, while competitors like Amazon.com were muscling into the business.By expanding an existing but limited partnership with Ingram that was unveiled last year, Chegg will focus on arguably the more important part of its business, its ties to students.“This focuses Chegg,” Dan Rosensweig, the company’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview. “This takes a big headache off the table and allows our investors to enjoy what a digital company can do.”The move has the potential to improve Chegg’s financials significantly. Its gross margins are expected to leap from about 30 percent to more than 60 percent, according to the company, while its annual sales growth is expected to rise from 20 percent to over 25 percent. All of its working capital can now be deployed to the faster-growing digital services instead of maintaining its existing warehouse in Kentucky.It is a business shift that Mr. Rosensweig likened to Netflix’s drift away from DVD rentals to streaming video, or Adobe’s move away from physical software packages to online software and services.“Netflix has been a role model from Day 1,” Mr. Rosensweig said, joking that the video rental service company still maintains a toehold in delivering physical goods while his own business will complete its own transformation in far less time.So crucial is the shift, Mr. Rosensweig said, that the company will dispatch executives on a two-week series of meetings with investors in a half-dozen cities, pitching Chegg as a digital Internet company that deserves a higher stock valuation.“It’s almost like re-I.P.O.-ing the company,” he said.Advertisement
