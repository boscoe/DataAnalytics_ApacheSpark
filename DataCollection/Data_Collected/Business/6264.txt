In the 12 months through April, the index fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009. In the 12 months through March, it dipped 0.1 percent.The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.3 percent, the largest rise since January 2013. The advance in March was 0.2 percent.In the 12 months through April, the core C.P.I. advanced 1.8 percent after a similar gain in March.A fading dollar rally also was seen keeping core inflation on an upward trend. The dollar surged about 15 percent against the currencies of the main American trading partners between June last year and mid-March. It has handed back some of those gains and is now up only 10 percent.“If sustained, that should help weakness in core goods prices continue to moderate,” said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.The overall C.P.I. edged up 0.1 percent last month after increasing 0.2 percent in March. It was held back by a 1.7 percent drop in gasoline prices and no change in food prices. In the 12 months through April, the C.P.I. fell 0.2 percent, the largest decline since October 2009, after dipping 0.1 percent in March.Core inflation was lifted by a 0.3 percent increase in shelter costs, which followed a similar gain in March.Shelter inflation could continue to increase in the months ahead as rising household formation lifts demand for housing. That, together with a tightening labor market, should put upward pressure on the core C.P.I.Advertisement
