That trend is likely to persist. Early reports on Tuesday showing that automobile sales were on track to be the strongest in 14 years.The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods declined 1 percent in September after a downwardly revised 2.1 percent drop in August. Factory orders were previously reported to have declined 1.7 percent in August.Orders for automobiles and parts rose 1.5 percent in September after falling 2 percent in August.Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, is also being constrained by efforts by businesses to reduce inventory and by tepid global demand. But the worst could be over for the sector after a report on Monday showed that new orders rose in October for the first time since July.The dollar has gained 16.8 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014, which has undercut export growth and weighed on the profits of multinational corporations like Procter & Gamble and 3M.At the same time, a plunge in oil prices has pressured revenue for oil field companies like Schlumberger and the diversified manufacturer Caterpillar.The factory orders report also showed a 0.4 percent drop in manufacturing inventories, which was bigger than the government had assumed for its advance third-quarter gross domestic product estimate published last week.Economists said the decline in factory inventory suggested that the third-quarter G.D.P. estimate could be lowered by at least 0.1 percentage point to a 1.4 percent annual pace when the government publishes its first revision this month.Still, the September drop in factory inventories is an encouraging sign for the industry as it suggests that orders will rise in the months ahead.“A steady pace of liquidation will eventually boost output as orders move closer to sales and input utilization levels,” said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.The Commerce Department also reported that orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft — seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans — slipped 0.1 percent instead of the 0.3 percent drop reported last month.This also supports the view that the worst of the manufacturing slump might be over. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the G.D.P. report, increased 0.5 percent in September as reported last month.Advertisement
