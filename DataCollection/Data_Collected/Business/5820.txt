Whole Foods Market said on Wednesday that same-store sales growth cooled in the latest quarter, even as it cut prices further and introduced its first national advertising campaign. Same-store sales, a closely watched performance gauge for retailers, rose 3.6 percent for the second quarter, which ended April 12, compared with a year earlier. That was slower than the 4.5 percent growth in the first quarter and less than the 5.3 percent gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Whole Foods shares tumbled almost 11 percent in after-hours trading.A version of this brief appears in print on May 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Whole Foods Growth Slows Despite Price Cuts and Ads .
