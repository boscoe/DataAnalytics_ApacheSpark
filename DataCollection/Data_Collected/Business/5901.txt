Revenue from shipping and package delivery services helped prop up the United States Postal Service’s finances in the second fiscal quarter of 2015, but the agency continued to lose money as mail volumes tumbled. The post office on Friday reported a net loss of $1.5 billion in the quarter that ran from January through March, down from the same period last year, when it lost $1.9 billion. The mail carrier, which had a 2.1 percent decline in the volumes of first-class and standard mail, has focused on building its package delivery services to take advantage of the growth in e-commerce. That effort appears to be paying off as shipping and package volumes rose 14.4 percent in the second quarter, increasing operating revenue by $223 million, to $16.9 billion. Without a retiree health benefit prefunding requirement, the agency said, its net loss would have been $44 million in the second quarter.A version of this brief appears in print on May 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Postal Service Cuts Loss to $1.5 Billion.
