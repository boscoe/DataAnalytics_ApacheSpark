Last summer, The Times passed one million digital subscribers; paid digital-only subscriptions now stand at 1,041,000.The company reported adjusted earnings of 9 cents a share, beating analysts’ forecasts of 6 cents a share.Digital advertising, an important component of the company’s plan to double digital revenue to $800 million by 2020, decreased 5 percent.Mark Thompson, the company’s chief executive, said that it had been the company’s “best advertising quarter of the year” despite that decline. He described the quarter as strong and said that the company remained bullish about its digital advertising business and expected it to return to growth in the fourth quarter.Print advertising revenue, the traditional bedrock of most newspapers, declined by less than 1 percent, a less precipitous fall than has been the case for The Times and other publications, as print advertising drops across the industry.Operating costs decreased 8 percent, driven by declines in severance payments, depreciation and amortization, and efficiencies and reductions in print costs. Severance costs, which had been a drag on profit a year ago, were $1 million in the quarter, compared with $21.4 million in the same period last year, when charges related to buyouts and layoffs were included in third-quarter earnings.Digital-only circulation revenue grew about 14 percent to $49 million; overall circulation revenue increased by 1.1 percent to $209 million, a result of the rise in digital subscribers and an increase in home delivery prices that offset a decline in print copies sold.Over all, total revenue was 0.7 percent higher from the year-ago quarter’s $365 million.Revenue from other sources, such as the company’s crossword product and rental income, was up 16 percent.In a call with investors, Mr. Thompson said that the digital subscription number had surpassed the company’s expectations, and credited improved acquisition and retention initiatives. The company has started new digital advertising initiatives, he said, which seem poised to grow despite the rise of ad-blocking software on smartphones.The company’s chief financial officer, James M. Follo, said that circulation revenue was expected to increase in the fourth quarter of the year, with about 40,000 additional digital subscribers possible, an increase partly offset by declines in print. Overall advertising revenue will most likely be down slightly, though the company expects growth in digital advertising revenue “in the mid-single digits,” he said.The company’s stock was up about 1.6 percent by the early afternoon.Advertisement
