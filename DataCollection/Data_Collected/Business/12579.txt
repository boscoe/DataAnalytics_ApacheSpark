HONG KONG — The Australian port operator Qube has teamed up with a competing bidder and other partners to buy the port and rail operator Asciano for about $6.8 billion.Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, a Toronto-based investment firm that was previously competing with Qube, is now part of a consortium offering 9.15 Australian dollars, or $6.90, a share for Asciano for a total of about 9 billion dollars. Asciano shares closed 1.4 percent higher on Tuesday, at 8.99 dollars.Asciano’s board has recommended the deal to its shareholders, and the transaction is expected to be completed by June. The deal brings an end to several months of tussling over Asciano, which agreed in August to be bought by Brookfield but received a competing bid from Qube in January.Under the terms of the deal, various parts of Asciano would be acquired by different members of the consortium. Qube, Brookfield Infrastructure, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, the Qatar Investment Authority and GIC, a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, would create a joint venture to acquire Asciano’s Patrick Container Terminals business. The same group, minus Qube, would buy the business that provides port services for bulk freight and the automotive industry.AdvertisementThe Pacific National rail business would go to Global Infrastructure Management, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, GIC, British Columbia Investment Management and the CIC Capital Corporation, an arm of a Chinese sovereign wealth fund.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In an effort to address concerns about competition, Brookfield Infrastructure has agreed not to acquire any interest in the rail business, and Qube has agreed not to acquire any interest in the bulk and automotive ports services business.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
