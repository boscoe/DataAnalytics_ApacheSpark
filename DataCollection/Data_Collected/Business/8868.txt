Much of that improvement reflected quirks in timing related to the calendar: About $42 billion in August benefit payments were made in July because Aug. 1 fell on a Saturday. Through the first 11 months of this budget year ending Sept. 30, the deficit is running 10 percent below last yearâ€™s level. The Congressional Budget Office is forecasting that the deficit for the full year will drop to $426 billion, down 11.8 percent from the previous year and the lowest imbalance since 2007. Advertisement
