But the survey spotted trends in ticket-buying habits that, should they continue, could provoke change in films or their marketing and distribution.In one notable shift, domestic per capita ticket sales rose last year to 3.1 tickets annually among viewers ages 50 to 59, higher than any year in the last five, and viewing rose slightly among those 40 to 49.Per-capita sales among those younger than 40 fell. The sharpest year-to-year drop, almost 20 percent, was among those 25 to 39.Over all, per-capita domestic ticket sales fell to 3.7, about 16 percent lower than recent peaks of 4.4 achieved in 2005, 2006 and 2007, the report said.While the number of 3-D screens in the United States and Canada reached a high of 16,146, up 364 from 2013, box-office sales for 3-D films fell 21 percent, to $1.4 billion from $1.8 billion in 2013. The 2014 sales were down more than 36 percent from their peak of $2.2 billion in 2010.In one sign of industry growth, the number of films released last year by major studios and their subsidiaries rose for the first time since 2006, to 136 from 114 in 2013.The total number of films released in the domestic market grew 7 percent, to 707, from 659, continuing a long-term expansion that has been fed by smaller independent movies that are often released in only a few theaters before moving to on-demand services.Advertisement
