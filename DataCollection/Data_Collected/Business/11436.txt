A little more than five years after federal agents raided the offices of Level Global Investors, securities regulators are returning $21.5 million in settlement money that the hedge fund paid to resolve an insider trading investigation.A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the hedge fund’s 2013 settlement vacated after the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would not oppose the request by lawyers for the now-defunct hedge fund.Level Global shut its doors in 2011 after investors lost confidence in its management when one of its founders, Anthony Chiasson, was implicated in the insider trading scandal. Mr. Chiasson was convicted at trial, but the verdict was overturned and the charges tossed out by a federal appeals court in 2014.The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which made it more difficult for federal prosecutors to pursue certain insider trading cases, has led to a number of convictions being overturned as well.The settlement money, which was paid by Level Global to settle a civil complaint filed by the S.E.C., will be returned to the firm’s former investors and management company. Gregory Morvillo, a lawyer for Mr. Chiasson, said he did not know the mechanics of how the money would be returned to investors but added that he was “glad they are getting it back.”In a statement on behalf of his client, Mr. Morvillo said that Mr. Chiasson “is grateful that the S.E.C. eventually recognized the import of the appellate ruling by fully reimbursing the fund to the benefit of his investors who entrusted their capital to him for many years.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
