The benchmark 10-year bond yield dropped to as low as 7.61 percent, its lowest level since July 15, 2013. The partially convertible rupee gained to as much as 61.65 to the dollar, its strongest level since Feb. 4.Although Mr. Rajan signaled positive trends in inflation, analysts said that the prospect of slashing interest rates was reduced, given the new inflation targets and a statement that contained words of warning as well as encouragement.Another 0.25 percentage point cut “is possible, maybe in the April policy, but after that there will be a pause,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Financial Services.Indian inflation has moderated sharply as oil prices have slumped since last year. In January, consumer prices rose an annual 5.11 percent, having fallen from double digit levels as recently as November 2013.That was well within the inflation target of 4 percent, with a band of plus or minus two percentage points, agreed upon by the central bank and the government, which will be set starting from the fiscal year ending in March 2017.Mr. Rajan said the bank would seek to bring the inflation rate to 4 percent, the midpoint of that band by the end of a two-year period starting in 2016-17.Advertisement
