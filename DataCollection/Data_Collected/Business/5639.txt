Ford Motor is recalling almost 593,000 cars and trucks in North America, including 520,000 because the power-assist to the steering could be lost, making the vehicle harder to turn, the automaker announced on Wednesday. About 554,000 of the vehicles are in the United States.The steering problem affects the 2013-15 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans and the 2015 Ford Edge sport utility vehicle.Ford said that bolts used in the steering system could rust and fracture, causing the loss of power steering. The automaker said that the steering would still work, but that the vehicle could be more difficult to steer, increasing the risk of a crash. Ford said it was not aware of any accidents.Ford is recalling vehicles that were sold or are registered only in states that depend heavily on road salt in the winter because it can accelerate the corrosion. Those are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C.
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            Such an action is called a regional recall, and it is sanctioned by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.AdvertisementFor years, consumer groups have objected to limiting recalls to certain areas, saying that they save automakers money while running the risk that, in a mobile society, some dangerous vehicles will not be fixed. Automakers have defended regional recalls, saying some safety problems are caused by geographic-specific factors such as heavy use of road salt or extreme hot or cold.AdvertisementFord is providing an extended warranty to owners outside those states, Kelli Felker, a Ford spokeswoman, wrote in an email. Ms. Felker said there was no limit on the warranty, and it is transferred to subsequent owners.Ford also said it was recalling about 50,000 vehicles — including almost 46,000 in the United States — because of a possible stalling problem. That action affects the 2014 Ford Focus, Edge, Escape and Transit Connect vehicles as well as the 2014-15 Ford Fiesta. The automaker blamed a problem with the fuel pump and said it was aware of one report of an accident.Also, Ford said it was recalling about 22,600 2015 Lincoln MKZ vehicles because the parking lights are brighter than allowed under federal regulations.A version of this article appears in print on April 30, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ford Recalls Nearly 600,000 Vehicles Over Steering and Stalling Problems.
