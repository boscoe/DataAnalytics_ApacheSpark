The report also noted that core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, climbed 0.3 percent, the biggest one-month increase in more than two years.The numbers suggest that an improving economy could be setting the stage for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark short-term interest rate. The central market has held the rate near zero for more than six years.“We don’t think inflation is really a problem, but the uptick is a cover for the Fed to do what it wants to do anyway: Get off zero rates,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust.Later in the day, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, said in a speech that she expected the Fed to begin raising rates later this year if the job market improves. But she cautioned that the economy is still facing challenges, including disappointing wage growth and too many people working part-time.Despite the drop for the day, the S.&P. 500 still closed up for the week, its third weekly gain in a row. The index has closed at record highs recently, though the gains have been tiny as investors fret over unimpressive earnings and an uncertain global economy.“It continues to be the rally that no one respects,” said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “Despite headwinds, it continues to plug along.”AdvertisementAmong other stocks making moves Friday, Gap fell 55 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $38.01 on news late Thursday that first-quarter earnings plunged 8 percent as it tries to turn around its Banana Republic and Gap chains.
