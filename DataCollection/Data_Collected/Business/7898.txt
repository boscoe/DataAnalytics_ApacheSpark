The company also reported its slowest revenue growth in 18 quarters in the three months that ended June 30, and said its chairman, Max Levchin, would step down “to pursue other interests.” Yelp, whose shares fell as much as 16 percent in extended trading, said it expected to report net revenue of $139 million to $142 million in the third quarter — well below the $152.6 million average analyst estimate. Yelp’s subscriber growth has been slowing in a crowded market. Yelp’s revenue rose 50.8 percent to $133.9 million in the latest quarter, slightly beating the average estimate, as the company added more local advertisers. However, Yelp reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.3 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a profit of $2.7 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Advertisement
