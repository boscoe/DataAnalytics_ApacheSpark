Ambac’s expenses rose under Mr. Tavakoli despite its projecting cost cuts during that same time.In a statement on Monday, Canyon said that it was nominating Frederick Arnold, the chief financial officer of Convergex Group; John R. Brecker, a director of ACA Financial Guaranty; and Eugene I. Davis, chief executive of the Pirinate Consulting Group.“Canyon Capital believes these issues should be of the utmost concern to all Ambac stockholders and believes the company’s performance will continue to suffer without significant changes in the boardroom,” the hedge fund said in a statement.Canyon also is a creditor of Ambac’s, with $259 million worth of exposure to the insurer’s bonds.Ambac has argued that those dual roles — of shareholder and debt investor — are a conflict of interest for Canyon.On Monday, Ambac hammered on that point, saying that “we believe Canyon has a fundamental conflict of interest — its economic interests are aligned with certain creditors, not with shareholders.”The rival slate, the company said, “is a thinly veiled maneuver designed to accelerate payments on its own creditor position, regardless of the consequences for the company, other creditors and shareholders.”But the hedge fund has argued that shareholders would do better as the company paid down its insurance claims.Ambac also said that it was in talks with shareholders about adding two new directors to its board and that it expected “to announce the outcome shortly.”Shares of Ambac were down 1.8 percent in early afternoon trading.Advertisement
