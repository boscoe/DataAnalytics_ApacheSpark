Nearly 95 percent of eligible pilots voted, the union said. The airline has 15,000 pilots.“In effect, the pilots of American Airlines made a business decision,” said the union president, Keith Wilson. The new contract includes an immediate 23 percent increase in pay and annual increases of 3 percent in the next five years, the airline said in a statement. W. Douglas Parker, the chief executive of US Airways, who now runs the airline, had the initial backing of pilots and flight attendants from American Airlines for his plan to combine the carriers, promising better contracts for all. At the time, American was in bankruptcy and had forced cuts in pay and benefits on its workers. The vote is a step forward in merging American Airlines and US Airways into a single operating airline. Still, the union said it would now seek to address what it sees as shortcomings in the contract, including work rules that determine how many hours pilots can fly.Advertisement
