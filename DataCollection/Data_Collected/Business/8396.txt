Gains were modest but broad: Nine of the 10 industry groups of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the day higher, led by health care stocks.“This continues to be a resilient market,” said Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, drawing a parallel between the quick recovery today and the one last week after China devalued its currency. “The averages came back.”Global news was mixed.

We’ve weathered trouble in our own economy and yet we’re in spitting distance of all-time highs,” he said. “People are still bullish.”Investors are hoping for good results from retail earnings reports this week. Walmart and Home Depot will report on Tuesday, Target and Lowe’s on Wednesday and Gap on Thursday.
