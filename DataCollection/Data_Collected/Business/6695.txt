He declined to give further details.The bank initially identified the prosecutors as coming from Wiesbaden, but authorities said later that they were based in Frankfurt. A spokesman for the prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt said Tuesday afternoon that he could not comment because the search was continuing.Numerous legal proceedings have damaged Deutsche Bank’s reputation and hampered its attempts to remake its business in response to tougher banking regulations and increasing pressure to reduce risk.In April, the bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion to United States and British authorities to settle accusations that its employees had taken part in a conspiracy to fix the benchmark interest rates used to determine the interest on trillions in loans.The size of the settlement angered the bank’s shareholders, some of whom complained that Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen had handled the matter poorly, resulting in a larger penalty. Shareholder discontent was a factor in their decisions to resign.Even though the police search on Tuesday did not appear to involve any wrongdoing by the bank, it illustrated how difficult it can be for the company to put controversy behind it and focus on improving the performance of its businesses.Advertisement
