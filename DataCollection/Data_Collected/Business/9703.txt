The aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins has struck a deal to buy an aircraft interior maker, B/E Aerospace, for $62 a share in cash and stock, the companies said on Sunday.The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products that Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer base internationally.The combination is expected to produce cost savings of about $160 million and provide a double-digit lift to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said.Rockwell agreed to pay $34.10 a share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins stock, a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace’s closing price on Friday.AdvertisementThe companies have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other related systems.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
