AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWASHINGTON — The World Bank indirectly invests part of its $18.8 billion employee pension fund in companies in industries like coal and tobacco, holdings that clash with the development institution’s own calls for ethical and low-carbon investing.In an internal post to staff members seen by Reuters, the World Bank’s treasurer said that about 40 percent of the pension fund’s equity holdings were actively or passively invested against equity index funds, which include companies in industries associated with environmental and health problems.Reuters viewed discussions between staff members and managers on an internal World Bank website and a research note produced by bank employees. The note expressed concern about the pension and gave details of the holdings, questioning why the bank does not use socially responsible alternatives.In its own lending practices across the developing world, the bank refuses to invest in tobacco production and has banned financial support for the construction of coal-fired electricity plants except for the poorest countries that lack other options.The Washington-based bank’s pension fund, details of whose holdings have not previously been reported, was ranked a “laggard” in transparency and managing climate risks in a report released last week by the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, which pushes asset owners to address climate change risks. It ranked lower than the pension funds of British Coal and the state oil fund of Azerbaijan, among other companies.“It’s very difficult for the bank to take a position where it is promoting sustainable growth and not managing the risks in their large portfolio — or telling anyone about it,” said Julian Poulter, chief executive of the initiative.While the pension fund is required to prioritize financial gains for staff members, investment analysts said it could be directed into prescreened or tailored funds that exclude companies that fail to follow sound environmental, social and governance principles.The bank’s pension fund assets are held in a separate legal trust administered by its Pension Finance Committee, which has as its chairman the World Bank’s chief financial officer and includes a mix of members from management, employees and retirees. External managers run the funds on a day-to-day basis. The pension committee did not respond to Reuters request for comment.The World Bank has a responsibility to manage the money “in the best interest of plan beneficiaries,” the bank said in a statement to Reuters.The bank said it did not comment on specific pension investments, adding that it opted for a “principled yet pragmatic approach” within the fund’s overall requirements that considers environmental, social and governance principles “where material and relevant.”That is guided by federal law that requires a plan’s investment policy to have the “exclusive purpose” of providing benefits to participants, though pension providers have flexibility on which investment principles to pursue.The bank has called on others to divest from fossil fuel companies, and its president, Jim Yong Kim, has asked long-term investors “to recognize their fiduciary responsibility” to disclose their exposure to climate change-related impacts.The bank is conducting a review of its corporate sustainability policies, but says its pension fund investments are not included in that process because they have a separate governance structure.Participation in the pension fund — a combination of defined-benefit and defined-contribution savings — is mandatory for World Bank employees. It has about 15,000 current employees and around 10,000 retired beneficiaries.Kenneth Lay, the vice president of the World Bank alumni group — the 1818 Society — said the fund should focus on maximizing returns.While there is some evidence that investment made according to environmental, social and governance principles can improve “risk adjusted performance,” he said, “there is also extensive literature reaching the opposite conclusion.”Some of the pension’s holdings are invested in the Russell 3000 index, which tracks 3,000 companies including Peabody Coal and Arch Coal and the tobacco giant Philip Morris, according to the research note by World Bank employees. Others are invested in funds tied to Morgan Stanley’s MSCI index, which includes major fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil, according to that note.MSCI and other indexes offer portfolios that screen out companies in industries with perceived ethical problems.Some of these funds have performed as well as or better than the bank’s current investments. The MSCI’s two Fossil Fuels Exclusion Indexes have outperformed the main MSCI index for the past three years, according to annual performance fact sheets.In its statement to Reuters, the bank said that were it to consider such funds, it “would have to be convinced of their superior return and risk properties in order to make the investment consistent with fiduciary responsibilities.”In a blog post on the bank’s internal website last October, some employees argued that the bank’s target of 3.5 percent annual real returns could be met through socially responsible investments, and raised concerns that the bank’s pension investments contradict its public mission.Bank employees have investment choices within their plans, but none offer ethical alternatives, they said.In response, Madelyn Antoncic, treasurer of the World Bank, posted that “things aren’t always black and white.” She cited the case of a bio-medical subsidiary of the tobacco company Reynolds American which is working to develop a vaccine for the Ebola virus from modified tobacco leaves.Ms. Antoncic, who oversees more than $140 billion in World Bank assets as well as the pension fund, said that 60 percent of the plan’s equity holdings are in separately managed accounts.Several other large pension funds have shifted toward more ethical investments.Norway’s $850 billion Government Pension Global Fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, announced in February that it had moved out of companies connected to Alberta’s oil sands and gold mining companies. And the $53 billion staff pension fund of the United Nations invested in two low-carbon funds by BlackRock and State Street last December.Advertisement
