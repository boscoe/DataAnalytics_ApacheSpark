The joint action by the trade commission and all 50 states says the president, James T. Reynolds Sr., and others spent donations meant for cancer patients on six-figure salaries and luxury vacations. Much of what was sent to patients was virtually worthless, including sample-size soaps, Little Debbie snack cakes and blank greeting cards, according to court documents. The settlement with Mr. Reynolds, Cancer Fund of America and Cancer Support Services was filed on Wednesday in federal court in Arizona. It requires the judge’s signature before it takes effect. Mr. Reynolds’s son and ex-wife previously agreed to settlements involving two related charities. The former president of Cancer Support Services also settled earlier. Together, the four charities raised more than $187 million between 2008 and 2012.Advertisement
