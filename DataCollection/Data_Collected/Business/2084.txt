And if Britons vote to leave the bloc, next year could be worse.Not since 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell and communism crumbled across Eastern Europe, has the Continent’s geopolitical kaleidoscope been shaken up so vigorously.But unlike that year of joyous turmoil, which paved the way for a leap forward in European integration, the crises of 2015 threatened to tear the union apart and left it battered, bruised, despondent and littered with new barriers.The collapse of the Iron Curtain led within two years to the agreement to create a single European currency and, over the following 15 years, to the eastward enlargement of the European Union and NATO up to the borders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. That appeared to confirm a prediction of the European Union’s founding father, Jean Monnet, that a united Europe would be built out of crises. In contrast, this year’s political and economic shocks over an influx of migrants, Greek debt, Islamist violence and Russian military action have led to the return of border controls in many places, the rise of populist anti-European Union political forces and recrimination among European Union governments.Jean-Claude Juncker, who describes his European Union executive agency as the “last-chance commission,” warned that the union’s Schengen Area of passport-free travel was in danger and the euro itself would be unlikely to survive if internal borders were shut.Mr. Juncker resorted to gallows humor after the last of 12 summit meetings this year, most devoted to last-gasp crisis management: “The crises that are with us will remain and others will come.”His gloomy tone was a reality check on the “we can do it” spirit that the German chancellor, Angela Merkel — Europe’s preeminent leader — has sought to apply to the absorption of hundreds of thousands of refugees, most of them from Syria.Ms. Merkel has received little support from her European Union partners in sharing the migrant burden. Most have insisted that the priority is sealing Europe’s external borders rather than welcoming more than a token number of refugees in their own countries.This is partly due to latent resentment of German dominance of the bloc and payback for its reluctance to share more financial risks in the eurozone.Some partners also accuse Berlin of hypocrisy over its energy ties with Russia, while friends such as France, the Netherlands and Denmark are simply petrified by the rise of right-wing anti-immigration populists at home.One of the sharpest rebuffs to sharing more of the refugee burden came from France, a close ally. Prime Minister Manuel Valls said of Ms. Merkel’s open-door policy toward Syrian refugees: “It was not France that said, ‘Come!”’Ms. Merkel’s critics rounded on her at an end-of-year European Union summit meeting. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, backed by Portugal and Greece, attacked her refusal to accept a eurozone bank deposit guarantee program. The Baltic states, Bulgaria and Italy denounced her support for a direct gas pipeline from Russia to Germany at a time when the bloc is sanctioning Moscow over its military action in Ukraine and has forced the cancellation of a pipeline to southern Europe.One problem likely to worsen in 2016 is that Europe’s main leaders are politically weak and so preoccupied by domestic challenges that they are unable to take the necessary collective action.Ms. Merkel’s survival in the chancellery hinges on her ability to bring down the number of refugees flooding into Germany next year and show she has migration under control. But without “Mutti” (Mommy), as she is affectionately known back home, the union would be in even direr straits.The year of President François Hollande of France has been bracketed by militant attacks on the streets of Paris in January and November that caused shock across the Continent over the Islamist threat from within and over failures in European police and intelligence cooperation.France’s influence in Europe is diminished by its economic weakness as Mr. Hollande struggles for re-election in 2017 against the rising far-right populist Marine Le Pen and Mr. Hollande’s conservative predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy.The British prime minister, David Cameron, cares only about finding a face-saving deal on changes in Britain’s European Union membership terms in February to win a knife-edge referendum that he has hinted he hopes to hold sometime next year.Mr. Cameron has effectively mortgaged Britain’s future to an attempt to deprive immigrants from eastern European Union countries of the same in-work benefits that low-paid British workers get — something many Euorpean Union members say would be illegal.Given British public alarm over immigration, an anti-elite mood and age-old suspicion of Europe fanned by a skeptical news media, the referendum is an accident waiting to happen.If Britain — Europe’s second-biggest economy and one of its two main military powers — became the first member state ever to vote to leave the union, it would be a shattering blow to the bloc’s confidence and international standing.Die-hard European federalists like to believe a “Brexit” would unshackle the remaining members to move ahead in a much closer union built on the eurozone.But that is to ignore the myriad east versus west, north versus south, free-market versus protectionist, socialist versus conservative and independent versus integrationist divisions among the other 27 member states.More likely, a Brexit vote would prompt demands for referendums elsewhere, from Poland to Denmark, amid acrimonious negotiations between London and Brussels over the terms of Britain’s departure and future relationship with the bloc.Denmark has just shown the political risk when governments anywhere in Europe ask voters whether they want even a tiny bit closer cooperation. The answer was “nej tak” — no thanks.If Mr. Cameron wins and Britain stays in the bloc on improved terms, some fear political contagion, with other national leaders tempted to emulate his tactic of taking Brussels hostage for domestic ends.
