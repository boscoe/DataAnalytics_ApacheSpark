Exor, the investment firm controlled by the Agnelli family, had its $6.4 billion offer for the reinsurance group PartnerRe rejected on Monday.PartnerRe said it was committed to its announced merger with Axis Capital Holdings, and announced new deal terms that would allow the company to pay its shareholders a one-time special dividend of $11.50 a common share.PartnerRe said it had held extensive discussions with Exor since the Agnelli group made its unsolicited bid last month. PartnerRe said that during those talks, Exor never expressed a willingness to bid higher than its current offer of $130 a share, which the reinsurance firm said undervalued the company.“Over the course of the past three weeks, the board, as well as our advisers, engaged extensively with Exor and conducted a very careful and thorough evaluation of the many aspects of their proposal, including price,” PartnerRe’s chairman, Jean-Paul L. Montupet, said in a statement. “Throughout these discussions, Exor made it abundantly clear that it was not willing to adjust its price. The board concluded that Exor’s proposal significantly undervalued PartnerRe and that there was no prospect of the offer leading to a superior proposal. Consequently, we determined that further discussion would not be productive and we have rejected their proposal.”PartnerRe said its deal with Axis would create the world’s fifth-largest reinsurance company, and that the combination would result in about $200 million in annual savings.“We continue to be very excited by the prospects of our amalgamation with Axis Capital, which we firmly believe will create value well in excess of the proposal made by Exor, and will give shareholders the opportunity to be a part of a world-class specialty insurance and reinsurance franchise and to share in the value such a combination will generate well into the future,” Mr. Montupet added.In a statement, Exor said it was “fully committed” to pursuing a transaction with PartnerRe, contending that its proposal was “financially superior, with no financing conditions.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
