Stocks on Wall Street wobbled and finished mostly lower on Monday as the price of oil continued to nose-dive, thanks to the strong dollar.Energy companies took the biggest losses as benchmark crude hovered around $40 a barrel, its lowest price in almost four months, and materials companies also traded lower.Every oil, gas and pipeline company in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished lower as a slump in the price of oil and other fuels extended into a third week. The losses for energy and mining, chemical and building companies canceled out gains for technology and health care companies. A survey showed United States manufacturing continued to grow in July, but did so at a slower pace than the month before. That, too, is linked to strength in the dollar.

“Manufacturing and oil have moved in lockstep for the better part of five years,” said Steve Chiavarone, associated portfolio manager for Federated Investors.AdvertisementThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,404.51. The S. & P. 500-stock index lost 2.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,170.84. The Nasdaq composite gained 22.06 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,184.20.AdvertisementA survey by the Institute for Supply Management said factories in the United States expanded for the fifth consecutive month, although its survey reading was lower in July than it was in June and factory employment decreased. A survey of manufacturing in Europe showed a similar result, and two surveys showed manufacturing activity in China was relatively weak in July.The dollar has been gaining strength over the last few years, and while it appeared to level off recently, it appears to be picking up again because investors are realizing the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates later this year. Mr. Chiavarone said that was starting to hurt oil prices and slow down manufacturing. When the dollar gets stronger, oil falls because it is priced in dollars.
