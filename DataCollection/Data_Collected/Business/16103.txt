The company made deals that were struck before the 2008 financial crisis with the help of freely available debt, only to struggle when business slowed down. Companies like Energy Future Holdings, a huge Texas power company, eventually sought relief in bankruptcy court.For Apollo and TPG, trouble began soon after they closed their takeover of Caesars, as the financial crisis began. The casino company grappled with a slowdown in gambling and a subsequent withering of profit, leaving it unable to pay down its enormous debt load.At the beginning of the settlement talks, early last year, a group of junior bondholders, known as second-lien holders, were offered roughly 9 cents on the dollar for their claims. Apollo and TPG had already secured the backing of senior creditors and hoped that the lower-level bondholders, which included big hedge funds like Appaloosa Management and Oaktree Capital Management, could eventually be persuaded or strong-armed into an agreement.Lobbyists for Caesars tried several times to roll back an obscure Depression-era bankruptcy law that would have hampered lawsuits by bondholders who were fighting the casino operator over guarantees they had on the debt they held.But the judge overseeing the case, A. Benjamin Goldgar of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Illinois, undercut Apollo’s and TPG’s hopes. He lifted a legal shield that protected Caesars’ parent company and the two investment firms from lawsuits over the parent company’s ending the repayment guarantee and the shifting of assets and money out of the now-bankrupt business.Later, Judge Goldgar ruled that top executives at the two private equity firms — including Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan and TPG co-founder David Bonderman — must give the second-lien creditors information about their personal wealth to help determine how much they could pay in any future judgment.Though the firms protested the judge’s decision, they offered more concessions to the junior creditors. In the end, Tuesday’s compromise will give those bondholders about 66 cents on the dollar, roughly seven times what they were first offered.Under the terms of the deal, Apollo and TPG will hand over their $950 million stake in Caesars Entertainment’s parent company, which is publicly traded and not in bankruptcy protection. (They will retain a smaller stake in Caesars Entertainment through their holdings in another affiliate.) More senior creditors will also give up some of what they are owed.Over all, creditors will own 70 percent of Caesars when it emerges from Chapter 11 protection. Shareholders in the still-public parent company will own 6 percent in the newly reorganized company.Liz Moyer contributed reporting.Advertisement
