The former head of the global foreign exchange spot trading desk was barred for five years.The regulator also barred, for at least one year, four former traders on the foreign exchange desk at UBS in Zurich.The regulator did not identify any of the individuals by name, but said none of those involved were still active at UBS.“Finma concluded that the individuals in question were directly responsible for the serious breaches of regulation at UBS in this business,” it said in a news release.The regulator said its investigation had determined that those responsible for management of foreign currency trading at UBS “tolerated, and at times encouraged, behavior which was improper and against the interests of clients.”Managers, the regulator said, were aware that traders were able to use group chats to share information and the potential risk of doing so, but failed to implement adequate systems and controls and to consistently monitor them for compliance with internal and external rules.The regulator said traders shared confidential client information, sometimes revealed the identity of clients to third parties and traded ahead of client orders in a practice known as front-running. Traders also repeatedly tried to manipulate foreign currency benchmarks, the authorities said.A UBS spokesman declined on Thursday to comment.The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority began enforcement proceedings against 11 UBS employees in November 2014. Following its investigation, the regulator discontinued proceedings against four of those in August. Proceedings continue against one other UBS employee, the regulator said.Advertisement
