The National Transportation Safety Board said Monday that new oil tank train cars should come with much stronger ability to withstand high heat and pressure from a crash or a blast.Several oil trains derailed this year, causing large explosions and oil spills and underscoring the “significant vulnerability” to fires of the latest generation of crude oil tank cars, the safety board said.Traditional tank cars used for crude oil transportation, called DOT-111 cars, have long been known to rupture in crashes. A newer car, CPC-1232, adopted by the rail industry in recent years, has also broken up and exploded in the crashes this year.New federal measures intended to make the growing oil-by-train business safer are not expected to take effect until 2017, and are still being debated in the administration. These rules are expected to add protections to the CPC-1232 cars.AdvertisementBut the safety board said the new measures needed to be significantly strengthened and to include more robust thermal protections, like a ceramic thermal blanket on the cars. The board also called for increased capacity of pressure relief valves.“We can’t wait a decade for safer rail cars,” said Christopher A. Hart, chairman of the safety board. “The industry needs to make this issue a priority and expedite the safety enhancements, otherwise, we continue to put our communities at risk.”AdvertisementThe safety board said that in the four oil train derailments this year, a total of 28 CPC-1232 tank cars failed, either because the train derailed or because a fire or excessive pressurization caused by high heat made the cars rupture.A version of this article appears in print on April 7, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: New Standards Sought for Oil Tank Rail Cars.
