As much as 35.5 billion renminbi of this debt could be due before the end of 2015.The company had previously reported that on June 30, 2014, its borrowings amounted to only 29.8 billion renminbi, though this number would not have included trade credit.Kaisa’s problems rattled Asian corporate debt markets at the start of this year after it failed to make a timely repayment on a loan from HSBC of 400 million Hong Kong dollars, or $51 million, and was late on a $26 million bond coupon payment.Bondholders had hoped Sunac’s proposed acquisition of a 49.25 percent stake in Kaisa would help bring its debt under control, but Monday’s disclosure indicates the borrowings could be higher than they had feared.Kaisa bonds due in 2020 have dropped to 60 cents on the dollar, 15 points off the highs they struck after the news of Sunac’s proposed stake purchase. Trading in its shares was suspended earlier on Monday.Kaisa’s liquidity will be tested once again next month, as it has coupon payments due on its bonds with 2017 and 2018 maturities.The company also warned on Monday that it would experience a substantial decline in its net profit for 2014 and that its cash flow could be hit by an continuing block by the government on sales at some of its developments in Shenzhen.The company’s problems escalated late last year after it was hit by the block and the subsequent departure of a string of senior executives, including Kwok Ying Shing, its chairman.Mr. Kwok’s exit set off the mandatory prepayment provision in the HSBC loan, creating panic among investors after the company said it might default on other obligations.It missed a Jan. 8 deadline for paying a coupon on its bonds due in 2020 but subsequently paid up within the 30-day grace period.Kaisa said it would hold a meeting with its onshore creditors later on Monday and said it hoped to engage offshore creditors on a restructuring proposal as soon as is practicable.Kaisa added that it hoped to reach a debt restructuring agreement by the end of March and to complete the process in April.Advertisement
