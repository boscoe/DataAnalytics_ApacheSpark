The bank, which sold its non-United States operations to the Swiss retail bank Raiffeisen, eventually shut its doors.In May, Credit Suisse agreed to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing and paid about $2.6 billion to end inquiries in connection with its role in helping Americans hide assets in secret Swiss accounts.Founded in 1873, BSI specializes in wealth management and has about 2,000 employees in 20 locations worldwide. As of Dec. 31, it had assets under of management of 92.3 billion Swiss francs, or about $95.9 billion.In July, Generali Group, the Italian insurer, agreed to sell BSI to the banking unit of BTG Pactual Group of Brazil for about $1.7 billion. That deal is awaiting regulatory approval.On Monday, BSI said that it posted a 2014 profit of 2.2 million Swiss francs, as its results were significantly affected by the settlement with the Justice Department.Advertisement
