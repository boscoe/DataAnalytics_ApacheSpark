HOUSTON —  Gasoline prices are drifting higher as Memorial Day weekend approaches, but American holiday travelers can still expect to save nearly a dollar a gallon compared with last year.The sharp decline in oil and gas prices last fall and winter is saving the average household roughly $650 this year, according to the Energy Department, but the boon has lost some of its appeal in recent weeks. Retail gas costs are up by approximately a third since January, after an even larger rebound in crude oil prices at home and abroad.Still, experts predict Americans will hit the road in large numbers to take advantage of fuel prices that remain lower than those of recent years.The AAA motor club projects that 37.2 million Americans will travel more than 50 miles this weekend — a 4.7 percent increase from last year and the highest number for the holiday since 2005. Of those travelers, about 33 million will drive, a 5.3 percent increase over last year, the club said.Advertisement“A strong employment market and low gas prices have driven consumer optimism to new highs and boosted Americans’ disposable income,” said Marshall L. Doney, AAA’s president.$4a gallon3AAA national average of the price of regular gasoline210’12’13’14’15MAY 22, 2015
So far this year, however, retailers, restaurants and hotels have not enjoyed the increased consumer spending pegged to low energy prices that most economists had foretold.AdvertisementEconomists said they saw more benefits to the economy from lower fuel costs in the final quarter of 2014 than in the first three months of 2015 for reasons that are not yet clear.“The bang from the lower gasoline prices did not come out as expected in the first quarter,” said Mine K. Yucel, senior vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.How much of a boost will come in the second quarter remains in doubt. Gasoline prices in most states have surged to their highest level since last November, when energy prices collapsed after an OPEC meeting in which Saudi Arabia and its allies decided against cutting production despite a growing global glut in crude oil supplies.Surveys show that gas prices have risen over the last month in every region of the country. California and several other Western and Midwestern states experienced a notable increase because of various refinery outages. In Southern California, Exxon Mobil’s Torrance refinery has been producing well below capacity since a fire in February, though most repairs should be complete by the July 4 weekend.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            Other breakdowns and maintenance problems in other refineries in California, Illinois and Louisiana have affected several local markets.Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service, said most of the refinery problems would have a temporary price impact, except in California, where he said gasoline prices over the summer months should remain high relative to the rest of the country.Advertisement“There is so much incentive to make a lot of gasoline,” Mr. Kloza said. “It is going to be a cheap summer under all circumstances, except for the possibility of a hurricane landfall on the Gulf Coast.”Oil prices have been wavering in recent days because of the fluctuating value of the American dollar and other forces that are taking oil futures up and down.The recent Islamic State capture of Ramadi, Iraq, and rising tensions in Yemen — which threaten open conflict between Saudi Arabia and Yemen — have increased the sense among oil traders that turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa could halt critical supplies of crude from reaching global markets.Those fears have been partly eased, however, by rising production in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and even Russia, despite Western sanctions.The average national price for a gallon of regular gas on Friday was $2.74, 4 cents more than a week ago and 26 cents more than a month ago, but still 91 cents below the price a year ago. The Energy Department recently projected that the national price for a gallon of regular would peak this month and average $2.55 this summer.All told, oil prices have surged by roughly 40 percent since late March on the expectation that a falloff in production and a recovering economy in Europe and Asia would eventually diminish global oil supplies — which remain between 1.5 million and two million barrels in excess of demand.And with crude oil inventories abundant — nearly 90 million barrels more than last year in the United States alone — many energy analysts warn that a backlog of uncompleted wells could mean that producers may increase production in the near future and drive prices back down again.Some energy experts predict that once refinery activity eases after the summer driving season, domestic petroleum inventories could rise to levels not seen since the Depression years of the 1930s.“Crude and gasoline prices are going to fall between now and the end of the year,” Mr. Kloza predicts, adding that by late December “there will be many more states with $1.99 gasoline than $2.99 gasoline.”A version of this article appears in print on May 23, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Rising Gas Prices, Crowded Highways .
