Local regulators, like the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, are required to enforce the rules or explain why they are not complying.In an opinion issued in December, the European Banking Authority said that small banks and some other financial institutions in Europe should be exempt from some of the limits on bankers’ bonuses, but that European law would have to be changed to allow such waivers.The updated guidelines on pay, which include new rules requiring the deferral of a portion of bonuses for three to five years, are expected to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2017.“The P.R.A. attaches a great deal of importance to the principle of applying policies in a proportionate manner consistent with the legal provisions,” Andrew Bailey, the deputy governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England and the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, said in a news release.“We have followed the principle of proportionality, which in practice means that smaller firms which pose less risk to the safety and soundness of the financial system face lower regulatory requirements,” he added. “This is a sensible outcome.”Regulated firms, regardless of their size, would have to comply with the remaining final guidelines on pay, the British regulators said.The bonus cap, which came into effect in 2014, limits annual performance payouts to an amount equal to 100 percent of what an employee receives in so-called fixed remuneration, or salary and other compensation that is not based on performance.The cap was intended to reduce the financial incentive for bankers to make risky bets that authorities say contributed to the financial crisis.On Monday, the British regulators said that a number of banks and other regulated financial firms had increased the percentage of fixed pay for their employees since the bonus cap went into effect, while overall pay has remained stable during that period.“The P.R.A. and F.C.A. believe that the shift to fixed remuneration makes it more difficult for firms to adjust variable remuneration to reflect their financial health, and limits deferral arrangements that put remuneration at risk should financial or conduct risks subsequently come to light,” the regulators said on Monday.The blanket extension of the bonus cap to all regulated firms would “exacerbate these impacts, and fails to recognize the different incentives and consequences for risk-taking” across all regulated firms by disregarding the size, internal organization, nature, scope and complexity of their activities, the regulators said.Advertisement
