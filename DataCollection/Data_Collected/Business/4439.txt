Mr. Brown, a fifth-generation descendant of George Garvin Brown, is being promoted to the new position of president of Old Forester, effective May 1, the company said on Tuesday. The elder Brown introduced Old Forester when starting the company in 1870. Campbell Brown becomes the first family member in nearly a century to be responsible for the label, the company said. Eleven fifth-generation Brown family members work for the company. Last year, the company announced plans to build a downtown Louisville distillery to produce Old Forester. Sales slumped to 93,000 cases in 2012, but have since risen to 112,000 cases, the company said. Advertisement
