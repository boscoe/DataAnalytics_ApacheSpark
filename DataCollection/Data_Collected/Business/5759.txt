The company says the cuts will reduce its work force by 1,500 to 1,750 positions. The company said in March that it would receive about $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an estimated $2.2 billion in Olin common stock as part of the chlorine business deal. Dow Chemical will take charges of $330 million to $380 million in the second quarter for asset impairments, severance and other costs tied to the cuts announced Monday. Dow has been under pressure from the hedge fund Third Point to split its specialty chemical and petrochemical businesses. Advertisement
