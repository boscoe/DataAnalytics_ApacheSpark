AdvertisementSupported byBy Patricia CohenHoping to offer more alternatives, particularly to low-income students considering substandard for-profit colleges, the Education Department is unveiling a pilot program on Wednesday to allow students to use federal loans and grants for nontraditional education like boot camp software coding programs and MOOCs, or massive open online courses.At the moment, only programs offered by accredited schools are eligible to receive federal student aid and loans. This initiative would sidestep that regulation by permitting aid to flow to students who enroll in experimental programs approved by the Education Department.The pilot would rely on its own quality assurance measures rather than depend on accreditation panels, which have come under fire in recent years from both Congress and education experts for failing to adequately monitor poorly performing institutions.“The existing accrediting agencies aren’t being hard enough on the schools,” said Debbie Cochrane, research director at the Institute for College Access and Success. “They’re the ones that are supposed to sign off on the quality of the institutions. Clearly too many subpar ones are slipping through the cracks.”Coding boot camps have exploded in popularity in the last year or so. In addition to testing new types of educational programs that emerge from outside the traditional arena of colleges and universities, government officials said they are also exploring new methods to evaluate quality.For the pilot program, officials said that independent evaluators could conceivably come from industry associations or groups of employers who know the kind of skills they need and are in the best position to judge outcomes.Officials at the Education Department said they expect to announce further steps later this month to tighten the accreditation process.State prosecutors and education officials have cracked down in recent years on for-profit colleges after a flood of complaints that they were exploiting low-income strivers and veterans by enrolling them in overpriced courses that failed to deliver meaningful returns.The responsibility for policing higher education institutions is jointly shared by a variety of accrediting boards, states and the federal government. But critics charge that not enough has been done to end abusive practices. More gatekeepers have often meant less accountability, said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State College and Universities. “Everybody’s in charge,” he said, “means no one is in charge.”Ms. Cochrane cited Brown Mackie College, a for-profit college in Tucson, as an example of how abuses could go on before being detected. That college used supplies intended for veterinary technicians to teach nursing students and sent them to train at a hospice without faculty supervision. Representatives from the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools inspected the school last week, according to a report in The Arizona Daily Star. The college said it has improved its practices. “We’ve made significant administrative and academic changes at the school to ensure that our students are provided with a quality education that prepares them for professional practice in their chosen field,” said Chris Hardman, senior vice president for communications at Education Management Corporation, which owns Brown Mackie. He added that the college had promised to refund the money paid by the nursing students who were scheduled to graduate last June.Education Department officials say they have been working to ensure that for-profit colleges don’t sidestep regulations, but they have also called on Congress, states and accrediting boards to do more as well.“We need Congress to take action to ensure that institutions are held accountable and that accreditors are not solely responsible for ensuring the quality of programs,” said Ted Mitchell, the under secretary of education.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has been talking on the campaign trail about busting the accreditation “cartel,” introduced a bill last month with Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, to create a voluntary system of accreditation. “This alternative accreditation system we’ve proposed is built on higher quality standards and outcomes than the current accreditation system and would mark an important first step to shake up a higher education system that leaves too many people with tons of student loan debt and without degrees that lead to good paying jobs,” Mr. Rubio said.But education advocates were wary of any system that relied on a voluntary component, saying it could lead to further abuses.“If you are going to allow federal aid without accreditation, as the senators propose,” said David Halperin, a Washington lawyer who has frequently criticized for-profit colleges, “then you have to replace it with something that provides for real accountability.”Advertisement
