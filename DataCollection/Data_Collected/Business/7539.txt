Franklin, the Platform Specialty chairman, said in a news release. “Alent is a terrific fit and rebalances the portfolio as we continue to build the company.”The deal values Alent at about $2.3 billion, including debt, the companies said.In addition to the cash component, Alent shareholders would have the option to receive shares in the combined company for all or part of their holdings in Alent.Cevian Capital, Alent’s largest shareholder, has agreed to accept shares in the combined company up to the full size of its interest in Alent, which is about 21.9 percent of the company. Cevian has also agreed to vote in favor of the deal.The amount of shares that Cevian ultimately receives will be determined in part by how many Alent shareholders agree to accept shares, the companies said.Alent’s board of directors intends to recommend that shareholders approve the transaction, the companies said in a joint release.“The combination with Platform, drawing on the best of both that Alent and Platform have to offer, is a compelling proposition which I believe will be better able to serve customers and provide even greater opportunities for our employees,” Andrew Heath, the Alent chief executive, said in a news release.Platform Specialty said it expected to achieve at least $50 million in annual cost savings in the three years after the transaction.Alent was formed in 2012 after it was spun out of the engineering group Cookson.
