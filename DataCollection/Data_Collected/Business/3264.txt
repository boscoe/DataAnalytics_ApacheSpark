Coming off the best sales year in nearly a decade, the auto industry showed little sign of slowing down in January.The broad-based gains — which included double-digit increases by General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Honda — occurred in a month that traditionally is slower for dealerships in the United States.But the combination of low gas prices, an improving economy and milder weather compared with last year’s snow and extreme cold propelled automakers to large year-over-year sales gains, analysts said. Once again, sport utility vehicles and trucks were the best sellers.Over all, sales rose 14 percent over January of last year, with 1.15 million vehicles sold in the United States, for a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 16.66 million vehicles, the highest rate since 2006, according to Autodata.AdvertisementGeneral Motors, which has contended with a safety crisis over the last year that led to about 30 million vehicles recalled worldwide, reported that January sales rose 18 percent compared with a year ago, with its lineup of crossovers and sport utility vehicles up 36 percent. Models like the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and Buick Encore posted their highest January sales.Advertisement“Consumer and commercial demand for trucks and crossovers is really driving our business,” said Kurt McNeil, G.M.’s vice president for sales in the United States.Sales of Chevy’s full-size truck, the Silverado, were up 25 percent, and sales of G.M.’s midsize trucks topped 8,000 for the month. A potential risk for G.M., which is based in Detroit, is that its new midsize pickups, the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon, will take sales from their larger older siblings, like the Silverado. That does not appear to be happening, said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.“So far they have reasons to be happy, though one month doesn’t make a trend yet,” Mr. Brauer said.MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMJAN. 2014SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesJAN.2015 SALES491,724520,8581,012,582JAN. 2014529,696621,4271,151,123JAN. 2015F-SeriesSilverado1500-3500CorollaCamryAltimaCR-VAccordEscapeRAV4FusionEquinoxCivicCruzeFocusExplorer54,370 36,106 28,618 27,357 26,763 26,408 23,211 21,011 20,054 19,824 19,694 19,555 18,699 18,693 18,478 17,036   +16.8+24.8+14.1+20.2+14.7+17.3+27.3+  2.0+  3.1+17.4–  4.9+34.4–14.3+11.1+53.9+33.0%FORDCHEVROLETRAMTOYOTATOYOTANISSANHONDAHONDAFORDTOYOTAFORDCHEVROLETHONDACHEVROLETFORDFORD+7.7%+19.3%+13.7%CHANGE   16.66ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+53.9%FordFocusHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDJAN 2015SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE202,786        177,441               169,194        145,007                                                           104,107                                 102,184                                      44,505     40,812   38,299                                                      35,228           +18.3+15.6 +15.6+14.0+15.1+11.5+  1.1 +23.7+  3.5+  4.1%17.615.414.712.69.08.93.93.53.33.1%GENERAL MOTORSFORD MOTORTOYOTAFIAT CHRYSLERNISSANHONDAHYUNDAISUBARUKIAVOLKSWAGEN BIGGESTLOSER–14.3%HondaCivicFord, which struggled in recent months, posted a strong start to 2015, with sales up 15 percent — which the company said was its best performance at dealerships since 2004, and which topped analysts’ expectations. The automaker’s biggest bet, its new mostly aluminum-bodied F-150 pickup truck, was selling well, said Ford, which is based in Dearborn, Mich. More than 54,000 F-series trucks were sold in January, up 17 percent from a year ago, when the previous version was on sale. (Ford’s numbers include heavy duty trucks; the company does not break out the F-150.)Fiat Chrysler continued its rise, with January sales up 14 percent. The Jeep brand was up 23 percent, and the Ram brand rose 14 percent for the company, which is based in Amsterdam.Other automakers also posted double-digit gains: Nissan was up 15 percent, Toyota up 16 percent and Honda up 12 percent. Even Volkswagen halted its recent decline, with sales increasing ever so slightly in January, by barely more than a percent, from a year ago.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Kelley Blue Book found the industry’s overall average price rose 5 percent from a year ago, to $33,993, meaning American shoppers are paying more on average for cars and trucks.But much of that increase is attributed to the boom in pickup truck and S.U.V. sales, which are more expensive in general, pushing up the average. Pickups in particular are now more elaborate, and costly, than in the past, said Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com.Ms. Caldwell said the most popular vehicle segments are now clustered at opposite ends of the price spectrum, and there is tremendous action at $25,000 and below. The introduction of smaller S.U.V.s means even more vehicles are coming to market in those low price ranges.At the same time, more consumers are flocking to higher-end luxury products, trucks and S.U.V.s.“The average itself can be a bit misleading, when you think of vehicles averaging $34,000,” she said. “But the reality is there are not only plenty of choices in the sub-$25,000 range, there are more than ever.”An earlier version of a chart with this article misstated the number of cars sold in January 2014 and the number of light trucks sold in January 2015. In January 2014, automakers sold 491,724 cars, not 725,736. In January 2015, they sold 621,427 light trucks, not 814,609.A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Auto Sales Stayed Strong in January, Bucking Trend for Month.
