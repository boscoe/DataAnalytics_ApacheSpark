After rising earlier this year, crude is back down to about $43 a barrel. Prices have fallen more than 60 percent in nearly two years. Prices tend to fluctuate in response to geopolitical and economic turmoil. Worries about China’s economic health has been one recent factor weighing on oil.

The low price of oil has cut the profits of United States oil companies, forcing many into bankruptcy. And a devastating forest fire in the oil sands region of Canada forced many companies to slow or stop altogether. For the first time in years North American production decreased, as more than 250,000 oil and gas workers have lost their jobs worldwide — over half of whom worked in the United States.
