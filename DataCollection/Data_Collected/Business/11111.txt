It bills itself as the investor-friendly alternative to other exchanges, where high-frequency traders lie in wait to make trades based, in part, on the buy and sell orders their fast computer programs can see from other brokers.IEX proposes to slow trading by delaying the sharing of buy and sell orders on its exchange by 350 microseconds. But it would not slow its receipt of information from others — and that is part of the problem, its rivals say.Goldman has long been supportive of IEX, and said in its letter that the emergence of the new exchange had raised important issues regarding the way stock markets operate. One of those issues is that exchanges have increasingly taken on roles as broker-dealers.“We are concerned that exchange-affiliated routing broker-dealers may have access to and use the proprietary market data of the exchange to benefit their own order routers,” Goldman said on Tuesday in a comment letter to the S.E.C.In other words, IEX will have some trade information before other exchanges, such as BATS, the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.BATS said last year in its comment letter, “This disparate treatment in favor of IEX’s routing-broker dealer not only unfairly discriminates against other broker-dealers, but it actually allows the IEX routing-broker dealer to engage in the exact type of latency arbitrage that IEX claims is plaguing the current market.”The N.Y.S.E., Citadel Securities and others have made similar complaints.One of the market trends of the last two decades has been an increasingly blurred distinction between the broker-dealers who send orders to and from exchanges and the exchanges themselves.Goldman and other major Wall Street trading banks compete with exchanges for orders through their internal dark pools, which match buyers and sellers but do not publish the trade information.Goldman has been investing in electronic trading, including improving its Sigma X dark pool and hiring executives from high-frequency trading firms to strengthen its electronic execution business.In the comment letter said Goldman said it supported IEX becoming an exchange. The bank also suggested that speed should not be the only factor in trading.“The value to investors from this nonstop race for faster speeds may have reached a point of diminishing marginal returns for market efficiency and stability,” Paul Russo, a managing director at Goldman, wrote in the letter. Instead, stronger safety nets to reduce the size and frequency of market malfunctions should be a priority, the letter said.OpinionJonathan Macey and David SwensenAdvertisement
