WASHINGTON —  Consumer spending in the United States barely rose in January as households cut purchases of a range of goods, suggesting the economy started the first quarter on a softer note.Sluggish spending came despite cheap gasoline and a buoyant labor market, leaving economists to speculate that consumers were using the extra income to pay down debt and increase savings."There is a risk of a temporary soft patch for the economy as it is somewhat surprising the consumer has stopped spending their savings from gasoline prices," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.The Commerce Department said on Thursday that retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services edged up 0.1 percent last month.AdvertisementThat followed a 0.3 percent drop in December and was below Wall Street’s expectations for a 0.4 percent increase.

JPMorgan cut its estimate to a 2.5 percent rate from a 3 percent pace.The economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. However, inventory and trade data for December were below the government’s assumptions in the G.D.P. report, suggesting growth could be revised to a rate as low as 1.8 percent.Despite a 39.5 percent decline in gasoline prices since June, consumer spending has been soft in the last two months. Still, cheaper gasoline prices and robust employment gains are expected to provide a powerful stimulus to consumer spending and keep the economy on an expansion path, despite sputtering growth in Asia and Europe.

Possibly," said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. "But all the conditions are in place for a period of very strong consumption growth. We still expect to see that strength come through in the retail sales data soon."Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of national economic activity, expanded at its quickest pace since 2006 in the fourth quarter.AdvertisementSofter consumer spending posed a risk to a much anticipated midyear interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

G.D.P. has disappointed while the labor market hasn’t," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 304,000 last week. The underlying trend, however, remained consistent with a strengthening jobs market.Difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal variations have caused volatility in recent weeks. The four-week moving average of claims, seen as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 last week, to 289,750.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
