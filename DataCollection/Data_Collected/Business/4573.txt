CreditRichard Perry/The New York Times        Once a week, after touring the Caribbean, the cruise ship Oasis of the Seas calls into its home port in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for what is called “turnaround day.”Just as an airplane makes money only when it is flying, keeping a cruise ship out at sea is essential for its profitability. But instead of turning over a few hundred airline passengers, this ship offloads 6,000 people, takes on new supplies and welcomes 6,000 more travelers — all in under 12 hours.Logistics are essential on turnaround day, at once the first and last day of a cruise, and the busiest time for the ship’s 2,140 crew members. Oasis docks at about 6 a.m. and leaves by 4:30 p.m. In that time, more than 12,000 bags need to get off the ship, food must be stocked, beds made and bathrooms cleaned. Getting everything ready in time is part Nascar pit stop, part loading of Noah’s Ark.“Embarkation day is frantic,” said Rodolfo Corrales, the ship’s provision master, whose job is to keep the vessel fully stocked for its journey. “It’s not just busy, it’s crazy busy.”AdvertisementBorn in the 1970s, the modern cruise industry now counts more than 400 ships offering cruises tailored to many budgets and whims — from luxury ships sailing the Mediterranean Sea to mass-market holidays in the Caribbean Sea, still the most popular voyage for cruisers. Last year, more than 17 million passengers took a North American cruise, up from seven million in 2000, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.AdvertisementThe trade group expects the industry to grow again this year after a lukewarm performance in the last two years. Bookings fell after the grounding of Carnival’s Costa Concordia in 2012, a tragedy that killed 32 people. That was followed the next year by the Carnival Triumph’s loss of power at sea.The Triumph had capacity for about 3,000 passengers and 1,100 crew members, making it an average-size cruise ship. The Oasis can accommodate twice as many passengers. To put that into perspective, think back to the Carnival Holiday. In 1985 it was one of the biggest ships of the day; it could fit 1,400 passengers.The Oasis, which is owned by Royal Caribbean, caters to middle-class vacationers — there is a casino, an aqua-theater for highflying diving acts, and a Broadway-style production of “Cats” — and on a recent turnaround day during the winter high season, it was packed with families, retirees and young couples looking for a break from the cold.Before heading for a seven-day cruise to the Bahamas, the Oasis needs to stock everything a small city might need. This includes 24,000 bottles of beer and 1,400 bottles of Champagne. It rarely picks up any provisions during the cruise, only topping up its fuel tanks while visiting ports.Bread is baked onboard, and 2,000 tons of fresh water a day are produced through a reverse-osmosis desalination system. A treatment system handles all the wastewater generated by the passengers and crew. That system, which processes 1,200 tons of wastewater a day, uses bacteria to break down waste, then mechanical and chemical systems to remove solids, and finally ultraviolet light to disinfect. The water at the end is clean enough to drink but is discarded in the sea. Any remaining solids are held in special tanks to dry and be incinerated.A forklift operator unloads pallets of supplies from trucks on the dock for a coming departure of the Royal Caribbean’s Oasis Class cruise ship, Allure of the Seas.Almost all trash is recycled aboard or repurposed. Bottles, cans and compost are crushed and frozen in cold-temperature rooms to prevent the spread of bacteria. Engine heat is used to heat laundry room water and showers; air-conditioning condensation is also used as a source for laundry water.Standing near one of the cargo doors on the dock, Lincoln Brooks, the ship’s inventory manager, keeps an eye on the clock. Around him is a jumble of trucks, forklifts and carts all moving at a steady clip. Every step is timed to avoid bottlenecks inside the narrow galleys as two dozen cold-storage rooms slowly fill up with fresh vegetables, including 15,000 pounds of potatoes, 9,000 pounds of tomatoes and about 9,000 soda cans.Advertisement“I need to keep things moving,” he said. “I can’t afford for the captain to call me.” Rain can make work more hazardous and slow things down, but this was a crisp morning and Mr. Brooks seemed relaxed.The countdown before sailing started deep inside the ship as well. A small legion of workers hustled along the main artery, a service corridor known as I-95 that runs nearly the length of the ship and allows fast access to any section.Royal Caribbean has built the largest cruise ship terminal at Port Everglades, in Florida, to handle the flow of passengers from Oasis and its twin, the Allure. To prevent long immigration control lines from forming, departures are staggered over a few hours.Passengers begin to leave their cabins about 7 a.m. and must be off the ship by 10:30 a.m. The main bottleneck is juggling the flow of bags. Passengers are handed color-coded tags for their luggage, which is collected the night before the ship reaches the port.About 15 to 30 minutes after the last passenger leaves, newcomers start trickling in through one of two gangways linked to the terminal ashore.Oasis gets generally positive ratings on consumer websites. Passengers tend to praise the embarkation process, though they give lower marks to port visits and shore excursions. The ship recently received four out of five stars on CruiseCritics.com for the whole trip; the embarkation process was rated five out of five by most reviewers.Packing in passengers has been a winning formula for the business. (Until Oasis went into dry dock for a two-week maintenance last year, it had been in service for more than 1,800 days, or five straight years.)Royal Caribbean, which has the world’s three largest cruise ships, doubled its revenue in the last decade to $8 billion last year. To increase its profit per passenger, the company is also moving away from traditional all-inclusive formulas to offering services and amenities for an extra cost. About a third of its revenue now comes from selling items during port visits or sales onboard — Wi-Fi access, for example. Passengers can pay up to $400 to connect two devices for seven days to download movies or make Skype calls from the middle of the ocean.AdvertisementA few years ago, Royal Caribbean brought in experts in industrial productivity, including DHL and the German carmaker Porsche, to help manage complex flows on the ship. As an example, the efficiency experts helped determine where to locate waiter stations in the main dining room to reduce the number of footsteps needed to serve hundreds of diners simultaneously.Loading and unloading the Allure of the Seas takes dozens of workers. Inside the ship’s loading dock, workers use special motorized forklifts to make way for more deliveries.They also figured out a way to clean rooms faster by borrowing from techniques used in auto manufacturing. The company conducted time and motion studies on their workers to identify where they could be more efficient.During the cruise, attendants are responsible for 15 to 17 rooms each. On turnaround day, they have a precise list of tasks to perform. They first take out the dirty linen and towels and line them up in the hallways in green and red bags. The efficiency specialists decided that bedsheets and towels should be separated before they are sent to the laundry room. Rooms are then dusted and wiped.Attendants work alone, except when they fit new sheets to the beds, when they pair up. That task should take three to five minutes at most, said Edna Pli, the head housekeeper. Thanks to this precise flow, 189 housekeepers can get more than 2,700 rooms ready by noon.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

By the end of the day, the crew washed 93,000 pounds of laundry. Bedsheets are folded automatically in presses. But 29,000 towels are folded by hand.Crew members, who come from all over the world (many are from the Philippines), work long shifts. Some will stay onboard for four months at a time and work seven days a week, taking short breaks during the day, then head home for a two-month rest period. It can be grueling and repetitive work. Eight butchers, for instance, spend the cruise chopping up 25,000 pounds of meat each week, working in two shifts of four.This obsession with detail and planning has become necessary as cruise ships get ever bigger. But risks also come with size. An engine fire on the Carnival Triumph two years ago crippled the ship at sea for several days. Toilets clogged, food perished, and passengers slept on decks to avoid the stench in their cabins.Carnival has since fitted its ships with emergency generators to avoid another similar mishap. But the ship’s plight turned off many would-be cruisers, and bookings dropped industrywide. Cameras aboard helicopters showed images of makeshift tents on the pool deck, and passengers described their ordeal in apocalyptic terms.Advertisement“It’s like being locked in a Porta-Potty for days,” one passenger, Peter Cass, a physician from Beaumont, Tex., said at the time. “We’ve lived through two hurricanes, and this is worse.”The hazards were also apparent in January 2012 when the Costa Concordia, also owned by Carnival, ran aground off the coast of Italy after its captain steered it off course, and then delayed evacuating the ship when it hit rocks by the island of Giglio. Thirty-two people died. The captain, Francesco Schettino, was convicted of manslaughter and abandoning the ship with passengers onboard.“These accidents were definitely a wake-up call for the industry,” said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry research firm. “Cruise companies learned the hard way, and many of the newer ships now have redundancies built in them.”
                Cruise ships have grown bigger and bigger in recent years as cruising has become ever more popular.            A norovirus outbreak is one of would-be cruisers’ biggest fears. Royal Caribbean said the virus was usually brought on board by passengers who were already sick. For that reason, there are hand-sanitizing stations throughout the ship, and passengers are constantly reminded to wash their hands thoroughly. Attendants offer passengers sanitizing gel as they board, too.If there is an outbreak, cruise companies typically follow similar containment protocols, which include trying to quarantine sick people in their rooms and sanitizing public areas to prevent the disease from spreading. Once they return to port, ships must be thoroughly disinfected.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted at least eight instances of norovirus contaminations infecting more than 3 percent of passengers for ships arriving in United States ports last year. There have been two cases so far this year. The latest was in February, when 142 passengers and eight crew members got sick during a 10-day Caribbean cruise on the Celebrity Equinox, with symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting. There were a total of 2,896 passengers and 1,209 crew members on board.Harri Kulovaara, Royal Caribbean’s chief naval architect, acknowledges that larger ships have challenges. Royal Caribbean had to come up with new lifeboats that could fit as many as 370 passengers, instead of 180, because adding enough smaller vessels would have taken too much hull space.But Mr. Kulovaara, who is considered one of the industry’s most innovative architects, said bigger ships also provided safety features. Thanks to its width, Oasis remains stable while cruising, even in bad weather. The ship is powered by six huge engines — each about the size of a school bus — that can produce extra power when encountering strong crosswinds as it enters a port, for instance.AdvertisementMost important, its engines are housed in two separate rooms and can be operated independently if needed. This redundancy, common in new Royal Caribbean ships for over a decade, became the norm for new cruise ships after the Triumph episode.“We never set out to build the biggest ships in the world,” Mr. Kulovaara said. “Size creates certain challenges, of course. But the driver is really what is giving us a unique design and a unique vacation for our guests.”One of Oasis’s most distinctive features is an open-air atrium that runs down the middle of the ship. It allows sunlight to come inside the vessel, enabling some inside cabins to have balconies. Those cabins can be sold at a premium. Prices for a seven-night cruise in March vary from $1,109 a person for an interior room (without windows) to $2,999 a person for a suite.Mr. Kulovaara came up with the design in the late 1980s when he was working on a Scandinavian ferry, the Silja Serenade. The Oasis and the Allure have proved so popular that Royal Caribbean has ordered two more of them, at a cost of about $1.5 billion each.Soon, the Oasis will depart. Weather is the main cause of delays and can have ripple effects on future cruises. For instance, when fog recently delayed a ship from docking in Tampa, Fla., for more than a day, Royal Caribbean mobilized a “war room” of staff members onshore to rebook flights for delayed passengers and find accommodations for more than 3,000 people who were waiting for their ship to show up.The last passengers trickle in and visitors leave, including the piano tuner who boards every two weeks to work on the ship’s five grand pianos. At 4:30 p.m., the odyssey begins again.An article last Sunday about the logistics of unloading and loading an ocean liner between cruises misstated the trend in profit per passenger for Royal Caribbean. Adjusted for inflation, profit has decreased over the last 10 years, from an inflation-adjusted $164.85 in 2005 to $148 last year. It has not increased.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Luxury Liner Logistics.
