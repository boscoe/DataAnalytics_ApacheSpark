The artificially low carbon dioxide readings allowed owners in Europe to collect tax incentives to which they were not entitled.Volkswagen estimates it will cost 2.2 billion euros, or about $2.3 billion, to reimburse European governments that granted tax breaks on cars said to feature low levels of carbon dioxide emissions. Those costs would be on top of the €6.7 billion the company has already set aside to address its main air pollution crisis. Volkswagen is retesting the vehicles so it can issue accurate figures on emissions.The automaker’s admission that it made false claims about emissions applies only to cars sold in Europe, not the United States.The tax inquiry is focusing on five suspects, who under German law cannot be identified by name, said Birgit Seel, a spokeswoman for the Braunschweig prosecutor’s office.She said she could not comment on whether any of the suspects were the same as those implicated in a separate fraud investigation stemming from Volkswagen’s admission in September that more than 11 million cars are equipped with software designed to camouflage their real output of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to lung ailments.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.That investigation is focusing on at least six suspects.Volkswagen admitted early in November that it had understated carbon dioxide output for about 800,000 diesel and gasoline vehicles sold in Europe. As a result, buyers of the vehicles may have received tax breaks to which they were not entitled.Germany and many other European countries provide tax incentives to people who buy cars with lower emissions of carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming. Volkswagen and the employees responsible would be liable if the lower taxes were based on false information provided by the company.Volkswagen has already promised to compensate governments for any taxes that should have been paid.In a further indication that Volkswagen may not be the only company that has flouted emissions rules, a German environmental group said on Tuesday that a diesel passenger van made by Renault produced far more pollution than allowed.The group, Deutsche Umwelthilfe, said the van, the Renault Espace, which is not sold in the United States, adhered to pollution limits only when the motor was cold.When the motor was warm, as it would be during normal driving, the Renault emitted 13 to 25 times the permissible levels of nitrogen oxide, the organization said. The testing was conducted on the organization’s behalf by the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland.In a statement, Renault said the Espace and all its other vehicles complied with European regulations. It said testing by the Bern University deviated from European regulations. The French carmaker said it was “endeavoring to fully understand the tests in detail.”Deutsche Umwelthilfe, based in Berlin, and other environmental groups have been pushing for more rigorous scrutiny of vehicle emissions, arguing that many manufacturers take advantage of flawed testing regulations in Europe to exceed pollution limits.So far, none of the accusations by the environmental group rival in scope the emissions cheating that Volkswagen has acknowledged.But the latest test data comes as European automakers apprehensively await the results of broader, official tests by the German agency that oversees motor vehicles. The agency, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, is testing diesel emissions of 50 vehicles, including Volkswagens and other brands sold in Europe, and it is expected to present its findings next month.The agency is testing vehicles in the lab and on the road. Environmental groups have contended that stationary testing in the lab is too easy for carmakers to game, leading to huge discrepancies between official results and pollution levels on the road.Last month, Deutsche Umwelthilfe released data that it said showed suspicious emissions data produced by an Opel van. The group did not accuse Opel, a unit of General Motors, of deliberately devising the car to deceive tests, but it presented results that it said were hard to explain.The group said that tests by the Bern University of Applied Sciences found that a diesel Opel Zafira van met European emission standards for nitrogen oxide only when the front-drive wheels were spinning, and that it exceeded them when all four wheels were turning — as would be the case during actual driving conditions.Opel said its own tests showed that the vehicle complied with European air quality rules. The company said none of its vehicles had software intended to detect when the cars are being tested and to then set emissions controls to provide the best results.Pierre Comte, deputy director of the emissions testing center at Bern, said the center stood by its test results for the Opel. “We measured what we measured,” he said by telephone last week.Representatives of Deutsche Umwelthilfe said the gap in readings between warm and cold tests of the Renault, with the engine producing more emissions when warm, did not make sense from a scientific point of view and were suspicious.“What we are seeing here did not happen by chance,” said Jürgen Resch, head of the group, whose name translates as German Environment Assistance.The organization said it chose to test the car in Switzerland because all of the labs in Germany have deep ties to the automobile industry.“In the future, we need independent testing organizations,” said Axel Friedrich, a former senior environmental official in the German government who now works with Deutsche Umwelthilfe. “There is not a single automobile testing facility in Germany that is not dependent on the automakers.” Mr. Friedrich said.Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin.Advertisement
