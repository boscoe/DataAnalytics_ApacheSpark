Rice Energy, a gas producer focused on Appalachia, is testing the limits of the thaw in energy mergers and acquisitions in the United States.The company’s $2.7 billion offer to acquire Vantage Energy, which had planned to go public, follows a spate of transactions in oil shale regions. Rice Energy’s plan to pay partly in shares will limit debt. Yet unlike its rival EOG Resources, whose shares jumped on news of its recent $2.5 billion acquisition, Rice’s shares fell.Vantage owns around 85,000 acres adjoining Rice’s properties in the gas-rich Marcellus shale region, along with some other assets. The buyer says that should help it increase production by 70 percent next year. Paying more than a third of the total consideration in newly issued shares will limit the strain on the balance sheet.After factoring in the planned disposal of some gas infrastructure to an affiliate, analysts at Jefferies estimate that Rice is paying around $10,600 an acre, a figure that is cheap compared with the roughly $12,400 an acre that Vantage recently paid for some Marcellus property.Despite these benefits, the 7 percent drop in the value of Rice’s shares on Tuesday morning suggests that investors have reservations. It is true that most oil and gas producers were trading lower on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia and Iran scotched hopes of an OPEC production cut. The dip in Rice’s share price may also reflect the roughly 6 percent discount it is offering on the new shares it will use to finance the purchase.It is nevertheless a contrast to EOG, whose shares rose nearly 7 percent when it announced a cash-and-stock deal this month to buy the privately listed Yates Petroleum – one of a string of recent transactions in Texas’s oil-rich Permian Basin. Coupled with the fact that Vantage’s private equity owners have decided to sell rather than follow through with their plans for an initial public offering of stock, it suggests that, despite a recent price rally, American natural gas is not yet inspiring the same animal spirits as oil.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
