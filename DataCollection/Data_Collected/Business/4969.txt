The company has struck deals with the comedian Adam Sandler to produce and star in four new feature films that will appear exclusively on the service, and made plans to release the sequel to the movie “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” simultaneously around the world on Netflix and in Imax theaters.There are no plans for a theatrical release for “Special Correspondents.”Mr. Gervais already has worked with Netflix on his comedy series “Derek” about an optimistic nursing home caretaker. He called Mr. Sarandos the “new Godfather of entertainment” and said he was presented with an offer he couldn’t refuse.“Having shaken up the TV industry, Netflix is about to do the same to Hollywood,” Mr. Gervais said. “It’s great to be part of the changing future.”Netflix continues to ramp up its spending on original programming, seeking to expand its global footprint and keep pace with more competition. The company is expected to spend more than $450 million on original programming this year, up 88 percent from $243 million in 2014, according to the MoffettNathanson research firm.Advertisement
