AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael CorkeryAnalysts at Keefe Bruyette & Woods on Monday waded into the debate over breaking up the nation’s biggest banks, releasing a report that urges Citigroup to split up.In the report, the analysts argue that Citigroup’s stock price is being held back by regulations that require big banks to hold large amounts of capital.The analysts suggest Citigroup could break up in several ways — by selling part of its Banamex unit in Mexico, splitting its consumer and corporate units in the United States into two companies, or selling its international operations.Together, the moves could increase Citigroup’s market value by 57 percent, to $198 billion, the analysts estimated.“K.B.W. believes that the primary motivation for splitting up would be the faster return of excess capital to shareholders,” the report said.In a statement, a Citigroup spokeswoman said, “Citi’s board of directors, as part of its fiduciary obligation to shareholders, annually conducts a formal review of Citi’s strategy and progress. The board remains confident that the current strategy being executed by the existing management team will yield the best long-term results for shareholders.”Calls to break up one of the nation’s largest banks have been common in the Democratic presidential campaign. Analysts at Goldman Sachs have looked at what would happen if JPMorgan Chase broke up.But such calls have been relatively rare on Wall Street, given the financial realities of finding buyers for many of the assets and a firm belief held by many top executives that their banks can still flourish at their current sizes. Citigroup has also sold billions of dollars in assets since the financial crisis to simplify. Most recently, the bank said it planned to sell its operations in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.The Keefe Bruyette & Woods analysts said they had concluded that regulators were not likely to become more lenient about how much capital banks need to set aside, which could prove a long-term drag on Citigroup’s returns. The analysts acknowledged, however, that their break up proposal might “fall on deaf ears” at Citigroup.The bank’s shares have fallen more than 15 percent this year but were essentially flat in Monday afternoon trading.Advertisement
