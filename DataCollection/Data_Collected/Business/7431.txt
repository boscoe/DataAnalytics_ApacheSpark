Paul Konigsberg, a former associate of Bernard Madoff, avoided prison on Thursday for his role in perpetuating a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme. Mr. Konigsberg, 79, a lawyer and accounting firm executive, pleaded guilty last year to charges of conspiracy and falsifying books and records. At the time, his cooperation deal was seen as a signal that prosecutors were still pursuing a criminal case against Mr. Madoff’s son, Andrew, who died of cancer three months later. Judge Laura Taylor Swain of United States District Court in New York told Mr. Konigsberg, “You’ve demonstrated sincere remorse.” Prosecutors said Mr. Konigsberg was unaware of the scheme but helped create some fraudulent statements. He has forfeited more than $4 million of commissions his firm received for Madoff clients.A version of this brief appears in print on July 10, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Judge Lets Madoff Associate Off Without Prison Time.
