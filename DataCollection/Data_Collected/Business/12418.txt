What once was free on airlines now often translates to fees.An aisle or window seat can cost extra. Bag fees come in at least six varieties. Even airline-issued pillows and blankets have a price tag on some carriers.While it has done wonders for the airlines’ bottom line, the fee frenzy has now reached “ridiculous” levels, in the view of some members of Congress.On Wednesday, legislators introduced a bill that would limit airline fees for checked bags, ticket changes and cancellations, saying the practice amounts to a form of price gouging.Backed by several consumer organizations, the bill, called the Forbidding Airlines from Imposing Ridiculous Fees Act, or FAIR Fees Act, follows an attempt to set minimum standards for seat size on commercial airlines.AdvertisementChances of the bills’ passing, either on their own or as part of the major Federal Aviation Administration funding bill currently being discussed, may be slim. But the sudden activity is a sign that legislators are heeding the public’s disaffection with the ever expanding list of fees.AdvertisementAmerican and Delta have a $200 ticket change fee. United charges up to $150 for unaccompanied minors.There are fees for pillows (JetBlue and Virgin America), fees for carry-on bags (Frontier and Spirit), fees for booking on the phone (Alaska, American and pretty much everyone else), fees to select seats (Southwest and Frontier), and fees for perks like priority boarding, window or aisle seats, or picking exit-row seats with a little more legroom.According to government statistics, bag fees collected by airlines amounted to $2.85 billion in the first three quarters of 2015. While the figure for the last quarter is not yet available, the total for the year will certainly exceed 2014’s haul of $3.5 billion and is up from the $464 million the airlines collected in 2007.The airlines also netted $2.3 billion from change and cancellation fees in the first nine months of last year.An investigation by the Democratic staff of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee found that three carriers increased checked baggage fees by 67 percent from 2009 to 2014.Cancellation fees on domestic flights increased 33 to 66 percent in the same period.“Airlines should not be allowed to overcharge captive passengers just because they need to change their flight or have to check a couple of bags,” according to a statement by Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, an author of the bill along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the authors noted that airlines were unlikely to lose much money since they can always resell a seat.Separately, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said last month that he would offer an amendment to the F.A.A. reauthorization bill that would require seat-size standards.“The average passenger feels like they’re being treated as a sardine,” he said during a news conference last month. “Squeezed and squeezed and squeezed.”A version of this article appears in print on March 10, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: As Passenger Ire Rises, Bill Is Introduced to Restrict ‘Ridiculous’ Airline Fees.
