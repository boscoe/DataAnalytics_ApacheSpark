As basic things like raw materials, labor and energy become more expensive, the cost of manufacturing goods rises. Some of those costs are increasing faster in some countries than in others, shifting where certain goods can be manufactured more cheaply.

Manufacturing costs rose from 2004 to 2014 in most of the top 25 exporting countries. Some that are usually thought of as cheap places to produce goods like Russia, Taiwan and China now have costs pretty close to those in the United States.
