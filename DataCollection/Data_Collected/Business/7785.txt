The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said contract lawyers could be eligible under federal labor law for overtime after working 40 hours per week if their work is so basic that it does not constitute the practice of law. The unanimous decision was a victory for David Lola, whom a staffing agency hired to review documents for Skadden at $25 per hour, and who is pursuing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of other contract lawyers. The firm declined to comment. Advertisement
