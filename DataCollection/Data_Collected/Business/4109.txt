Tillerson, says he expects the price of oil to remain low over the next two years because of ample supplies and weak economic growth. At the companyâ€™s annual investor conference on Wednesday in New York, Mr. Tillerson cautioned that geopolitical turmoil could unexpectedly send prices higher, but he said much more oil was ready to reach the market. His remarks came the same day the Energy Department reported that United States oil supplies had grown to 444.4 million barrels, the highest level in at least 80 years. Exxon told investors that 16 new projects would begin producing oil and gas through 2017, helping the company increase production to 4.3 million barrels a day from four million barrels a day last year.
