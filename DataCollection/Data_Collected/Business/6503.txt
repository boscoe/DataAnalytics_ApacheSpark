Anyone know more?  I am stuck.The grounding coincided with reports of bomb threats made against several carriers, including a United flight, but those turned out to be unfounded.It is not the first time that United has experienced computer problems that have led to delays or cancellations of flights. The airline, which is based in Chicago, merged with Houston-based Continental Airlines in 2010. It has since struggled to integrate operations and computer systems into a single one.Advertisement
