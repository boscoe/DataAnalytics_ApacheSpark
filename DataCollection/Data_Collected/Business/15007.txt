But the company said in a news release that it expected population growth and urbanization to drive demand in the long term. Komatsu said that Joy Global will add to its ability to offer large loading equipment and equipment for mining underground.“In terms of mining techniques, economic rationale will call for use of larger equipment in surface mining as well as further development of underground mining,” the company said.Joy Global has been hit hard by the global mining slowdown. It lost $1.18 billion in the fiscal year that ended in October, and its shares have lost more than half their value since the beginning of last year. Komatsu has also seen its shares fall almost 20 percent over the same time.Joy Global had said it was placed under investigation in 2014 by United States securities regulators over its 2012 purchase of International Mining Machinery Holdings Limited in China, which makes coal-mining equipment. Joy Global said last month that regulators had closed the investigation without taking further action.The Komatsu-Joy Global deal is expected to close in 2017.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.Advertisement
