The investment eventually grew to a majority stake, with the rest of the shares owned by the company’s management.The BC Partners funds would generate a return of 2.7 times their investment through the sale, according to the person.The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.“I would like to thank all the employees and management of the Synlab Group,” Ewald Walgenbach, a managing partner at BC Partners in London, said in a news release on Friday. “Their motivation and active support have enabled the company to steer its successful course.”The deal comes about a month after Cinven agreed to acquire a majority stake in Labco, a French operator of medical diagnostic laboratories. Labco had announced plans to pursue an initial public offering in Paris before the Cinven acquisition.“Our investments, first in Labco and now Synlab, perfectly illustrate how our health care and regional German and French teams have worked closely together to execute our expansion strategy within the European laboratory diagnostics market,” Stuart McAlpine, a Cinven partner, said in a news release.Philippe Charrier, the Labco chief executive, said Labco’s and Synlab’s businesses were “highly complementary” and have “little direct geographic overlap.”Synlab provides laboratory services for the medical and veterinary medicine sectors, as well as for environmental testing. It operates in 25 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, and it employs more than 7,000 people, including 4,500 in Germany.Synlab has made about 60 acquisitions since BC Partners first invested in it. It posted revenue of €756 million in 2014.Cinven, which was founded in 1977 and is based in London, seeks to acquire companies in Europe that require an equity investment of €100 million or more. At the end of 2013, the company had completed 105 buyout investments for a total realized value of €23.2 billion.Advertisement
