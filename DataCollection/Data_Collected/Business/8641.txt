Customers in Chicago, Los Angeles and parts of New York can order items including chicken wings, cold medicine and paper towels. Orders are made through the app or website of DoorDash, an online delivery company that 7-Eleven has teamed with. Stores in Washington and Boston will offer delivery in the coming months, the companies said, and more cities are planned. DoorDash said it was testing ways to deliver still-frozen Slurpees, but a 7-Eleven spokeswoman, Margaret Chabris, said the treats were “best when consumed immediately.” The company said it would soon offer the delivery of alcohol.
