For the full fiscal year, Aberdeen had net outflows of £33.9 billion.As of Sept. 30, the company, which is based in Aberdeen, had assets under management of £283.7 billion. That was down from £324.4 billion at the end of September last year.“Asian and emerging markets are undergoing a cyclical correction,” Roger Cornick, Aberdeen’s chairman, said in a news release. “Traditionally these are areas of significant strength for Aberdeen, but we have experienced outflows from some investors who have made their asset allocation decisions on the basis of their macroeconomic views on these markets.”The company’s results follow a report in The Financial Times in October that Aberdeen’s longtime chief executive, Martin Gilbert, was seeking potential buyers for a takeover. The company has since denied that it is seeking a sale.For the full fiscal year, Aberdeen reported profit before tax, amortization and other costs of £491.6 million, from £490.3 million in fiscal 2014.Revenue rose about 4 percent, to £1.17 billion, in fiscal 2015.Advertisement
