Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The New York Post reported Thursday that the deal would cover four years and be worth more than $100 million. Cory Shields, a spokesman for NBCUniversal Cable, called that figure “grossly inaccurate.”Still, the paycheck is likely to be substantial and at the top of the reality genre, TV industry executives said, because the family holds significant bargaining chips.“Keeping Up With the Kardashians” is one of the bright spots at E!, which like other cable television networks is suffering ratings declines. Prime time ratings at E! for the total year 2014 declined 10 percent for viewers 18 to 49 years old, at an average of 386,000, according to Nielsen data.“Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” meanwhile, has managed to hold on to its audience, with the eighth and ninth seasons both attracting an average of 3.5 million viewers live and seven days after an episode was televised, Nielsen said. The 10th season is scheduled to start in March.Kim Kardashian has maintained her presence in the spotlight with her marriage to the rapper Kanye West, a Super Bowl commercial and a huge presence on social media. In addition, the popularity of her sisters has exploded, giving the family another bargaining chip.Advertisement
