Even as auto sales have returned to prerecession levels, one kind of vehicle has been left behind: the family sedan.Overall sales of passenger cars fell by 10 percent in August compared with the same period a year ago, to less than 690,000 sold in the United States, according to Autodata. By contrast, light trucks, including sport utility vehicles, achieved a 9 percent gain, selling nearly 890,000 vehicles.The two competing forces led to an essentially flat August for the entire market — down, just barely, by 0.5 percent, according to Autodata.The car-truck divide turned out to be good news for the three Detroit automakers, which had surprisingly strong results in a month that featured an unusual calendar quirk that had been expected to depress sales.AdvertisementFiat Chrysler and Ford Motor reported gains, while General Motors fell slightly but avoided the larger loss that analysts had predicted because of robust truck sales.Advertisement“Companies that depend on car sales are the ones that are suffering the most,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader.Toyota, which relies on vehicles like the Camry sedan to power its numbers, experienced a 9 percent drop in sales in August.MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMAUG. 2014SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesAUG.2015 SALES818,8251,586,015767,190AUG. 2014889,4091,577,407687,998AUG. 2015%F-SeriesSilverado1500-3500AccordCamryCR-VAltimaCivicCorollaRAV4EscapeFusionRogueEquinoxExplorerElantraFORDCHEVROLETRAMHONDATOYOTAHONDANISSANHONDATOYOTATOYOTAFORDFORDNISSANCHEVROLETFORDHYUNDAI71,33254,97745,31040,93137,59234,77132,32732,03131,72630,53428,87028,27027,66525,21123,67122,405+  4.7+11.7+  3.5–19.9–14.6+  2.0+  0.5–  5.9–  4.1–14.3–  0.4–  4.0+29.2+17.9+22.1–  1.9–10.3%+8.6%–0.5%CHANGE   17.80ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+29.2%NissanRogueHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDAUG. 2015SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE270,480            233,880                   224,381              201,672                                                               155,491                                     133,351                                         72,012         58,897       52,697                                                          51,445     –  0.7+  5.6 –  8.8+  1.7–  6.9–  0.8 +  2.9 +  7.7+  4.9–  2.1    %17.114.814.212.89.98.54.63.73.33.3%GENERAL MOTORSFORD MOTORTOYOTAFIAT CHRYSLERHONDANISSANHYUNDAIKIASUBARUVOLKSWAGENBIGGESTLOSER–19.9%HondaAccordSEPT. 1, 2015
“A lot of their heavy volume movers are in the car segment,” said Akshay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, speaking about Toyota.Honda, which is similarly positioned, dropped 7 percent for the month compared with the previous year. Nissan fell slightly, by less than 1 percent, according to Autodata.But flush with new truck and S.U.V. offerings, and because of strong consumer demand, domestic automakers had a different experience last month.Ford sales increased 6 percent for the month, lifted by its best August for sport utility vehicle sales in 12 years. Vehicles like the Explorer and Edge delivered solid growth, and perhaps most important for the company, its flagship F-150 pickup, recently redesigned with a mostly aluminum body, also had gains. More than 70,000 F-Series trucks were sold in August, for a 5 percent increase.“It looks like Ford may be getting some of its groove back by finally getting the F-Series out there,” Ms. Krebs said.AdvertisementMark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president for American marketing, said that improved availability for the new pickup trucks, which increased production in recent months, helped make August the strongest month this year for F-Series sales.One reason that analysts had predicted a tougher month for auto sales is that Labor Day weekend, traditionally a popular time for car shoppers to visit dealers’ lots, falls later than usual. That means that sales over the holiday, which last year were included in August numbers, will this year be counted in September instead.Fiat Chrysler posted a 2 percent gain, despite analysts’ predictions of a loss, allowing the company to continue a streak of 65 consecutive months of year-over-year gains, which many had thought was finally poised to end. Jeep sales once again powered the performance, with sales up 18 percent, and the Ram brand rose 6 percent.But if the domestic automakers celebrated their overall gains, they still had reason to worry: Their car lineups were hammered just as hard as those of their import competitors.Most of Ford’s sedans, for example, with the exception of the new Mustang and the Fiesta, were down — in some cases by double-digit percentages.Fiat Chrysler struggled as well to sell its cars: They were down by 9 percent over all in August, with vehicles like the Dodge Dart, Avenger and Charger falling by substantial margins.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Encore and Enclave S.U.V.s were up 30 percent and 27 percent; the Regal and Verano sedans were down 23 and 48 percent.The reliance on S.U.V.s was also evident in Cadillac’s monthly figures, as the Escalade, which has pulled an outsize share of the weight at the division over much of the last year, fell 22 percent. That helped drag Cadillac’s overall numbers down 6 percent for the month.Chevrolet was also down for the month, dropping 2 percent over all, but 24 percent among its car offerings.AdvertisementOver all, the industry’s seasonally adjusted annual rate continued its steady climb, to 17.8 million vehicles sold versus 17.3 million a year ago, according to Autodata.Looking ahead, there are few signs the migration away from cars will be stemmed anytime soon.Mr. Anand, the analyst, said consumers’ embracing of sport utilities and trucks are a sign of buyers with more confidence in their finances and the economic outlook. More modestly priced cars, as a result, are being left in the dust by those who can afford an upgrade.“Consumers are willing to spend more and more,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on September 2, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Passenger Car Sales Fall, but Truck Market Stays Robust.
