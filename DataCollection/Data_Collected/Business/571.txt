The AmSurg Corporation, which operates outpatient surgery centers, wants to expand its physician-outsourcing services by merging with TeamHealth Holdings. In dueling letters made public on Tuesday, TeamHealth made it clear that the financial proposal was not good enough.AmSurg first met with TeamHealth on Sept. 30 to discuss a merger of the two companies. AmSurg offered to pay $7.8 billion in cash and stock. But TeamHealth said the proposed valuation was too low and rejected the offer.A letter written by Christopher Holden, the chief executive of AmSurg, to TeamHealth’s chairman, Lynn Massingale, was disclosed Tuesday. TeamHealth made its rebuttal public as well and its stock rose 19 percent.The saga is illustrative of an industry undergoing extensive consolidation and the need by smaller players to merge to remain competitive. Mr. Holden demonstrated the urgency in his letter, encouraging TeamHealth not to ask, “Why now?” but rather, “Why wait?”AdvertisementOne of TeamHealth’s key obstacles was its $1.6 billion acquisition of IPC Healthcare, which was announced in August. TeamHealth wanted to focus on integrating the short-term care provider after the deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year. AmSurg said that its proposed merger would not delay or harm TeamHealth’s deal with IPC Healthcare.AdvertisementAmSurg said it has already integrated Sheridan Healthcare, the physician outsourcing service that it acquired for $2.3 billion in July 2014. Mr. Holden said AmSurg’s experience with Sheridan would serve as a road map for its combination with TeamHealth.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Michael Snow, the president and chief executive of TeamHealth, said in his letter that further discussions with AmSurg about the proposal were pointless.“While we can certainly understand why AmSurg would find a combination with TeamHealth appealing in such an environment, we are well positioned to independently seize advantageous transaction opportunities that may arise over time,” said Mr. Snow.The proposed deal would amount to $71.47 per TeamHealth share, with $11.49 per share in cash. TeamHealth and AmSurg would each own about half of the merged company, which would assume the TeamHealth name but keep the AmSurg and Sheridan brands.Guggenheim Securities and JPMorgan are providing financial advice to AmSurg, while Bass, Berry & Sims is serving as legal counsel.
