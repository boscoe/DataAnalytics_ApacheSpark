The Agriculture Department says the average price of a dozen eggs in the United States will climb to a record this year because of the nation’s worst-ever outbreak of bird flu in poultry. In a monthly supply and demand report, the agency on Wednesday increased its forecast for the price of Grade A large eggs in New York: $1.60 to $1.66 per dozen. That is up from its May estimate of $1.30 to $1.36 and tops last year’s average price of about $1.42, which was a record high, according to government data. In the fourth quarter, the report says, eggs will average $1.73 to $1.87 per dozen.A version of this brief appears in print on June 11, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bird Flu Will Force Egg Prices to a Record, U.S. Says.
