With the craft beer industry growing rapidly over the last decade, more universities are offering online programs about the business side of craft beer. In the last decade, according to the Brewers Association, the number of craft breweries has grown to more than 4,000 in the United States today, from around 1,400 in 2005. Universities that have or are starting beer-business programs include the University of Vermont, San Diego State, and Portland State and the University of Portland in Oregon. As the industry becomes more competitive, the bar has been raised for those starting a brewery or working for one. Scott Gallagher, Portland State’s director of communications, said: “It’s not all about brewing and drinking beer. There’s a lot of business behind it as well, and that’s usually what they’re lacking.”A version of this brief appears in print on January 2, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Universities Offer Classes for Those Interested in Beer.
