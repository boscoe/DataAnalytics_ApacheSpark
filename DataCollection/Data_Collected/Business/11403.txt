Mr. Georgiades told the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on Monday that strict adherence to fiscal and other reforms meant that Cyprus had not used more than 2 billion of the 9 billion euros, or about $9.7 billion, that its eurozone partners made available to it under the 2013 bailout deal. Mr. Georgiades said Cyprus would not need a conditional credit line once the program concludes. Advertisement
