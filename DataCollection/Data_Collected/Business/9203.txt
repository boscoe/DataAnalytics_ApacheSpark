The Italian lender recorded the gains but did not disclose the losses.After the perilous state of Monte dei Paschi’s finances was revealed in 2013, Fabrizio Viola, the chief executive who took over in 2012, had to work with the bank’s chairman, Alessandro Profumo, to repair the bank’s finances and reputation.Monte dei Paschi said in February 2013 that it had lost 730 million euros, or $818 million at the current exchange rate, on three of these transactions. One of the deals was the Alexandria contract with Nomura, which it said cost it €273.5 million. It sued Nomura in March 2013 for the losses it said it suffered as a result of the deal.The same month, Nomura claimed in Britain’s high court that the transaction was valid. Monte dei Paschi counterclaimed, saying that the transaction was unenforceable. The settlement this week resolves both legal cases, in Britain and Italy.Nomura estimated that the agreement to terminate the transaction early would pare its second-quarter financial results by 34.5 billion yen, or about $287 million.“I am satisfied that we have now closed the last legacy linked with the previous management of the bank, an important outcome that strengthens the equity of Banca Monte dei Paschi, improves the expected profitability and normalizes our financial profile,” Mr. Viola said in a news release.Nomura said in a news release that it believed “the transactions were conducted legally and appropriately, and does not accept allegations made against it or admit any wrongdoing in connection with the settlement. Taking into account the views of the relevant European financial authorities and the advice provided by external experts, the company considers it to be in its best interests to reach a settlement.”Advertisement
