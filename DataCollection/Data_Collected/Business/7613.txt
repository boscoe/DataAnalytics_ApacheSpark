Still, analysts remained cautious because of the uncertainty caused by the Greek financial crisis. The region posted its 22nd consecutive month of growth in auto sales, with 1.36 million units bought, lifting half-year sales by 8 percent to 7.1 million, the group said. Carlos Da Silva, an analyst for IHS Automotive, said the stronger-than-expected growth was because of two extra calendar days of sales in June compared with May, as well as the effect of end-of-quarter accounting, when many automakers offer incentives to reach targets. “The market’s recovery is still fragile, even more so as a result of the ongoing turmoil in Greece,” Mr. Da Silva said.
