The legal battle over whether Sumner M. Redstone has the mental capacity to make decisions about his $40 billion media empire is scheduled to go to trial in October in a Massachusetts court house.In a ruling on Thursday, Judge George F. Phelan of Norfolk County Probate Court rejected a motion by Mr. Redstone’s lawyers to dismiss the lawsuit, but said there was no need to conduct an immediate mental and physical exam of the 93-year-old mogul, who is in poor health. The judge requested that Mr. Redstone’s medical records covering the last 19 months be produced as evidence in the case.The court fight centers on the sudden dismissal in May of two of Mr. Redstone’s longtime confidants from the trust that will control his companies after he dies or is declared incompetent. The plaintiffs, Philippe P. Dauman and George S. Abrams, are challenging Mr. Redstone’s mental capacity and asserting that he was unduly influenced by his daughter, Shari Redstone, when he dismissed them.Hanging in limbo are the fortunes of the Redstone family and the fates of Viacom and CBS, two of the world’s largest entertainment companies. Mr. Dauman’s position as chief executive of Viacom also is in jeopardy.AdvertisementThe judge ruled that Massachusetts was the proper jurisdiction for the matter, given that the business of the trust remains there and the trust document makes no mention of California. He noted that Mr. Redstone moved to California more than a decade ago and had amended the trust twice, but never changed provisions related to its Massachusetts status.
                War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.            He also said that because Mr. Dauman and Mr. Abrams were ousted from the trust in May, no current medical exam was necessary. The question is whether Mr. Redstone had the mental capacity at that time to make the decision.AdvertisementJudge Phelan’s ruling highlighted several issues related to Mr. Redstone’s mental state and his relationship with his daughter that are likely to face scrutiny as the legal battle continues.In one example, he pointed to an argument made by Ms. Redstone that the trust does not prohibit the removal of trustees, even if the decision was the result of undue influence.“While it is accurate that the trust contains no such explicit prohibition, the court can only begin to conjure the universe of misbehavior which, if allowed to prey unchecked, could hijack trust administration into darkness,” Judge Phelan wrote, later concluding that “interests of justice and public policy demand that trusts are free from undue influence in their administration.”A spokeswoman for Ms. Redstone declined to comment.The judge also raised several questions about the outcome of a recent suit in California brought by a former companion of Mr. Redstone, Manuela Herzer. The suit was dismissed after just one day of trial based on 18 minutes of videotaped testimony from Mr. Redstone in which he relied on an interpreter and expressed vehement distrust of Ms. Herzer. (The judge in that case did not make a ruling related to Mr. Redstone’s mental capacity, yet found that Mr. Redstone “suffers from either mild or moderate dementia.”)Judge Phelan questioned the role and qualifications of Mr. Redstone’s speech therapist, who acted as his interpreter in the case. The judge also stated that there was no discussion of the information that Mr. Redstone relied on to make decisions or the filters, if any, that were placed on that information.“The 800-pound gorilla which remains is what information did Sumner Redstone, concededly susceptible to undue influence, 93 years old and undisputedly suffering a myriad of physical infirmities, and of disputed mental status, rely on to come to the viscerally expressed conclusion,” the judge wrote.AdvertisementHe added that the Massachusetts court must scrutinize “all relevant aspects about how the information that caused Sumner to take the actions he took was conveyed to him.”“To get to the truth, we must identify the suppliers of the information and examine the information itself,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

National Amusements last month moved to replace five Viacom directors, setting the stage for the ultimate firing of Mr. Dauman as Viacom’s chief executive.Viacom’s lead independent director has filed suit to block the changes in Delaware, where a hearing is scheduled for Friday.A version of this article appears in print on July 29, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: October Trial Date Is Set on Redstone Competence.
