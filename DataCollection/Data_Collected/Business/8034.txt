Walk out the door and watch TV anywhere.That’s the pitch AT&T is making for its new nationwide offering, the first of its kind, that combines television and wireless phone service for $200 a month for the first 12 months.The announcement of this package, available to customers starting Aug. 10, came a little more than a week after AT&T closed its $48.5 billion takeover of satellite company DirecTV, forming the country’s largest television distributor, with about 26 million subscribers.Executives promoted the merger — which combines one of the country’s largest telephone and Internet providers with the country’s largest satellite provider — as the creation of a next-generation entertainment provider that would serve customers who increasingly demand on-the-go entertainment across a variety of screens.Creating new bundles of television, wireless and broadband services was one of the merger’s highlights that executives underscored.
                Here are some prominent services offering live TV, à la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.            “Today is the first of many planned moves to enable our customers to enjoy a premium entertainment experience anywhere,” Brad Bentley, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of AT&T’s entertainment and Internet services, said in a statement. “We’re going to deliver more TV and entertainment choices to more screens — when and where our customers want it.”AdvertisementAT&T is doubling down on the television business at a time when it is facing significant disruption. A wave of so-called cord cutters are abandoning their traditional cable and satellite service in favor of often cheaper streaming alternatives. At the same time, a number of television groups like HBO, Showtime and CBS are introducing new stand-alone streaming offerings that do not require a traditional pay-TV subscription.AdvertisementThe number of American households that pay for broadband service but not television increased 16 percent, to 10.7 million in 2014, from 9.2 million in 2012, according to the research firm SNL Kagan.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Subscribers will be able to start watching television programming via the DirecTV app on their computers, tablets and smartphones as soon as they sign up for the service and will not need to wait for the installation of their television service.AT&T will also be introducing other new plans and packages after the close of the deal.A version of this article appears in print on August 3, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: AT&T; Says Users Can Watch TV on Any Device With Its New Bundle, the First of Its Kind .
