Concerns about the world economy helped tug the market lower on Monday as worries mounted over Greece’s standoff with its creditors. Major indexes headed lower at the opening of trading, following European markets down. A rebound in crude oil drove energy stocks higher.With no major reports on the U.S. economy to hold their attention, investors looked abroad.“There’s still a lot of uncertainty around Greece,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. “It’s one of these tectonic plates shifting around the financial system.”Greece’s new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, set his government on a collision course with the country’s creditors. In a speech on Sunday, Tsipras declared an end to a regimen of budget cuts and tax increases and said he would push for a short-term loan to give the country and its creditors time to negotiate a new arrangement to replace its bailout program. Greece and its international creditors were expected to take up the issue later this week.For investors, the worry is that if Greece drops the European currency, it could have unpredictable consequences for the wider financial system. One fear is that other countries with much larger economies might follow Greece out the door.AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slipped 8.73 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 2,046.74.
