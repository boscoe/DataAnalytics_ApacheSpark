AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks closed modestly lower on Monday, as traders focused on early signs from the holiday shopping season and potential moves from the American and European central banks.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 78.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,719.92. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 9.70 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,080.41 and the Nasdaq composite lost 18.86 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,108.67.Consumer discretionary stocks were among the biggest decliners, including the big department stores like Macy’s, Kohl’s, Walmart and Target. Initial data from the first holiday shopping weekend showed shoppers were not going to stores as much as last year.Preliminary data from ShopperTrak showed in-store sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday were $12.1 billion, down from $12.3 billion a year earlier. Yet the economic climate is relatively strong for shopping, including lower gas prices from a year ago and an improving job market.“We believe Black Friday has gone from a period of management excitement to one of anguish,” the Nomura retail analysts Simeon Siegel, Gene Vladimirov and Julie Kim wrote in a note to investors.Investment bank analysts have said that department stores had to do deep discounting to attract shoppers to their stores. But data from research firms like ChannelAdvisor showed strong growth in sales online, which could suggest consumers decided to spend online instead of in brick-and-mortar shops.Consumer discretionary stocks fell 1 percent, compared with the 0.5 percent drop in the S.&P. 500. Some of the more notable decliners were Macy’s, which fell 90 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $39.09, Walmart, which fell $1.04, or 1.7 percent, to $58.87 and Urban Outfitters, which fell $1.25, or 5.3 percent, to $22.40. Even the online retail giant Amazon dropped $8.46, or 1.3 percent, to $664.80.“While it’s too early to make the call about how 2015 holiday revenues (and margins) will unfold, our survey results for the Black Friday weekend don’t add a lot of confidence for the broad retail landscape,” Dave Weiner and Sindhu Chitturi, retail analysts for Deutsche Bank, wrote in a note to investors.More broadly, investors are also focused on this week’s European Central Bank meeting and the release of American jobs data.The European Central Bank is widely expected to give the region’s economy another dose of stimulus as it tries to keep a recovery going and get inflation closer to 2 percent. The stimulus is likely to include increasing the amount banks have to pay to park money at the central bank, giving them an incentive to lend it instead.While the European Central Bank moves toward increasing stimulus, the Federal Reserve is getting ready to start raising interest rates for the first time since June 2006. A series of American economic reports this week, culminating with Friday’s jobs survey for November, could cement investors’ expectations for a rate hike at the Fed’s next policy meeting in mid-December.“Unless this report is a total disaster, I think it’s very, very likely the Fed is going to raise in December,” said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. The policy divergence between the two central banks has weighed on the euro and sent the dollar higher. On Monday the euro fell to $1.0572, its lowest level since April. It traded at $1.0591 late Friday.Major American stock indexes ended November with slight gains. The S.&P. 500 rose less than 0.1 percent and the Dow gained 0.3 percent.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index rose 0.2 percent, to 107.7, last month. The index has increased 3.9 percent over the last 12 months. The figures add to evidence that the housing market has lost some of its momentum after rapid sales growth this year. Healthy job gains and low mortgage rates lifted sales for much of the year. But rising home values and limited inventories have curtailed further growth in the closing months of 2015. Benchmark United States crude fell 6 cents, to $41.65 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, lost 25 cents to close at $44.61 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 3.2 cents, to $1.359 a gallon; heating oil fell 1.6 cents, to $1.337 a gallon; and natural gas rose 2.3 cents, to $2.235 per 1,000 cubic feet.Government bond prices did not move much. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.21 percent. The dollar rose to 123.12 yen from 122.85 yen late Friday.Gold rose $9.60 to $1,065.80 an ounce. Silver edged up 4 cents, to $14.05 an ounce, and copper edged down half a penny, to $2.04 a pound.Advertisement
