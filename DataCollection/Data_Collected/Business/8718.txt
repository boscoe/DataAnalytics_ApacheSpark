HOUSTON —  Despite the recent tumult in global stock and energy markets, American travelers can count on bargains at the pump this Labor Day weekend, with prices for gasoline at their lowest levels in 11 years.With oil prices diving by more than 50 percent since last summer, the low prices are no surprise, analysts say. But the numbers can be startling to any driver who habitually glances at the gasoline price billboards along the highway.On Friday, the national average for regular gasoline was $2.42 a gallon, 9 cents lower than only a week ago and $1.01 lower than last year, according to the AAA motor club.“Consumers will feel a lot better at the pump this holiday than they will looking at their 401(k)’s,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.AdvertisementAll told, Mr. Kloza estimated that Thursday through Monday, Americans would spend $3.9 billion on fuel, down from $5.5 billion during the holiday weekend in 2014 and 2013.AdvertisementBehind the low gasoline prices are widespread fears that the global economy is slowing, along with a resilient expansion of domestic oil production. The prices represent an astonishing reversal from recent years, when motorists complained bitterly about gas expenses.An estimated 8,250 gas stations in 24 states — representing more than 5 percent of the nation’s stations — now have prices below $2 a gallon. Not a single station in the country sold gas at that price last Labor Day weekend, specialists say.“Average U.S. gas prices are falling at the fastest rates since December,” said Michael Green, a spokesman for AAA, referring to the month after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shocked oil traders by refusing to cut production and allowing crude prices to collapse.Several AAA clubs project that 35.5 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more over the weekend, the highest volume since 2008 and a 1 percent increase from last year. The AAA clubs say 86 percent of the travelers will drive.Cheap gasoline is encouraging motorists to drive more. The Federal Highway Administration has reported that the mileage driven in the first half of the year was the highest since 2008, before the recession. In July, drivers traveled 266.8 billion miles, a 1.5 percent increase from last year, when prices exceeded $100 a barrel and gasoline prices were roughly a dollar a gallon higher.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            Today, global oil benchmark prices are hovering around $45 to $50 a barrel, although in recent days they have been on a particularly wild ride, jumping or falling 5 percent or more, sometimes within hours.Last summer, oil and gasoline prices jumped as turmoil rocked the Middle East. But Iraq kept pumping and exporting, as have Saudi Arabia and other gulf states. Meanwhile production in the United States has remained high as producers have become more efficient.AdvertisementAnd after the recent nuclear deal, the prospect of Iran exporting large amounts of oil again has worried traders and energy executives that a glut could last years.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But this summer the savings have been less than 2 cents a gallon largely because of refinery mishaps. An explosion in February at an Exxon Mobil refinery in Torrance, Calif., was so severe the plant is still not operating at full capacity.And last month, BP’s refinery in Whiting, Ind., the largest in the Midwest, was forced to shut down its biggest crude distillation unit for several days because of leaky pipes. That sent gasoline prices soaring across the Great Lakes region, and some energy specialists warned that high prices could last more than a month.But technicians fixed the problem sooner than expected, and the national average for a regular gallon of gasoline has dropped every day for more than two weeks, in time for the holiday weekend.Prices are bound to decline more as the busy summer driving season ends and refineries process cheaper winter blends.“September looks like another month that consumers will save about $60 at the pump versus last year,” Mr. Kloza said. He estimated that the average driver puts 60 gallons a month into his or her gas tank.The Energy Department recently predicted that the average national price for regular gasoline would decline to $2.11 in the fourth quarter, contributing to an annual average of $2.41 for 2015. That is roughly a dollar lower than last year.The one wild card for prices is, as always, the price of crude oil, which can jump in the event of a crisis in the Middle East. But at the moment, commodity traders are more fearful of a decline in global demand mostly because of the slower economic growth in China.“A slowdown in China means more than just a slowdown in Chinese oil demand,” according to a Barclays report on Friday. “China’s industrial activity and global links, the energy intensity of its commodity imports, and even the oil used to get these goods to the country will all stumble if China does.”A version of this article appears in print on September 5, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: For Labor Day Drivers, Lowest Gasoline Prices in 11 Years .
