LOS ANGELES — From Hollywood’s court docket: “Off the record, on the QT, and very hush-hush.”Those breathy words were delivered by Danny DeVito in the film “L.A. Confidential.” And they pretty much apply to any information about the inner workings of Comic-Con International that might figure in an federal trademark suit by Comic-Con against the operators of a similarly named, but unrelated, Salt Lake Comic Con.In January, Magistrate Judge Jan M. Adler issued a protective order sealing any confidential business information filed by either side. That means all the disclosures about pricing, customers, contracts, conversations and such will be marked “Confidential — Attorney’s Eyes Only,” and kept away from outsiders who wonder what makes the giant, annual San Diego convention tick.(This year’s convention starts on Thursday, July 21, with a preview the night before, and concludes July 24.)AdvertisementEven the lawyers involved have had a tough time prying loose some of that information.In a joint motion filed with the United States District Court in San Diego on March 1, lawyers for Dan Farr Productions, which operates the Salt Lake convention, complained that representatives of the San Diego event were withholding important information about attendee complaints, ticket refunds or investigations by state, federal or other government entities.In the same joint motion, lawyers for San Diego Comic-Con said that the convention was meeting its obligations to provide information, would make disclosures when its experts had had a chance to decide what was relevant, and objected to requests designed “to harass and annoy” it.AdvertisementMagistrate Judge Adler has scheduled a hearing for 9:30 a.m. on Friday. But resolution of the case, which was filed in mid-2014, appears distant.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
