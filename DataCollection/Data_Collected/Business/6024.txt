Walmart said on Wednesday that it would test a new unlimited shipping service for online shoppers this summer that will be priced below Amazon’s widely popular $99 per year Prime service. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, said the shipping subscription service would cost $50 a year. Products will arrive in three days or less, it said. Walmart already offers a grocery delivery and pickup service in five markets, but the unlimited shipping program underscores how serious it is about accelerating the growth of its online business. Ravi Jariwala, a company spokesman, said the service was in response to increasing demands from customers looking for predictable and affordable shipping. It is also part of an overall strategy to test new ways to serve customers who shop online. Mr. Jariwala said the service would be available only by invitation for now.A version of this brief appears in print on May 14, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Walmart Plans to Test Unlimited Shipping Service.
