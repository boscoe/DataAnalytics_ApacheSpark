The CIT Group, a commercial lender, agreed on Thursday to sell its aircraft leasing business to a Chinese-owned competitor for about $10 billion, signifying a big step by CIT to slim itself down in the face of pressure from investors.CIT is selling its aircraft leasing unit — which owns and manages 334 planes and has an additional 133 on order — to Avolon Holdings Ltd., which is based in Ireland but is owned by the HNA Group of China.Perhaps just as crucially as selling off a noncore business, CIT will use the proceeds to pay out more than $3 billion to its shareholders and to further bolster its balance sheet. The firm has already cleared the move with one of its main regulators, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The $10 billion that Avolon is paying adds up to a 6.7 percent premium over the aircraft leasing unit’s adjusted net asset value as of June 30, according to CIT.AdvertisementThe transaction is likely to please Hudson Executive Capital, the activist hedge fund founded by Douglas Braunstein and James Woolery. Earlier this year, the firm called on CIT to break itself up to improve its stock price.The call from Hudson Executive and other investors effectively reversed the strategy that CIT had pursued under its former chief executive, John Thain, who struck a series of takeovers that propelled the lender into a sizable bank. Mr. Thain stepped down this spring and was succeeded by Ellen R. Alemany.AdvertisementHudson Executive declined to comment.CIT took advice from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Sullivan & Cromwell. Avolon received advice from UBS and Morgan Stanley; the law firms Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; and the consulting firms KPMG and E&Y.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
