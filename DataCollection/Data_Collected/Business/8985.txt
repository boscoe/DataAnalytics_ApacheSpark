Among the transactions he advised on were Forest Laboratories’ sale to its fellow drug manufacturer Actavis and Merck & Company’s takeover of Cubist Pharmaceuticals.Another longtime client is AbbVie, which he advised in its unsuccessful attempt to buy Shire last year.“With his exemplary client focus and dedication to the firm, Henry has been a role model to many throughout his career,” Hernan Cristerna and Chris Ventresca, JPMorgan’s co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions, wrote in the memo.“While we will miss Henry,” the memo continued, “we look forward to the opportunity of working with him as a client.”Ms. Aiyengar, who has worked on huge deals like Burger King’s takeover of Tim Hortons and OfficeMax’s merger with Office Depot, will now become the sole head of that team, reporting to Mr. Cristerna and Mr. Ventresca.A spokeswoman for JPMorgan confirmed the contents of the memo.Advertisement
