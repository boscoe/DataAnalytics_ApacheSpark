SEOUL, South Korea — The de facto holding company of South Korea’s biggest conglomerate, the Samsung Group, on Tuesday sought another cornerstone as it smoothes the path for a management succession, offering more than $8 billion to buy an affiliate with an important stake in the company’s flagship subsidiary, Samsung Electronics.The holding company, Cheil Industries, with interests from construction to fashion, is offering new stock priced to be worth a total of about 8.9 trillion won, or $8.1 billion, to buy the affiliate, the Samsung C&T Corporation, a building company. After recent market jitters over Samsung’s overhaul, shares in Cheil and Samsung C&T rose nearly 15 percent on Tuesday, taking Samsung C&T’s value beyond the offer price to about 10 trillion won.The move combines what analysts consider two key companies in the sprawling, family-controlled Samsung conglomerate. It would also cement the position of the heir-apparent, Jay Y. Lee, who is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics. He would probably remain top shareholder of the merged entity as Samsung prepares for the eventual transfer of control from its ailing patriarch, Lee Kun-hee, to his children.Samsung C&T’s 4.06 percent stake in Samsung Electronics, worth nearly $8 billion at current market prices, makes it the third-largest investor in the tech giant after South Korea’s National Pension Service and Samsung Life Insurance.AdvertisementThe latest move needs to be approved by shareholders, but it probably will not be the last in the group’s revamping, which has not been without hitches. In November, Samsung Heavy Industries scrapped a $2.5 billion takeover of Samsung Engineering because of shareholder opposition.Under the agreement made Tuesday, Cheil is offering 0.35 new Cheil shares, issued at a fixed price, for each Samsung C&T share in a deal that values the target at 8.9 trillion won.Advertisement“Some shareholders that believe that Samsung C&T prices are undervalued could oppose the deal,” said Baek Kwang-jae, a construction analyst at Kyobo Securities. “However, if the share prices continue to rise sharply, shareholders may agree.”A version of this article appears in print on May 27, 2015, in The International New York Times.
