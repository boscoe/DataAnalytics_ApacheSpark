They will remain free during appeals. The DeCosters wanted to avoid jail, but Judge Mark Bennett of United States District Court in Sioux City, Iowa, heeded prosecutorsâ€™ calls for tougher punishment. Prosecutors said the DeCosters knew their Iowa egg facilities were at risk for contamination. Federal health officials linked 1,939 illnesses to the outbreak, but estimate about 56,000 people may have been sickened. The Quality Egg company paid a $6.8 million fine as part of a plea agreement, and the DeCosters paid $100,000 each. Advertisement
