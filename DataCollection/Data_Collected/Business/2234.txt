Sidecar, a delivery and ride-hailing pioneer that has struggled to compete with bigger rivals like Uber and Lyft, said it would stop offering services. In a message posted on Medium, Sidecar’s co-founders, Sunil Paul and Jahan Khanna, said its rides and deliveries would end at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday. The company’s investors included Google Ventures and Richard Branson. While Uber says it is operating in 68 countries and Lyft in 190 cities, Sidecar did business in just eight markets in the United States. Apps for hailing rides have become a huge business, but it is not clear how many companies will survive as the industry grows. Uber and Lyft have raised billions of dollars in funding, and they have taken the lead in the ride-hailing market.A version of this brief appears in print on December 31, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Pioneer of Ride-Hailing, Sidecar to Stop Services.
