Greece and its creditors reached an agreement on Monday that aims to resolve the country’s debt crisis and avoid economic and political fallout from a Greek exit from the eurozone.
Although Greece makes up a small part of the overall European economy, the fate of the country is important.Circles are sized according to each country’s gross domestic product in 2014.Circles are sized according to each country’s gross domestic product in 2014.FINLANDSWEDENBRITAIN16% ofE.U. totalBerlinPOLANDLondonEuropeanUnionGERMANY20.9% of totalParisFRANCE15.3% of totalMilanITALYSPAINMEDITERRANEANSEAGreece1.3% of totalCircles are sized according to each country’s gross domestic product in 2014.BRITAIN16% ofE.U. totalBerlinLondonEuropeanUnionGERMANY20.9% oftotalParisFRANCE15.3% of totalITALYSPAINGreece1.3% of totalBRITAINEuropeanUnionGERMANYFRANCEITALYSPAINGreeceA Greek default would cost European countries much more than extending emergency aid. And the deal is critical for Greece, which needs money to pay its significant debts and other bills. Without fresh aid, the country’s economy, which is already languishing, would risk sinking even further.The prospect of a country leaving the common currency was once unthinkable – it was the driving force behind Europe’s goal to form an “ever closer union.” The deal keeps the eurozone intact, at least for now.The crisis also opened a divide between eurozone countries, including Germany, that opposed further aid to Greece and those, including France and Italy, that said Athens still deserves a helping hand. On Monday, the end of five months of bitter negotiations brought a more optimistic tone. “A deal has been reached,” President François Hollande of France posted on Twitter. “France was looking for one, wanted one. Greece will stay in the eurozone. Europe has won.” But the deal does not stop larger forces challenging the solidarity of Europe.Greece’s creditors pushed for austerity measures and other economic reforms. In part, they did not want to set a dangerous precedent. Overly generous terms could have prompted other countries with high debt levels, like Italy and Portugal, to demand better deals. If the final terms are too harsh, Greece could have difficulty digging out of its economic hole, a reason Athens was resistant.Circles are sized according to each country’s G.D.P. in 2014.
