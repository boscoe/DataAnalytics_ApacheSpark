A large drop in energy prices made up for increases in the costs of food, alcohol and tobacco, services and industrial goods. Still, the figures remains far below the European Central Bank’s aim for an annual rate of just under 2 percent. The central bank’s president, Mario Draghi, said it would continue its 1.1 trillion euro ($1.2 trillion) stimulus program until inflation turned up convincingly, implying the stimulus could be continued beyond September next year. The bank publishes new inflation projections after its governing council meeting on Thursday, which could provide clues to the bank’s future stance. Advertisement
