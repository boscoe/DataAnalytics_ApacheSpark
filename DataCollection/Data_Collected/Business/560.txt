U.S. stocks mustered a slight gain in the final moments of trading on Monday, capping a day of listless action that had the market headed for a downbeat close.A slide in oil prices hammered energy stocks, including Chevron and Exxon Mobil, which ended up as the biggest decliners in the Dow Jones industrial average. Other commodities also fell, hurt by a strengthening dollar.Weight Watchers more than doubled on news that Oprah Winfrey is buying a 10 percent stake in the weight management company and will help promote the company’s services.Investors had their eye on company earnings from Morgan Stanley, Hasbro and others. Both companies tumbled after their results left investors less-than-impressed.AdvertisementStill, Monday’s sluggish trading suggests many investors were holding off on any big moves until they see a broader slice of companies report third-quarter earnings over the next few days, said David Schiegoleit, managing director of investments at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank.Advertisement“A lot of participants are on the sidelines waiting to see those numbers come out and use them as a cue to move forward,” Mr. Schiegoleit said. “The big push in earnings season starts today, particularly after the close, and as we head into the rest of the week.”
