That’s nearly 24 percent more than Pep Boys’ closing price on Friday.Shares of Pep Boys have climbed 39 percent over the last 12 months, with much of the gains coming after the company said that it was weighing a sale of itself.Revenue has been roughly flat over the past four years, eventually prompting the money manager Mario Gabelli to consider a fight over the board. The company settled with the investor in June.Mr. Gabelli’s firm, Gamco, reported a 16 percent stake in the retailer as of Sept. 30, according to the research firm Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Founded in 1921 and based in Philadelphia, Pep Boys sells a range of aftermarket parts like tires, car batteries and performance-enhancing widgets. The company lost $27 million in its most recent fiscal year, on $2 billion in sales.“We are excited to join the Bridgestone family of companies to become part of the world’s largest company-owned tire and automotive service retail network,” Scott P. Sider, the retailer’s chief executive, said in a statement. “This transaction delivers a significant premium for Pep Boys’ shareholders and offers new opportunities for our employees across a bigger business.”The deal is expected to close early next year, pending approval from Pep Boys shareholders and regulators.JPMorgan and the law firm Jones Day advised Bridgestone.
