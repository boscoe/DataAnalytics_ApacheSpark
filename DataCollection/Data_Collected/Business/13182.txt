LONDON — The British retailer Tesco said on Wednesday that its recovery was gaining pace, but it warned that a supermarket price war meant profit growth would be hard to deliver this year.The company, hammered by an accounting scandal and the rise of German discount chains, reported its first increase in underlying annual profit growth in four years and its first quarter of underlying British sales growth in over three years. But Tesco, the country’s biggest retailer, said there was much more work to do.“We feel like we stabilized the business,” Dave Lewis, Tesco’s chief executive, told reporters. “We don’t feel that we’re in the crisis that, being candid, we were 16 months ago.”“More customers are buying more things more often at Tesco,” he said, highlighting a fourth-quarter British volume growth of 3.3 percent and a 2.8 percent rise in customer transactions.AdvertisementHowever, Mr. Lewis warned that profit improvement “won’t be a smooth line,” as Tesco cuts prices and invests in the quality of its products to help protect its leading position in Britain.AdvertisementShares of Tesco, which controls 28 percent of Britain’s grocery market, have risen 31 percent so far this year on recovery hopes, but they fell as much as 5 percent to 186.3 pence in morning trading in London.Sales at British stores open over a year rose 0.9 percent in the final quarter of Tesco’s financial year, which concluded on Feb. 27, building on growth over its six-week Christmas sales period.Tesco also reported a full-year operating profit before one-off items of 944 million pounds, or about $1.3 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations of £932 million and the £940 million it made in 2014-15.That is a far cry from the profit of £3.97 billion that Tesco generated in 2011-12, when it could seemingly do little wrong.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Tesco’s net debt now stands at £5.1 billion, down 40 percent year-on-year.Tesco’s better performance was broad based, with positive and improving underlying sales also achieved in Ireland, continental Europe and Asia, and with improved sales across all store formats and categories.While analysts welcomed the return to British sales growth, they point out that the discounters continue to open stores and take market share, and that competition with traditional rivals — Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s — remains intense.They also note significant cost pressures from the British minimum wage, business rates and rental costs, and uncertainty regarding the June referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
