Those products will be marketed under the Buitoni brand name once the transaction is completed.The sale is subject to regulatory approval.The food giant has engaged in a series of brand sales since Nestlé’s chief executive, Paul Bulcke, unveiled plans two years ago for the company to divest some of its underperforming business lines.Those sales include the divestiture of its 10 percent stake in Givaudan, the Swiss flavor and fragrance company; the sale of its PowerBar nutrition business to the cereal giant Post Holdings; and the divestiture of its Jenny Craig brand in North America, Australia, New Zealand and parts of the Pacific to a private equity firm, North Castle Partners.The acquisition broadens the portfolio of Findus.
