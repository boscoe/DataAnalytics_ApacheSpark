The billionaire investor Cliff Asness is a staunch libertarian who is very much against government intervention.Except, perhaps, when the government intervention involves $35 million going to his firm, AQR Capital Management.The funds from the Connecticut state government are part of efforts to persuade companies not to leave the state and includes loans and grants tied to conditions for jobs to be created.The state has been trying to stem the flow of business leaving after a tax increase last year, and the Connecticut State Bond Commission approved a similar offer to Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund, for $22 million.AdvertisementSome have wondered whether these packages actually create jobs.Case in point: Several months after Bridgewater received approval for its aid package, the company announced a “renovation” that would involve job cuts.AdvertisementKevin Lembo, the state comptroller, has also questioned the wisdom of aiding investment firms that often employ only graduates from top-tier universities when the state could be spending on companies that create more stable, middle-class jobs.The company led by the American billionaire Koch brothers, along with dozens of banks and fund managers, kept billions of dollars in profit from Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme in accounts offshore.And, it turns out, the funds can stay there.They had invested in the Madoff fund from offshore accounts, and a judge said that certain funds held abroad, worth an estimated $2 billion, could not be made available to victims of the Madoff scheme.The judge said foreign bankruptcy proceedings blocked the trustee from gaining access to the money.Koch Industries began investing in the Madoff fund well before its collapse and pulled out $21.5 million in 2005.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It’s part and parcel of the unsavory marketing of his brands that he also did during the campaign.”— Norman Eisen, former chief White House ethics lawyer for President Obama, on Donald J. Trump’s use of his properties as a backdrop for his transition.• The Commerce Department will report data on durable goods order in October.
