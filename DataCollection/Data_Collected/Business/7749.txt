Anthem previously offered $184 a share.The two sides could announce an agreement this week, these people added, although discussions were proceeding and could fall through.Should the two insurers reach a deal, it would be the latest sign of the consolidation sweeping the American health insurance industry, coming weeks after Aetna agreed to buy Humana, the smallest of the big five insurers, for $37 billion.A deal would also bring an end to a rocky series of negotiations. Anthem took its campaign to buy Cigna public in June after months of talks foundered as a result of disagreements on several issues, including who would run the combined company. The two companies have agreed that Joseph R. Swedish, Anthem’s chief executive, will oversee the combined insurer.Health insurers have been spurred toward a new round of consolidation amid new efforts to pare costs and move into the government and individual markets. That merger wave was recently bolstered by the Supreme Court’s upholding the portion of the Affordable Care Act that subsidizes consumers who buy policies through the government’s online marketplace.Time has also been of the essence. Analysts have said that antitrust regulators will probably allow only some of the potential mergers before deciding that too much power is being concentrated in too few hands.One question has been what the UnitedHealth Group, the biggest of the American health insurers, will do. Analysts had largely discounted a UnitedHealth bid for Humana, given the two companies’ strong presence in Medicare.Together, Anthem, which runs Blue Cross plans in 14 states, and Cigna, which offers insurance plans through employers, would have around $115 billion in revenue. Cigna also has 24 million behavioral care customers, nearly 14 million dental care members, 8 million pharmacy benefit plan members and 1.5 million Medicare Part D pharmacy customers.Representatives for the two insurers were not immediately available for comment.Advertisement
