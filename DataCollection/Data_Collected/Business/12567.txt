The lender announced plans last year to dismantle its global investment bank and to reduce the number of countries where it operates.Most of the roles being cut are primarily in back- and middle-office functions, rather than customer-facing roles. They also include a small number of technology jobs.R.B.S. plans to shift about 300 of those positions to India, where it already has similar back-office operations.“As part of R.B.S.’s drive to be a stronger, simpler and fairer bank, we have been restructuring our corporate and institutional bank, as well as reducing its size, to focus on our core customers and products,” a R.B.S. spokesman said on Tuesday.“As this process continues, our front-line staff need a simpler, clearer, more efficient relationship with our middle- and back-office functions to better serve customers, so we’re reshaping our services business accordingly. Unfortunately the changes will result in some job losses.”The bank has not reported a full-year profit since 2007 and has been plagued by additional provisions for legal and regulatory matters as it looks to reduce its costs and improve its profitability.Ewan Stevenson, the bank’s chief financial officer, warned in February that the bank expected “further substantial conduct costs to come.”The British government has started winding down its stake in the bank, which received a bailout of 45 billion pounds, or about $65 billion, during the financial crisis. It raised about £2.1 billion in its first sale of shares it held in R.B.S. in August.Advertisement
