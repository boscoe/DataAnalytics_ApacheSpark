The workers will join Writers Guild of America, East.“The creative freedom we enjoy is one of the things that makes HuffPost a great place to work,” the Huffington Post organizing committee wrote in a statement on Wednesday. “We believe organizing is the best way both to preserve what’s already working and to bring about positive change.”The committee added, “Simply, a union will give us a voice in our newsroom’s future.”In its statement, the committee listed reasons for unionizing, including a push for better pay, clearer job responsibilities and a more efficient hiring process, which it called “lengthy” and “highly subjective.” The committee also said it wanted a union to push for more diversity on the staff.Lowell Peterson, the executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East, said the organizing effort would affect roughly 300 newsroom employees. He said the guild had been talking with The Huffington Post’s editorial staff for months.The Huffington Post, co-founded by Arianna Huffington, has been criticized for expecting its writers to work at a grueling pace, which has reportedly hurt employee morale in the past.Ms. Huffington said in a statement that she supported the unionization efforts.“The Huffington Post believes in an environment of mutual respect among all our staff,” she said. “Our top priority is always the happiness and well-being of our employees. We fully support our newsroom employees’ right to discuss unionizing and will embrace whatever decision they make on this issue.”The announcement by the staff of The Huffington Post — whose corporate parent, AOL, was recently bought by Verizon for $4.4 billion — comes after recent unionization efforts at other online media outlets, including Vice and Salon.The moves are viewed by some as a sign that web publications have grown up. Many sites, including The Huffington Post, have ambitious plans that include global expansion and more original reporting.Mr. Peterson said employees at online media outlets like The Huffington Post would benefit from having the collective bargaining power that a union brings, particularly as the industry continues to mature.“As unforeseen issues arise, as the business changes, as economics change, there will be a process in place where the editorial staff gets to say what it thinks and has a voice in it,” he said.Advertisement
