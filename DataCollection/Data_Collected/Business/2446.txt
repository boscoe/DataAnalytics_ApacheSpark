The stock market is bouncing back from a tough start to 2015.Investors sent shares sharply higher for a second straight day on Thursday, erasing heavy losses from the first few days of the year.The gains were driven by a combination of positive domestic economic news and rising hopes for stimulus from Europe’s central bank. The price of oil is also showing signs of stabilizing after six months of heavy losses, and there is renewed confidence that the Federal Reserve will keep supporting the economy as growth outside the United States appears to be flagging.The wild swings in stock prices will probably be more common this year as investors try to anticipate when, if at all, the Fed will start to raise interest rates, said J. J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.“People will have to get used to volatility at a higher level,” Mr. Kinahan said. “It’s going to be one of the primary stories for 2015.”The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 36.24 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,062.14. The index is now up 0.2 percent for the year, after falling 2.7 percent in the first three days of trading.AdvertisementThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 323.35 points, or 1.8 percent, to 17,907.87. The Nasdaq gained 85.72 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,736.19.AdvertisementComments from Charles Evans, president of the Fed’s Chicago branch, late Wednesday gave stocks a lift. Mr. Evans said that the Fed shouldn’t rush to raise interest rates because inflation was likely to remain tame for several years, according to Bloomberg News. The prospect of more stimulus from central banks around the world is also driving the rebound.Pressure is rising on the European Central Bank to support the region’s flagging economy. European data on Wednesday showed that consumer prices fell in December for the first time since 2009.Many analysts expect the bank to announce a plan this month to buy European government bonds. Such a move, known as quantitative easing, is intended to hold down long-term interest rates and stimulate borrowing and spending.“Oddly enough, the market was helped by some of the weaker data out of the eurozone,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “In many ways, the bad news was the good news.”Investors also got encouraging news on hiring Thursday. A report showed that fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, which is a sign that employers expect the economy to keep growing, prompting them to hold on to workers. The Labor Department said Thursday that applications for unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 last week, to 294,000.Economists forecast that a government report Friday will show that private employers added 243,000 jobs last month.
