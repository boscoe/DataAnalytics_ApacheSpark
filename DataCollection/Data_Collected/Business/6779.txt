Anthony Albanese, chief of staff to Benjamin M. Lawsky, the New York State superintendent of financial services, will succeed his boss on an interim basis when Mr. Lawsky steps down next week.Mr. Lawsky, who is leaving government to start his own legal and consulting firm, announced the appointment in a memo to his staff on Friday. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is conducting a search for a permanent successor.
                Benjamin M. Lawky’s four-year tenure as New York’s overseer of banking and insurance shook up the sleepy world of financial regulation in New York.            Mr. Lawsky stressed continuity at the Department of Financial Services under Mr. Albanese. “His appointment for this period as acting superintendent means business as usual for the department,” Mr. Lawsky said. “I know that under his leadership D.F.S. will continue all of the important initiatives we have underway while also continuing to be a smart, modern, and forward-thinking prudential regulator.”Mr. Albanese, who is 43, has been the main negotiator for all the bank enforcement actions under Mr. Lawsky. One of his most important duties was negotiating a settlement last year with the French bank BNP Paribas for transferring billions of dollars on behalf of Sudan and other countries blacklisted by the United States. The bank agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay an $8.9 billion penalty, a record sum for a bank in a sanctions-related case. Mr. Lawsky allowed BNP to continue to operate in the state, but he did temporarily suspend its ability to process payments in dollar denominations, a function known as dollar clearing.Before joining the department in 2011, Mr. Albanese was a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges.Here’s the whole memo:Dear DFS Team,As you all know by now I will be transitioning out of my role as Superintendent next week. I am pleased to report that when I depart, Anthony Albanese, my Chief of Staff, will take over as the Acting Superintendent while the Governor’s office conducts a search for a permanent replacement.Most of you know Anthony well. He has been by my side since we launched and has played an incredibly important role in getting DFS to where it is today. Anthony has helped lead DFS since the day he got here in 2011.
