It said on Friday it decided to stick with the original agreement after concluding that the bid from the consortium was not superior. As a result, it said, it would not engage in discussions about the proposal or allow the group to start any due diligence.As well as K.K.R., the bidding group — called the Pacific Consortium — includes the Australian fund First State Super, Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners and Macquarie, the Australian bank.Tatts said in a statement that the offer significantly undervalued its lottery operations, which manage lotteries in Australia, even as it said that it expected that business to post weaker-than-expected results in the first half of next year.At the same time, Tatts said the offer overvalued its wagering business, which runs horse- and sports-event betting. Under the bid from the Pacific Consortium, that business would have been sold to another buyer or would have been listed on a stock exchange.“The Pacific Consortium is reviewing its position and absorbing the details of the material profit downgrade announced by Tatts Group today,” Kerry Schott, the chairwoman of the consortium, said in an emailed statement.At the time the Tabcorp deal was announced in October, it implied a value for Tatts of 4.34 Australian dollars, or $3.32 at the time, per share. That compares with the offer of 4.40 to 5 Australian dollars per share that the rival bidding group submitted this month. Both offers include a mix of cash and shares, meaning their values can fluctuate.Tatts shares closed almost 3 percent lower on Friday.Advertisement
