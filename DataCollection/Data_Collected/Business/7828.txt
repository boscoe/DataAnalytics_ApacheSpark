It also led to the loss of thousands of jobs at the bank.In May, the Dutch government said it favored proceeding with an I.P.O. to sell it stake and was likely to remain a shareholder for a number of years as it sells its shares of the bank in stages.The government previously said the first sale would probably represent a 20 percent to 30 percent stake in the lender.The bank itself had been valued at €15 billion, or about $16.7 billion, in previous estimates by the outside experts, the government has said. It also could be one of the largest I.P.O.s in the Netherlands.The government delayed a decision on an I.P.O. in March following a disagreement with lawmakers about executive salaries at the lender.A group of ABN Amro’s top managers eventually gave up a pay increase after the outcry.ABN Amro’s prospects have improved in recent years as it has shed operations and reduced its provisions for bad loans.The bank’s underlying profit, which excludes certain special items, more than doubled in 2014, to €1.55 billion from €752 million in 2013.Advertisement
