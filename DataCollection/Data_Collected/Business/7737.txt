Walbert, the Horizon Pharma chairman, president and chief executive, said in a news release.“We are resolute in our commitment to acquire Depomed and we call upon Depomed’s board of directors to listen to their shareholders, fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities and meet with us in order to promptly complete a negotiated transaction,” he said.The higher offer is contingent on Depomed entering “good faith discussions” with Horizon Pharma.“We urge you to thoughtfully evaluate this revised proposal and engage with us to facilitate a transaction over the next several days,” Mr. Walbert said in a letter to Depomed’s board. “We and our advisers stand ready to immediately meet with your management team and board to negotiate a mutually acceptable agreement.”Horizon Pharma made a formal offer to acquire Depomed in late May but has said it has been repeatedly rebuffed by Depomed’s board. Horizon Pharma said that it sent its latest offer to Depomed’s board in a letter on Tuesday.Depomed previously said that its directors had carefully considered Horizon Pharma’s previous offer and “unanimously determined that it was not in the best interests of Depomed or its shareholders.”On Tuesday, Depomed said that its board, in consultation with the company’s independent financial and legal advisers, would “carefully review” the revised proposal and determine the action it believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The company again described the Horizon Pharma offer as a “highly conditional, unsolicited and nonbinding proposal.”“Depomed noted that today’s purported increase does not reflect any increase in the amount of Horizon stock that the Depomed shareholders would receive, nor any increase in the pro-forma ownership for the Depomed shareholders, and is the result of the trading value of Horizon’s stock having increased since it made its initial offer,” Depomed said in a news release.If completed, the transaction would add to a string of deals by Horizon Pharma in the last two years.In 2014, Horizon Pharma agreed to acquire Vidara Therapeutics International for $660 million in cash and stock, and Hyperion Therapeutics of California for $1.1 billion in cash in March.Depomed, based in Newark, Calif., makes products to treat pain including Nucynta, which helps manage severe pain. The company posted sales of $114.2 million in 2014 and has about 450 employees.A deal would also be the latest in a flurry of transactions in the health care industry this year, particularly among pharmaceutical companies.Horizon Pharma, based in Dublin, makes rare-disease drugs like Actimmune, which is used to help reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with chronic granulomatous disease. It reported sales of $297 million in 2014 and has more than 630 employees.Advertisement
