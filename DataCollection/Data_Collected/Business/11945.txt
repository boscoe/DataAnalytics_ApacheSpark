It did so only after the internal memo was sent anonymously to the Food and Drug Administration, which began an investigation.The company conducted a recall, which was actually a change in the label, not the removal of the product from the market.Kent Jarrell, a spokesman for the company, said the initial internal memo was actually incorrect and contradicted by further careful analysis. He said the warning language added to the GranuFlo label in 2012 was eventually removed. GranuFlo, and a related product called NaturaLyte, are used in dialysis machines to help cleanse patients’ blood.In the first case to go to trial, a jury in Massachusetts state court ruled that Fresenius was negligent, for not distributing the memo more widely, but that a patient’s death could not be attributed to GranuFlo, so no monetary damages were awarded, according to Mr. Jarrell and to Christopher Seeger, a lawyer who led the settlement negotiations for the plaintiffs.But if the initial concern was unwarranted and Fresenius won the first trial, why would it pay $250 million to settle? Mr. Jarrell suggested that a reason was to put the more than 10,000 lawsuits behind it.“Fresenius deeply regrets the confusion and concern temporarily generated by the November 2011 memorandum,” he said in an emailed statement.Mr. Seeger, who is a founding partner at the New York firm Seeger Weiss, said he disagreed that there was no problem with GranuFlo.“When you’re paying hundreds of millions, you can say all you want that there’s no admission of wrongdoing or liability, but people draw their own conclusions from that,” he said.Fresenius said in a news release Wednesday that the settlement would take effect only if 97 percent of all plaintiffs agreed to it by July. It said its insurers would pay $220 million of the amount and Fresenius would take a $60 million pretax charge to cover its share of the settlement and other costs.Advertisement
