As in medicine or teaching, time in actual practice is critical for a new lawyer to become competent.The answer is paid training, but state bar associations are not responsible to provide it. Paid opportunities are a function of market forces, and the market is dismal, as The New York Times has well documented.The tough reality is that a new bar member who does not find real employment close to graduation loses his law school knowledge and confidence over time, and the longer the graduate is out of work, the greater the loss of knowledge and confidence.Peter DeAndreisEureka, Calif., June 24The writer is a lawyer and a member of the Oregon bar.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
