The Swedish retailer Ikea is recalling around 442,000 children’s night lights because the cover of the light can detach, creating a risk of electrical shock. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Tuesday that Ikea was taking all of its Patrull night lights off the market. The agency said a child in Austria who was trying to take the light out of an outlet sustained an electric shock and a minor hand injury when the cover came off. No injuries have been reported in the United States or Canada. The agency advised consumers to stop using the product and contact the company for a refund.A version of this brief appears in print on August 19, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ikea Recalls Night Lights That Pose Safety Risks .
