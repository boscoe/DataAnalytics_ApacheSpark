Mondelez International, the name behind brands including Cadbury, Oreo and Sour Patch, on Wednesday reported lower sales and earnings in the fourth quarter.The company, which was split from Kraft in 2012, said sales slid 7 percent to $8.8 billion, and its earnings dropped more than 70 percent to $500 million, or 29 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Dec. 31.Profitability looked far worse than it was because in the same quarter a year ago, the company’s bottom line was plumped by an almost $3 billion settlement it won in a dispute with Starbucks. Adjusted for that extraordinary event, negative currency swings and other nonoperational charges, earnings rose 26 percent, to 47 cents a share, in the latest quarter.Mondelez, like other companies with large confectionary businesses, has faced higher costs for two of its chief commodities, cocoa and milk. The company tried to pass its higher prices on to consumers, but the strategy was met with mixed success.Investment analysts also are waiting to see whether the company’s use of zero-based budgeting, a financial management tactic that Mondelez is using to cut costs, pays off.For the year, Mondelez’s sales dropped 3 percent, to $34.2 billion, while earnings sank to $2.2 billion, from $3.9 billion in 2013.A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Sales Slide for Mondelez, Maker of Sweets.
