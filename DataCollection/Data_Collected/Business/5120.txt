Below are quarterly returns for variable annuities. The annuity names are listed, followed by subaccounts for each annuity. When available, additional information includes the company’s telephone number, as well as the maximum surrender charge and the period after which that charge is no longer levied. The letter “R” indicates that there is a so-called rolling back-end load, which is a deferred sales charge that applies to each additional dollar invested. The table includes only annuities with at least $6 billion in assets.
