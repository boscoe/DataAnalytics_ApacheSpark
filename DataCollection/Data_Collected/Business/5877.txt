WASHINGTON —  Consumers increased their borrowing in March by the largest amount in nearly a year as credit cards rebounded after two months of declines.Consumer borrowing expanded by $20.5 billion in March to a record of $3.36 trillion, the Federal Reserve reported Thursday. It was the largest increase since April 2014.Borrowing in the category that covers credit cards shot up $4.4 billion to $889.4 billion in March after having fallen in January and February. It was the biggest gain for consumer credit since last July. Borrowing in the category that covers auto and student loans rose $16.2 billion to $2.47 trillion.The increase in borrowing on credit cards could be evidence that consumers are beginning to feel more confident about taking on debt to finance retail purchases, a development that should signal strengthening consumer demand in the months ahead. Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.

But even with rising credit card debt, the category is still 8.6 percent below its peak from July 2008.AdvertisementConsumer spending growth slowed sharply in the January-to-March quarter, a big factor in the slowdown in overall growth. The economy eked out a tiny 0.2 percent increase in gross domestic product in the first quarter.AdvertisementA separate report, also released Thursday, suggested that while growth had stalled, employers were only lightly tapping the brakes.The Labor Department said that weekly applications for unemployment benefits rose 3,000 to 265,000. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell 4,250 to 279,500, the lowest level since May 2000. The total number of people receiving benefits was 2.23 million, the lowest figure since November 2000.Weekly applications are a proxy for layoffs. They have stayed below 300,000 for the last two months, which usually indicates additional hiring on the expectation of business improving.

But the low levels of layoffs indicate “that report’s weakness may have been a blip in an otherwise solid trend,” said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at BNP Paribas.Economists expect a labor rebound in the government’s April jobs report to be released Friday. They anticipate that 222,500 workers were hired, causing the unemployment rate to slip to 5.4 percent, according to FactSet.As for growth, economists are expecting a rise of 2 percent to 2.5 percent in the April-to-June period and 3 percent in the second half of the year. But those forecasts are heavily dependent on a solid rebound in consumer spending.Consumer borrowing in the Fed’s monthly report is up 6.9 percent from a year ago, a gain heavily influenced by the rise in the auto and student loan category. Growth in the category that covers credit cards has also accelerated in the last year.The Fed’s monthly credit report does not cover mortgages or other loans backed by real estate like home equity loans.A version of this article appears in print on May 8, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Consumer Borrowing Rises by $20.5 Billion .
