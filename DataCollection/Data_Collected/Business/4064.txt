MUMBAI — India’s central bank and the finance ministry have agreed, in the biggest change to monetary policy in more than two decades, to introduce inflation targets to counter a long history of volatile prices.The agencies set a consumer inflation target of 4 percent, with a band of plus or minus 2 percentage points, by the financial year that ends in March 2017, according to a document dated Feb. 20 and published on the ministry website on Monday.The central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, will first aim to get consumer inflation below 6 percent by January.The changes bring closer to reality a goal pursued by Raghuram Rajan, the central bank’s governor, who has said that inflation targets, more commonly seen in developed economies, are vital for India.AdvertisementThe central bank will be deemed to have missed its target if consumer inflation is at more than 6 percent or less than 2 percent for three consecutive quarters, starting in the 2015-16 fiscal year, the document said.The central bank’s governor will determine the country’s key interest rates or any other measures needed to achieve that inflation target. There was no mention of a long-expected Monetary Policy Committee.AdvertisementThe finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said on Saturday that the government and the central bank had agreed on a new monetary policy framework and promised to change the Reserve Bank of India Act, which is required to put the changes into effect.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
