Ford is again recalling about 340,000 Windstar minivans from 1998 to 2003 because an earlier effort to fix a rear axle that could break might not have been done properly, the automaker said Wednesday in a news release.In 2010, Ford recalled about 500,000 Windstars in the United States because corrosion could cause the rear axle to fail, making the vehicle difficult to control. Ford replaced axles that were cracked, and on other vehicles it installed a supporting bracket. On Wednesday, Ford said some of those brackets were not properly installed. The automaker said there have been “a small number of accidents that might be connected to this issue but no injuries.” A Ford spokeswoman, Kelli Felker, said she did not know how many axles may have failed without resulting in an accident.Ms. Felker said Ford “believes the bracket is an adequate fix,” but that it was offering $300 to help owners who want a new rear axle. Ms. Felker said that was about half the cost of the repair, but for owners who reported their experience to carcomplaints.com, the average cost of replacing the rear axle was about $1,000.Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, wrote in an email that Ford’s encouraging owners to get new axles was an admission that “the only effective remedy is a new rear axle.”In another action Wednesday, Ford said it was recalling about 37,000 2015 F-150 pickups because the adaptive cruise control — which uses radar to check for vehicles ahead — could malfunction and cause the vehicle to suddenly apply the brakes.A version of this brief appears in print on October 1, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ford Windstar Minivans Recalled for a Second Time.
