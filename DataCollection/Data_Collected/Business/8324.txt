Starting this fall, new episodes of the children’s television series “Sesame Street” will appear exclusively on the cable network HBO and its streaming outlets. After nine months, the episodes will be available free on PBS, the show’s longtime home.This isn’t the first time “Sesame Street” and HBO have crossed paths.Over the years, “Sesame Street” has parodied a number of popular HBO series, including “Game of Thrones,” “True Blood” and “Boardwalk Empire.”In the “Game of Chairs” parody, which has been viewed more than 2.6 million times on YouTube, four players play a game of musical chairs to determine who will win the crown as king or queen.In the “True Mud” parody, which has been viewed more than 349,000 times on YouTube, a grouch has an appetite for mud.And in the “Birdwalk Empire” clip, viewed more than 734,000 times, two groups of birds face off “beak to beak.”Now, let’s get creative.
