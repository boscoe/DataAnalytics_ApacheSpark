 U.S. TAKES ON PAYDAY LENDERS  |  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will soon release the first draft of federal regulations to govern a wide range of short-term loans made by the $46 billion payday loan industry, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook. The rules are expected to address expensive credit backed by car titles and some installment loans that stretch longer than the traditional two-week payday loan, according to industry lawyers, consumer groups and government authorities briefed on the discussions.“Behind that decision, the people said, is a stark acknowledgment of just how successfully lenders have adapted to keep offering high-cost products despite state laws meant to rein in the loans,” Ms. Silver-Greenberg writes. The regulations will likely set off a new round of lobbying from payday lenders. Already, some payday lenders have begun aggressively lobbying a number of states, including Kentucky, Washington and New Mexico, to weaken state laws restricting expensive loans or to stop new caps before they gain ground. The lenders contend that their loans are the only option for millions of Americans.At the center of the regulations being considered, the people briefed on the matter said, is a requirement that lenders assess whether borrowers can repay loans at the end of a two-week period by examining their income, other debts and their payment history. Among the most hotly debated parts of the rules, the people said, are what kinds of loans fall under the guidelines. Some lenders, they said, have pushed to keep the definition narrow, arguing that car title loans and installment loans should escape the crackdown.

GREECE SETS UP CLASH WITH CREDITORS  |  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece said on Sunday in a speech to Parliament that his government would not seek an extension of a bailout program and would carry out its campaign pledges to roll back austerity, Niki Kitsantonis writes in The New York Times. Greece’s creditors ‒ the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund ‒ want the new government to seek an extension beyond Feb. 28 of the European portion of the country’s bailout of 240 billion euros, or $270 billion.
But the government has said that despite shrinking cash reserves, it is not interested in the latest portion of the bailout, a loan of €7 billion, because of what it sees as onerous conditions, Ms. Kitsantonis writes. Instead, it has said it wants a program between now and the end of May to bridge the gap and permission to raise short-term funding by issuing treasury bills. Mr. Tsipras said extending the bailout would be tantamount to continuing the “mistakes and disaster” of the past, and he said his government needed “fiscal space” for discussion on restructuring of debt.
European stocks on Monday morning were down on rising fears that Greece would leave the eurozone. The stock market in Athens was down about 6 percent. Markets in Asia were mixed on disappointing Chinese trade data.



HIDDEN CASH FLOWS TO NEW YORK REAL ESTATE  |  For more than a year, The New York Times examined the influx of global money fueling the high-end real estate boom in New York City. The results of the inquiry are detailed in a five-part series, “Towers of Secrecy,” that examines the people behind shell companies buying elite real estate. The series will run this week.
The investigation pierced the secrecy of more than 200 shell companies that have owned condominiums at one complex, the Time Warner Center. There, 37 percent of the condominiums are owned by foreigners. At least 16 foreigners who have owned in the building have been the subject of government inquiries, either personally or as heads of companies. Condominium 74B, for instance, was purchased in 2010 for $15.65 million by a secretive entity called 25CC ST74B L.L.C., which traces to the family of Vitaly Malkin, a former Russian senator and banker who was barred from entering Canada because of suspected connections to organized crime.
The Times inquiry also found that a Malaysian financier named Jho Low, who is close to the family of Malaysia’s prime minister, also has a taste for New York real estate. “Just as many of the wealthy use shell companies to keep the movement of money opaque, they also use people like Mr. Low,” The Times writes. “Whether shopping for new business opportunities or real estate, he has often done so on behalf of investors or, as he likes to say, friends. Whether the money belongs to others or is his own, the lines are frequently blurry, the identity of the buyer elusive.”



ON THE AGENDA  |  G20 finance ministers and central bank governors meet in Istanbul for a two-day summit. President Obama meets with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at 9:55 a.m. at the White House. Jerome H. Powell, a Federal Reserve governor, gives a speech titled “Audit the Fed and Other Proposals” at 4 p.m. at the Catholic University of America’s Columbus School of Law. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries publishes its monthly oil market report at 7 a.m.



HSBC FALLS ON TAX AVOIDANCE CLAIMS  |  Shares of the British bank HSBC declined in early trading on Monday after a consortium of media organizations accused its Swiss private banking arm on Sunday of helping clients hide billions of dollars in assets from international tax authorities before 2007, DealBook’s Chad Bray writes. 
In a report released on Sunday, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, along with a number of other news outlets, said that secret documents revealed that bank employees had reassured clients that HSBC would not disclose details of their accounts to tax authorities in their home countries and discussed options to avoid paying taxes on those assets. The report was based on account information that dated to 2007.
In a long response, HSBC said that the lender’s Swiss operations “have undergone a radical transformation” in recent years and that tax-reporting obligations in the past fell to the individuals, rather than their banking institutions. Shares of HSBC fell 1.7 percent, to 6.10 pounds, or about $9.29, a share in early trading in London on Monday.
