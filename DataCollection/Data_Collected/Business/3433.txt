Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide said on Tuesday that it planned to spin off its time-share division into a separate publicly traded company, joining the swelling ranks of corporations breaking themselves up.The trend has taken hold as companies have looked to slim down their operations to improve their stock prices.Starwood added that the spinoff effort also fit its strategy of becoming “asset light,” focusing more on growing its brand and less on the more capital-intensive business of actually running hotels and resorts.Now, the company will spin off what it calls its vacation ownership business, which it says reported $640 million in sales last year and has sold more than $6 billion worth of time-share intervals during its history.Letting the business become its own publicly traded concern will give it access to the public markets to help it raise money for its own growth initiatives, Frits van Paasschen, Starwood’s chief executive, said in a statement.“This is the right time for us to spin off our vacation-ownership business and move Starwood forward in its asset-light strategy,” he said. “Separating this distinct part of our business will allow Starwood to continue participating in this growth industry through a fee-based business model, as we do with our managed and franchised hotel business.”Citigroup and Credit Suisse advised Starwood on its plans.A version of this article appears in print on 02/11/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Time-Share Spinoff.
