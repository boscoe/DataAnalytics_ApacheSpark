Video from the eighth crash test of a Trinity guardrail, which shows a Geo Metro spinning out after hitting the guardrail, causing the driver’s door to strike a bent piece of metal.The federal agency charged with investigating a potentially dangerous guardrail defended its methods of analysis, after it was criticized for giving a guardrail a passing grade in a crash test despite severe damage to the driver’s door.Among critics of the decision on Friday were lawyers in a recent whistle-blower lawsuit involving Trinity’s ET-Plus guardrail, who focused on how the Federal Highway Administration did not apply guidelines the agency had in place in 2003 to judge if a crash test should pass or fail. (The ET-Plus was tested under safety standards used in 2005, when the modified guardrail was first sold.)Suzanne Emmerling, a spokeswoman for the Federal Highway Administration, said on Saturday that the 2003 study was “not applicable to the crash test results that were analyzed” for the ET-Plus, since that guideline had since been revised and was no longer used.On Friday, the agency said measurements taken of the lower part of the driver’s door showed it was pushed into the passenger compartment by 6.75 inches. The agency concluded that the damage was not likely to cause serious injury, and that the ET-Plus deserved to pass. That prompted criticism from lawyers for the whistle-blower case that a guideline the Federal Highway Administration put in place before 2003 was ignored.
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published a study at the request of the Federal Highway Administration that stated the guideline for damage to the occupant compartment had been set at six inches deep. The study concluded that significant injuries were happening even when damage was less than six inches, and suggested re-evaluating the guideline to potentially make it even stricter.AdvertisementMs. Emmerling said that the 2003 study on guardrail intrusion involved crash data where the damage happened to the front side panel area of the car, as well as the floor area near the driver’s feet, but not the door itself. Therefore, she said, the agency did not consider it relevant to the eighth ET-Plus test.AdvertisementThat test, conducted in late January, involved a 1998 Geo Metro traveling about 60 miles an hour. It was driven into an ET-Plus guardrail and spun out, causing the driver’s door to strike a bent piece of the metal guardrail and collapse inward. In video footage released on Friday by the agency, the crash test dummy can be seen being thrown to the side as the door caves in.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The agency said that was not required. The report used a comparison of the 6.75 inch measurement in the lower leg area, and compared that to an analysis of data on other crashes with similar deformations to conclude that there was a low risk of serious injury.Experts for the lawyers in the recent whistle-blower case involving the ET-Plus said they disagreed with the agency.“The degree of injury, and therefore the risk, would actually be greater when the guardrail intrudes into the driver’s door than when the intrusion is ahead of the driver’s-side door and into the fender,” said Brian Coon, who was an expert witness for the whistle-blower lawsuit.A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Safety Agency Defends Guardrail Test.
