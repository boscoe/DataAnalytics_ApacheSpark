AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedAfter a deadly school shooting in Newtown, Conn., more than two years ago, the Wall Street owner of the manufacturer of the rifle used in the assault publicly pledged to sell the company.Now, having failed so far to find a buyer, the $20 billion investment firm, Cerberus Capital Management, essentially will let its investors sell their stakes in the company, Remington Outdoor, formerly the Freedom Group, and move the manufacturer out of its funds and into a special financial vehicle.The decision by Cerberus, disclosed in a letter to investors on Friday, is an attempt to mollify its public pension fund investors, like the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which have long called for the sale of the gun maker.Its struggle to sell Remington, whose Bushmaster rifle was used by Adam Lanza in his attack on the Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 26 children and adults in December 2012, illustrates how difficult the market has become for gun makers.Sales of firearms surged in 2013 in the face of fears of tougher ownership laws. The worst of those fears have since subsided, but that stockpiling has led to a glut of guns in the United States.Many firearms manufacturers have had declining revenue over the last year. Another gun company, Colt Defense, the maker of the M1911 handgun, has announced a financial reorganization plan as it has struggled to make debt payments.In its decision to cash out investors, Cerberus has all but acknowledged that it must hold on to its investment for a while longer. In the letter, which was reviewed by The New York Times, the private equity firm said that it would take Remington out of its main private equity funds and put it into a separate financial entity.Cerberus will then let its investors sell their individual stakes in the gun maker back to the company.“We are disappointed that we were unable to effect an outright sale of the company or other comparable transaction,” the private equity firm wrote in the letter.Investors have 30 days to decide if they want to take up the offer, though many are expected to do so. As recently as last month, California’s treasurer publicly urged the state teacher pension fund to sell its 2.5 percent stake in the gun manufacturer.A spokesman for Cerberus declined to comment.Cerberus first entered the gun business by buying Bushmaster Firearms seven years ago. The private equity firm — named after the multiheaded dog that guarded the gates of the Greek underworld — then bought a number of other gun manufacturers, including the nearly two-century-old Remington Arms, the country’s oldest firearms maker.The move was a characteristically bold and tough-minded one by Cerberus, which made its name wading into deals that others feared. It first rose to prominence by investing in the debt of distressed companies, an often bare-knuckled business where fighting over cents on the dollar is the norm.The company’s founder, Stephen A. Feinberg, has shown a particular affinity for investments tied to the military. He is an avid hunter whose preferred firearm is a Remington 700 rifle.Through that string of deal-making, the firm built up what became known as the Freedom Group into the country’s biggest firearms maker, with 3,200 employees and sales in more than 60 countries.Yet the Sandy Hook shooting eventually prompted Cerberus to try to retreat from the business — an unusual instance of a Wall Street firm bowing to social concerns over one of its investments. The firm was affected by the tragedy on a more personal level as well, since Mr. Feinberg’s father was a resident of Newtown at the time.“We believe that this decision allows us to meet our obligations to the investors whose interests we are entrusted to protect without being drawn into the national debate that is more properly pursued by those with the formal charter and public responsibility to do so,” the firm said in announcing a sales process for Remington.But gun manufacturers’ fears of a crackdown after the shooting were allayed by a series of victories. Congress defeated efforts by the Obama administration two years ago to enact tougher gun control laws, particularly stricter background check requirements.“Right now it’s not even possible to get even the mildest restrictions through Congress, and we should be ashamed of that,” President Obama said last summer.And gun sales spiked as customers feared a clampdown on firearms.Still, the tide has turned against Cerberus and the gun industry, at least for now. Gun sales began slowing last year. Remington reported a nearly 28 percent drop in sales from 2013, to $939.3 million. And it swung to a $68.2 million loss from a $57.7 million profit. (The company also cited a recall of millions of triggers for its Remington Model 700, which has been reported to fire without the trigger’s being pulled, as weighing on its results.)A chief rival, Smith & Wesson, said that its sales for the 12 months ended Jan. 31 fell about 15 percent, to $541.6 million.Over all, the number of background checks processed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, a rough indicator of interest in gun sales, declined slightly in 2014, to just under 21 million.“Concern over more restrictive government legislation contributed to strong demand in 2013, which has now returned to more normalized levels,” Remington wrote in its annual financial report.Weeks after the Sandy Hook shooting, Cerberus moved to sell the gun maker, hiring longtime advisers at the investment bank Lazard to run the process. Since then, the firm has struggled to find an acceptable deal.The company, which Cerberus had hoped would fetch about $1 billion, is too big for some rivals to afford. Sturm, Ruger & Company, for example, is about the same size, while Smith & Wesson holds a market capitalization of approximately $813 million.According to Friday’s investor letter, Remington is now valued at about $880 million, including its debt, and investors’ individual stakes will be valued accordingly.And Remington’s financial performance dissuaded many private equity firms from offering a bid acceptable to Cerberus.“Market pressures and operational difficulties, which began to significantly impact the performance of the company late in 2013, have impeded both further efforts to sell the company and our ability to provide options for our investors,” the firm wrote in its letter.”Compounding the problem has been the reluctance of big lenders to participate in the sales process for fear of potential hits to their reputation. Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse have rarely advised or lent money to deals involving firearms makers, making it more difficult for potential buyers to afford Remington.Even Mr. Feinberg, chief of Cerberus, declined to buy the company using both his and others’ personal fortunes.By November 2013, all potential strategic buyers dropped out of the running for Remington and two other private equity firms dropped out or were rejected. Weeks later, Cerberus announced a plan to sell a stake in the gun maker to an unnamed partner, as well as raise hundreds of millions of dollars in new debt.Only half of that effort succeeded, as the minority investment never materialized. The cash raised from the debt offering, however, will help pay for what amounts to a stock buyback, which is expected to be completed by mid-June.For now, Cerberus executives, Remington management and any investors who choose not to cash out will continue to own Remington through the newly created financial entity.In its letter, the private equity firm cautioned that any other chance to sell out may not come “for the foreseeable future.”Advertisement
