HONG KONG — As demand dwindles, steel prices in China have fallen 12 percent in the first five weeks of this year, almost as much as in all of 2014.The tonnage of China’s imports of rubber, oil, iron ore and other industrial materials also fell sharply in January. And the global market for bulk freighter charters is in free fall, already below levels in the worst days of the global financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009.“In the past two months, it has been more or less a vertical correction, and this is a proxy for China,” said Basil M. Karatzas, a Manhattan ship broker.Heavy industry in the country, the world’s second-largest economy, is experiencing a much sharper downturn than was apparent or expected even several weeks ago. That slowdown seems to be mirrored to a lesser extent in other sectors. But the full scope of China’s economic weakness is obscured by limited data, as the country prepares for a nationwide, weeklong holiday beginning Feb. 18, in observance of the Lunar New Year.Advertisement“It’s too early to be saying we’re moving toward disaster, but there’s nothing in this data to be cheery about,” said Louis Kuijs, the chief China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.AdvertisementChina’s National Bureau of Statistics released inflation data on Tuesday morning in Beijing showing that producer prices have been falling faster and faster since last July, partly because of lower commodity prices.Prices were down 3.4 percent in January compared with a year earlier, a slightly smaller drop than expected but nonetheless fanning fears of possible deflation. Consumer prices have nearly stopped rising, with an increase of only 0.8 percent in January from a year earlier — the smallest rise since November 2009.Following its standard practice, the agency will not release a wide range of monthly economic statistics for January — a month in which the timing of the Lunar New Year, from late January to mid-February, can distort figures. So investors, business executives and others will get only limited, partial figures on industrial production, real estate investment, retail sales and other crucial barometers until mid-March, when figures for all of January and February are scheduled to be released.
            The daily cost of leasing a bulk carrier freighter for hauling commodities like iron ore and coal has plunged this winter as demand has withered from China, the main importer.        4,000Baltic Capesize Index*321Baltic Dry Index**0FMAMJJASONDJF2014’15The People’s Bank of China, the central bank, signaled its concern last week when it unexpectedly cut the proportion of assets that banks must hold as reserves, freeing them to lend about $100 billion to businesses and consumers. The reserve requirement had not been cut since 2012.China’s General Administration of Customs released trade data on Sunday that showed a slight dip in exports. Imports plunged, although that was partly because the effect of falling tonnages of key commodities was compounded considerably by lower commodity prices.Some businesses selling consumer products are complaining of weak sales this winter. “Our business has slowed down in recent months; I think it has to do with the overall economic slowdown in China, as well as internationally,” said Fred Zhang, the sales manager at the Qingdao Oulang Hair Product Company, a small maker of wigs in Qingdao.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The banking system is still under tight central government control and can be told to step up lending further. Overall credit, though, has already grown faster as a share of economic output since 2009 than practically anywhere except Ireland. Some restrictions on housing market speculation have been lifted, at the risk of making homes more expensive.A slowdown in home construction and car sales has contributed to trouble in the steel and iron ore sectors and in the energy sector. The tonnage of iron ore imports is down 9.3 percent in January from a year ago, while the tonnage of imports of refined products like gasoline and diesel was down 37.6 percent.AdvertisementSome of the slowdown in industrial commodity imports last month may reflect that many Chinese companies built above-average stockpiles last autumn as prices were falling, and now find themselves with scant room to store more. They also face losses on their earlier purchases, as prices have continued to drop.In the iron ore sector last autumn, “they bought every single cargo, and they were able to buy at lower and lower prices,” said Jeffrey Landsberg, a commodity analyst and managing director of Commodore Research & Consultancy in New York.With the purchases slowing, ship charters have slowed to a crawl. Large freighters that cost $8,000 to $9,000 a day to operate, plus $20,000 or more a day in interest payments and other ownership costs, are now leasing for about $4,000.The daily cost to charter a so-called capesize freighter, a large ship particularly used to supply China, has fallen fastest of all, down 75 percent since mid-November.“It’s pretty grim at the moment,” said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport, a large Hong Kong shipping line. “The bulk carrier market is at the lowest it has been in 30 years.”A version of this article appears in print on February 10, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Heavy Industry in Surprise Slide in China.
