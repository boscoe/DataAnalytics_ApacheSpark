LONDON — Prosecutors in Switzerland said on Thursday that they had ended an investigation into possible money laundering at HSBC’s Swiss private bank without filing any criminal charges.The Geneva prosecutor’s office said that it would not pursue charges against the Swiss unit and that HSBC would pay 40 million Swiss francs, or about $42.8 million, to settle the inquiry.“The investigation found that neither the bank nor its employees are suspected of any current criminal offenses,” HSBC said in a statement.In February, the prosecutor’s office conducted a search of the offices of HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) in Geneva and announced that it had opened a criminal inquiry into possible aggravated money laundering there.AdvertisementThe bank said that the 40 million Swiss franc payment was “compensation to the Geneva authorities for past organizational deficiencies.”AdvertisementThe news comes as HSBC, which is based in London, has faced renewed scrutiny in recent months over the role of its Swiss unit in helping wealthy clients to avoid taxes.In March, France’s financial prosecutor’s office recommended that the Swiss private banking unit be criminally charged with encouraging tax evasion. The Swiss operation also is facing criminal charges in Belgium.In April, French magistrates placed the parent company, HSBC, under formal criminal investigation and ordered it to post bail of 1 billion euros, or about $1.1 billion. HSBC is also facing a tax investigation into its Swiss unit in Argentina.HSBC apologized in February after news reports, based on secret documents taken from the bank in 2007, showed that its employees had reassured clients that the lender would not disclose details of their accounts to the tax authorities of their home countries and had discussed options to avoid paying taxes on those assets.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
