They have been called frivolous and are faulted for swelling the legal costs of Wall Street banks and Main Street auto lenders.For years, financial firms have tried to ward them off by requiring customers to agree not to file class-action suits, but to take their disputes to arbitration instead.Now, the nation’s consumer watchdog agency — the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — is aiming to reopen the courthouse doors for the tens of millions of people who have signed away their right to sue.On Wednesday, the agency is set to propose the rough draft of rules that would prevent financial companies from barring their customers from filing class-action litigation as a condition of obtaining credit cards or checking accounts.“Companies are using the arbitration clause as a free pass to sidestep the courts and avoid accountability for wrongdoing,” Richard Cordray, director of the bureau, said in a statement.The proposal is likely to face stiff opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has argued that class actions pad plaintiff lawyers’ pockets while delivering little relief to consumers.The preliminary rules are the culmination of a multiyear study that examined the use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts and the outcomes of class actions.In this highly charged debate, the consumer protection agency tried to broadly calculate the monetary relief that class actions yielded.It found that in a five-year period, class-action settlements produced $2.7 billion in cash relief for 160 million Americans, with 18 percent being used to pay the plaintiffs’ lawyers.Without the benefit of a class action — which allows consumers to pool their resources in pursuing a costly legal claim — most consumers cannot afford to challenge companies with deep pockets.Still, business groups say arbitration offers a more efficient but equally fair means for consumers to resolve complaints. These private proceedings, held outside court, provide the same opportunity for relief without the staggering legal bills, the groups say.The agency disagreed. The study showed that relatively few people ever make it to arbitration. When they do, the agency found, their payouts were limited.In fact, business got bigger judgments against consumers — $2.8 million in 2010 and 2011, largely for debt payments — than the consumers obtained in relief, according to the agency’s analysis of arbitration claims filed with the American Arbitration Association, which handles the bulk of arbitrations involving consumers.During that period, only 78 arbitration claims resulted in judgments in favor of consumers, who received less than $400,000 in total relief.The financial industry counters that on an individual basis, consumers fare better in arbitration. On average, awards in arbitration are 166 times as great as the sums received by individuals participating in a class action, according to a July letter from industry groups commenting on the agency study.Under the rules, financial companies would not be allowed to explicitly prevent consumers from forming a class. Companies would still be able to use arbitration to resolve disputes.If they go through with arbitration, companies would have to submit the results of the proceedings to the consumer protection agency under the rules. Today, no federal agency collects data on how consumers fare in arbitration. More than half of all credit card agreements and nearly 90 percent of private student loans contain arbitration clauses, according to the agency’s study, which was released in March.The unveiling of the preliminary rules — which is expected at a hearing in Colorado organized by the consumer protection agency — is only the first step in what could prove to be a protracted battle. A comment period is to follow, in which the rules will be presented to a panel of small-business owners.Arbitration was among the topics that the bureau was asked to address when it was created as a result of the Dodd-Frank reform law in 2010 in the aftermath of the financial crisis.Since then, the bureau has faced a barrage of attacks, mostly from congressional Republicans, who have tried to rein in the nascent agency or have called for it to be dismantled. The battle over the class-action rules could prove to be one of its toughest challenges yet.Previous efforts in Congress to limit the use of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts have gained little traction. In April, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, reintroduced a bill that would eliminate mandatory arbitration clauses from consumer and other contracts. The proposed legislation, which is still pending, followed the defeat of a bipartisan bill that would have allowed members of the military to opt out of arbitration.F. Paul Bland Jr., executive director of the group Public Justice, hailed the proposal as “an enormous step toward protecting consumers.”Advertisement
