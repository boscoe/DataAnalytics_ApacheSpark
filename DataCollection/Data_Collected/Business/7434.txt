Mendelsohn, the head of restructuring for the Americas at Goldman Sachs, as a top banker for its team, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.Mr. Mendelsohn, 52, is the latest in a string of hirings by Perella Weinberg in recent months. In the spring, for example, the firm lured George H. Young III, a top telecommunications banker, from Lazard.It is also among the biggest moves that Perella Weinberg has undertaken to replenish its restructuring team after firing many of the group’s members this year. The investment bank dismissed the team’s previous leader, Michael Kramer, and others for what it said were violations of the firm’s partnership and employment agreements.Since then, Perella Weinberg has placed leadership of the team under Kevin M. Cofsky, a managing director, as it has hunted for new bankers.Among the firm’s current assignments are advising Fidelity in the Chapter 11 reorganization of the big Texas utility Energy Future Holdings and advising the gun maker Colt in its bankruptcy case.In Mr. Mendelsohn, the boutique is gaining a veteran of the field, in which companies look to reorganize their finances either through a corporate bankruptcy or by negotiating agreements with creditors.He joined Goldman in 1998 and was made a partner, the Wall Street giant’s highest rank, in 2010.Mr. Mendelsohn is expected to start at Perella Weinberg around year end, the people briefed on the matter said.Representatives for Perella Weinberg and Goldman declined to comment.Advertisement
