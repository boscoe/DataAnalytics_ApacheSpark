LONDON — European antitrust officials filed formal charges against MasterCard on Thursday, accusing the company of setting artificially high fees for credit card transactions in the European Union, which ultimately may have hurt consumers.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said MasterCard had prevented some retailers from processing transactions in countries with lower fees. The commission also said that MasterCard’s fees were unfair to tourists traveling in Europe.“We currently suspect MasterCard is artificially raising the costs of card payments, which would harm consumers and retailers in the E.U.,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official, said in a statement on Thursday.If found to have breached the region’s rules, MasterCard could face fines of up to 10 percent of its worldwide revenue, which was about $10 billion last year. It could also be forced to change its business practices.AdvertisementMasterCard did not say when it would respond to the charges, known as a statement of objections.“We will be formally responding to the statement of objections and are also working with the European Commission on the issue as part of an ongoing constructive dialogue,” MasterCard said in a statement.AdvertisementThe clampdown is the latest in a series of antitrust investigations that Ms. Vestager, a Danish politician, has pursued since taking over as Europe’s top competition official last year.In recent months, the European Commission has filed formal antitrust charges against the United States search giant Google and the Russian energy company Gazprom, as well as jump-starting investigations into Amazon, Starbucks and Apple.The commission is also in the midst of a separate three-year investigation into similar practices at Visa Europe, MasterCard’s main rival in the region and separate from Visa Inc. in the United States.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For example, fees paid by a European bank when a Chinese man used his card in Belgium were up to five times higher than those paid by the same institution when a Belgian made the same transaction, the commission said.“The commission is concerned that these high inter-regional fees increase prices for retailers and may in turn lead to higher prices for products and services for all consumers,” it said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on July 10, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Europe Charges MasterCard Over High Transaction Fees.
