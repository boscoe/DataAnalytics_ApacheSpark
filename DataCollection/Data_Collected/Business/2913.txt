The parent of the in-flight shopping magazine SkyMall said on Friday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, citing in-flight Wi-Fi access as one of the factors luring shoppers away from its quirky catalog of travel products, pet toys and garden gnomes.The company, Xhibit, said that it would sell off its online retail business and other assets.“Historically, the SkyMall catalog was the sole in-flight option for potential purchasers of products to review while traveling. With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalog,” Xhibit said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.Founded in 1990 to cater to airplane passengers with time and money to spare, SkyMall catalog’s often featured wacky product offerings and provided comic relief for travelers riffling through the seat pockets for light reading.Its 2014 holiday catalog offered a Santa Claus Sculptural Glass-Topped Holiday Table for $129; and $1,000 Serenity Pods for cats and dogs, fitted with a wireless sound system and LED lights, which promised to gently rock them to sleep. More sensible offerings included travel-related items like passport wallets or wrinkle-free resort wear.SkyMall’s eclectic lineup contributed to its downfall, its bankruptcy filing suggested.“Because SkyMall historically did not narrowly tailor its product offerings, SkyMall faced well-established competitors in every market vertical, as well as competition from significant, broad-based e-commerce providers, such as Amazon.com and eBay.com,” the filing said.AdvertisementMany of SkyMall’s competitors have greater, or vastly greater, resources, longer histories, more customers and higher brand recognition.”AdvertisementThe costs of carrying printed SkyMall catalogs also made them increasingly unattractive to airlines, the company said. Delta’s contract with SkyMall ended Nov. 30, and Southwest Airlines told Xhibit in December that it would not carry the catalog beyond April of this year, according to the filing. By the end of December, SkyMall faced “a severe liquidity crisis,” it said.Sales from Southwest travelers alone made up about 7 percent of its overall merchandise sales and the negative impact on its bottom line could be even greater, the company had warned in an earlier statement.Still, Paul Swinand, an analyst for Morningstar who covers the retail industry, called the bankruptcy filing surprising.“That would seem like it’s a monopoly business,” he said. “Nobody competes with them. Where the SkyMall fell flat was with mobile. If people are on their phones, they’re not browsing the SkyMall catalog.”Scott Wiley, Xhibit’s acting chief executive, said in a statement that he was “extremely disappointed in this result.” Mr. Wiley replaced the former Xhibit chief, Kevin Weiss, who resigned from the company last year as its woes mounted.He said Xhibit was “hopeful that SkyMall and the iconic ‘SkyMall’ brand find a home to continue to operate as SkyMall has for the last 25 years.”In its filing, Xhibit listed assets of $1 million to $10 million, and liabilities of $10 million to $50 million. Delta, American and US Airways were listed among its creditors.The SkyMall business generated revenue of about $33.7 million in 2013 and $15.8 million for the nine months ended Sept. 28, according to the filing. Debtors estimate that total creditor claims are approximately $12 million, according to the filingRebecca R. Ruiz contributed reporting.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
