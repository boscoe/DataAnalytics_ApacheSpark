In the months since, CNN has used a number of guest hosts, including Jim Acosta, Jim Sciutto, Dana Bash and Gloria Borger.Mr. Tapper, who joined CNN in 2013 and is the cable channel’s chief Washington correspondent, has experience hosting Sunday morning shows. He was the interim host of ABC’s “This Week” for several months in 2010 after George Stephanopoulos left for the weekday morning show “Good Morning America.” Christiane Amanpour later took over “This Week,” but when she left in 2011, Mr. Stephanopoulos assumed hosting duties for both “Good Morning America” and “This Week.” Mr. Tapper will soon take on a similar double-duty assignment that will have him on the air six days a week.Advertisement
