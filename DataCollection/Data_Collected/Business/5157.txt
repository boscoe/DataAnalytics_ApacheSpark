Ms. Dament’s most recent job was at PetSmart, where she was a vice president for services. Before that, she had worked at Safeway, where her last job was as group vice president for perishable strategy. Target will overhaul its food strategy over the next 12 to 18 months. The reinvention is being led by Brian Cornell, a former PepsiCo executive who took over as chief executive last August. Groceries are a priority since the unit drives customer traffic. Food and pet supplies accounted for 21 percent of Target’s total sales in the latest fiscal year. Advertisement
