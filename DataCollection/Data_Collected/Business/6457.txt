The Chinese government has recently stepped up a campaign to root out rumors on social media sites. Critics say the campaign was largely aimed at suppressing criticism of the ruling Communist Party. KFC, one of that country’s biggest restaurant operators, said it was demanding 1.5 million yuan ($242,000) and an apology from each of three companies — Shanxi Weilukuang Technology, Taiyuan Zero Point Technology and Yingchenanzhi Success and Culture Communication — that operated accounts on the popular mobile phone app WeChat. Calls to numbers listed for the companies either went unanswered or the numbers were not valid. Advertisement
