It would also transfer its European frozen food businesses, except for its frozen pizza operations.The deal would not include Nestlé’s operations in the United States, which include the Dreyer’s and Edy’s ice cream brands.R&R, which is owned by the European private equity firm PAI Partners, would join the joint venture in its entirety. PAI acquired R&R from Oaktree Capital Management in 2013.The deal, if completed, would continue efforts by Paul Bulcke, the Nestlé chief executive, to reshape the food giant’s business after introducing plans in 2013 to divest some of its underperforming business lines and brands.The company has since undertaken a number of sales, including the divestiture of its 10 percent stake in Givaudan, a Swiss flavor and fragrance company; the sale of its PowerBar nutrition business to the cereal giant Post Holdings; and the sale of its Jenny Craig brand in Australia, New Zealand, North America and parts of the Pacific to a private equity firm, North Castle Partners.In January, it agreed to sell its La Cocinera frozen meals business to the Spanish arm of Findus Group, the British frozen food and seafood supplier.In April, Nestlé said that it had begun exclusive negotiations to sell its Davigel frozen foods business to Brakes Group, a British food service provider owned by the private equity firm Bain Capital.Advertisement
