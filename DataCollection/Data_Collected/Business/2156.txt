While Japan’s core consumer prices rose for the first time in five months in November, household spending tumbled, casting doubt on the central bank’s view that robust consumption will help accelerate inflation to its 2 percent target. The mixed batch of data will keep alive expectations that the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, who has said he will do whatever it takes to achieve his ambitious price goal, may nudge the central bank into expanding stimulus as early as next month. “The downward pressure from falling oil prices seems to have run its course, which helped core C.P.I. rise,” said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at the Mizuho Research Institute, referring to the core consumer price index. “But consumer prices likely won’t rise as fast as the B.O.J. projects. We expect the central bank to ease next year.” The core C.P.I., which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.1 percent in November from a year earlier, data showed on Friday. The rise followed a 0.1 percent drop in October and came as higher food prices moderated the pressure from slumping energy costs. But household spending suffered the biggest annual fall in eight months, down 2.9 percent in November from a year earlier.A version of this brief appears in print on December 26, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mixed Japan Data Clouds Economic Outlook .
