Readings above 50 indicate that more builders view sales conditions as positive rather than poor. Lower mortgage rates, coupled with job gains over the past year, point to stronger sales.But while home sales are projected to rise this year, economists doubt they will return to a more typical pace as builders still seem chastened by the 2007 housing crash that helped bring about the worst recession in 80 years. When builder sentiment was at similar levels in 2006, housing starts were 60 percent higher, said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez, a forecasting firm.“There remains a big disconnect between what homebuilders are saying and what they are actually doing,” Mr. Shapiro said.Builders’ outlook for current sales conditions and prospective buyer traffic slipped in February, while the expected sales conditions over the next six months held steady.The latest reading is consistent with the forecast for the United States housing market to steadily improve this year. Buyer traffic may have stalled in February because of storms, the group said.After sluggish real estate sales for much of 2014, Americans snapped up newly built homes at a faster pace in December, a promising sign as warmer months tend to draw out buyers and sales begin to peak heading into summer.Sales of new homes surged 11.6 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000.Only 435,000 new homes were bought last year, a modest 1.2 percent improvement from 2013. That is well below a pace of roughly 700,000 new homes selling in the 1990s.A separate report showed that manufacturing activity in New York State expanded at a modest pace in February, held back by weaker orders and hiring.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Tuesday that its Empire State manufacturing index slipped to 7.8 this month from 10 in January. Any reading above zero indicates expansion. Orders fell to 1.2, suggesting that demand was nearly unchanged.Advertisement
