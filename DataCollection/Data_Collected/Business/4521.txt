Yelp said the claims in the film, “Billion Dollar Bully,” had no merit and that the film’s director, Kaylie Milliken, had a history of trying to mislead consumers about Yelp. The claims “have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the F.T.C., and disproven by academic study,” Yelp said by email. Analysts at Barclays and Cowen said Yelp had successfully defended itself against similar accusations. Its shares came off lows to close down 3.5 percent. Advertisement
