The afternoon slide helped pull down financial stocks and the broader market.For the year, shares of Deutsche Bank are down 53 percent, battered by worries that it has too little cash relative to its 1.8 trillion euro ($2.02 trillion) balance sheet, which has a larger share of complex, hard-to-sell securities than its peers.Over the last year, investors have expressed their negative view of the bank by shorting its stock, or betting that the share price will fall sharply.As the shares have hit historical lows, and with continued uncertainty over whether the German government has plans to step in, some investors are having second thoughts about using Deutsche Bank as a counterparty.One long-term client, who would not reveal his identity because he did not want to jeopardize his relationship with Deutsche Bank, said on Wednesday that he was no longer using it to trade complex securities, which require a trading partner that is large and has ready access to pools of liquidity.On Thursday, after the trading day had ended in Frankfurt, Bloomberg reported that 10 hedge funds had removed some of their cash reserves from the bank.But Barry Bausano, who oversees Deutsche Bank’s hedge fund relationships, noted that the firm’s prime brokerage business has about 800 hedge fund clients, a number that fluctuates week to week. Mr. Bausano also pointed out that the environment for hedge funds has been challenging recently, as they struggle with poor performance and redemption pressures.“We have ebbs and flows in this business every week,” he said.Many Deutsche Bank clients, in fact, say that they have no problems with using the bank to buy and sell liquid securities like stocks.They say they are comfortable using Deutsche Bank for such trades because they are certain the German government would never let it fail.For providing all manner of lending and trading services to hedge funds and other investors, Deutsche Bank is one of the elite practitioners on the street, with large trading hubs in London and New York.In the parlance of traders, the bank is called “a flow monster,” meaning it makes its money by capturing a piece of the trillions of dollars of bonds and stocks that are the lifeblood of today’s global financial system.But this status is only as good as the trust that hedge funds and institutional investors have in the bank to make good on trades and to be a sound steward for assets that are parked there.Making matters worse for Deutsche Bank is that short-term rates tied to the Libor, or the London interbank offered rate — the benchmark financial institutions use when they borrow money — have been edging up as a result of concerns over rising interest rates and a dearth of ready cash in the markets.Higher rates and worries about the bank’s financial health can be enough for some clients to take their business elsewhere.“Why would you keep collateral with Deutsche Bank right now?” said Raoul Pal, an independent research provider who has been an outspoken critic of the bank for several years. “If you are a hedge fund right now, you start pulling lines and go somewhere else.”Because of its size, analysts do not expect Deutsche Bank to fail, as Lehman Brothers did in September 2008, and in the process close the door on billions of dollars that investment funds had in the bank.But given the political opposition in Germany to any form of help for banks in distress, especially before important elections next fall, the situation would have to deteriorate significantly to prompt state intervention.Part of what stiffens resistance to a bailout is that Deutsche Bank has, since 2009, tapped markets for 13 billion euros in cash, while paying out 19 billion euros in bonuses, according to data compiled by Autonomous Research.“It is all about confidence now,” said Julian Brigden, an independent market analyst at Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company that caters to hedge funds and is based in Vail, Colo. “If a client has some derivatives at Deutsche Bank, he starts to think — will I get paid? Things can get out of hand quickly.”videoAdvertisement
