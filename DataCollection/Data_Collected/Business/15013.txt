Pulte, a $7 billion home builder, will also cut investment in new land and buy back more shares. The constructive engagement between the pushy 4.7 percent shareholder and PulteGroup management is in stark contrast to the founder William Pulte’s ham-handed campaign against the soon-to-depart chief executive, Richard Dugas.Conflict between the company’s founder and his handpicked successor spilled into the open in April, when the PulteGroup said that Mr. Dugas would resign in May 2017 after 14 years at the helm. Mr. Pulte published an open letter criticizing Mr. Dugas’s performance and calling for him to resign immediately.Mr. Pulte, who still owns nearly 9 percent of the company’s shares, had some valid criticisms. The home builder was arguably too timid about getting back into growth mode after the housing crash, for example. But Mr. Pulte’s tactics — which also included an undisclosed meeting with a now-departed director — set the board against him.Elliott, whose stake in the PulteGroup first came to light in June, presumably sees some of the same potential to bolster performance as Mr. Pulte. With an enterprise value of 7.1 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the PulteGroup’s shares trade at a discount to those of its rival Lennar, whose multiple is closer to nine times.The activist investor is no shrinking violet. Best known for its bruising 15-year tussle with Argentina over defaulted sovereign bonds, it regularly threatens proxy fights against companies that do not bow to its demands — although it rarely has to follow through with them. In this case, instead of pursuing a public confrontation, Elliott exerted force behind the scenes to change both the board and strategy. There’s a lesson for Mr. Pulte: a little experience and finesse can go a long way when it comes to winning board seats and influencing people.Advertisement
