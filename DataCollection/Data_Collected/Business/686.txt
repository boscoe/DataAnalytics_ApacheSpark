They have maintained that while engine models pass official laboratory tests, many models — and not just Volkswagen’s — surpass European emissions limits during real on-road driving situations.The environmental group, Deutsche Umwelthilfe, an influential lobbying organization based in Germany, said it had commissioned a test of a front-wheel-drive Opel Zafira diesel under laboratory conditions. The group did not accuse Opel of deliberately designing the car to deceive tests, but it presented results that it said were hard to explain.The group said the test had found that the Zafira’s engine met European emission standards for nitrogen oxide when only the front-drive wheels were spinning, and exceeded them when all four wheels were turning — as would be the case during actual driving conditions.Nitrogen oxide, referred to in the industry as NOx, is a pollutant that can cause emphysema, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases. Air-quality standards are meant to hold emissions of the pollutant to a minimum level. In the four-wheels test, emissions of the pollutant were three to four times the allowable limit, the group said.“I see no technical reason why the NOx emissions increase drastically when the rear wheels rotate,” said Axel Friedrich, a former official in the German Federal Environment Agency who advises Deutsche Umwelthilfe. “I have no normal, technically plausible explanation for the emission behavior of the Opel vehicle,” he added.In a statement, Opel rejected the results of the test, which was conducted by researchers at Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland.Opel said that it had carried out its own tests on the same vehicle model, and that the engine had met official limits.“The values comply with the legal limits both for testing on two-wheel or four-wheel setups,” Opel said in the statement. “This means: The allegations are clearly false and unfounded.”Opel said that no G.M. cars contained software that could detect whether the vehicle was undergoing emissions tests.“We are committed to the reliable compliance with exhaust emissions thresholds in all our vehicles,” the statement said. “We have clear global processes that ensure that our products meet all exhaust emission standards in the markets they are sold in.” Deutsche Umwelthilfe said it had decided to test a Zafira after hearing from car owners about how rarely they needed to refill a tank in the emissions-control system that is designed to neutralize nitrogen oxide by filtering the exhaust through a urea-based solution. Such reports might raise questions about whether the emissions-control system was always engaged.An Opel spokesman, Ulrich Weber, said he was not aware of that particular issue with the emissions-control system.Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement
