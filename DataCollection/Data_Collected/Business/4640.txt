Statements of opinion in securities filings, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the seven justices in the majority, are untrue only if they are not sincerely held.But she added that statements of opinion may nonetheless be unlawfully misleading if they fail to disclose conflicting information.The case, Omnicare v. Laborers District Council Construction Industry Pension Fund, No. 13-435, arose from a 2005 registration statement that included a discussion of Omnicare’s business model, which was based in part on rebates from drug companies.“We believe,” the registration statement said, that those rebates “are in compliance with applicable federal and state laws” and “are legally and economically valid.”A group of pension funds that had bought the company’s stock sued, saying the statements were false, as the rebates were in fact unlawful kickbacks. Omnicare disputes that, although it has settled lawsuits based on similar accusations.The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, allowed the pension funds’ lawsuit to proceed, saying it was enough for them to assert that the substance of the statements was objectively false, adding that the company’s sincerity in making them was irrelevant.That ruling was mistaken, Justice Kagan wrote. She noted that the pension funds “do not contest that Omnicare’s opinion was honestly held.”“What the funds instead claim is that Omnicare’s belief turned out to be wrong — that whatever the company thought, it was in fact violating anti-kickback laws,” she wrote. “But that allegation alone will not give rise to liability.”Having closed one door, Justice Kagan opened another. She said a suit remained possible if it could be shown that Omnicare had omitted information from the registration statement “about the issuer’s inquiry into or knowledge concerning a statement of opinion.”“An investor, though recognizing that legal opinions can prove wrong in the end, still likely expects such an assertion to rest on some meaningful legal inquiry — rather than, say, on mere intuition, however sincere,” she wrote.When the case was argued in November, Thomas C. Goldstein, a lawyer for the funds, pointed to what he said was a crucial omission.“Their own lawyers told them not to make these purchases with respect to nursing homes because it would amount to an illegal kickback,” he said.Justice Kagan cited that assertion but suggested that it might not be enough to allow the lawsuit to proceed.“Suppose, for example, that in stating an opinion about legal compliance, the issuer did not disclose that a single junior attorney expressed doubts about a practice’s legality, when six of his more senior colleagues gave a stamp of approval,” she said. “That omission would not make the statement of opinion misleading, even if the minority position ultimately proved correct.”The Supreme Court sent the case back to the appeals court to puzzle out whether the pension funds had made the case that they could proceed on the second theory.Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia issued concurrences saying the majority had gone too far.Justice Thomas said the second theory “is not properly before us.”“We should exercise some caution,” he wrote. “This court rarely prides itself on being a pioneer of novel legal claims.”Justice Scalia said the majority’s approach was naïve.“It seems to me strange to suggest that a statement of opinion as generic as ‘we believe our conduct is lawful’ conveys the implied assertion of fact ‘we have conducted a meaningful legal investigation before espousing this opinion,’” he wrote. “It is strange to ignore the reality that a director might rely on industry practice, prior experience, or advice from regulators — rather than a meaningful legal investigation — in concluding the firm’s conduct is lawful.”In a second decision on Tuesday, B&B Hardware v. Hargis Industries, No. 13-352, the court ruled 7 to 2 that decisions issued by a trademark tribunal may sometimes be binding in separate proceedings in federal courts.The question arose, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote for the majority, in “a feud of nearly two decades” between B&B Hardware, which makes Sealtight metal fasteners for the aerospace industry, and Hargis Industries, which makes Sealtite metal fasteners for the construction trade.“Although there are obvious differences between space shuttles and A-frame buildings,” Justice Alito wrote, “both aerospace and construction engineers prefer fasteners that seal things tightly.”B&B Hardware won in the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. Justice Alito wrote that its ruling should be binding in a separate trademark infringement suit in federal court so long as it addressed the same question based on the same legal standard, here “the likelihood of confusion.”Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, dissented, saying Congress had not intended to make the administrative tribunal’s rulings binding on federal courts.Advertisement
