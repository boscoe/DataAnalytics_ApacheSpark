AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersUnited States stocks closed higher on Monday, and the Nasdaq reached a record as hopes grew that a deal would be reached to prevent Greece from defaulting on loans.Stocks have been largely driven by the situation in Greece of late, with investors concerned that if the country defaults on its loans, it may have to leave the euro or the European Union, potentially shaking the region’s economic foundations.Athens presented new reform proposals that eurozone finance ministers cautiously welcomed on Monday, though they said the plan required detailed study and that it would take several days to determine whether they could lead to an agreement. Greece needs fresh cash to avoid defaulting on a $1.8 billion debt payment to the International Monetary Fund on June 30.“This takes one anxiety off the table, even if it doesn’t yet resolve the primary issues that made investors anxious in the first place,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 103.83 points, or 0.58 percent, to 18,119.78, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 12.86 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,122.85. The Nasdaq composite index added 36.97 points, or 0.72 percent, to 5,153.97.With the day’s gains, the Nasdaq ended at a record while the S.&P. 500 closed about 0.3 percent away from its own record close. The S.&P. 500 now trades at 17.3 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data, above its long-term average.“Valuations are somewhat high, but there aren’t many alternatives that look attractive,” Mr. McCain said. “Stocks will probably get a lot higher before there’s any serious risk of a pullback on valuation.”In addition to developments on Greece, sentiment was also lifted by merger-and-acquisition activity. The S.&P. energy index, the day’s top performing sector, rose 1 percent after Energy Transfer Equity confirmed it had made a $48 billion unsolicited bid for the Williams Companies, hours after Williams rejected the offer as significantly too low.Shares of Williams surged 26 percent, to $60.86, and were the biggest percentage gainer on the S.&P. 500.Separately, the health insurer Cigna rose 4.7 percent, to $162.60, after it rebuffed Anthem’s $47 billion merger proposal on Sunday.
