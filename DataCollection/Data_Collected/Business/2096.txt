But the guidance is meant to clarify disparity in the interpretation and enforcement of the bonus rules.The European Union’s executive arm this year determined that the bonus and related compensation rules should apply without exception to all financial firms. But some national regulators — including Britain’s — have been exempting smaller banks from the bonus cap, which limits bonuses to an amount equal to one or two times an employee’s salary and other compensation that is not based on performance.Monday’s opinion by the European Banking Authority said that some exemptions should be allowed for smaller financial firms and for staff members at banks who receive only a small amount of their annual compensation as bonuses based on performance.All employees who take risks that could affect the financial institution’s overall stability should be subject to the bonus cap, the authority said. But some financial firms should not have to comply with new requirements, set to begin in 2017, that a portion of bonus pay be deferred for several years or paid in shares or other noncash financial instruments.To allow such waivers, European law would have to be changed, which would fall to the bloc’s executive arm, the European Commission, and the European Parliament.The application of the pay provisions should be harmonized in the European Union “to achieve a level playing field and avoid distortion of the competition to attract the best and most talented staff,” the banking authority said in its opinion on Monday. “At the same time, the administrative burden for, in particular, smaller institutions should be reduced.”The European Banking Authority has jurisdiction over banks throughout the 28-nation European Union.As part of formal guidelines issued by the regulator this year, banks and other financial institutions will be required to defer at least 40 percent of annual bonuses for a period of three to five years and to pay half of those bonuses in stock or other noncash financial instruments.The authority said those requirements could be burdensome for smaller institutions and require them to hire additional administrative staff members, which would put those firms at a competitive disadvantage.The opinion was released on Monday alongside the European Banking Authority’s final guidelines on how banks can pay bonuses and which employees are affected by the bonus cap.Those formal guidelines were first issued in March and finished this month after a consultation period. The bonus cap is already in place, but the new guidelines on pay go into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, to give financial institutions time to adjust their pay policies.The bonus cap, which came into effect in 2014, limits annual performance payouts to an amount equal to 100 percent of what an employee receives in so-called fixed remuneration, or salary and other compensation that is not based on performance.The cap was intended to reduce the financial incentive for bankers to make risky bets that authorities say contributed to the financial crisis.Under the cap, annual bonuses can be raised to 200 percent of an employee’s fixed pay if an institution’s shareholders vote to approve the increase.It is up to local regulators to comply with European Union rules and banking authority guidelines or explain why they are not complying. They will have a two-month period after the new guidelines are translated and officially published to do so.As part of the rules, banks must apply the bonus cap to all bank-owned subsidiaries, including asset managers and insurance groups, if their employees take risks that could affect the financial institution’s overall stability.The guidelines were intended to quash efforts by banks to get around the bonus limits, including using a new category of compensation, known as role-based allowances.The authority determined in October 2014 that role-based pay was discretionary and should be classified as variable compensation and subject to the bonus cap. Britain’s banking regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, previously criticized the bonus cap.When the European Banking Authority issued its opinion last year, several regulators, including the British authority, had already approved role-based pay for the 2014 year, so it was too late to enforce that for bonuses paid in January 2015 for work in 2014.Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority, said this year that the regulator would comply with the opinion.Advertisement
