LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company on Friday disclosed a 35 percent increase in overall pay in 2014 for its chief executive and chairman, Robert A. Iger.Mr. Iger, 63, received compensation valued at $46.5 million for the company’s last fiscal year, up from $34.3 million in 2013, according to a regulatory filing. More than 92 percent of Mr. Iger’s pay is determined by Disney’s financial results, which reached record heights in 2014 for the fourth consecutive year.Net income for the company’s last fiscal year rose 22 percent, to $7.5 billion, the result of blockbuster movies like “Guardians of the Galaxy,” strong sales of “Star Wars” and “Frozen” merchandise, and record theme park attendance.Financial highlights of the last year also include a stock price that increased about 23 percent, to roughly $94. Disney’s total shareholder return was 38 percent, compared with 20 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.Advertisement“Mr. Iger has driven spectacular financial performance,” the filing said.Mr. Iger’s 2014 compensation included a $2.5 million base salary and long-term stock and stock option awards of $17.3 million — flat from the previous year. His cash bonus was $22.8 million, an increase from $13.6 million. Mr. Iger also had higher pension value and $1.1 million in other compensation, including for security.In October, Mr. Iger agreed to extend his tenure as chief executive to 2018. He had been expected to retire in June 2016, which was itself an extension.AdvertisementWhile Mr. Iger is one of America’s highest-paid chief executives, he falls behind others in media, even with his increase. In 2013, for instance, Leslie R. Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, received $66.9 million. To compare, CBS has a market capitalization of $28.8 billion; Disney’s is roughly $161 billion.A version of this article appears in print on January 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Disney’s Chief Was Paid $46.5 Million Last Year.
