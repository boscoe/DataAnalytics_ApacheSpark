PARIS — Struggling to regain its financial footing after a crippling two-week pilots’ strike last year, Air France-KLM said on Thursday that it would reduce planned investments in new aircraft and services by more than $680 million over the next two years and would accelerate a cost-cutting drive in the face of stiff competition.The moves come as the French-Dutch airline group swung to an operating loss of 129 million euros, or about $147 million, for 2014, in contrast to a profit of €130 million a year earlier.“By deciding today to reinforce its unit cost reduction efforts and adapt its investment plans, the group is ensuring that it can achieve its key targets of improved competitiveness” and debt reduction, Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of Air France-KLM, said in a news release.The carrier, Europe’s third-largest by number of passengers, after Ryanair and Lufthansa, also reported that revenue was little changed, at €24.9 billion, and net debt increased slightly to €5.4 billion.AdvertisementAfter more than three years of belt-tightening, Air France-KLM is still struggling to cut operating costs while fighting a two-front battle against low-cost carriers on European routes and fast-growing Middle Eastern rivals on long-distance services.AdvertisementLess than five months after a strike by French pilots forced it to substantially scale back a planned European expansion of its low-cost subsidiary Transavia, Air France-KLM said on Thursday that uncertainty about the European economy and fare competition meant that it was slashing about €600 million in investments planned for this year and 2016.Those cuts would mainly involve delays in the replacement of older aircraft in its fleet. Pierre-François Riolacci, chief financial officer for the group, said Air France-KLM would delay deliveries of up to 12 jets on order from Boeing and Airbus, including wide-body and single-aisle planes. Analysts said the decision reflected just how constrained Air France-KLM’s finances remained and warned that slowing investments, particularly in long-distance aircraft, could handicap the group’s potential for growth in vital emerging markets, particularly in Asia, over the medium term.“Putting off capital expenditure, even for a year, is risky,” said John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant in London. “New aircraft bring you better technology, fuel-efficiency and range, as well as better onboard experience, which is important to overall customer perception.”In addition to curtailing new investment, Air France-KLM announced plans to shave up to €350 million in operating costs in 2015 and confirmed plans to cut a further 800 jobs over the next three years through buyouts and early retirements. The reductions, which follow the loss of more than 8,000 jobs at the group over the last three years, will affect 500 members of ground staff at French regional airports and 300 flight attendants.High labor costs at the group’s French unit have hurt its competitiveness for years. Employee salaries and related costs fell 2 percent last year, to €7.3 billion, roughly 29 percent of annual revenue, and more than the group’s fuel bill of €6.6 billion.By contrast, labor costs as a share of revenue are less than 10 percent at its low-cost rival Ryanair, and around 12 percent at easyJet, according to the CAPA Center for Aviation in Brussels.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Air France’s operating loss of €314 million last year more than wiped out a €175 million profit at KLM.AdvertisementThe added cost of the French pilots’ strike, which the group said had reduced operating profit by €425 million and erased nearly €500 million in revenue, has only served to fan resentment among Dutch labor leaders and some politicians.In an effort to defuse those tensions, Mr. de Juniac and Frédéric Gagey, the head of Air France, recently embarked on a charm offensive, visiting with Dutch labor leaders and politicians to make the case that the group was returning to financial health. Were it not for the pilots’ strike, the group noted on Thursday, Air France would have reported a modest operating profit of €99 million in 2014, on revenue of €15.6 billion.“Air France is not a bottomless pit,” Mr. Gagey said in an open letter published this month in the Dutch business daily Het Financieele Dagblad.Speaking in Paris, Mr. Gagey said no additional staff reductions were planned at Air France this year beyond the 800 announced on Thursday. However, he would not rule out further voluntary departure programs in 2016 or 2017, which he said could eventually include some pilots.Pilot unions at Air France voted in December in favor of a proposal that limited the group’s planned investments in its Transavia budget carrier mainly to the French market — a far cry from the ambitious pan-European expansion it announced for the brand in September. That expansion would have based hundreds of new pilots and other workers in popular destinations in Southern Europe, where wages are lower.Analysts have warned that scaling back the Transavia plan could undermine the long-term business case for the budget brand, whose operating losses widened last year to €36 million, from €23 million in 2013, on revenue of more than €1 billion.A version of this article appears in print on February 20, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Struggling Air France-KLM to Cut Investments by $680 Million.
