SYDNEY —  Rio Tinto has reached an agreement with the government of Mongolia that paves the way for work to resume on a delayed $5 billion underground copper mine that is expected to underpin the growth prospects of both the country and the global mining company.The Oyu Tolgoi project, a combined open pit and underground mining project in the south Gobi Desert, is the biggest single foreign investment in Mongolia and has long been seen as a bellwether of the country’s openness to foreign investment.However, disputes between Rio Tinto and Mongolia over taxes and the costs of building the first stage  halted work on the second phase, an underground mine that, Rio says, will unlock 80 percent of the copper wealth at the project.The dispute  has also deterred investment in Mongolia over the past two years, worsening the hit to its economy from sliding commodity prices, prompting the country’s new prime minister to  resolve the issues.Advertisement“Oyu Tolgoi is a world-class copper-gold asset and its further development is of great economic significance for Mongolia,” the prime minister, Chimediin Saikhanbileg, said in a statement.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
