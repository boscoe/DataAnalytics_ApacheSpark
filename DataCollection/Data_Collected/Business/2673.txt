New passenger car registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 5.7 percent in the European Union last year, reaching about 12.6 million vehicles, the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association reported from Brussels. It was the first annual expansion since 2007, when the market peaked at nearly 16 million new passenger cars. Spain led the major national markets in 2014, with government trade-in incentives helping to lift sales by more than 18 percent. Germany, Europe’s largest auto market, grew 2.9 percent. Still, the industry is not out of danger. The stagnant economy in most of Europe, as well as crushing unemployment in countries like Greece and Spain, will continue to weigh on the market. LMC Automotive, a market research firm, estimates that European sales will gain just 1.1 percent in 2015. Carlos Da Silva, who follows Europe’s car market at IHS Automotive, said in a research note that the 2014 recovery was welcome news, but that Europe was not yet “a fully cured patient.” Advertisement
