The restructuring, long expected, reflects growing overlap between the two divisions.In the last year, for instance, Disney Consumer Products has introduced a steady stream of digital offerings, including “Star Wars Journeys,” billed as app-based storybooks; a line of mobile learning apps called Imagicademy; and Playmation, a toy line that uses wireless systems, motion sensors and wearable technology.But early results have been mixed — Imagicademy revenue so far has been slight, according to data from the analytics firm App Annie — signaling that the division could benefit from closer integration with the technology experts at Disney Interactive. (Playmation does not arrive until the fall.)Created as a stand-alone entity in 2008, Disney Interactive at first struggled to keep up with rapidly shifting consumer tastes in video games. A foray into casual games played on the Internet was a particular bust, and the unit ran up losses of more than $1 billion. Substantial layoffs followed.Disney Interactive has more recently found financial success in Infinity, a game rooted in a popular concept known as “toys to life,” in which players collect toy figures, and, using a sensor base, bring them to life inside a video game.Under the restructuring, some employees will be moved into new roles, particularly in areas like finance, business development and human resources. But the combination will not result in layoffs, according to a spokeswoman.Rather than naming a single executive to run the new division, the leaders of the two separate units will jointly manage the new one. Leslie Ferraro, hired only last month to lead the Consumer Products group, will become co-chairwoman of Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media. Her digital counterpart, James Pitaro, will be its co-chairman.The merged division will have annual revenue of at least $5.28 billion and operating income of $1.47 billion, according to Disney financial filings. Disney will begin to report financial results for the combined group in the fall, with the beginning of its 2016 fiscal year.Although based in separate buildings, the two businesses already share a corporate campus in Glendale, Calif.Advertisement
