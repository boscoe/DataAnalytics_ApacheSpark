The new action covers the passenger-side airbag on the 2008 Corolla and Corolla Matrix as well as the 2008-10 Lexus SC 430. The company said it was not aware of any injuries associated with the new recall. In June, the automaker recalled earlier model years of those vehicles as part of an action covering almost 1.4 million vehicles. Toyota has now recalled about 15 million vehicles worldwide because of the Takata defect. Over all, 14 automakers have recalled about 24 million vehicles for the inflaters, which have been linked to 10 deaths and more than 100 injuries.Advertisement
