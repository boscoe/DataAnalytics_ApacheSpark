Amazon.com has agreed to buy Annapurna Labs, an Israeli chip developer, a spokeswoman for the American company said on Thursday.The company is expected to pay about $350 million.Though the deal represents a significant push by Amazon into the Israeli technology scene, it’s not exactly clear  what the company is getting in this deal. Annapurna has been fairly tight-lipped about the products it is developing.The start-up was founded about four years ago by Avidor Willenz, a veteran of the semiconductor industry who founded Galileo Technologies, a chip designer that was sold to Marvell Technology for about $2.7 billion.A sale of Annapurna Labs would be the second deal by an American technology company for an Israeli start-up this week. On Wednesday, Dropbox said that it had acquired CloudOn, a document editing services provider, to help shore up an engineering beachhead in Israel.News of the Annapurna transaction was reported earlier by Calcalist, an Israeli newspaper.
