LONDON — ICBC Standard Bank agreed to pay nearly $33 million in penalties and enter into a so-called deferred prosecution agreement related to bribery of officials in Tanzania, British authorities said on Monday.The settlement is the first time that the Serious Fraud Office of Britain has used a deferred prosecution agreement to conclude an investigation involving a company. The fraud office, which investigates financial crime in Britain, was given the power to use such agreements last year.The Serious Fraud Office accused ICBC Standard Bank of failing to prevent a former sister company from trying to bribe officials in Tanzania from 2012 to 2013.The fraud office said that Stanbic Bank Tanzania made a $6 million payment in March 2013 to a local partner that was intended to induce members of the Tanzanian government to favor Stanbic Tanzania in a $600 million private placement to be carried out on behalf of the government. The placement generated transaction fees of $8.4 million for Stanbic Tanzania and ICBC Standard Bank.AdvertisementICBC Standard Bank reported the matter to British authorities in 2013 and had its outside lawyers conduct an investigation, which was shared with the fraud office.AdvertisementDeferred prosecution agreements allow companies to avoid criminal charges if they complete a series of changes to prevent similar issues in the future. Often, a court-appointed monitor is named to measure the company’s progress.The agreements are a common tool for prosecutors in the United States but have been criticized by lawmakers and others who have called for companies and individuals to face greater consequences, particularly after the financial crisis.The Justice Department has made a push in recent years for more companies to plead guilty to a criminal charge as part of any settlement but continues to use deferred prosecution agreements as a tool.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It also is required to implement recommendations of PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is acting as an independent monitor.ICBC Standard Bank will pay $25.2 million in penalties and 330,000 pounds, or about $496,000, in costs to the Serious Fraud Office, plus a separate $7 million payment to the Tanzanian government.If it fully complies with the agreement for three years, ICBC Standard Bank will not be prosecuted on a charge of failure to prevent bribery, the Serious Fraud Office said.The bank also has agreed to pay a $4.2 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission for separate related conduct, the Serious Fraud Office said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
