AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersUnited States consumer sentiment rebounded strongly in early October, suggesting that the economic recovery remained on track despite headwinds from a strong dollar and weak global demand that have weighed on the country’s industries.The snapback in sentiment reported on Friday underscored robust domestic demand and offered hope that consumer spending would remain solid enough to support economic growth, which has slowed significantly in recent months.The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 92.1 points in early October from a reading of 87.2 in September. The survey’s current conditions subindex rose to 106.7 this month from 101.2 in September.The index at current levels has historically been consistent with roughly a 4 percent annualized rate of consumer spending growth, according to economists.“This suggests that U.S. household sentiment has turned an important corner, and is a hopeful sign on the outlook for consumer spending activity going forward, given signs of weakness in other parts of the economy,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.The rise in sentiment, which probably reflected cheaper gasoline prices, suggested limited impact from recent stock market volatility. Consumers were the most optimistic about their personal financial expectations since 2007.Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity. It has been the bright spot in the economy as industry wobbles under the onslaught of slowing global growth and the resurgent dollar, which have eroded demand for goods made in the United States.The economy is also being weighed down by a reduction in capital investment in the energy industry because of lower oil prices, as well as an effort by businesses to reduce their inventories.In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial output slipped 0.2 percent on renewed weakness in oil and gas drilling after dipping 0.1 percent in August. Industrial production rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter.“We do not expect the recent slowing to lead to a broader pullback in aggregate growth, as service sector activity remains solid,” said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.Manufacturing accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Still, the weak industrial production report added to soft trade, retail sales and employment data that have pointed to a significant slowdown in growth after the economy expanded at a 3.9 percent annual pace in the second quarter.Third-quarter growth estimates are now around a 1.5 percent rate. Slower growth and low inflation have diminished expectations of an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year.Advertisement
