JPMorgan announced that its profit rose 12 percent, to $5.9 billion, or $1.45 a share, compared with $5.27 billion, or $1.28 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of $1.38 a share.The earnings gain was not achieved by simply cutting costs, as has happened at several of the big banks recently. Instead, JPMorgan increased revenue 4 percent, to $24.8 billion, from $23.9 billion in the quarter a year earlier.Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with investors Tuesday morning that the bank experienced “broad strength in underlying performance.”The increase in the headline numbers at JPMorgan was driven by improved performance across the bank’s trading desks, which have been struggling in recent quarters. Revenue at the bank’s enormous bond-trading operations jumped 61 percent from the previous quarter. The bank said this was driven by activity in interest rate products, emerging market bonds and currencies.Ms. Lake said that market activity had dropped off somewhat at the beginning of the second quarter but was likely to continue to be higher than it has been in recent years. The strong results from the quarter provide the company with ammunition to use against critics who have said the bank would be better off broken into smaller parts.Investment banking fees also increased at Wells Fargo, jumping 36 percent, to $445 million. But fees from businesses like debt and equity underwriting were not enough to lift the company’s profits from a year ago.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.Still, the bank’s net income of $5.8 billion, or $1.04 a share, topped analysts’ expectations of 98 cents a share. Executives said a reason for the profit decline was related to the settlements of routine tax matters, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.John Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s chairman and chief executive, said the fundamentals of the bank’s business had never been stronger, particularly increased deposits and capital levels.“This is some of the strongest deposit growth I’ve seen in my 30 some years in the company,” Mr. Stumpf said in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.But that growth could not offset many of the pressures on the bank’s bottom line. The bank said regulatory and compliance costs, in addition to expenses related to its growth initiatives, drove expenses 6 percent higher in the first quarter.Wells’s efficiency ratio — which is one measure of how the bank is managing expenses — was 58.8 percent in first quarter, which was at the top end of the range that the bank is seeking to achieve this year.Another important measure of the bank’s profitability also fell. Net interest margin, which is the difference between what the bank makes on lending and what it pays to customers with deposits at the bank, declined to 2.95 percent in the first quarter from 3.2 percent a year ago. Both JPMorgan and Wells reported some bright spots in mortgage lending, which had been in a slump recently.A momentary drop in interest rates in the first quarter fueled a flood of applications for mortgage refinancing, Wells Fargo executives said.The bank reported $44 billion worth of mortgage applications in the pipeline at the end of the first quarter, up from $26 billion at the end of last year.JPMorgan reported a big increase in mortgage originations, which were up 45 percent from a year earlier and 7 percent from the previous quarter. But at JPMorgan, much of the increase came from wealthier households taking out what are known as prime mortgages. The banks also said it was still too early to determine whether the spring selling season — which will begin to heat up in the second quarter — will top last year’s disappointing sales activity. “There is more mortgage credit available, more people have jobs this year and home inventory is somewhat improved,” said John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer.Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.6 percent, to $63.04, while Wells Fargo fell 0.7 percent, to $54.19.Advertisement
