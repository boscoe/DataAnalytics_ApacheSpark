FRANKFURT — The German carmaker BMW reported on Wednesday that its operating profit was better than expected, thanks to healthy sales of high-margin sport-utility vehicles. The company, however, disappointed investors with its dividend.The company’s earnings before interest and tax rose to 9.59 billion euros, or $10.6 billion, above the average forecast of €9.55 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts. The results gave the producer of BMW and Mini cars an operating margin in its automotive division of 9.2 percent.Last year, BMW retained the title of the world’s biggest luxury carmaker, with sales of BMW-branded cars reaching 1.91 million, a 5.2 percent increase from the previous year. It was the 11th year in a row that the Munich-based company held the title.Harald Krüger, BMW’s chief executive, said the company aimed to continue increasing sales.“We are again targeting a new sales volume record in 2016, with sales expected to be slightly up on the previous year,” Mr. Krüger said on Wednesday in a statement.AdvertisementBMW said it would recommend a dividend of €3.20 per share of common stock and €3.22 for preferred stock, which was below the €3.38 per share expected in the Reuters poll.Analysts at Evercore ISI said that although results beat market expectations, the lack of any announcements about higher dividend payments was disappointing.Advertisement“The lack of any special dividend and the flat payout ratio disappoint,” said Arndt Ellinghorst, the head of global automotive research at Evercore.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
