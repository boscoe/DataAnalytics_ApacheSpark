Restaurant Brands, which is based in Oakville, Ontario, said it lost $514.2 million, or $2.52 a share, in the period ended Dec. 31, in contrast to a year-ago profit of $66.8 million, or 19 cents a share. Revenue was $416.3 million, up 57 percent from a year ago, helped by new locations and sales gains at established restaurants for Burger King and Tim Hortons. Daniel Schwartz, the chief executive, said Burger Kingâ€™s international locations now exceed those in the United States. Advertisement
