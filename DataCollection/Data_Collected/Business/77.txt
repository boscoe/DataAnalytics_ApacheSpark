They spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential negotiations. Mr. Tyrangiel and Vice declined to comment.During his tenure at Businessweek, Mr. Tyrangiel became well-known in media circles for an irreverent aesthetic and for a pop-culture sensibility. The magazine recently earned praise for devoting an issue to a 66-page essay on computer code.He was previously a writer and editor at Time magazine.Vice announced in March that it would introduce a daily newscast with HBO. (It already has a weekly documentary series on the network.) The newscast will consist of five half-hour shows a week for 48 weeks a year. The newscast, Vice said, will feature on-the-ground reporting and will draw on Vice’s “network of more than 30 global bureaus to bring viewers inside the world’s most critical stories.”The media company, which began as a free magazine in 1994, has quickly gone from antiestablishment to establishment, based on an appeal to the kinds of younger viewers traditional news outlets have struggled to attract and robust video offerings. Its investors include 21st Century Fox, and it recently secured $500 million in financing.In early summer, Vice said it was now worth at least $4 billion, with nearly $1 billion in projected revenue for 2015.Advertisement
