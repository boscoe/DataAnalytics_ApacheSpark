The country shipped 7.898 million barrels a day of crude in March, up from 7.350 million in February, figures supplied by the Saudi government to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative showed. That was the highest level since November 2005, when the country shipped 7.962 million. The increase underlined Saudi Arabia’s determination not to cede market share to higher-cost producers, like shale drillers in the United States. Advertisement
