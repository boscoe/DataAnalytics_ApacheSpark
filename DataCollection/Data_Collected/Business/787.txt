Jeff Bahl, a former top high-yield credit trader at Goldman Sachs Group is also an investor. The deal values the company at more than $100 million.A market once dominated by private negotiations between bond dealers and customers has moved toward electronic trading after new regulatory requirements forced banks to reduce the amount of bonds they held on their books to meet customer demand.
