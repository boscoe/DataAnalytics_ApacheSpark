There were 19 injuries described as minor and some structures, such as garages, were damaged, but the number was not immediately available, he said.The models covered are the 1997-2004 Pontiac Grand Prix; 2000-4 Chevrolet Impala, 1998-99 Lumina and 1998-2004 Monte Carlo; 1998-99 Oldsmobile Intrigue; and 1997-2004 Buick Regal. All have a 3.8-liter V6 engine. Mr. Adler said the automaker was working on a new remedy and that the problem was worsened because a different component on the older vehicles, the engine valve cover, was deteriorating, allowing some oil leakage.The failure of the previous recalls has left some owners frustrated. “I was told I was entitled to a free and effective remedy for my car,” the owner of a 2001 Buick Regal in Sacramento wrote to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2011. “The repair was obviously not effective as my car still caught fire, just as described in the recall. I called Buick and filed a claim, which was denied, without anyone coming to look at my car or anything.”Mr. Adler said the automaker handled reimbursements case by case.The first recall was in 2008 and covered about 200,000 vehicles. It came after federal safety regulators began an investigation prompted by owner complaints. There was another recall in 2009 and another in May as the automaker increased the numbers and models affected.In a separate action, Fiat Chrysler said Tuesday that it was recalling about 75,000 2015 Jeep Cherokees in the United States because air-conditioning lines could be too close to hot engine components, posing a fire hazard. The automaker said it had been prompted to investigate after seeing complaints from two owners posted on the N.H.T.S.A. website. There are now six such complaints.Fiat Chrysler this year agreed to a $105 million settlement over its handling of recalls. Federal regulators accused the automaker of failing to act promptly on safety problems.Advertisement
