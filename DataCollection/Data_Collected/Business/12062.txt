FRANKFURT — Mars said on Tuesday that it was recalling chocolate bars and other products in 55 countries, mainly in Europe, after a piece of plastic was found in a Snickers bar in Germany.All of the recalled products, which include Mars, Snickers and Milky Way bars, were manufactured at a factory in Veghel, the Netherlands, a Mars spokeswoman said. They were sold in European countries including Germany, France and Britain, and in some countries in Asia.The recall, in effect since Monday in Germany, follows a Jan. 8 complaint from a consumer in Germany who found red plastic in a Snickers bar and sent it back to the company, the spokeswoman from Mars Netherlands said.“We cannot be sure that this plastic was only in that particular Snickers,” she said. “We do not want any products on the market that may not meet our quality requirements, so we decided to take them all back.”It was not immediately clear how much the recall would cost the company, which is based in New Jersey and is one of the world’s biggest food companies. Mars, which also makes Wrigley gum, Uncle Ben’s rice and Pedigree pet food, is privately held and does not disclose detailed financial information.The recall is the first to affect the factory, which employs about 1,200 people. Mars Netherlands said it was working closely with the Dutch food safety authority on the matter.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Mars Recalling Chocolate Bars and Other Products in Europe.
