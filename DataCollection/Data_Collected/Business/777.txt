The agreement came after weeks of public back and forth between the two companies.The companies are facing a Wednesday deadline that would require Anheuser-Busch InBev to make what is considered a formal offer under British takeover rules or not make another approach for up to six months.The deadline has already been extended once by the British Panel on Takeovers and Mergers.Extending the deadline would give the companies more time to complete their negotiations and secure financing for the deal, which would create a behemoth in the beer industry with annual revenue of about $64 billion.An announcement is expected as soon as Wednesday morning, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller declined to comment on Tuesday. Bloomberg News reported the development earlier.Regulators require companies listed in London to disclose they are in merger talks when a number of triggering factors occur, including rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or “untoward movement” in a takeover target’s stock price.That starts a countdown clock — 28 days — for the acquiring company to make a formal offer under the rules. The deadline can be extended, at the request of the takeover target, if the companies are making progress in their discussions, and the extension must be announced “promptly.”The rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers.Spanning 407 pages, the rules often trip up American companies that are not used to operating under them.Anheuser-Busch InBev itself ran afoul of the rules this year as it publicly lobbied for a deal after SABMiller rejected its initial approaches.At one point during the public wooing, Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev‘s chief executive, said he expected to garner the support of the Santo Domingo family of Colombia, one of that country’s wealthiest dynasties and one of SABMiller’s largest shareholders.The brewing giant was later forced to put out a statement clarifying that it didn’t have the support at the time of the Santo Domingo family’s BevCo, which owns 14 percent of SABMiller.Under the terms of the latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev is offering to pay 44 pounds, or about $67.48, a share for SABMiller. That would represent more than a 50 percent premium to SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September, before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was first announced.As part of the deal, the Santo Domingo family’s BevCo and the American tobacco giant Altria, which holds a 27 percent stake, would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at £39.03 a share, a discount to the cash price. That would allow the company’s largest shareholders to avoid a huge tax bill after the merger.As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay £67.9 billion.The merger would bring some of the world’s most popular beers under one roof, including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois from Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Grolsch, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsner Urquell from SABMiller.The deal would also give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure to faster-growing emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Latin America.To win over regulators, the brewers may be forced to sell off some assets where they overlap, including the United States.Advertisement
