The University of Michigan says its consumer sentiment index rose to 96.1 this month, from 90.7 in May. The June reading was the highest since 98.1 in January. The index is up from 82.5 a year ago. For the first six months of 2015, consumer optimism improved at the fastest pace since 2004, three years before the recession, said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Michigan survey. Mr. Curtin said the readings were consistent with a 3 percent increase in consumer spending this year. That would be the fastest pace since 2006. The Commerce Department reported this week that consumer spending rose at an annual pace of 2.1 percent from January through March. The optimism reflects a strong job market. Employers have been adding jobs — nearly 3.1 million over the last year — at a pace not seen since the boom years of the late 1990s. “After a soft start to the year, we expect the economy to find its footing in the coming months with stronger consumer spending seen to be a key driver of accelerating growth,” Gregory Daco, head of United States macroeconomics at Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note.
