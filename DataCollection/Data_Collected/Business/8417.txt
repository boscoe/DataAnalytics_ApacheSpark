The stock market shuffled to a slight loss in a lazy day of summer trading Tuesday.Shares of Walmart slid after the retailer cut its profit forecast for the year, while renewed concerns over the strength of China’s economy weighed on companies that depend on customers there.But the broader market looked aimless. The major indexes headed lower at the opening of trading, turned higher just before lunchtime, then slowly lost ground throughout the afternoon.“We’re in the summer doldrums,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “Most people are staying cool on the lake somewhere.”

Another reason for the markets’ recent drift, Mr. Paulsen said, was that the news wasn’t all that surprising.Advertisement“People know about China’s problems, they know about falling commodity prices,” he said. “They’ve digested a lot of the news that’s out there already.”AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slipped 5.52 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,096.92. The S.&P., which is the benchmark for most mutual funds, has lost just seven points this month.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 33.84 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 17,511.34, and the Nasdaq sank 32.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,059.35.Walmart fell 3 percent after warning that its annual profit would most likely fall short of previous estimates, partly because of a strong dollar. The company, the world’s largest retailer, also reported a drop in quarterly earnings as it spent more on wages and overhauling American stores. Shares slid $2.43 to $69.48.Other retailers fared better. TJX, the company behind T. J. Maxx, reported rising earnings and sales and raised its estimate for annual profit. The news sent its shares up $5.17, or 7 percent, to $76.78, the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500.Overseas, China’s main Shanghai stock index took another plunge, losing 6 percent. It was the index’s largest one-day drop since an 8 percent drop on July 27 and happened even though Beijing banned major shareholders from selling stocks.“All the news out of China recently has done nothing to restore confidence in its financial markets,” said David Madden, market analyst at IG, “and the ripple effect can be felt in Europe.”Major European markets closed with slight losses. France’s CAC-40 slipped 0.3 percent, and Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX lost 0.2 percent.AdvertisementWorries over China, a crucial customer for German-made machinery, chemicals and other goods, have helped knock the DAX down 3.5 percent so far this month.Lennar, D.

Gold slipped $1.50 to $1,117.10 an ounce, while silver sank 51 cents to $14.79 an ounce.The price of oil inched above its recent six-year low, though analysts expect the supply glut that has pushed prices lower to persist. United States crude rose 75 cents to settle at $42.62 in New York. Brent crude for October delivery, an international benchmark, rose 7 cents to settle at $48.81 in London.In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline fell 0.7 cent to $1.647 a gallon, and natural gas fell 2.4 cents to $2.704 per 1,000 cubic feet.A version of this article appears in print on August 19, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Summer Doldrums Settle In on Wall St.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
