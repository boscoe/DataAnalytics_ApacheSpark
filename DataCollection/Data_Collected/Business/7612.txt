The company reported second-quarter profit that beat expectations, largely because of cuts in sales expenses and administrative costs. It raised its profit forecast for the full year to $6.25 to $6.35 a share from $6.15 to $6.30, on revenue of about $154 billion. Analysts on average expect a full-year profit of $6.26 a share on revenue of $143.61 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement
