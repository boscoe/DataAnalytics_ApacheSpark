Ackman has taken a large stake in Nomad Foods Limited, a company that acquires food businesses.Pershing Square Capital Management, Mr. Ackman’s New York hedge fund, said it owned a 22 percent stake in the so-called special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, according to a filing made to the London Stock Exchange on Monday. SPACs raise money from investors to make acquisitions.Nomad was co-founded by Martin Franklin and Noam Gottesman last year. In April, Nomad announced a 2.6 billion euro acquisition of a European frozen food company, Iglo Foods Holdings.Mr. Ackman talked about Nomad at a Manhattan investor conference last month, saying that its anchor investment in Iglo would be used as “a base for future food industry acquisitions,” according to a copy of the presentation posted to a website for Pershing Holdings, Mr. Ackman’s offshore fund.It is not the first time that Mr. Ackman has invested along with Mr. Franklin. Pershing Square has taken stakes in two holdings created in part by Mr. Franklin, including Justice Holdings, which acquired a big stake in Burger King and took the company public. It also invested in Platform Specialty Products, which Mr. Franklin founded; he also serves as chairman.These bets have worked out well for Mr. Ackman and Pershing Square. Last summer, Burger King bought the doughnuts-and-coffee chain Tim Horton, creating a global fast food empire that has been rebranded as Restaurant Brands International. And since Platform Specialty Products started trading on the public markets in 2013, its share price has gained 175 percent, a detail Mr. Ackman pointed out in his presentation last month.Advertisement
