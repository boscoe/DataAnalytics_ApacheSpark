A decision could be made on Sunday.A second day of gains for Chinese stocks also encouraged investors. United States stocks had fallen sharply on Wednesday, in part because of concerns that a monthlong slump in China’s stock market could crimp growth in the world’s second-largest economy.“This is a giant collective exhaling,” said Kristina Hooper, a United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. The Greek deal “is not done, but we’re closer than we have been in a while.”AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 25.31 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,076.62.
