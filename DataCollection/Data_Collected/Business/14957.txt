The acquisition terms reflect paying a very high valuation multiple and the deal could constrain inorganic investment in the pharma division at a time when the future pipeline of this division is a key concern for investors.”Monsanto shares, which have traded consistently below Bayer’s offers, were flat at midday Tuesday, trading at $106.41. In trading in Frankfurt, Bayer’s shares were down just over 1 percent.Monsanto is being advised by the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Ducera Partners, as well as the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Chad Bray contributed reporting.Advertisement
