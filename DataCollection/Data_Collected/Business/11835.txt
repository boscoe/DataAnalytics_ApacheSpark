The Ohio Art Company, which has produced or owned the Etch A Sketch for more than five decades, has sold the classic toy to a Toronto-based firm, Spin Master, for an undisclosed price. Ohio Art announced the sale, which included the spinoff Doodle Sketch, on Thursday. “It’ll be bittersweet, but we had to look at the long-term future of the business,” Martin Killgallon, Ohio Art’s president, told The Blade in Toledo. The company said the move left it with more capital to focus on metal lithography, the business on which it was founded over a century ago. Etch A Sketches, created by a French inventor in 1955, have been produced or owned by Ohio Art since 1960, when it bought the rights for $25,000 after executives saw it at a toy fair in Nuremberg, Germany. Production was moved to China more than 15 years ago. Spin Master, founded in 1994, owns a variety of children’s entertainment and toy brands, including Bakugan and Air Hogs. Anton Rabie, Spin Master’s co-chief, said in a statement that the Etch A Sketch toys had been “popular for more than 50 years and we look forward to building on this foundation of fun and creativity.”A version of this article appears in print on February 13, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ohio Art Sells Etch A Sketch to Spin Master.
