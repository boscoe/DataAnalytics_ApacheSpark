Eatroff, who is Morgan Stanley’s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, will depart in January to become Comcast’s executive vice president for global corporate development and strategy, the cable company announced on Tuesday.Mr. Eatroff is a two-decade veteran of the investment bank. A little more than two weeks ago, his previous co-leader of Americas mergers, Jim Head, disclosed his own departure.But while Mr. Head is going to a competitor, the merchant bank BDT & Company, Mr. Eatroff is joining a longtime client of Morgan Stanley’s. He and the firm have advised Comcast on several transactions, including its acquisition of NBCUniversal.At Comcast, Mr. Eatroff will report to the company’s chief financial officer, Michael J. Cavanagh — himself a former top investment banking executive at JPMorgan Chase.“Bob Eatroff is a terrific talent and will be a great addition to our team,” Mr. Cavanagh said in a statement. “He is well known to Comcast, having advised the company on transactions for years, including the acquisition of NBCUniversal, and has extensive knowledge of an array of sectors, including technology, telecommunications, cable, media and wireless.”Morgan Stanley has not yet picked a replacement for head of mergers in the Americas. But the firm continues to be one of the busiest deal advisory businesses around, having advised this week on Visa’s $23 billion takeover of its former European affiliate; the $2.7 billion acquisition by Treehouse of ConAgra’s store-brand division; and Shire in its $5.9 billion purchase of Dyax.At Comcast, Mr. Eatroff will fill roles previously held by Alexander D. Evans, who will join a new venture backed by the telecom, and Robert Pick, senior vice president for corporate development.Advertisement
