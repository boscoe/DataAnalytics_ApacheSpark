Ermotti, the UBS chief executive, saw his compensation increase 28 percent in 2015, as the Swiss bank more than doubled its annual profit despite uncertainty in the markets that weighed on its results in the fourth quarter.As part of its annual report on Friday, UBS, which is based in Zurich, said that Mr. Ermotti received total compensation of 14.3 million Swiss francs, or about $14.7 million, for 2015. That compared with 11.2 million francs in the prior year.His compensation included a base salary of 2.5 million francs and 11.5 million francs in so-called variable compensation, which includes shares in UBS that will be granted to Mr. Ermotti in May, subject to shareholder approval. Those shares would not vest until 2021.UBS said its directors believed that Mr. Ermotti’s stewardship of the company in a “challenging market environment” was crucial to helping the company’s businesses deliver good results for the year.“His focus on execution of our well-defined strategy has made these results possible,” the bank said.UBS posted a net profit of 6.2 billion francs in 2015 despite choppy markets in the fourth quarter, from 3.6 billion francs a year earlier.When the bank reported its preliminary results last month, UBS warned that the macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical risks that have weighed on the markets recently were “unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future.”The lender noted at the time that its fourth quarter was “characterized by very low levels of client activity and pronounced risk aversion” by its customers. That was particularly felt by its wealth management business, which had 3.4 billion francs in net new money outflows, or the balance of funds that clients withdrew, in the quarter.On Friday, the bank said that it expected “a modest slowing in the pace of global economic expansion in 2016,” but it warned that geopolitical risks, including the possibility that Britain will vote in a referendum to leave the European Union, could pose wider challenges to the global economic outlook this year.Over all, the bank’s bonus pool increased 14 percent to 3.5 billion francs in 2015.Advertisement
