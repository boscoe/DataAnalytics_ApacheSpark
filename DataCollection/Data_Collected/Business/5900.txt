Iowa agriculture officials said on Friday that bird flu would claim an additional four million egg-laying chickens on two more farms in a county already hit by the disease. Officials are waiting for preliminary tests on two farms in Wright County to be confirmed. The county reported earlier that a farm with 2.8 million chickens was affected. Iowa’s chicken loss is approaching 25 million, more than 40 percent of the state’s egg-laying flock. Officials also said the virus had been found on five more turkey farms, including one with 42,000 birds. That brings the state to 44 cases in 12 counties. The virus has spread to well over 30 million birds in 13 states.  A version of this brief appears in print on May 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Iowa Says 4 Million More Chickens Have Bird Flu .
