Trump’s surprise victory tied for the highest-rated election night in broadcast history, according to Nielsen figures released on Wednesday.An average of 71.4 million Americans tuned in to the major networks from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Tuesday, about the same audience that watched the results in 2008. In 2012, prime time viewership was 66.8 million.The ratings extended a record-busting year for television news, whose financial prospects had seemed to flounder in recent years as digital competitors captured more viewers. As recently as 18 months ago, The Washington Post posed the question, “Has prime time faded for cable TV news?”But the head-turning twists of the campaign lured back audiences, sending CNN and Fox News to their highest viewership in years.From 8 to 11 p.m. on Tuesday, as anchors grappled with a knife-edge count in Florida and a gradual recognition that Mr. Trump was outperforming polls, CNN was seen by an average of 13.3 million viewers, beating its cable competitors and the broadcast networks.The Fox News audience grew throughout the evening, peaking in the midnight hour as voting returns swung decisively toward Mr. Trump. When the election was called, in the 2 a.m. hour, about 9.8 million viewers were still watching Fox News. NBC News was the most-watched broadcast network during prime time hours.Before Tuesday night, network executives had conceded privately that they expected a significant drop in their audiences after the election — but their widespread presumption had been that Mr. Trump would lose.Candidate Trump served as a ratings godsend for television news. President Trump? As industry observers might put it, records were made to be broken.Advertisement
