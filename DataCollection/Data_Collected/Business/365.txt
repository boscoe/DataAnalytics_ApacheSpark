Dell’s planned takeover of the data storage company EMC is no exception.Monday’s announcement of the deal disclosed roles for more than a dozen banks and law firms, many of whom reprised their roles from the 2013 leveraged buyout of Dell by Michael S. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake.Still, some roles were changed from the deal two years ago. JPMorgan Chase previously advised Dell’s special board committee on the take-private offer; now it is listed as the lead financial adviser to Dell in the acquisition of EMC. JPMorgan and Credit Suisse are also coordinating the global financing effort.The boutique investment bank Evercore Partners also previously advised the Dell special committee in 2013. Now it has provided a similar role to EMC.And Morgan Stanley has secured a role by advising EMC, after having missed out on the leveraged buyout by advising on an aborted rival bid by the Blackstone Group, Francisco Partners and Insight Venture Partners.The number of advisers in this deal is by no means a record, however. The $10.4 billion buyout of SunGard Data Systems in 2005 enlisted 56 financial and legal advisers, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.The financial advisers to EMC were:■ Morgan Stanley■ Evercore Partners■ Needham & CompanyAnd dispensing financial advice, as well as debt financing, to Dell and Silver Lake, were:■ JPMorgan Chase■ Credit Suisse■ Barclays■ Bank of America Merrill Lynch■ Citigroup■ Deutsche Bank■ Goldman Sachs■ RBC Capital MarketsEMC’s outside legal counsel was Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Silver Lake drew upon Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, while Mr. Dell and his investment firm relied upon Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Advertisement
