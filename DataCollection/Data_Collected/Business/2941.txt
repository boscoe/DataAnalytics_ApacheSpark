Two big makers of packaging materials, RockTenn and MeadWestvaco, agreed on Monday to merge, creating a $16 billion manufacturer of cardboard cartons and other types of boxes.Together, the two will create a stronger competitor to International Paper, with $15.7 billion in combined net revenue and $2.9 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.The transaction comes after an activist shareholder campaign at MeadWestvaco by the hedge fund Starboard Value, which pushed the company to spin off its chemicals business with the aim of pushing up shareholder returns. MeadWestvaco announced this month that it would break off that chemicals division.Starboard still maintains a stake of roughly 6 percent in MeadWestvaco, making it the company’s fifth-biggest shareholder, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders in both manufacturers will take stakes in a new, as yet unnamed company. For each share in RockTenn that they own, shareholders can receive either one share in the new company or the cash equivalent to the volume-weighted average price of RockTenn’s shares over a five-day period that ends three trading days before the deal closes.Shareholders in MeadWestvaco will receive 0.78 of a share in the new entity for each of their shares, or about $49.13 at Monday’s premarket trading prices. The company’s shares were priced at $45.04 in premarket trading.That structure will leave MeadWestvaco investors with 50.1 percent of the new company and RockTenn stockholders with the remainder, assuming 7 percent of the RockTenn group takes the cash payout.The chief executive of RockTenn, Steven C. Voorhees, will continue in that role at the newly combined company, while MeadWestvaco’s chairman and chief executive, John A. Luke Jr., will become nonexecutive chairman. RockTenn will contribute eight of its directors to the new company’s board, while MeadWestvaco will bring six.The combined manufacturer will keep its headquarters in MeadWestvaco’s hometown, Richmond, Va., but will maintain operating offices in Norcross, Ga., RockTenn’s home base. The two companies said they would reap up to $300 million in cost savings within three years after the deal closes, which is expected by June 30.“This transaction brings together two highly complementary organizations to create a new, more powerful company with leadership positions in the global consumer and corrugated packaging markets,” Mr. Voorhees said in a statement.RockTenn was advised by the Blackstone Group, Lazard and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore. MeadWestvaco was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Greenhill & Company and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.A version of this article appears in print on 01/27/2015, on page B6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: 2 Leading Makers of Packaging Materials Reach Merger Agreement.
