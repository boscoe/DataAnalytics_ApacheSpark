DETROIT —  The president of the United Automobile Workers union, Dennis Williams, expressed confidence Friday that workers at Fiat Chrysler would accept a more lucrative contract proposal after rejecting an earlier version of the agreement.Mr. Williams said that union bargainers were determined to strengthen the agreement by providing a path for entry-level workers to achieve wage parity with veteran employees.Under the new proposal, entry-level workers will get raises over time that will bring their wages in line with those of longtime employees.“The membership wanted a clear path to achieve traditional wages,” Mr. Williams said in a conference call with reporters. “They don’t want to be considered second-class citizens.”AdvertisementMore than 40 percent of Fiat Chrysler’s 36,000 hourly workers are considered entry level. Under the previous contract, they earned $16 to $19 an hour, compared with $28 for veteran employees.AdvertisementThe first tentative contract, which was rejected last week by 65 percent of union members, called for raises that increased the top entry-level wage to $25.But under the new deal, those workers will earn about $29 an hour after eight years on the job.Veteran workers will also get raises in the new tentative agreement, to just less than $30 an hour.
                Prodded by its union, the auto industry served as the 20th-century trailblazer in spreading prosperity. But the model of a “social contract” has begun to unravel.            The new wage rates address what many workers said was the main reason that the first proposed deal was soundly defeated.Mr. Williams said that union leaders would take more time to explain the new agreement to workers than they did with the first proposal.“I think there were missteps,” he said, referring to how quickly the union called for a vote on the initial deal. “We should have taken more time to vote.”Vernita Glover, a Tier 2 worker who voted against the first proposed contract, said she would vote for this one. (Tier 2 is the entry level, and Tier 1 is veterans.)“I think everybody’s going to run with this one,” said Ms. Glover, who works at a Detroit-area plant. “The traditional people got a perk, and so did Tier 2s. I feel like it was evenly built.” She added, “I feel like more people are satisfied with this one than not, and just want it to be over.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But signing bonuses for veteran employees were increased to $4,000, up from $3,000 in the first proposal.AdvertisementUnion bargainers also dropped a controversial health care component.In the initial deal, Mr. Williams pushed for the institution of a health care cooperative that would pool the spending power of blue-collar and salaried employees to reduce total medical costs.
                Chrysler, founded in 1925, has had a tumultuous history as the third-largest of Detroit’s auto companies.            But some workers thought the move could hurt the benefits they receive under the union’s health plan. While Mr. Williams said that was not the case, he decided to remove the cooperative from the new proposed contract.“I was a little naïve and thought that everybody really understood it,” he said. “It’s my fault, and we did take it out of the agreement.”Workers are expected to begin voting on the new deal next week. Besides the 36,000 hourly workers, about 4,000 salaried employees at Fiat Chrysler are covered by the agreement.If the pact is ratified, the U.A.W. will move on to final negotiations with Ford Motor and General Motors. Mr. Williams said he expected to use the Fiat Chrysler agreement as a template for those talks.Hustling to his car at the Warren Stamping Plant, Jim Alter, a Tier 1 worker, said he would most likely vote for the new agreement, but was not surprised the initial pact was rejected.“These are hard-working people, and I sympathize, of course I do,” said Mr. Alter, who has been on the job 16 years. “If you look at the rising pay among C.E.O.s in our country, we’re out of whack.”Still, Mr. Alter said the union learned from the defeat. For example, the way the U.A.W. had described a proposed health insurance cooperative in its summary had created confusion and anxiety among some workers.“Now, it says, ‘health care unchanged.’ People are like, ‘Oh, O.K. We can understand that.’ ”Mary M.
