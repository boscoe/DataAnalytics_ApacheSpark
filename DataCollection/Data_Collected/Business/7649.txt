The bidding battle for Bwin.Party Digital Entertainment culminated on Friday with the online gambling company 888 Holdings agreeing to acquire its larger rival in a deal worth 893.3 million pounds, or about $1.4 billion.The Gibraltar-based 888 Holdings triumphed over GVC Holdings, a rival based on the Isle of Man, for Bwin.Party, which first announced it was in merger talks with several companies in November.The transaction is expected to increase the scale of 888 Holdings and its products and to generate at least $70 million in annual pretax cost savings by the end of 2018, the companies said.Under the terms of the deal, 888 Holdings will pay 104.09 pence in cash and shares for Bwin.Party, representing a 16.4 percent premium to Bwin.Party’s closing price on May 14, the day before GVC unveiled its takeover offer.Advertisement888 Holdings announced its own takeover bid a few days later, on May 18.“This is a transformational opportunity for 888 in the consolidating online gaming industry, which is expected to grow significantly over the coming years,” Brian Mattingley, the executive chairman of 888 Holdings, said in a news release.AdvertisementThe transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of 2016.Bwin.Party’s directors intend to unanimously recommend that shareholders approve the deal, the companies said. The directors and other investors who collectively hold 12.7 percent of the company’s shares have agreed to support the deal.Bwin.Party shareholders would receive 39.45 pence a share in cash and 0.404 of a share in the combined company for each share of Bwin.Party, and they would own 48.9 percent of the combined company.The offer includes a so-called mix-and-match provision that would allow Bwin.Party to vary the proportions of cash and new 888 shares they receive, but that would ultimately not change the total number of shares issued or the total cash component of the deal.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
