AdvertisementSupported byBy Alexandra StevensonCitadel Securities is preparing to close its Apogee dark pool as it focuses on another so-called off-exchange trading platform.Citadel Securities employees have held discussions with clients in recent weeks to notify them about its intentions, according to someone close to the firm. Citadel Securities operates Apogee and Citadel Connect, two electronic market-making platforms called dark pools, which allow buyers and sellers to trade anonymously outside of the public exchanges.It has not set a date yet for the halt of trading on Apogee, but the move is part of a shift in resources and focus toward Citadel Connect, the person said. Run out of New York, Apogee accounts for less than 1 percent of Citadel Securities’ business, the person said. Trading volumes are not publicly available.The move comes at a time when regulators are looking closely at dark pools and asking whether the businesses running these platforms have accurately disclosed information about how they work. In January, the Swiss bank UBS agreed to pay $14.5 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle accusations that it violated federal securities laws with its dark pool by creating an unlevel playing field for its customers.At the time, Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, said the agency would continue to focus on “policing the equity markets to ensure fairness and compliance.”Citadel Securities is owned by the billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, who also manages a $25 billion hedge fund called Citadel that he started when he was 22 after successfully trading bonds from his Harvard dorm room.It recent years, Citadel Securities has made a big push into electronic trading. The number of shares traded in its dark pools has increased as more institutional investors turned to its platforms.From 2013 to 2014, Citadel Connect nearly tripled its volume, to 72 million shares traded each day, making it a top platform for dark pool trading among institutional investors and overtaking trading in Apogee, according to a news release in February 2014.“Citadel Connect is one of the leading sources of off-exchange liquidity and its rapid growth underscores our commitment to being the world’s leading market maker by providing investors with the fastest, most cost-effective and reliable access to our deep and diverse liquidity,” Jamil Nazarali, head of Citadel execution services, said in the statement.Advertisement
