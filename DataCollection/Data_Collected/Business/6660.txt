JetBlue Airways, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were among the carriers whose shares declined.Stocks over all have sagged in the past two weeks as investors try to guess when Federal Reserve policy makers will raise the benchmark interest rate.The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at close to zero since December 2008 to help support lending and prop up the economy. Those low rates have also helped push the stock market to record levels. But a stronger-than-expected jobs report on Friday hinted that the economy was recovering from its winter slump.“The market is suggesting that if the data continue at this pace, the Fed will be more inclined to raise rates in September, rather than waiting,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial.AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 13.55 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,079.28.

Delta Air Lines shares fell $2.15, or 5 percent, to $40.75, and JetBlue shares fell $1.48, or 7.2 percent, to $19.01. Shares in United and Southwest Airlines also fell.The drop for airlines extended a theme of weakness for the transportation sector.The Dow Jones transportation average is down almost 9 percent this year, a slump that is giving a potentially worrying signal about the economy even as hiring picks up. A drop in these companies could mean that fewer goods are being transported by boat, plane or rail, suggesting that demand remains weak six years after the end of the recession.“You do want to see transport stocks gaining,” said Ms. Krosby of Prudential. She said that would lend confirmation to expectations “that the economy is gaining that crucial momentum that we have been waiting for.”
