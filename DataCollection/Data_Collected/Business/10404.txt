AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressInvestors on Wall Street made a small move back to safer assets Friday afternoon after the November employment report showed continued hiring but weak wages.Indexes finished little changed as real estate and household goods companies rose, but banks, which have soared since the presidential election, took losses.The Dow lost 21.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 19,170.42. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 0.87 point to 2,191.95. The Nasdaq composite added 4.55 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,255.65.Most stocks finished higher, and the biggest gains went to companies that pay big dividends, similar to bonds. Investors also bought bonds, sending their yields down.The dollar also weakened as investors expected less inflation.The jobs report called into question some investors’ hopes about the state of the United States economy, and they reversed some of the moves they have made since the presidential election three weeks ago.The Labor Department said employers added 178,000 jobs in November as hiring continued at a steady pace. Investors have long expected that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates later this month, and the jobs report did nothing to dispel that notion. Behind the positive headline numbers, however, fewer people looked for work and hourly wages slipped.The weak finish on Wall Street appeared to mark an end, at least for now, of the postelection rally for United States stocks. The S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq fell this week after a three-week rally took them to record highs. The Dow finished slightly higher.Bond prices, which have been falling sharply since the presidential election, rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.39 percent from 2.45 percent.Lower bond yields pushed investors to buy utility and real estate companies and consumer goods makers, which are often compared to bonds because of their big dividend payments. General Growth Properties rose 62 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $25.46 and Exelon rose 84 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $33.01. PepsiCo climbed $1.57, or 1.6 percent, to $100.60.The drop in bond yields also affected banks because yields are linked to long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates mean banks cannot make as much money from lending.

The euro rose to $1.0662 from $1.0660.Starbucks shares slid $1.30, or 2.2 percent, to $57.21 after the coffee chain said that Howard Schultz would step down as chief in April. He will remain chairman, and Starbucks said he will focus on new ideas like high-end shops. Kevin Johnson, the president and chief operating officer, will take over as chief executive. Mr. Schultz gave up the chief executive title in 2000, and investors feel Starbucks struggled until he returned to that post again in 2008.The human resources software company Workday gave a weak forecast. Aneel Bhusri, the chief executive, said some customers have recently delayed completing large deals, partly because of “global uncertainties,” including Britain’s planned exit from the European Union, the rise of Donald J. Trump to the presidency in the United States and elections elsewhere. Workday’s stock tumbled $10.20, or 12.5 percent, to $71.40.Gold rose $8.20 to $1,175.10 an ounce.Major indexes around the world retreated.
