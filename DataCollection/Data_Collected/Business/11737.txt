The online consumer review service Yelp reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue, driven by the strength of its advertising business. It also announced that its chief financial officer, Rob Krolik, would step down. Yelp’s results were released ahead of schedule because of a vendor error caused by PR Newswire, according to a company spokeswoman. Yelp’s shares were down about 10 percent in volatile trading. Mr. Krolik, who joined Yelp in 2011, will continue in his current role until Dec. 15, or until a replacement is hired, the company said. It said it had a net loss of $22.2 million, or 29 cents a share, attributable to common stockholders, for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, in contrast to a profit of $32.7 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $153.7 million from $109.9 million.A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Yelp Reports Rise in Revenue and an Executive Departure.
