Insurers are hoping that biosimilars will be sold for discounts of 40 to 50 percent from the cost of original brands in the United States, but Novartis has not yet disclosed the intended U.S. price for Zarxio. The judge denied Amgen’s request for a preliminary injunction. Novartis had agreed to delay its U.S. release until the court’s decision, or until April 10, whichever came first.It was not immediately clear how long Amgen’s appeal would take, or whether Novartis might release its biosimilar before an appeals court decision is rendered. If Novartis were to initiate such an “at-risk” release, it might later have to pay costly damages in the event that Amgen’s patent is declared valid and enforceable.Biosimilars have been on the market since 2006 in Europe.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March approved Zarxio for the same five conditions for which Neupogen is used — among cancer patients undergoing various treatments.
