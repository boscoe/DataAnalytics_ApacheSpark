The legal industry is consolidating at a fast pace, with 48 law firm mergers or acquisitions so far this year, the most recorded at midyear, and more activity is predicted, according to a report.A flurry of 29 such combinations in the first three months of the year was the strongest start registered, according to Altman Weil, a legal consulting firm. It started keeping track of law firm mergers and acquisitions nearly a decade ago.The largest combination, which was completed this month, was between the global law firm Dentons and McKenna Long & Aldridge, a firm in Atlanta. At present, Dentons now has more than 3,000 lawyers and professionals.In January, Dentons said it would merge with Dacheng Law Offices in China, which set it on the path to balloon to more than 6,600 lawyers and become the largest global law firm.Advertisement“We expect the law firm acquisition market to be extremely active for the foreseeable future,” said Eric Seeger, a principal at Altman Weil in Newtown Square, Pa., outside Philadelphia.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Cozen O’Connor, a firm based in Philadelphia with 575 lawyers, for example, expanded into Chicago by acquiring Meckler Bulger Tilson, a commercial litigation firm with 60 lawyers.Nearly 80 percent of the deals announced in the second quarter involved firms with 20 or fewer lawyers, such as the foray by Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn, a firm based in Detroit with 260 lawyers, into Chicago with its acquisition of Schopf & Weiss, a litigation boutique with 14 lawyers.In Houston, the intellectual property firm Wong Cabello, with 24 lawyers, said it would be folded into Blank Rome, a firm with about 540 lawyers.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
