LONDON — Deutsche Wohnen urged its shareholders on Monday to reject a takeover bid from Vonovia, Germany’s biggest residential real estate company.Vonovia offered to acquire its smaller rival in October, in a cash-and-share deal that values Deutsche Wohnen at 14 billion euros, or about $15.4 billion, including debt.The move eventually led Deutsche Wohnen to abandon a separate deal to acquire the residential property company LEG Immobilien. That transaction would have created a much stronger competitor to Vonovia.Deutsche Wohnen is focused primarily on managing and developing residential properties. As of Sept. 30, the company managed about 149,000 residential and commercial properties and about 2,000 nursing units.AdvertisementOn Monday, Deutsche Wohnen said that its management and supervisory boards considered the structure and value of the Vonovia offer to be “inadequate.”Advertisement“The premium offered with the consideration on the stock price lies significantly below the premia paid for comparable transactions in the German residential real estate sector,” Deutsche Wohnen said in a news release on Monday, “and even signifies a discount against the median of analyst target share prices.”Under the terms of Vonovia’s bid, Deutsche Wohnen investors would receive €83.14 in cash and seven shares of Vonovia for 11 Deutsche Wohnen shares.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
