Trinity Industries, which has been accused of making a guardrail that can malfunction and impale drivers, indicated on Friday that it would resume selling the product — days after the Virginia attorney general’s office said the guardrail had “failed miserably” in a crash test.It has been almost a year since Trinity stopped shipping its guardrail system, called the ET-Plus, after a jury in a whistle-blower case found that the company had defrauded the federal government when it failed to disclose potentially hazardous changes it made in 2005. More than 30 states also suspended purchase of the guardrails units.“The company is currently receiving inquiries from customers for potential purchases of ET-Plus Systems, and will resume shipment of the product as orders are received and accepted,” Jeff Eller, a Trinity spokesman, said in a statement. He would not disclose which customers had inquired about buying the guardrail systems.Reporters for The New York Times contacted state transportation officials in all 50 states to ask whether any had lifted temporary bans on buying the guardrails or had any plans to purchase new ET-Plus units from Trinity. Many did not respond, and some reiterated that the suspensions were still in place. No state confirmed that it was planning to purchase new guardrail units.
            A sequence from video footage of a crash test in San Antonio in January, in which a compact car collided with a Trinity ET-Plus guardrail head. The car spins out and the metal guardrail bends to form a sharp “elbow,” which the vehicle then strikes on the driver’s side.        Since the verdict, the Justice Department and the Transportation Department inspector general’s office have begun a joint criminal investigation into Trinity and its dealings with the federal government. The Federal Highway Administration ordered eight crash tests of the guardrails and, in March, announced that Trinity had passed the tests, including a final test in which the device severely dented the driver-side door of the test car.AdvertisementBut officials in Virginia, which has banned purchase of the guardrail and has joined a state-level whistle-blower lawsuit against the company, deemed those tests to be inadequate. They proceeded with six more tests following what they described as stricter criteria, including a low-angle test that is generally not required for such products.AdvertisementVirginia’s Transportation Department has not received the results of those tests yet, said Marshall Herman, a spokeswoman for the department. She said the agency would not “make any judgments on results until our engineers have thoroughly reviewed the report,” adding that the product is still not approved for use on Virginia’s roads.But this week, Virginia’s Office of the Attorney General filed documents in court that described one of the tests as a failure.“The new, modified ET-Plus was recently crash-tested by Virginia using the low-angle critical test and it failed miserably,” said the filing. “The pickup truck in one test went airborne after hitting the extruder head then flipped and landed on the guardrail.”
                Trinity announced on Friday that it would resume shipping its guardrail system.            Trinity sharply criticized the characterization.Mr. Eller questioned whether officials in the attorney general’s office were qualified to analyze test results. He added that normally a crash test sponsor “waits until all of the test data is compiled and analyzed by legitimate experts before publicly coming out with test results.”The test results did not meet a “known standard,” so the results would be irrelevant, he said.Trinity previously criticized Virginia’s use of the low-angle tests, calling them “nonstandard.” Because the ET-Plus was deemed eligible for federal funding in 2005, it still qualifies to be tested under older guidelines, even though they were updated in 2011. The older guidelines do not require a shallow-angle test, but do allow regulators’ discretion for further testing when they are investigating a particular vulnerability.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In 2005, without notifying federal authorities, Trinity narrowed the channel behind the head to four inches from five, possibly causing the system to jam, state officials have said. When that happens, the rail may cut through the vehicle itself, potentially injuring occupants.Last month, the federal highway agency and a nonprofit group representing state transportation officials released a report that said that thousands of guardrails manufactured under an old safety standard — like Trinity’s ET-Plus — may be particularly vulnerable in certain kinds of crashes. The Federal Highway Administration declined to comment.Aaron M.
