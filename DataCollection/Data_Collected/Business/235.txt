Pure Storage, whose initial public offering had been viewed by hopeful investors as a potential antidote to the trend, proved no different.Shares of the company, a data storage provider, fell below their I.P.O. price in their first day of trading on Wednesday. The stock ended the day down 5.8 percent, at $16. That valued the company at under $3 billion, below the level of its last private fund-raising round.The six-year-old technology provider had priced its stock sale at $17 a share on Tuesday night, the midpoint of its expected range.The drop proved yet another disappointing public debut in a year that has been tough for initial stock sales. The number of pricings in the United States so far this year is down 35 percent from the same time in 2014, according to data from Renaissance Capital. And those stock sales on average have fallen 4.2 percent before their initial price.That raises questions about how some of the big and prominent companies waiting to go public — like the credit card processor First Data and the supermarket operator Albertsons — will fare.Pure Storage’s chief executive, Scott Dietzen, professed little worry about the stock’s performance in a telephone interview on Wednesday, joking that if he saw employees with the company’s stock ticker up on their desks, he would order them taken down.Going public, he said, was meant to help promote the storage provider’s visibility and standing.“The markets are going to do what the markets are going to do,” he said.Though analysts have questioned whether hiccups in Pure Storage’s public debut represented a continued slowdown in the red-hot tech private market, Mr. Dietzen played down such concerns. His own company was still showing huge gains in growth, as are other tech start-ups, which will continue to draw investors.“I feel very comfortable that there’s tremendous appetite for highly differentiated tech companies,” he said.Advertisement
