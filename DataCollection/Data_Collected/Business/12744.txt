A federal jury on Thursday ordered Gilead Sciences to pay Merck $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to a lucrative cure for hepatitis C. The damages award is far less than the $2 billion Merck had demanded. On Tuesday, the same jury in San Jose, Calif., upheld the validity of the patents, which lie at the heart of the dispute over Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Together, the medicines had more than $20 billion in United States sales in 2014 and 2015. Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. Merck, which in January won approval on its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, is also asking for a 10 percent royalty on Gilead’s sales going forward. That issue will be argued in a separate nonjury trial starting next week.A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Gilead Must Pay Merck $200 Million in Patent Dispute.
