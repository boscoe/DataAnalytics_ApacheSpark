Target announced in a filing on Tuesday that it was laying off 1,700 employees as part of a cost-cutting drive at its Minneapolis headquarters, the first in a wave of job cuts expected at the retailer over the next two years.Executives at Target, which is in the midst of a turnaround after a string of lackluster years,  warned investors last week to expect “several thousand” job cuts, mostly in Minneapolis, as the company reorganized its operations.Target expects to pay severance costs of about $100 million in this round of cuts, which will be booked as a pretax charge in its first-quarter earnings, the retailer said.Over all, Target is aiming for a cost savings of $2 billion over the next two years to bolster investment in areas like food, e-commerce, and supply-chain technology.A version of this article appears in print on March 11, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Target Laying Off 1,700 in First Wave of Cuts.
