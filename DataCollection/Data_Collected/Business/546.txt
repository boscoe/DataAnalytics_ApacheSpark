AdvertisementSupported byBy Jad MouawadAmerican Airlines appears to have successfully negotiated one of the final and most critical pieces of its merger with US Airways this weekend after it merged the two airlines’ reservation systems.The carrier shifted all US Airways flight numbers, reservations and passenger information records to the system used by American, called Sabre. The airline said it got through the weekend without any malfunctions or canceled flights related to the reservation switchover.The last US Airways flights to take off was Flight 1939 — renamed for the year the airline was founded. It left San Francisco Friday evening and landed in Philadelphia Saturday morning, where it joined other defunct airline brands such as TWA, Northwest, Continental and Pan Am.Saturday morning, all flights were renamed American, airport signs were changed and people checking the US Airways website were redirected automatically to the American website.“We’re still monitoring everything to see how things go for the first few days of business travel, but Monday is off to a good start,” said Casey Norton, American’s spokesman. He added that call volumes to the airline’s reservation system and its social media traffic over the last couple of days were “typical” of weekend operations.Analysts note that the true test of the merger integration will come this week, however, when the airline faces heavier traffic and more passengers.American has met all of the major operational and technical goals related to its 2013 merger with US Airways. In April, the airline received its single operating certificate from the F.A.A., meaning all flights now operate under the American call sign, which pilots use to communicate with air traffic controllers. The airlines also merged their frequent-flier programs.To ensure a smooth transition, American devised a three-month “drain down” approach rather than a more abrupt overnight changeover. It started moving all US Airways reservations in mid-July, hoping to avoid the mishaps that United Airlines experienced in 2012. In that merger, problems with United’s reservation systems led to months of delays and cancellations after it joined with Continental Airlines.Advertisement
