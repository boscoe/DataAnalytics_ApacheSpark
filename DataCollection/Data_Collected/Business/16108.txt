LONDON — E. Anheuser & Company started as a small brewer in St. Louis more than 160 years ago – one of several breweries opened by German immigrants that introduced German-style lager to the United States.Anheuser-Busch InBev, its corporate descendant and the world’s largest brewer, hopes to soon become much bigger – and more dominant globally – as it prepares to gobble up its closet rival, SABMiller, in a deal worth more than $100 billion.The path to creating a combined company that Anheuser-Busch InBev has called the “first truly global brewer” has taken nearly a year as the company has agreed to a series of asset sales in order to win regulatory approval.It faces one last hurdle on Wednesday, as SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch InBev shareholders vote on the proposed deal.AdvertisementThe margin to win approval, however, may be tighter than Anheuser-Busch InBev, which is based in Belgium, originally expected.AdvertisementTo win the support of SABMiller’s two largest shareholders, the deal was structured to give those investors – the American tobacco giant Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia – the ability to take restricted shares, instead of cash. That would allow them to avoid a costly tax bill following the transaction.Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to increase its cash offer this summer as the pound declined following Britain’s vote to exit the European Union.Facing pressure from its investor base, SABMiller, which has recommended that investors approve the transaction, also agreed this summer to treat its two biggest shareholders as a separate class, allowing other investors to vote on the cash offer separately.Now, a smaller pool of SABMiller shareholders is set to determine the outcome of the deal – with a handful of SABMiller investors expected to vote against the transaction.Aberdeen Asset Management, an investment management company in Scotland that holds a stake in SABMiller, has publicly opposed the deal, saying it undervalues the company.Reports in recent weeks also have indicated that Vontobel Asset Management of Switzerland and the British investor Ash Park Capital are both considering voting against the transaction. Vontobel and Ash Park did not respond to requests for comment.Citigroup said on Monday that it believed that there was a “high likelihood” that SABMiller shareholders would approve the transaction.Advertisement“Considering that ABI has had many conversations with SAB investors in recent weeks, we believe by now they probably should have a reasonably clear view on whether they have enough votes for the scheme to be approved,” Andrea Pistacchi, a Citigroup analyst, said in a research note. “We doubt ABI would go ahead with the vote on Wednesday, unless it were confident of succeeding.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

On a pro forma basis, the company’s annual revenue would be about $55 billion.To win approval of the deal, Anheuser-Busch InBev has agreed to sell off a variety of assets to satisfy regulators.AdvertisementIn November, Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed to sell SABMiller’s 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to SABMiller’s partner in a joint venture, Molson Coors Brewing, for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch InBev.In April, it accepted an offer by Asahi Group Holdings of Japan to buy the beer brands Grolsch, Meantime and Peroni, as well as associated SABMiller operations in Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, for 2.55 billion euros, or about $2.9 billion.And Anheuser-Busch InBev also said in April that it would be willing to sell SABMiller’s assets in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia as part of a package of divestments to win approval from European regulators.Chinese regulators gave conditional approval to the transaction after Anheuser-Busch InBev agreed earlier this year to sell SABMiller’s 49 percent stake in the maker of Snow to China Resources Beer, a state-owned brewer, for about $1.6 billion. China Resources Beer already owns the other 51 percent of the brewer, C. R. Snow.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.A version of this article appears in print on September 28, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Shareholder Vote Is Last Hurdle for Merger of Beer Giants.
