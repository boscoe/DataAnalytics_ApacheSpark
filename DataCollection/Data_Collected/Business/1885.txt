AdvertisementSupported byBy Jack EwingWOLFSBURG, Germany — It was the corporate equivalent of saying “never mind.”Volkswagen, which has been on a public relations losing streak in recent months, said Wednesday that one of its admitted sins was not as egregious as the company had originally confessed.The automaker said Wednesday that it had overstated things last month when it announced an auto emissions problem that regulators had not yet detected — that it had misled the public about the fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions of 800,000 vehicles in Europe. The number, Volkswagen said on Wednesday, was only a small fraction of that — no more than 36,000.German transportation regulators have not yet confirmed the revised, smaller number. But if it is accurate, it means that Volkswagen would have to repay only a small fraction of the 2 billion euros, or $2.2 billion, in tax incentives that the company originally estimated customers in Europe had improperly received from their governments for driving cars with low emissions of greenhouse gases.The tax breaks were granted by governments on the basis of the low emissions and good fuel economy that Volkswagen had initially reported for the cars — and that the company on Wednesday said it could once again vouch for, in most cases.Whether €2 billion, or a much smaller figure, the money is only a portion of the many billions of dollars Volkswagen could end up spending in repairs, fines and lawsuit settlements over the much bigger scandal it has not been able to explain, or explain away. That is the problem of deceptive software it has admitted installing in more than 11 million diesel cars that was designed to let the cars cheat on emissions tests.If the scaled-back admission on Wednesday holds up, it might be a rare, if minor, piece of good news for the company. But it also raises questions about why the company announced the 800,000 figure and whether Volkswagen still has a public communications problem.Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it had chosen to err on the side of caution when it disclosed the new problem and gave the figure of 800,000 cars. The company said that after retesting the vehicles, it concluded that its original measurements of fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions were accurate for the vast majority of the vehicles.And even for 36,000 or fewer of the vehicles, Volkswagen said, the fuel economy and emissions discrepancies might be small enough that the company may not have to reimburse any tax breaks. The fuel data was off by the equivalent of less than two miles per gallon, the company said, and the carbon dioxide-emission figures were off by a “few grams” per 100 kilometers, or about 60 miles, traveled.Volkswagen’s bigger issue remains the diesel cheating scandal involving 11 million cars. Most are in Europe but about 500,000 of them are in the United States, where regulators disclosed the deception in September.On Thursday here in Wolfsburg, Matthias Müller, the Volkswagen chief executive, will hold his first news conference since the wrongdoing came to light and he was promoted to replace Martin Winterkorn, who resigned a few days after the deception was exposed.Mr. Müller is expected to provide an interim report on the company’s own investigation of who was responsible for the diesel cheating. How forthcoming the company is able to be will be a test of its campaign to restore credibility.Volkswagen said late last month that it would be able to make diesel vehicles in Europe compliant with clean air rules by reprogramming the software. For some engines, Volkswagen said it would install a simple plastic part to improve the flow of air into the engine and reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides — the gases that the deceptive software was meant to reduce during testing, but would allow at much higher levels during on-the-road driving.Though Volkswagen has yet to indicate how it will fix its diesel vehicles in the United States, where emissions standards are stricter, the remedial actions announced for Europe were much simpler and cheaper than expected.“In Europe, Volkswagen has mostly gotten the risks out of the way,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who specializes in the auto industry and is a prominent critic of Volkswagen.But he said the company was also benefiting from light enforcement of regulations in Germany. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, the regulatory agency for motor vehicles in Germany, is deliberately starved for resources by political leaders eager to protect the country’s powerful automakers, Mr. Dudenhöffer said Wednesday. As a result, he said, the agency does not have the capacity to challenge Volkswagen’s technical findings.Under European Union rules, approval by German regulators automatically confers approval in the bloc’s other countries.Volkswagen also said Wednesday that it had replaced an executive who had earlier been suspended in connection with the diesel emissions cheating. The executive, Heinz-Jakob Neusser, will give up his duties as head of development for the Volkswagen brand and be replaced by Frank Welsch, the company said.Mr. Neusser will remain with the company and “is available to take on other responsibilities,” Volkswagen said.Last week, Ulrich Hackenberg, who like Mr. Neusser played a top role in developing Volkswagen engines in recent years, resigned his post at the company. Six other executives have also been suspended, but as far as is known they remain on the payroll.There is little political will in Germany to punish Volkswagen, which is one of the country’s largest employers. But Volkswagen still faces intense pressure in the United States from the Environmental Protection Agency, and there are customers and dealers who have filed hundreds of lawsuits.“There is still the United States,” Mr. Dudenhöffer said.OpinionThe Editorial BoardAdvertisement
