LONDON — The Irish drug maker Horizon Pharma said on Monday that it would seek a special shareholder meeting to replace the directors of Depomed, its smaller American rival, as it continued to pressure the company to engage in takeover talks.Horizon Pharma also said it planned to file a lawsuit in state court in California on Monday to challenge a so-called poison pill plan adopted by Depomed to fend off its takeover approach.Depomed said on Monday that it planned to file its own lawsuit against Horizon and said it would argue that Horizon’s takeover bid was predicated “on the improper and unlawful use of highly confidential and proprietary information” related to Nucynta, Depomed’s drug to help manage severe pain.Last week, Depomed’s board unanimously rejected Horizon’s latest sweetened offer in an unsolicited bid to acquire Depomed in an all-share deal.AdvertisementOn Monday, Horizon, which owns about 1 percent of Depomed’s common stock, said that it wanted to team up with other shareholders to call a special shareholder meeting and would seek to remove all of Depomed’s current directors.Advertisement“We have repeatedly sought to engage in good faith with Depomed’s management team and board towards a consensual agreement to combine our two companies,” Timothy P. Walbert, the Horizon chairman, president and chief executive, said in a news release.“However, as a result of the improper efforts of Depomed’s management team and board to entrench themselves, we have taken definitive steps to empower Depomed’s shareholders to act in their own best financial interests through a special shareholders meeting,” Mr. Walbert said.Horizon said it planned to file a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California for the County of Santa Clara, challenging the legality of Depomed’s poison pill plan and other bylaw amendments adopted by the drug maker in July.On Monday, Depomed fired back and said it was preparing its own lawsuit.Depomed planned to seek an injunction in Superior Court to block Horizon from continuing to make “improper and unlawful use of Depomed’s highly confidential and trade secret data” and to prevent Horizon from continuing to make what Depomed claimed were “false and misleading statements” in connection with its takeover bid.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It reported sales of $297 million in 2014 and has more than 630 employees.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
