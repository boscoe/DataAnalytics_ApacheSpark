The companies will obtain 100 percent of Uniasselvi.Kroton began courting buyers during the second half of last year, after Brazil’s antitrust regulator CADE required it to sell Uniasselvi as a condition of approving its merger with Anhanguera Educacional.Uniasselvi, founded in 1997, will now compete against Kroton. The unit is Carlyle’s first investment in education in Brazil, Fernando Pinto, a managing director, said in a statement. Uniasselvi serves more than 100,000 students in its undergraduate and graduate programs.That sector has long drawn private investors here. Laureate has made several acquisitions here, and Advent International acquired a stake in Kroton in 2009, which it then sold in 2013.This year, though, many education companies are suffering as a result of the Brazilian government’s tightening of its student loan reimbursement policy. Uncertainty remains over the program’s future and growth as fiscal accounts deteriorate and the government comes under pressure from ratings agencies to enact fiscal austerity measures.Still, some see the sector as an opportunity.“The higher education sector should continue to expand over the years to come, as penetration in Brazil still lags that of other countries with the same development level,” the Vinci partner Carlos Eduardo Martins said in the statement.For Carlyle, its pace of investing in Brazil has picked up this year. In April, it obtained an 8.3 percent stake in the hospital operator Rede D’Or for 1.75 billion reais (or $603 million in the exchange rate at that time) in its first private equity investment in Brazil since 2012.For Kroton, the deal represents a healthy return — it acquired Uniasselvi in 2012 for 530 million reais, Mr. Lazar said.Carlyle said it expected the transaction to close in the next several months.Advertisement
