Home Retail is the owner of Argos, which sells electronics, housewares and other products through its online operations and retail stores in Britain and Ireland.Like many of its British peers, Sainsbury has faced pressure to cut prices as the German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl have cut into their market shares.The renewed bid came before a Tuesday deadline by the British takeover regulators for Sainsbury to make an offer or walk away for as long as six months. Home Retail said last month that it had rejected an earlier approach Sainsbury had made in November.The Home Retail deal would give Sainsbury a much larger footprint, by adding 840 Argos stores in Britain and Ireland to its more than 1,200 supermarkets and convenience stores in Britain. The transaction would also significantly raise Sainsbury’s online presence by acquiring Argos and its extensive delivery network in Britain.“The combination is an opportunity to bring together two of the U.K.’s leading retail businesses, with complementary product offers, focused on delivering quality products and services at fair prices, through an integrated, multichannel proposition,” Sainsbury said in a news release.On Tuesday, Home Retail said that its board of directors was willing to recommend the main financial terms of the bid, which values the company at about 161.3 pence a share.“Whilst the board of Home Retail Group continues to believe in the prospects for the stand-alone company, it recognizes that the possible offer will provide an attractive opportunity for Home Retail Group shareholders to receive a full valuation for their shares,’’ Home Retail said in a news release, “and, through their shareholding in the combined group, also to participate in the value created by the combined group from the transaction.”The British takeover authorities have agreed to allow a three-week extension until Feb. 23 for Sainsbury to make a firm offer for Home Retail.Under the terms of the proposed deal, Home Retail shareholders would receive 0.321 shares in the combined company and 55 pence in cash for each share they own, equivalent to about £1.1 billion. Home Retail shareholders would own about 12 percent of the combined company.They would also receive 25 pence a share from the sale of Homebase, a British home improvement chain, and 2.8 pence a share in lieu of a final dividend, equivalent to an additional £200 million in capital being returned to shareholders. Wesfarmers Limited of Australia agreed to acquire Homebase last month for £340 million.Morgan Stanley and UBS advised Sainsbury, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Home Retail.Advertisement
