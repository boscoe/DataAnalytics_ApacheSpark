LOS ANGELES — Nancy Tellem, a longtime entertainment executive recently caught in the crosscurrents of a leadership change at Microsoft, is joining senior management at Interlude, a start-up focused on interactive music videos.Interlude, founded in 2010 by the Israeli rock star Yoni Bloch, said on Wednesday that Ms. Tellem would become chief media officer and executive chairwoman. The move continues a focus on new media for Ms. Tellem, who spent roughly two decades at CBS and Warner Brothers before joining Microsoft, which hired her in 2012 to create an Xbox-centered movie and television business.Last year, just as Ms. Tellem’s operation was starting to gain traction, Microsoft got a new chief executive. Steven A. Ballmer was replaced by Satya Nadella, who set new priorities. Competing with the likes of Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and Sony in digital content was not one of them. Mr. Nadella pulled the plug on Xbox Entertainment Studios. (One series that Ms. Tellem left behind, “Humans,” a drama about robotic household servants, will be shown on AMC starting in June.)Ms. Tellem’s role at Interlude will involve her Rolodex. “I look forward to extending Interlude’s reach to the entertainment industry by bringing film and television creators on board,” she said in a statement.Interlude, which has done deals with Warner Music Group, Nickelodeon and Disney, is best known for an interactive video of “Like a Rolling Stone” by Bob Dylan, which has generated more than 70 million views. While Interlude is still small, the entertainment industry and advertisers are taking it seriously as they search for ways to make people more active viewers of online content.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
