Blendle, a publishing start-up that aims to simplify the way that people pay for journalism online, will be introduced in beta form in America in early 2016, the company said Wednesday.The company allows people to pay small amounts for individual articles, rather than having to sign up for full subscriptions to particular publications. It is backed by The New York Times and the German publishing company Axel Springer, and has more than 500,000 subscribers in Germany and the Netherlands, where it signed up major national publishers, as well as The Economist, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.“Paywalls are getting more and more common in the United States,” Alexander Klöpping, the company’s founder, said in a statement. “Some of the best content is only available behind those paywalls, doesn’t go on the web until days after publication in print newspapers and magazines and is still viewed through an array of intrusive ads.”The company, Mr. Klöpping said, seeks to address those difficulties, and also curates and suggests articles, using both technology and human editors. It has been called the “iTunes of journalism,” a reference to Apple’s music store, which stores credit card details so that people can buy music easily.So-called micro-payments, or the ability for readers to quickly buy individual articles with a minimum of form-filling, have long been a hope for a beleaguered news industry struggling to make ends meet online. Many publishers are moving toward subscription models, as digital advertising remains a much less lucrative business than its declining print counterpart.The articles that have sold best so far, Blendle said, are longer, and offer background, analysis or opinion.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
