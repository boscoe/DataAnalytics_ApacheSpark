It will be part of a science and technology company that includes Danaher’s diagnostics, dental and water quality businesses. This company, with roughly $16.5 billion in revenue including Pall’s, will keep the Danaher name.Danaher plans to split off its industrial businesses, which include its test and measurement and automation businesses, into a separate company, with $6 billion in revenue. The company says it expects the separation to take place in a tax-free transaction by the end of next year.“The pending strategic acquisition of Pall Corporation announced today offers us the unique opportunity to drive greater shareholder value going forward as two stronger and better companies,” Thomas P. Joyce Jr., Danaher’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Each company will be more focused with access to the capital necessary to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities.”Under the terms of the deal, Danaher will acquire Pall for $127.20 a share in cash, a premium of 28 percent to its closing stock price on Monday, before The Wall Street Journal reported that Pall was nearing the end of an auction of itself. Pall has a total enterprise value of $13.8 billion, when assumed debt is included and its cash holdings are excluded.Danaher says it expects to finance the acquisition with available cash and the issuance of debt or new credit facilities.Goldman Sachs and the law firm Shearman & Sterling advised Pall.Advertisement
