The Federal Reserve saidon Monday that borrowing rose $10.5 billion in January, an annual increase of just 3.58 percent. That is the smallest annual percentage gain since February 2013. Total borrowing was $3.54 trillion. Borrowing in the revolving category that covers credit cards dropped $1.1 billion, after a strong increase in December that corresponded with holiday shopping. Borrowing in the category thatincludes auto and student loans increased $11.6 billion last month.A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Rise in Consumer Borrowing Is the Smallest Since 2013.
