The Carlyle Group on Wednesday announced its first stock buyback as it tries to counter the perception, heightened by turbulent markets, that the boom in private equity is over.The private equity giant, based in Washington, reported that profit in the fourth quarter — a measure that includes gains that have not been realized — fell by 59 percent, to $73 million, compared with the same period a year earlier.The gain amounted to 24 cents a share, lower than the 31 cents a share expected in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.“Carlyle had a strong 2015 amid challenging markets,” said David M. Rubenstein, the co-chief executive of Carlyle. The firm will buy back $200 million of Carlyle shares, he added, because despite Carlyle’s history of strong performance, “the equity market currently ascribes little value to our diversified investment platform.”AdvertisementTurbulent markets have put a damper on Carlyle’s stock price, which has fallen by more than half over the last year. Carlyle’s problem is not unique, and other private equity executives have gone to great lengths to tell shareholders that their firms are undervalued, and some have also turned to buybacks. In January, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone told investors “right now you are getting Blackstone on sale.” And Leon Black of Apollo Global Management called his firm’s stock market valuation “an absurdity.”AdvertisementBoth Apollo and Fortress told investors last week that they would buy back shares — Apollo $250 million worth and Fortress $100 million. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company kicked of the trend when it pledged to buy back as much as $500 million worth of shares last October.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            With the price of oil down sharply and global markets flailing, the rich performance fees that Carlyle receives on its investments have slowed. Those fees are driven in part by the buyout firm’s exit of these investments by listing them in the public markets— which have been fewer in number.In the final quarter of the year, Carlyle said it made $4 billion on proceeds from sales of 140 investments in portfolio companies. Over 2015, Carlyle made $18 billion compared with $19.7 billion in 2014. It also said it raised $2.7 billion from investors in the last three months of the year, raising the total amount raised over the year to $16.4 billion.For Carlyle, distributable earnings, or the cash generated and eligible to be passed along to shareholders, was $145 million in the fourth quarter, down 53 percent from $311 million last year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Assets under management at the hedge fund fell to less than $2 billion at the end of last year from $8 billion at its peak in 2014. Carlyle bought a majority stake in the hedge fund, founded by four Citigroup traders, in 2010 as part of a move to diversify beyond its core business of buyouts.But there other bright spots in the unit. The firm is raising money for a second energy mezzanine fund, with $2.7 billion already committed, which recently began collecting fees. Carlyle is also planning to raise money for a new distressed fund that will focus on turnaround deals and credit opportunities.Carlyle’s real estate assets gained 27 percent over the year, while its core buyout funds gained 13 percent. Executives have been quick to point out that while this rate of appreciation has slowed for its cornerstone buyout business, it still outperformed the 1 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the same period.Striking a more positive note for 2016, Carlyle’s co-founder, William E. Conway, said that the firm already had $4 billion of deals that in the pipeline and roughly the same amount in companies that it was contracted to sell.“We expect a tougher environment over the next few years,” he said. “But it is in this environment we’ll expect to see the best opportunities.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
