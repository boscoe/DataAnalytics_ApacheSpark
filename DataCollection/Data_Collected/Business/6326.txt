Taco Bell and Pizza Hut say they will get rid of artificial colors and flavors, making them the latest big food companies trying to distance themselves from ingredients people might find unappetizing. Instead of “black pepper flavor,” for instance, Taco Bell will use black pepper in its seasoned beef, said Liz Matthews, the company’s chief food innovation officer. Taco Bell also said the artificial dye Yellow No. 6 would be removed from its nacho cheese, Blue No. 1 would be removed from its avocado ranch dressing, and carmine, a bright pigment, would be removed from its red tortilla strips. Ms. Matthews said some of the new recipes were being tested and should be in stores nationally by the end of the year.A version of this brief appears in print on May 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Taco Bell and Pizza Hut to Drop Artificial Flavors and Colors.
