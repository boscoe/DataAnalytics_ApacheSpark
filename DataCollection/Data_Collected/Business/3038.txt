PARIS — The European airline industry is one of the biggest in the world, on par with that of the United States. But with more than 150 carriers vying for 800 million passengers each year, Europe is also the world’s most fragmented and least profitable airline market.On Tuesday, however, in what analysts say could be a small but encouraging step toward a long-overdue industry consolidation, the Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus said its board had recommended that shareholders accept a sweetened takeover offer from the International Airlines Group, or I.A.G., the parent company of British Airways and Iberia of Spain.If shareholders accept the bid, valued at 1.36 billion euros ($1.54 billion) it would be Europe’s first significant airline consolidation deal in almost five years.“While we have seen some industry consolidation in Europe, it has been a slow and painful process,” said Stephen Furlong, an airline analyst at Davy Securities in Dublin. Adding a small but financially stable airline like Aer Lingus to I.A.G.’s stable of carriers would provide strategic advantages to both buyer and target.AdvertisementThe offer, of €2.55 a share, would still win the support of the two largest investors in Aer Lingus, the Irish government, which holds 25 percent, and Ryanair, the carrier based in Dublin, which owns nearly 30 percent. It would also need the blessing of the European Union antitrust authorities. But if the deal goes through, analysts say, it would be a positive sign for the European industry.Advertisement“For once this is not a case where they have to do a turnaround, restructure and downsize,” Mr. Furlong said. “This is an investment for growth.”What is good for the airlines is not always best for their customers, of course — as the much greater consolidation of the United States airline industry has shown. Fewer choices for passengers tends to mean fewer, more crowded flights and the ability of airlines to reduce creature comforts while keeping fares high and adding on fees.“People aren’t getting very excited about flying United in economy at 95 percent load factor,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, an aviation consulting firm based in London.That level of consolidation remains elusive in Europe, though. Many of the region’s former national carriers are struggling to compete with nimbler, low-cost rivals in their home markets as well as fast-growing carriers from the Persian Gulf on lucrative long-distance routes.The bulk of Europe’s scheduled services — more than 80 percent of available seats — is controlled by two dozen carriers, led by the Lufthansa Group, Ryanair and I.A.G. But in the United States, deregulation in the 1980s was followed by a series of airline failures and mergers that has reduced the field to just eight major players, with a combined market share of 95 percent.Led by Southwest and Delta Air Lines, these larger United States airline groups — many of which have recently emerged from bankruptcy — now outpace carriers in the rest of the world in terms of profit and revenue growth.“Europe’s perennial underperformance owes a lot to the fragmented nature of the market,” said Jonathan Wober, an analyst in London at the CAPA Center for Aviation, an independent market research group.AdvertisementEuropean passengers have benefited from the competition, which has helped keep a lid on ticket prices. Investments in larger airplanes have increased the number of available seats on each European flight by an average of about one-third over the last decade, Mr. Morris said, outpacing growth in demand, especially during the recent economic downturn.
            I.A.G., owner of British Airways and Iberia, is seeking to acquire Aer Lingus. The move is seen as a first step toward needed consolidation in the European market, which is much more fragmented than the market in the United States.

That opened the door to the creation of Pan-European discount carriers like Ryanair and easyJet, which quickly became formidable challengers, offering cheap point-to-point services to airports that were underserved by the national carriers, whose networks were structured around hubs based at major national airports.The flag carriers were slower to take advantage of the regional opportunities created by the market’s liberalization. It was not until the shock of the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, and the sharp drop in air traffic that followed, that many of Europe’s full-service carriers turned to consolidation as a means to avert financial ruin.From 2004 to 2010, three Pan-European groups emerged: Lufthansa of Germany absorbed Swiss International Airlines and Austrian Airlines; Air France merged with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines; and British Airways combined with Iberia and Vueling, a Spanish discount carrier, under the umbrella of I.A.G., a holding company based in Madrid.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Political pressure to maintain carriers — many of which are still partly state-owned — as separate brands within each group has limited the kinds of efficiency gains that would normally come with added scale.European regulators in Brussels have in some cases been wary of mergers seen as limiting consumer choice within national markets. That was the case when Ryanair made three hostile takeover attempts for Aer Lingus from 2006 to 2013, all of which were rejected by the European Commission.The consolidation that has occurred so far has delivered only limited returns to shareholders of at least two of Europe’s big airline groups: Air France-KLM and the Lufthansa group have struggled to rein in costs and reduce debt since their mergers. This year, they faced new hurdles in the form of crippling labor unrest, a weak international cargo market and lower-than-expected demand on important trans-Atlantic routes. Both are expected to report sharply lower operating profits for 2014.Preoccupation with getting their own financial houses in order has limited the role that either group has been able to play in further industry consolidation. Air France-KLM turned down a chance in 2013 to absorb the struggling flag carrier Alitalia, while Lufthansa ceded a money-losing British airline it owned, British Midland International, to I.A.G. in 2012 as it began a restructuring of its core German business.I.A.G. has faced similar challenges but has managed to increase its profit in the last two years on the strength of British Airways and its ability to leverage its dominant presence at Heathrow Airport near London, where it controls more than 51 percent of all available takeoff and landing slots.AdvertisementAnalysts said the group’s relative financial strength meant that it was likely to remain one of the drivers of further consolidation, though the near-term opportunities would most likely take the form of smaller deals like that for Aer Lingus. Although the Irish airline has only slightly more than 1 percent of the European market, it offers I.A.G. a chance to expand its trans-Atlantic business through the addition of a hub at Dublin Airport.Mr. Wober, an analyst, said future acquisition targets for the group could include Finnair, with which I.A.G. already has a trans-Atlantic joint venture that also includes American Airlines. Another, he said, might be TAP Portugal, for which the Portuguese government recently solicited bids for its two-thirds stake.“Mergers with smaller airlines would not make a huge difference to the overall level of concentration,” Mr. Wober said, “but over time, a number of these smaller deals could gradually change the landscape.”There is scope for modest consolidation, too, among Europe’s low-cost carriers, Mr. Wober said. He noted that Wizz Air, a privately owned budget airline based in Budapest that operates within Eastern Europe, had revived plans for an initial share sale amid the recent drop in oil prices. If Wizz Air does issue stock, it could draw takeover interest from the likes of Ryanair or easyJet, he said.Others said the failure of the major, full-service airline groups to keep pace with the growth of the big, low-cost carriers could mean that greater market concentration in Europe is ultimately achieved via attrition, rather than acquisition.“Consolidation can happen in several ways,” said James Halstead, a managing partner at Aviation Strategy. “It doesn’t have to be a capital consolidation. It could just be just one of some not growing fast enough so that they then become acquisition targets or are so loss-making that they are shut down or sold.”A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Aer Lingus Deal Could Spur Airline Consolidation in Europe’s Fragmented Market.
