The sale of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team to Steven Ballmer for $2 billion revealed just how valuable top-flight franchises had become, a person briefed on the board’s deliberations said previously.“After review, MSG’s board of directors believes that, while MSG has created significant shareholder value since it was established as a public company five years ago, separating MSG’s live sports and entertainment businesses from its media business now would further enhance the long-term value-creation potential of both businesses,” the company said in a statement on Friday.By splitting itself up, the company is betting that shareholders will appreciate having two investment choices. The sports and live entertainment business, which will be spun off to existing shareholders, is seen within the company as a producer of huge cash flow that could potentially support attractive dividend payouts.It will include the Knicks, the Rangers and the New York Liberty women’s pro basketball team, along with the company’s namesake arena and Radio City Music Hall. It will also include live shows like the Radio City Christmas Spectacular and the company’s stake in Fuse media.The remaining business will be made up of the company’s media operations, including MSG Network and MSG+, two lucrative regional sports networks. Madison Square Garden said that the two new companies would reach agreements to make sure that Knicks and Rangers continued to be broadcast on the networks.The corporate breakup is expected to be completed by the end of the year.JPMorgan Chase, LionTree Advisors and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell are advising Madison Square Garden in the split.Advertisement
