The stock sank to a three-year low of $108.38, registering its sharpest decline since the company’s well-publicized public listing in 2011. LinkedIn’s full-year revenue forecast of $3.60 billion to $3.65 billion was below the average analyst estimate of $3.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. “It’s not a great day to have reported tough guidance,” said Randle Reece, an analyst with Avondale Partners. “The mediocre employment report from the Labor Department just amplified the reaction of anything employment-sensitive today.”Advertisement
