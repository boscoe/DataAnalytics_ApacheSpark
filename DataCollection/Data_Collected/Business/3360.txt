TOKYO —  Takata, the Japanese car parts supplier embroiled in a crisis over dangerously defective airbags, added $50 million on Thursday to its loss forecast for its fiscal year, saying that it was facing growing costs to replace faulty components in millions of affected vehicles.The company said it expected a net loss of 31 billion yen, or about $264 million, in the business year ending in March. The loss estimate has grown by about 25 percent since November, when Takata warned it would probably lose ¥25 billion for the year.Takata said its losses through the first three quarters of its fiscal year amounted to ¥32.5 billion. That was slightly larger than its predicted loss for the full year. In effect, it was calculating that it would not need to add new reserves in the final quarter, and it would instead earn a small profit that would partly offset the losses it had incurred so far.Since Takata’s last profit warning, the scale of the safety problem has grown to include some 18 million vehicles in the United States alone, and several million more worldwide. Honda Motor, Takata’s largest customer, last week widened its own loss forecast for the year by $400 million to reflect the expanding cost of the recalls.AdvertisementSix deaths have been linked to ruptured Takata airbags, five of them in the United States. The most recent estimate of injuries in the United States, issued late last month, put the number as high as 64.AdvertisementSome airbag inflaters made by Takata can burst when they deploy, sending metal fragments shooting into the cabin toward the car’s occupants.

The company has set aside ¥50 billion to cover recall-related costs — it added ¥3 billion to the reserve fund in the latest quarter — and is stepping up production of replacement inflaters at factories in China, Germany and Mexico. But lawsuits could deal additional blows to the company, and carmakers like Honda may seek to reclaim some of their costs from Takata.In its financial statement on Thursday, Takata only said, “Depending on further developments, our financial results and our cash flow may be affected.”Takata offered little new information about its efforts to address the airbag problem. It did not hold an earnings briefing for reporters, continuing a pattern of keeping its most senior Japanese executives largely out of sight.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Takada is a grandson of Takata’s founder.Several executives, but not Mr. Takada, attended a news conference after the company’s last financial report in November, at which they apologized for causing “great inconvenience and concern to the cars’ drivers, automakers, shareholders and others.”Members of the senior management have taken pay cuts, and the company has suspended dividend payments to investors, the first time it has done so since it went public in 2006. Takata’s share price fell by half last year. The company’s announcement came after the close of the Japanese stock market on Thursday, when Takata’s share price rose 1.2 percent.Some carmakers, including Honda, are said to be looking to other suppliers to fill new orders that would normally have gone to Takata, according to industry experts and reports in the Japanese news media, delivering another setback to Takata’s business.A group of 10 automakers led by Toyota Motor is organizing an industrywide investigation into the airbag problems. The inquiry is expected to involve a panel of outside engineering experts and former United States safety regulators.A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Takata, Maker of Faulty Airbags, Expects Wider Loss.
