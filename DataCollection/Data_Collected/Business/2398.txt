Shares of the company, which warned last month that it might file for bankruptcy protection if it failed to meet immediate liquidity needs, more than doubled on Wednesday to about 13 cents. Teenage apparel retailers like Wet Seal have been struggling as consumers switch to fast-fashion brands like H&M, Forever 21 and Zara, which bring the latest styles from the runway to their stores within weeks. Wet Seal, which has reported slowing year-on-year sales growth for the last five quarters, said the closures followed a failure to renegotiate meaningful concessions from landlords. The company said the stores it was closing accounted for about 48 percent of its net sales in the nine months to Nov. 1. A year ago, Wet Seal had 7,413 full- and part-time employees. The closures will result in pretax charges of $5.4 million to $6.4 million, the company said. Advertisement
