The second-quarter profit for Baidu, China’s biggest Internet search company, fell short of analysts’ estimates as the company spent heavily to diversify away from its core search advertising business, which is becoming less profitable and more competitive. Baidu’s shares declined more than 8 percent in extended trading on Monday. The company said last month that it would invest $3.2 billion in “online to offline” services, in which mobile users are linked to nearby offline services like buying movie tickets. Baidu forecast that revenue for the third quarter would rise 34.4 to 37.4 percent to a range of 18.17 billion renminbi ($2.93 billion) to 18.58 billion renminbi, short of analysts’ average estimate of 18.79 billion renminbi, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Baidu rose 3.2 percent, to 3.66 billion renminbi. On a per share basis, Baidu earned 10.19 renminbi per American depositary share, well short of expectations of 10.58 renminbi.A version of this brief appears in print on July 28, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Baidu Profit Up 3.2 Percent, but Below Analysts’ Forecasts.
