Wenner in 1967, says the partnership is intended to help the magazine expand into new markets and bolster its brand internationally.“We really were looking for a strategic partner,” Mr. Wenner’s son Gus, who is currently the head of digital for Wenner Media, said in an interview. “This was kind of as strategic as I could possibly find because we have a shared vision and they’re going to be extraordinarily additive as we continue to evolve and transform our business.”He added: “This is purely a move and a partnership that is aimed at setting ourselves up with a plan and a strategy to be successful.”As part of the deal, which was announced on Sunday, terms of which were not disclosed, the two companies will form a wholly owned subsidiary called Rolling Stone International that Mr. Kuok will lead from Singapore.The investment, however, comes as Wenner Media, which also publishes Us Weekly and Men’s Journal, faces significant challenges that have raised questions about the fate of the company and Rolling Stone, in particular.Rolling Stone has been battling several lawsuits in connection with an article published two years ago about what it said was a gang rape at a fraternity at the University of Virginia. The magazine later retracted the article, “A Rape on Campus,” but pending litigation looms, along with any potential damages.Last week, a judge ruled that one of the lawsuits, filed in Virginia by Nicole P. Eramo, the associate dean of students at the university, could proceed to a jury trial, which is set to begin in mid-October.The company also faces a separate lawsuit, filed by the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity against Rolling Stone and Wenner Media, which is in the early phase of discovery. Another suit, filed by three former fraternity members, was dismissed in June.Wenner Media also carries significant debt, which will be due in the coming years.Gus Wenner, 26, who some in the media industry speculate will soon take over for his father at the company, said there were no plans to discontinue the print version of Rolling Stone. (He declined to comment on whether he would replace his father.) But he said the emphasis was on continuing to expand the magazine’s presence online.Its digital audience has increased; digital revenue, he said, has risen 90 percent in the last two to three years.“I think it’s paramount for us to diversify the areas of business that we’re in and not just be reliant on the publishing business, which is pretty volatile right now,” he said. “The strategy to move forward and to evolve obviously doesn’t involve investing in print and doubling down in that area, but it’s an important part of who we are.”Advertisement
