A coalition of 10 news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and NBCUniversal, has formed a partnership with Virginia Tech to test drones for news gathering, the companies said on Thursday.The partnership, the companies said in a statement, is “designed to conduct controlled safety testing of a series of real-life scenarios where the news media could use small U.A.S. technology to gather the news.” The college is one of six sites designated by the Federal Aviation Administration for testing of unmanned aircraft systems, or U.A.S.The other members of the coalition are Advance Publications, A. H. Belo, The Associated Press, Gannett, Getty Images, E.W. Scripps Company and Sinclair Broadcast Group.Drones are now soaring beyond their practical and recreational uses and are landing firmly in the hands of troublemakers and pranksters.Unmanned aircraft systems, said Rose Mooney, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership at Virginia Tech, “can provide this industry a safe, efficient, timely and affordable way to gather and disseminate information and keep journalists out of harm’s way.”AdvertisementDrones have long been coveted by news organizations for their potential to transform news gathering in dangerous situations, such as natural disasters, and to offer the organizations a vantage point that they would not normally get without expensive helicopters or planes.But, citing safety concerns, the F.A.A. has granted only limited permission for drone flights while it writes suitable regulations.AdvertisementThis week, CNN announced that it had also been cleared to test drones for news gathering.A version of this article appears in print on January 16, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Times and Other News Organizations to Test Use of Drones.
