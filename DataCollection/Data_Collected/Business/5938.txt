Still, the likelihood of an imminent deal with the leftist government in Athens continued to look remote.The squeeze is tightening on Greece, and uncertainty about the country’s economy led European Union officials last week to sharply pare back its growth prospects.Greece, it seems, still has enough money to meet the Tuesday deadline for repayment of 750 million euros (about $840 million) to the International Monetary Fund. The country’s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, indicated last week that Greece would make the payment.But most analysts said that Greece could soon face acute difficulties paying government salaries.And they said it stood almost no chance of making far larger debt repayments in the coming months without tapping funds worth €7.2 billion from its rescue program and negotiating a third bailout package.Greece had been expected to have reached a deal by now with its international creditors after a preliminary agreement in February granted the country the opportunity to suggest adjustments to its loathed austerity program.Instead, the wearying standoff looks set to continue as European lenders hold back on disbursements of rescue aid while the government in Athens, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, resists far-reaching reforms in areas like pensions, labor and taxation.Officials late last week played down the chances of a swift resolution of the crisis. But they also said talks between Athens and its international lenders did appear to be going more smoothly.“The organization and structure of the talks has improved compared to what it was before,” said a eurozone official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He was referring to negotiations among technical staff from international lenders and Athens.“We are, of course, still quite some way away from a situation where you could describe that as a final agreement being well in sight,” the official added.An agreement between Athens and its lenders needs to be reached by the beginning of June because then “it starts getting very, very, very tight,” said the official, who apparently was referring to the time needed to win political agreement for a deal before a possible Greek default.Any statement by ministers after the meeting on Monday will probably be “anodyne” and “not very exciting,” the official said.The ministers, the official said, will probably “take stock of the situation” and call on negotiators “to keep on working."Advertisement
