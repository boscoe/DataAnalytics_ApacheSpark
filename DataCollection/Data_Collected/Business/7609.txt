On Wednesday, an official of Amnesty International testifying at a Senate subcommittee hearing on the FIFA corruption scandal said such companies had an obligation to address the conditions faced by such workers, which reports have described as akin to indentured servitude.The settlement was unusual because when a company files for bankruptcy, litigation against it freezes and the litigants stand behind secured creditors when it comes to receiving proceeds. But Signal officials and plaintiffs’ lawyers negotiated the settlement as part of the bankruptcy filing.“This agreement will ensure some compensation for these workers, who only sought a better life when they took these jobs,” said Alan Howard, a lawyer at Crowell & Moring involved in the case.The lawsuit against Signal, which is based in Mobile, Ala., was initially brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center and was later joined by lawyers working on a pro bono basis from about 10 major law firms including Crowell & Moring; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; and McDermott, Will & Emory.The Signal case began in 2008 after hundreds of laborers from India arrived to work at the company’s facilities in Pascagoula, Miss., and Orange, Tex. The company builds and repairs oil-drilling rigs and ships.The metal fitters and welders said they had paid over $20,000 to a labor recruiter in India to get jobs, and to an American company and lawyer who said they would obtain permanent visas, known as green cards, for them.But the workers, who came into the United States under a temporary visa program, soon realized they were misled, and found themselves housed in squalid conditions for which Signal charged them over $1,000 a month.In 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the Indian workers against Signal and others. The case almost came to an end when a federal judge refused to allow it to go forward as a class action, but the big law firms salvaged it by agreeing to represent individual workers on a pro bono basis, said Daniel Werner, a lawyer at the Southern Poverty Law Center.In bankruptcy court papers, Signal said it was facing 11 lawsuits involving 227 foreign workers. Of the $15 million awarded by the jury, $11 million was assessed against Signal and that award was upheld in May.In its filing, Signal said the settlement plan, which a judge must still approve, covered “the vast majority” of Indian workers bringing actions, adding that it anticipated more laborers would join into it.OpinionAdvertisement
