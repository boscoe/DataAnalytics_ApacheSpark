That was lower than Wall Street estimates, and the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual sales rate dropped below 17 million for the first time this year.Sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles continued to account for most of the gains, while passenger cars lagged behind. And despite the introduction of a new Prius hybrid from Toyota, there was little improvement in overall sales of electrified models.“The segment has been pretty soft over all, and we expect to see that continue this year,” Mr. Gutierrez said.Electric cars and hybrid models, which are powered by both a gasoline engine and a battery, are critical to nearly every automaker’s efforts to improve their overall fleetwide fuel economy to meet a new federal standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. And meeting the goals has become even more important in the wake of the Paris climate accord last year, which mandated significant reductions in carbon emissions.Despite the lukewarm acceptance of electrified vehicles so far by consumers, environmental groups are praising the impact that the relatively small sales have had already.A report released this week by the Union of Concerned Scientists shows, for example, that about 200,000 electric cars have been sold in California to date, which has reduced annual gasoline consumption in the state by 56 million gallons.“New models like G.M.’s Bolt, Tesla’s Model 3 and the new plug-in Prius Prime should keep the number of electric vehicles growing,” said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer with the scientists group.Trends in the marketplace, however, are working against electrified models. With fuel prices still hovering at about $2 a gallon, many consumers are choosing larger vehicles that are more affordable to own when gas is cheap.And with automakers also improving the mileage of their existing compact cars and small sport utility vehicles, many buyers are meeting their fuel-economy needs with conventional, gas-powered models instead of electrified ones.Still, the Tesla’s introduction is a sign that latent demand for electric cars could translate into big sales in the showroom down the road.Mr. Musk said Tesla was preparing for a surge in demand by adding dealerships, prepping its California assembly plant to build as many as 500,000 electric cars a year, and building a new factory in Nevada to produce batteries.As far as the Model 3 is concerned, Mr. Musk was characteristically confident of its ability to compete with any car — electric or not — on the market. “You will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000,” he said.For the most part, industry executives say that lower prices and greater driving range are the key factors in jump-starting the electric market.Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of the Japanese automaker Nissan and the French carmaker Renault, said recently that the electric segment needed a wider and more diverse array of models to interest a larger audience of potential buyers.Nissan has had limited success with the all-electric Leaf, but growth is a “step by step” process, Mr. Ghosn said last month at the New York International Auto Show.“We’re not in it so much to showcase technology,” he said. “Our main driver is going to be the mass market for electric cars.”Advertisement
