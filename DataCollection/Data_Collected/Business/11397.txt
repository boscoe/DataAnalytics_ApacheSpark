But they begin only with admission as a member, meaning that actors, directors, executives and others receive no credit for the films on which they may have worked before joining, often in midcareer.The guidelines made public on Monday were released in a “frequently asked questions” format, and were intended to address the issues raised by the academy’s announcement on Friday that it was instituting radical reforms to its voting requirements, recruiting process and governing structure. The changes are meant to promote increased diversity of its membership.On Friday, the academy had said its board of governors had agreed to withdraw Oscar voting rights from members who were found not to have been active in a 10-year period, not to have achieved a lifetime total of 30 years’ work in the film business or not to have personally won or have been nominated for an Academy Award.Those general rules, and a plan to add new members and officials with a specific eye toward doubling the number of women and ethnic minorities in the group, aimed to quell an uproar over its selection of all-white roster of nominees in the acting categories for two consecutive years.But the plan instantly prompted a protest among some existing members, who were angered at being deprived of long-held voting rights or simply could not tell whether or not the new standards would cut them out.While it is now clear that all members will maintain voting rights if they have worked on a single film in the last 10 years — and one film each 10 years counts toward lifetime status — there are other points that may affect many members.Under the guidelines, for instance, qualifying work must be done on “the same kinds of quality films that got you into the academy in the first place” — a somewhat subjective standard that will be enforced by peer review and will be subject to appeal, according to the group’s disclosure on Monday.That would appear to set a variable standard for maintaining admission, since many older members — some better known for later television careers than for their film work — were admitted based on their work in movies that would most likely not qualify them for acceptance today. Apparently, those who were admitted under a lower standard may carry that standard with them.Clarifying another much-debated point, the academy said that members need not work only within the craft that brought them into the group to satisfy the voting requirements. For instance, an actor who gets no acting jobs in a 10-year period, but produces or directs a film, can count that work toward the voting requirement.Addressing a question of particular concern to producers, directors and writers — all of whom may work for years on a project that never reaches the screen — the academy said that actual screen credit is not required to secure voting rights.“Achievement is achievement, regardless of whether or not there is a screen credit,” the group said, in reference to those who work steadily but without credit. In its Monday disclosures, the academy also repeated an earlier promise that those who move to emeritus status will not pay dues and will still be included in screenings and other group programs.The academy’s statement acknowledged that it did not control the distribution of “screeners,” a coveted perk that could be withheld from those who have no voting rights. But the group promised that it would ask members who run production companies “not to make an issue” of voting rights in distributing screeners.Those who move to emeritus status can regain their voting rights by returning to work after a review process, the academy said.As for the expected recruitment program, which will replace those who lose voting rights with a more diverse membership, the academy said: “We are not lowering any standards, we’re widening our net.”Advertisement
