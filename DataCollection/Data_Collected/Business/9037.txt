The Dolan family, who have agreed to sell Cablevision to Altice of France for some $17 billion, including debt, have been a lightning rod for many in New York City and Long Island. There is its management of the New York Knicks and Rangers, as well as its stewardship of the cable company.Yet at least one group will have positive things to say about the family: Cablevision shareholders.That can be measured in a couple of different ways. On a basic level, there’s stock price. Since going public in 1986, the cable company’s shares has grown about 806 percent.That’s pretty healthy, although it trails both the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the stock performance of its rival Comcast over the same period.But a significant portion of the equity value that the Dolans have created over the years was by spinning off AMC Networks and the Madison Square Garden Company, which holds the Knicks and the Rangers, in 2010.So, were one to calculate the total return on a share of Cablevision from, say, Oct. 16, 1995, when James Dolan took over the company, that would be about 654 percent. (That includes distributions from Cablevision itself and from AMC and Madison Square Garden.)By contrast, the S.&P. 500 returned about 211 percent during that same time, adjusting for inflation.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
