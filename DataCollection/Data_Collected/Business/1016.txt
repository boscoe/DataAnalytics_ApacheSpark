The European Union’s farm federation said on Wednesday that the quality and yields of the harvest were good, and that production rose 2.7 percent to 171.2 million hectoliters (more than 4.5 billion gallons). “This year, we can easily call it a benchmark year,” said Thierry Coste, the chairman of Copa-Cogeca wine division. “Quality will be very good, and when it comes to price there is no reason for price volatility.” Italy had a 12 percent increase in volume to reach 50.3 million hectoliters. In comparison, the United States had an estimated level of production of 22.1 million hectoliters, with Argentina, Chile and Australia around 12.5 million hectoliters. Advertisement
