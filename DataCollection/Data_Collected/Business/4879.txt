The Simon Property Group withdrew its $23.2 billion offer to acquire the Macerich Company after the rival mall operator’s board rejected an unsolicited bid.In rejecting the latest offer, Macerich said that its directors, after reviewing the revised proposal with its advisers, felt the sweetened bid “continues to substantially undervalue” the company.Macerich showed little interest in an alliance with Simon and adopted measures to make a takeover much more difficult, including a shareholder-rights plan, often referred to as a poison pill.Simon, the largest mall operator in the United States, had previously threatened to withdraw its “best and final offer” if Macerich did not agree to meet to negotiate by the close of business on Wednesday.AdvertisementMacerich, which has headquarters in California but is incorporated in Maryland, is the third-largest mall operator in the United States.AdvertisementIn a news release late on Tuesday, Simon said Macerich chose not to “engage in discussions.”“Our board carefully reviewed Simon Property Group’s revised proposal and concluded that it does not reflect the full value of our company,” Arthur Coppola, the Macerich chairman and chief executive, said in a news release.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That was up from its first offer of $91 a share, which Macerich also rejected.Shares of Macerich closed down 2.3 percent at $84.33 in New York on Tuesday.Simon, based in Indianapolis, announced its initial takeover approach on March 9, which was privately rejected by Macerich. It had built a small stake in the company and expressed its interest in a takeover during a nomination period for Macerich board members.As part of its most recent offer, Simon said it would not nominate directors to Macerich’s board or otherwise try to prolong the takeover discussions.After the first unsolicited offer, Macerich moved quickly to make it more difficult for Simon to mount a hostile takeover attempt, including adopting the so-called poison-pill measure.“The board determined that pursuing such a transaction at this time is not in the best interests of the company, the company’s stockholders and other constituencies,” Mr. Coppola said in a letter to David E. Simon, the Simon chairman and chief executive, on Tuesday. “Our board believes that continuing to execute on our strategic plan will yield substantially more value for our stockholders.”A version of this article appears in print on April 2, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Mall Retreat.
