Copies of the letter were sent to executives and directors of the corporation’s parent, the Government Development Bank, which was the financial adviser on the bonds and directs much of the Puerto Rican government’s financial activity.“We hereby demand that P.F.C. take all actions necessary to collect,” said the executives, Richard A. Stein of OppenheimerFunds and Sheila Amoroso of Franklin Advisers.A spokeswoman for the Government Development Bank said, “We are in receipt of the letter, and it is currently under review.”Financial institutions that hold Puerto Rico’s debt have been questioning its intentions since late June, when the island’s governor, Alejandro García Padilla, announced that Puerto Rico was in “a death spiral,” and he had to negotiate a moratorium on its $72 billion in debt.He said the moratorium would give Puerto Rico time to make major structural changes in its economy and to restore growth after years of painful recession. Officials who represent bondholders have said repeatedly that they believe Puerto Rico has the resources to pay all of its debts and does not need to suspend the payments.The missed payment on Monday was Puerto Rico’s first since coming under United States jurisdiction in 1898. Of the island’s $72 billion total in outstanding bonds, the Public Finance Corporation has issued a little more than $1 billion, but they have special terms that Puerto Rico says have removed any legal obligation to pay.The bonds were issued as part of a financing process in which the Government Development Bank made loans to various government projects, then securitized the loan repayments as bonds issued by its subsidiary. The bond repayments are secured by annual appropriations of the Puerto Rico Legislature. Officials on the island say that if an appropriation is not made — and none were made this year — then there is no legal obligation to pay the bonds.The mutual fund executives disputed that. They said the law that allowed the bonds to be sold authorized Puerto Rico’s Treasury secretary to advance the money needed to pay interest and principal each year, rather than waiting for the Legislature to make the appropriation.“The Treasury secretary must now exercise that power,” they wrote. “Not only is this failure to pay unprecedented in modern times, it also violates the requirements of Puerto Rican law.”Advertisement
