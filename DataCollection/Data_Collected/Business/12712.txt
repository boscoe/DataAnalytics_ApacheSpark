As part of that bailout, the government received a so-called dividend access share, which gave it “enhanced rights” for dividends paid by the bank.By ending the dividend access share program, R.B.S., which is based in Edinburgh, moved one step closer to being able to resume dividend payments to its shareholders. The bank has not paid a dividend since 2008.R.B.S. is in the middle of a large restructuring as it shifts away from being a lender with global ambitions to focus on retail and corporate banking in Britain and Ireland. The lender announced plans last year to dismantle its global investment bank and to reduce the number of countries where it operates.It is a step forward for the lender as the government seeks to reduce its holdings in the bank. The government raised about £2.1 billion in its first sale of shares it held in R.B.S. in August.“This is another important milestone in our plan to resume capital distributions to our shareholders, and represents one less hurdle in our path to build the number one bank for customer service, trust and advocacy,” Ross McEwan, the R.B.S. chief executive, said in a news release.As part of an agreement to end the dividend access share program, R.B.S. made an initial payment of £320 million in 2014.The payment will be reflected in the bank’s first-quarter results.The bank has not posted a full-year profit since 2007, and its results continue to be dragged down by a series of legal and legacy issues.Advertisement
