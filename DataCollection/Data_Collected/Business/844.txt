N.A.B. plans to separate the investment businesses, leaving the MLC brand with the insurance arm, which it will be licensed to use for 10 years as a stand-alone operation.The deal follows an agreement last month by another Japanese firm, the Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company, to buy the British insurer Amlin for $5.3 billion. Japanese insurers have been snapping up companies overseas in recent years to diversify their revenue streams as the Japanese population ages.“Our wealth business has delivered significantly improved results since 2013, which has enabled us to secure the long term partnership we are announcing today with Nippon Life,” Andrew Thorburn, the chief executive of N.A.B, said in a news release. “This partnership will enable us to continue to deliver insurance solutions to our customers while improving wealth returns for shareholders.”He added that the bank would be investing 300 million Australian dollars in its wealth division over the next four years.The deal’s price-to-earnings ratio, or the amount paid per dollar of earnings, was about 19 times, based on earnings of about 160 million dollars. The bank said it anticipated a loss of about 1.1 billion dollars as a result of the sale, including the cost of the transaction.The deal is expected to be completed between September and December 2016, subject to regulatory approval.The announcement came with the release of the N.A.B.’s full-year earnings, in which it also confirmed its intention to sell its British operations. N.A.B. said it would sell about two-thirds of CYBG, the holding company of the British lender Clydesdale Bank, leaving the rest to be sold through an initial public offering, with the primary listing on the London Stock Exchange.Britain’s financial regulator fined Clydesdale Bank 20.7 million pounds, or $31.7 million, in April for failings in its process for handling complaints related to the wrongful selling of an insurance product. N.A.B.said British regulators had required it to set aside £1.7 billion for dealing with the insurance product problem and the cost of the merger, among other things.The divestments are part of a strategic overhaul as N.A.B. tries to focus on its business in Australia and New Zealand.Advertisement
