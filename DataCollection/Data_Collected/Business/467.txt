Buffett’s favorite banker.BDT has hired Jim Head, a co-chief of Morgan Stanley’s mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, as a partner, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday.Mr. Head will be the latest to join BDT, a combination of adviser and investor with a focus on advising some of the world’s wealthiest families. It was founded and is led by Byron D. Trott, a former rainmaker at Goldman Sachs whom Mr. Buffett has praised publicly — a rare display of affection by the billionaire for a banker.In recent years, BDT has advised on deals including the pending takeover of the insurer PartnerRe by Exor, the investment vehicle of the Agnelli family, and various takeovers by Germany’s Joh. A. Benckiser, including those of Peet’s Coffee & Tea and Caribou Coffee. BDT has also made a number of investments itself, taking stakes in the fashion company Tory Burch and in the barbecue grill maker Weber-Stephen.At Morgan Stanley, Mr. Head played a role in many big deals involving financial companies. He helped advise the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its response to the American International Group’s troubles during the financial crisis of 2008 and more recently worked on Cigna’s $48 billion sale to fellow insurer Anthem.He took over as co-chief of Americas M.&A. almost three years ago, alongside Robert Eatroff.Even as Mr. Head leaves, Morgan Stanley is still riding high in the business of advising on deals. The bank played significant roles in two huge situations announced this week: EMC’s $67 billion sale to Dell and SABMiller’s agreement in principle to sell itself to fellow beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev for $104 billion.News of Mr. Head’s departure was reported earlier by The Financial Times.Advertisement
