But the group said the van, the Renault Espace, which is not sold in the United States, adhered to pollution limits only when the motor was cold.When the motor was warm, as it would be during normal driving, the Renault emitted 13 to 25 times the permissible levels of nitrogen oxide, which has been linked to lung ailments, the organization said. It said the testing was conducted on its behalf by the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland.Renault did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Deutsche Umwelthilfe, based in Berlin, and other environmental groups have been pushing for more rigorous scrutiny of vehicle emissions, arguing that many manufacturers take advantage of flawed testing regulations in Europe to exceed pollution limits.So far, none of the accusations by the environmental group rival in scope the emissions cheating that Volkswagen has acknowledged, which involved 11 million vehicles, including about 500,000 in the United States.But the latest test data comes as European automakers apprehensively await the results of broader, official tests by the German agency that oversees motor vehicles. The agency, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, is testing diesel emissions of 50 vehicles, including Volkswagens and other brands sold in Europe, and it is expected to present its findings next month.The agency is testing vehicles in the lab and on the road. Environmental groups have contended that stationary testing in the lab was too easy for carmakers to game, leading to huge discrepancies between official results and pollution levels on the road.Last month, Deutsche Umwelthilfe released data that it said showed suspicious emissions data produced by an Opel van. The group did not accuse Opel, a unit of General Motors, of deliberately devising the car to deceive tests, but it presented results that it said were hard to explain.The group said that tests by the Bern University of Applied Sciences found that a diesel Opel Zafira van met European emission standards for nitrogen oxide only when the front-drive wheels were spinning, and that it exceeded them when all four wheels were turning — as would be the case during actual driving conditions.Opel said its own tests showed that the vehicle complied with European air quality rules. The company said none of its vehicles have software intended to detect when the cars are being tested and to then set emissions controls to provide the best results.Pierre Comte, deputy director of the emissions testing center at Bern, said the center stood by its test results for the Opel. “We measured what we measured,” he said by telephone last week.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Melissa Eddy from Berlin.Advertisement
