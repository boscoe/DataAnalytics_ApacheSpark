It is expected to seek to integrate Pirelli’s industrial tire business with assets of China National Tire and Rubber and with the Fengshen Tires Stock Company, doubling the volume of the business and expanding Pirelli’s business in Asia.China National Tire and Rubber also will choose a new leader of the board for Pirelli, and Mr. Tronchetti Provera will remain chief executive of the reorganized Pirelli, which will continue to be based in Italy. Mr. Tronchetti Provera will have the right to choose when to relist Pirelli.“The parties recognize the pivotal role of Pirelli’s current top management as a key factor for the ongoing success and growth of Pirelli and its business,” Camfin said in a news release. “In fact, the partnership is predicated on the continuation of Pirelli’s entrepreneurial and business culture.”The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close this summer. JPMorgan Chase has agreed to provide financing for the Pirelli acquisition.China National Tire & Rubber’s “approach to business and strategic vision guarantee Pirelli’s development and stability,” Mr. Tronchetti Provera said in a news release.China National Tire and Rubber was advised by Rothschild, ChemChina Finance Corporation and J.P. Morgan and the law firms Pedersoli e Associati Studio Legale, Clifford Chance and Jun He.Lazard and the law firms Chiomenti and Lombardi Molinari Segni advised Camfin, while Ligerion and the law firm Linklaters advised the Rosneft investment vehicle.Advertisement
