From India to South Korea, markets seem to be anticipating looser monetary policy to accommodate the resulting slowing of inflation.The imminence of further monetary easing in Europe and Japan builds a strong case for bond yields to drop further.But there is little sign yet of official rate cuts, particularly in markets like Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, where central banks were sounding aggressive or even raising rates into the final months of 2014.“The oil price has caught central banks by surprise,” said ING’s chief Asian economist, Tim Condon.“The panic of 2013 is right now foremost in their minds, and they are looking at a Fed rate hike, and so I think they will remain pretty dug in,” he added.The fear of a repeat of 2013’s “taper tantrum,” when talk of the Federal Reserve’s withdrawing monetary stimulus prompted vast sums of foreign capital to bail out of the region, helps explain why Asian central banks might err on the side of tighter monetary policy.But there are other factors that also suggest official policy will stay tighter than the bond markets imply.For one, a rising United States dollar is pushing down all emerging market currencies, which indirectly eases monetary conditions for Asian policy makers and creates pressure on them to keep interest rates up to prevent the flight of foreign cash.The market mismatch is evident in Indonesia, where the rupiah has fallen 9 percent against the dollar in the past six months.Ten-year Indonesian government bond yields, which are normally significantly higher than overnight policy rates to reflect the risk of holding bonds to term, are just 0.05 percentage point above the 7.75 percent policy rate, having fallen 0.6 percentage point since mid-December.One plausible scenario that could bring about a bond market tumble is a drastic improvement in United States growth numbers in the next couple months as a result of lower oil costs, leading to renewed optimism about global growth and an increase in Treasury bond yields.Far from cutting rates, policy makers might then have to raise rates.The odds of this high-growth scenario playing out are perhaps reflected in how well equity markets have held up despite worries about slowing inflation, patchy economic growth and the possibility that Greece could return to the emergency room.Despite a wobbly start to 2015, Asian shares are up 6 percent in the past three months.“We are apparently on the edge of deflation, and yet equity markets aren’t collapsing,” said the Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Claudio Piron. “And there are certain elements to what is going on which are reminiscent of the Asian financial crisis — oil prices falling, dollar strengthening, bonds rallying strongly — which all seems very ominous.”With the exception of Thailand, none of Asia’s central banks have explicitly spoken of the need for easier policy.Inflation has slowed sharply, except in Indonesia and Malaysia, where fuel subsidies were cut late last year.Although consumer price inflation in the Philippines is well below the central bank’s expected 3 percent average for the year, the rhetoric from policy makers suggests markets may hope for rates to be on hold.On the other hand, Indonesia’s inflation is running at nearly double the official forecast range for this year, thanks to a jump in domestic oil prices.Mr. Condon of ING does not expect any of Asia’s central banks to react in a hurry to either oil or slowing inflation, and instead says they might be prepared to tolerate lower inflation, just as the European Central Bank and Fed do.“There is some sort of asymmetry there. It’s O.K. to undershoot inflation; it’s prohibitive to overshoot. That, I think, will be the story in Asia as well,” he said.Some market participants recognize that bias, which is possibly why short-end yields in Asian bond markets have not moved much. But in longer-term yields, investors might read a warning that 2015 will hold more pain than gain. Advertisement
