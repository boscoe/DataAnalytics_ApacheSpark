The central bank said British consumer price inflation, which stands at zero, was unlikely to reach 1 percent until the spring of 2016, slightly later than forecast in August. “Although rising, increases in labor costs remain lower than would be consistent with meeting the inflation target in the medium term,” the bank said in a statement. Sterling fell against the dollar after the decision, and British bond prices rose slightly. Advertisement
