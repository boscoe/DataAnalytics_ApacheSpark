In a closely watched contest, the Defense Department late Wednesday awarded the Cerner Corporation a multibillion-dollar contract to digitize the health records of more than 9.5 million military personnel and beneficiaries.The contract, which is the first phase of a project that is estimated to cost $9 billion over its 18-year span, pitted a consortium that includes Cerner, based in Kansas City, Mo., against a team led by its main rival, Epic Systems.But even before a winner was announced, some observers were doubtful that the department could achieve its goal of seamlessly exchanging the medical records of its employees, retirees and families.One of the primary objectives is to allow the Defense Department and the Veterans Affairs Department to electronically transmit records to each other — a function they currently cannot do.Advertisement“If we allow the D.O.D. to put in a system that then can’t interconnect, that is not interoperable with other systems, that will be a big mistake,” said Representative Phil Roe, a Republican from Tennessee who is a physician and serves on the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “If we have to go to the appropriations committee and cut the money off and get them to slow down and reassure us that this won’t be a big mess, that’s what we’ll do.”AdvertisementIn recent years, hospitals and physicians’ offices across the country, spurred by a $30 billion incentive payment program included in the 2009 economic stimulus bill, have raced to meet deadlines for installing some sort of electronic health record. The goal was twofold: to reduce overall health care costs by eliminating unnecessary duplications of tests and to improve coordination of patient care.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Among the chief complaints have been that the costly systems are difficult to use and, in some cases, unable to share patient records with other systems.Cerner, an electronic health records vendor founded in 1979, teamed up with Accenture Federal Services and the military computing contractor Leidos for its bid.A competing vendor, AllScripts, and its team were also among the three finalists, but many believed Epic Systems to be the leading candidate. The privately held company, based in Verona, Wis., says it holds the health records of nearly half of the country, and many of the nation’s largest hospital systems, including Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles, the Yale New Haven Health System and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, use the vendor.For its bid, Epic joined with IBM.Cerner declined to discuss details of the contract. An Epic executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The first phase of the program, the Defense Healthcare Management System Modernization, involves a 10-year contract with a $4.3 billion cap that covers the first decade of services, according to the announcement.A version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Cerner Wins Bid to Redo Health Data.
