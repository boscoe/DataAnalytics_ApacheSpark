WASHINGTON —  Home resales rebounded strongly in September and new applications for unemployment benefits hovered around 42-year lows last week, suggesting solid domestic fundamentals even as the global economy falters.Thursday’s upbeat housing and labor market reports could keep the door open to an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve by the end of the year.“What you are seeing in the data is that the domestic picture looks strong, and I think that’s what the Fed is going to be looking at closely,” said Thomas Costerg, a United States economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York.The National Association of Realtors said home resales increased 4.7 percent last month, to an annual rate of 5.55 million units, almost erasing August’s decline.

A firming housing market is lifting household wealth, which is driving a robust pace of consumer spending. In turn, strong domestic demand has cushioned the blow to the economy from softening global growth, a strong dollar and weak capital spending in the energy industry.AdvertisementGrowth has also been squeezed by businesses’ efforts to reduce an inventory bulge, leaving growth estimates for the gross domestic product in the third quarter running below a 1.5 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent rate in the second quarter.AdvertisementHousing remains constrained by a dearth of properties available for sale. But rising house prices could encourage homeowners to put their properties on the market.The median price for a previously owned home rose 6.1 percent from September 2014. Realtors and economists say insufficient equity has contributed to the tight housing inventories.The unsold inventory of houses on the market fell 2.6 percent in September from August. At September’s sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.1 months in August. A six-month stock is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The housing index fell 0.43 percent, underperforming a generally stronger stock market. Shares in D. R. Horton, the largest United States home builder, declined 1.21 percent. Lennar slipped 0.48 percent.The dollar rallied against the euro on the data and dovish comments from the European Central Bank. Prices for longer-dated United States government bonds fell.In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state jobless benefits rose 3,000, to a seasonally adjusted 259,000, for the week that ended Oct. 17.Still, they remained not too far from levels last seen in late 1973, and it was the 33rd consecutive week that claims were below the 300,000 threshold, which is normally associated with a firming job market.AdvertisementAt current levels, there is not much room for claims to fall further. Additionally, the very low level of layoffs suggests that the labor market remains in good shape, despite a recent abrupt slowdown in job growth.

“These data signal that companies remain extremely unwilling to let go of labor and that the number of short-term unemployed remains very low,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The four-week moving average of claims, which is considered a better measure of labor market trends because it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 2,000 last week to 263,250, the lowest level since December 1973.The claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of October’s unemployment report. The four-week moving average of claims fell 9,250 between the September and October survey periods. That suggested a pickup in job gains this month.The four-week moving average of continuing claims was the lowest since late 2000, suggesting a further decline in the unemployment rate from 5.1 percent in September.“With August and September being notorious for initially underreporting job gains, today’s data add to the case that employment growth will pick up in October and the unemployment rate will continue to grind lower,” Mr. Ryding said.A version of this article appears in print on October 23, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Upbeat News in Jobs Data and Rate of Home Resales.
