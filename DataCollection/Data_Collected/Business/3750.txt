FRANKFURT — The European Central Bank made less profit in 2014 than a year earlier, as it charged banks lower interest rates for loans and spent money setting up a bank supervisory arm.The central bank said on Thursday that its net profit for 2014 was 989 million euros, or nearly $1.13 billion, compared with €1.44 billion in 2013. The profit is distributed to national central banks of the 19 members of the eurozone, which typically pass it on to their governments.Like all central banks, the institution serves as lender of last resort for commercial banks that have trouble raising money from other sources, and it charges interest on those loans. The amount of interest it earned in 2014 declined to €126 million from €406 million a year earlier, as the central bank cut its main lending rate to a record low of 0.05 percent in September. The rate was 0.25 percent when the year began.The European Central Bank earned €728 million from its holdings of eurozone government bonds that were bought as part of an earlier program aimed at keeping down market borrowing rates for countries like Greece and Italy. That was down from €962 million in 2013.AdvertisementNext month, the central bank will begin buying €60 billion a month in eurozone government bonds and other debt as part of a so-called quantitative easing program. In contrast with the earlier bond-buying program, which aimed to help specific countries and ran from 2010 to 2012, the new measures will include buying debt from around the eurozone to pump money into the economy and stimulate growth.AdvertisementThe new bond buying is part of an attempt by the European Central Bank to strengthen its balance sheet, a measure of the amount of stimulus in the economy, by about €1 trillion. The balance sheet, including funds allocated to the so-called Eurosystem network of central banks in the eurozone, was €2.2 trillion at the end of 2014, down from €2.3 trillion a year earlier.The European Central Bank has faced criticism for allowing its balance sheet to weaken when the eurozone economy is sluggish and inflation has declined to levels considered toxic for growth.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Greek bonds accounted for €18 billion.The European Central Bank began buying Greek government bonds in 2010, provoking an outcry in Germany because the bonds were seen as a financial risk for the rest of the eurozone. But so far they have been a profitable investment, earning €298 million in 2014, down from €437 million in 2013. The revenue has fallen as bonds bought by the central bank have matured.The central bank also said on Thursday that its president, Mario Draghi, was paid about €380,000 in 2014, slightly more than in 2013. The other five members of the central bank’s executive board each earned salaries of €271,000.The central bank’s net profit was cut in part by the costs of hiring new workers and other expenses, estimated at €300 million, related to its new role overseeing eurozone banks.In the future, commercial banks will pay fees to cover the cost of being regulated, but in 2014 they were charged only €30 million. The central bank decided not to charge banks start-up costs because they already had huge expenses related to a review of their assets.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
