Stocks rallied in the United States and overseas Monday after last week’s gloomy jobs report led investors to expect that the Federal Reserve will wait even longer before making its first interest rate increase since the financial crisis.Energy stocks rose along with the price of oil, and General Electric pushed industrial stocks higher.On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 304.06 points, or 1.9 percent, to 16,776.43. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 35.69 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,987.05, and the Nasdaq rose 73.49 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,781.26.It was the fifth straight day of gains for the S.&P. 500, a reversal of the five consecutive losses for the index right before the rally began.AdvertisementMonday’s rally was a continuation of a surge that began Friday, when the Labor Department said United States employers created only 142,000 jobs in September, far less than expected.AdvertisementLast week’s jobs report is being taken as positive by investors who want the Fed to postpone raising interest rates. Ultralow interest rates in place since 2008 have helped drive stock prices higher. The Fed next meets at the end of this month and again in late December.“It seems clear that investors have decided that the Federal Reserve cannot raise rates at its October meeting and probably cannot raise rates for longer than that,” said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.
