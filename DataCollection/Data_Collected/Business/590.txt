Some restaurants are turning sanctions into an opportunity to celebrate traditional food.Before the ruble started to collapse late last year, Natalya Tuktarova ran a European-style gastro pub in downtown Moscow. It specialized in tart flambés and Italian wines.Then came Western sanctions and Vladimir V. Putin’s retaliatory ban on food imports from Europe and the United States. Foreign alcohol prices surged, food prices doubled and fewer Muscovites were eating out. The combination hit Moscow’s restaurants particularly hard. Many restaurants, including Ms. Tuktarova’s, were forced to close or get creative.“If life gives us a lemon, we try to make make lemonade out of it,” says Ms. Tuktarova. She started a business that was more resistant to sanctions: an online pastry shop. Russian-made confectionary essentials like flour and eggs are easily available, unlike imported restaurant ingredients like Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese or Norwegian salmon.“Import substitute is a bad joke,” says Alexander Ilyin, a restaurant critic at the Afisha, a popular lifestyle magazine in Moscow. “The beef from Bryansk is not the beef from Texas. You don’t need to lie to yourself.”A homegrown food trend is taking hold and helping restaurants that cater to a new appetite for patriotism.
