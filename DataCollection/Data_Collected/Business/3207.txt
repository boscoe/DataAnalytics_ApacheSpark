Eighteen years after regulators shot down a merger between Staples and Office Depot, the two big office supply retailers may try to join forces once again.The companies are in advanced talks about a deal in which Staples would acquire Office Depot, uniting two of the biggest names in the world of pens, paper clips and yes, staples, people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.A deal could be announced as early as this week, but the people with knowledge of the matter cautioned that talks were continuing and could still fall apart.Shares of Staples, which has a market value of more than $12 billion, rose 11 percent in trading on Tuesday. Shares of Office Depot, with a market value of about $5 billion, rose 22 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported late Monday that the companies were in talks.Pressure for a combination of the two companies has come from Starboard Value, the activist hedge fund, which owns about 10 percent of Office Depot and 6 percent of Staples.Starboard Value has publicly called on the companies to merge to better compete against the likes of Walmart and Amazon.com. Analysts have also espoused the merits of a deal, contending that a combined company would be able to cut costs while having increased size to compete with rivals.Last month, Starboard stepped up its pressure on the companies to consider a combination. The strong performance of Staples’ stock price, it said, gave it a rich currency that could make an acquisition of Office Depot relatively easy.“This merger makes too much sense to ignore,” the hedge fund wrote in a letter to Staples last month. “It is time for you to take action — engage advisers and work expeditiously with Office Depot to consummate a transaction.”If the company did not pursue a merger, the hedge fund hinted in its public letters that it might wage a proxy fight to unseat Staples’ leadership.But while Starboard and analysts may like the looks of a merger between Staples and Office Depot, such a deal is likely to draw close scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who previously moved to block a merger of the two in 1997.Staples and Office Depot are the two biggest chains focused exclusively on office supplies, and regulators could make the case that a combined company would control too much of the market.However, the competition has changed since 1997. Walmart, Target and other big-box retailers compete in brick-and-mortar stores, while Amazon and other e-commerce companies vie for online sales.Recently, regulators appeared to acknowledge that the shift had made consolidation in the industry easier to stomach.In 2013, Office Depot acquired OfficeMax. In unanimously approving that deal, the Federal Trade Commission acknowledged that the rise of alternative sources for printer paper and other supplies, a range that includes Costco, Target and online rivals, had altered the competitive landscape.The commission concluded that the combination of Office Depot and OfficeMax was “unlikely to substantially lessen competition in the retail sale of consumable office supplies.”Together, Staples and Office Depot would operate about 4,400 stores and would report combined annual sales of about $34 billion.Should a deal be announced, it would be another victory for Starboard, which last year successfully ousted the board of Darden Restaurants, the parent of the Olive Garden chain. Starboard had also been agitating Yahoo to spin off its stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which the company announced it would do last month.Representatives for Staples and Office Depot declined to comment.A version of this article appears in print on 02/04/2015, on page B9 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Staples Said to Be in Talks to Acquire Office Depot.
