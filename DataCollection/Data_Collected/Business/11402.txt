Sprint is eliminating more jobs as it seeks to cut costs and turn around its business. A company spokesman, Dave Tovar, says Sprint, the country’s No. 4 wireless service provider, has cut about 2,500 jobs since last fall, or about 8 percent of its work force. Last week, it notified employees at six customer service centers around the country that it would be closing those locations or reducing the staff there. Sprint cut 2,000 jobs in 2014.A version of this brief appears in print on January 26, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Sprint Lays Off More Workers as It Pursues a Turnaround .
