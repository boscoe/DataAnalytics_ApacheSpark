AdvertisementSupported byBy Landon Thomas Jr.The Blackstone Group on Thursday reported a loss for the third quarter as volatile markets took a toll on the private equity giant’s many investment stakes in companies and real estate holdings.Economic net income, the firm’s core profitability measure, showed a loss of $416 million in contrast to a profit of $758 million a year earlier.This figure reflects unrealized losses in the value of its corporate and real estate investments.The core of Blackstone’s profits have always been the rich performance fees that the firm charges its clients when it unloads a large position in a company or a real estate property.The firm had its best year in 2014, when it recorded more than $4 billion in profit, driven largely by the performance fees it earned from selling its investments into booming markets.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.And while the firm, under its never-satisfied chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, has made strides toward building up more consistent, fee-driven businesses, its results this quarter are a reminder of how volatile the Blackstone model can still be.“Despite declines in the public markets that affected our economic net income, underlying trends in our businesses and our portfolio companies remain favorable, which is what drives value ultimately,” Mr. Schwarzman said in a statement.On a conference call with investors, Mr. Schwarzman was his usual feisty self when responding to skeptics who have said that Blackstone is too reliant on no-longer-booming markets to drive profits.“The perception that our cupboard will run dry is misplaced,” he said. “Some of you still believe it. You are wrong.”Earlier, Mr. Schwarzman noted that the firm had accumulated $97 billion in so-called dry powder, which it would be able to use to take advantage of investment opportunities in distressed markets.The tough quarter does not seem to have hampered the firm’s ability to draw in new capital. Assets under management grew to $333.9 billion, up from $284 billion a year earlier. Bringing in new cash is crucial as the management fees that Blackstone levies on this pool of money — much of which is locked up for as long as 10 years — serves as a buffer against the wilder swings of its performance fees.For example, in the third quarter, while performance fees suffered, revenue fees were up 7 percent for the year at $707.8 million.The bulk of the losses were in the firm’s private equity unit. Real estate and the firm’s smaller credit and hedge fund units eked out small profits for the quarter.In another sign of Blackstone’s push to diversify, the firm’s landlord lending subsidiary, B2R Finance, announced on Thursday that it had renamed its holding company Lending.com, as part of a move to broaden its offering to loans to consumers and small businesses.The mainstay of the firm’s operation will continue to be lending money to landlords seeking financing to buy homes to operate them as rental properties.To date, the firm has provided about $1 billion in loans to small to midsize landlords. But the strategy shift is part of a broader move by private equity firms and other nonbank finance firms into terrain that was traditionally one dominated by community and regional banks.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement
