An Alabama agency that had been helping with an investigation into whether Harper Lee, 88 and infirm, was manipulated into agreeing to publish a second novel this summer said on Thursday that it had ended its role in the inquiry.Joseph Borg, the director of the Alabama Securities Commission, which, among other things, tries to prevent financial fraud of the elderly, said his investigators had interviewed Ms. Lee and found “she has opinions and seems to be aware of what is going on with her book and the book deal.” As a result, he said, his team had closed its part of the investigation.Investigators conducting the larger inquiry for the Alabama Department of Human Resources continued their work this week and on Wednesday spoke by phone with the Rev. Thomas Butts, who has known Ms. Lee for many years and had been the pastor of her church.A spokesman for the department, Barry Spear, declined to commentSome of Ms. Lee’s friends and acquaintances in her hometown, Monroeville, and in other places have questioned whether Ms. Lee, who has severe hearing and vision problems, is lucid enough to have consented to the book deal. But other friends have joined Ms. Lee’s lawyer and her publisher, HarperCollins, in saying that Ms. Lee is alert and excited about the book, “Go Set a Watchman.”A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Agency Ends Its Portion of Inquiry in Lee Novel.
