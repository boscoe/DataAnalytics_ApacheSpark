The changes include the so-called ring-fencing of its retail operations in Britain.The lender said that its expected return on equity from its core business would be 11 percent in 2016, down from prior forecasts of more than 12 percent.On Thursday, the lender also reported third-quarter results that were weaker than expected by analysts, sending its shares down more than 5 percent by noon in London trading.The results came a day after Barclays announced that James E. Staley, a former senior investment banker at JPMorgan Chase who is now a managing partner at a hedge fund, would join the bank as its chief executive in December.Mr. Staley will replace Antony Jenkins, who was ousted this summer after directors lost faith in his ability to improve shareholder returns.“As we align Barclays around our three priorities — focus on core (segments and markets), generating shareholder value, and instilling a high-performance culture with strong ethical values — we now have a forward agenda that has been discussed and agreed with Mr. Staley,” John McFarlane, the Barclays chairman, said in a news release on Thursday.To meet coming regulatory requirements, Barclays plans to create a separate holding company for its business in the United States. It will also be required to shield its retail banking operations in Britain from its investment bank and other riskier operations under rules to come into effect in 2018.During a conference call with analysts, Tushar Morzaria, the Barclays finance director, described the £1 billion as “construction costs” for the new structural entities within the bank.The lender said it expected to spend about £100 million on structural changes this year and another £400 million in 2016.The bank also said on Thursday that its net profit in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose 10 percent to £417 million from £379 million in the same quarter last year.Barclays said it took a charge of £270 million in its third quarter, related to the settlement of two residential mortgage-backed securities lawsuits filed by the National Credit Union Administration in the United States and to the settlement of other litigation.It also took a provision of £290 million to compensate clients over an issue related to the rates the bank provided to some customers on foreign currency transactions from 2005 to 2012.Barclays said its adjusted pretax profit, which excludes provisions for customer redress and other charges, declined 10 percent to £1.43 billion in the third quarter, from £1.59 billion in the same period a year earlier.The adjusted pretax profit in the third quarter missed analysts’ forecasts, according to Reuters.Operating income, which is similar to revenue, declined 4.4 percent to £5.61 billion in the period, from £5.87 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Operating expenses declined about 1 percent to £3.84 billion in the quarter, from £3.88 billion in the same period a year earlier.In the investment bank, pretax profit rose nearly 12 percent to £317 million in the third quarter.Advertisement
