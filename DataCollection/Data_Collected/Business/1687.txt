The retailer has been under pressure since late October when the investment firm Elliott Management started pushing for money-generating maneuvers from Cabela’s, possibly the sale of its credit card unit or the entire company. Tommy Millner, Cabela’s chief executive, said in a written statement that the board maintained faith in its current strategy but would consider other options. The company has been trying to cut spending and in September it laid off 70 people, eliminating about 4 percent of its corporate work force. Advertisement
