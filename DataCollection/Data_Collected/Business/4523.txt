PARIS —  In a surprising turnabout, the board of the Irish budget airline, Ryanair, said that, in fact, it had not approved plans to offer ultracheap flights between Europe and the United States.Just days after Europe’s largest low-cost carrier confirmed its ambition to expand into trans-Atlantic travel as early as 2019, calling it “a logical development in the European market,” the company’s board issued a curt statement to the London Stock Exchange saying that no concrete plans were — or ever had been — in the works.“The board of Ryanair Holdings P.L.C. wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any trans-Atlantic project and does not intend to do so,” read the statement, which appeared late Thursday on the airline’s website.The reason for the airline’s reversal was not immediately clear. Ryanair did not respond to phone messages and emails requesting comment.AdvertisementMichael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, has long made public his desire to replicate the airline’s success within Europe on the lucrative routes linking Europe and North America, and he first dangled the notion of fares as low as $10 nearly a decade ago. But until its statement earlier this week, the carrier had held off, saying that the cost of the long-range jets it would need for such an operation was still too high.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But analysts say it is unclear how many of these inexpensive flights are — or ever can be — sustainably profitable.Ryanair is Europe’s largest airline by number of passengers, having carried 89 million people over the last year to more than 180 destinations.AdvertisementDespite average one-way fares of just 40 euros, or about $43, the airline is also the region’s most profitable. It has forecast a net profit of between €840 million and €850 million for the current financial year ending March 31, up from €523 million a year earlier.A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Ryanair Retracts Trans-Atlantic Plans.
