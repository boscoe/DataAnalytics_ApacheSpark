Zodiac, which is headquartered outside Paris, has been wrestling for months with missed deadlines for seat production, which it has blamed on its own overloaded engineering resources. A strike last autumn at a Zodiac plant in Texas also slowed shipments. In December, the first delivery of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner to American Airlines was pushed into 2015 because of missing seats. Boeing said that Zodiac had failed to prepare adequately. “If you pick any business, whether it is aerospace or automotive, where something goes wrong, it is about integration,” said Patrick Shanahan, senior vice president for airplane programs.
