Customers with these models should activate the vehicle’s parking brake before turning off the engine, because the shifter can wrongly indicate that the car is in park.Dealers will inspect the recalled cars and, if required, replace their transmissions, which are supplied by ZF, the German car parts maker.The recall includes more than 22,000 cars in the United States. Fiat Chrysler said inconsistent assembly procedures at the supplier’s plant had been linked to five reports involving customers who could not shift their vehicles into park. The company said it was not aware of any injuries or deaths related to the problem.Automakers recalled almost 64 million vehicles last year, shattering an industry record. Fiat Chrysler set a corporate record, recalling about nine million cars.Advertisement
