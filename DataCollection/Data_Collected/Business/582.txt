Highbridge’s top executives, including its chief executive, Scott Kapnick, are expected to take ownership.Since the financial crisis, the big banks have been under pressure to spin off their in-house private equity and hedge funds.The first businesses to go were the operations that invested the banks’ own money — so-called proprietary investing — which was banned by the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation known as the Volcker Rule.Last year, JPMorgan sold off One Equity Partners, a division that had put the bank’s money into large investments.While the Highbridge business is owned by JPMorgan, it largely invests the money of JPMorgan’s clients. That sort of activity is allowed by the Volcker Rule, but some banks have been scaling it back — or spinning off units — as they faced pressure from regulators and investors to simplify their businesses.The move to spin off Highbridge had been reported by Institutional Investor last year. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that as part of the potential deal, JPMorgan would keep ownership of Highbridge’s $6 billion hedge fund portfolio.Even if Highbridge is spun off, JPMorgan will still have a separate in-house unit that makes private equity investments with client money.Highbridge was acquired by JPMorgan in 2004. At the time it was purely a hedge fund. Mr. Kapnick came on board in 2007 and built the private equity arm.Advertisement
