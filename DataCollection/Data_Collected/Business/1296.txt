Macy’s and Nordstrom each hit two-year lows on Friday. Consumer discretionary stocks were by far the worst performing group in the S.&P. 500.J. C. Penney’s results were about equal to analyst projections, but its stock lost $1.35, or 15.4 percent, to $7.44. The video game retailer GameStop sank $7.35, or 16.5 percent, to $37.18.

Richard Jaffe, a Stifel Nicolaus analyst, suggested the widespread selling was an overreaction. Shoppers will spend plenty of money this holiday season, he said, and while they’re spending more money on smartphones and TVs and other big items than they used to, there will still be plenty of socks and sweaters given as gifts, too.“Christmas is boxed gifts,” Mr. Jaffe said. “There will be a lot of gift giving, a lot of apparel sales.”He noted that American shopping habits had changed a lot over the last few years. Consumers are spending more on homes, cars and vacations. Aging baby boomers don’t buy clothes as often as they used to, and younger shoppers are more interested in technology.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
