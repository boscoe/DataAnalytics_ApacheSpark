Chrysler will recall more than 228,000 vehicles because their airbags could unexpectedly inflate without a crash. The company will upgrade software governing side-curtain and seat-mounted side airbags in Jeep Cherokees from the 2014-15 model years, including more than 168,000 vehicles in the United States. Chrysler engineers initiated an investigation after getting reports of “a small number of inadvertent deployments involving drivers who executed extreme maneuvers.” In these cases, the airbag systems, sensing potential rollovers, automatically activated. The action follows a much larger recall for inadvertent airbag deployments announced on Saturday by regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That recall covers about 2.1 million vehicles made by Chrysler, Toyota and Honda with airbags that might suddenly deploy.A version of this brief appears in print on February 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Jeep Cherokees to Be Recalled to Upgrade Airbag Software.
