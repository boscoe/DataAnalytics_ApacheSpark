WASHINGTON — General Electric has asked regulators to lift the “too big to fail” label on GE Capital, saying in a filing on Thursday that its finance arm had shrunk to the point where it no longer met the definition.GE Capital is one of four nonbank financial institutions that regulators have designated as “systemically important” to the financial system. On Wednesday, another one, MetLife, won a court order to lift its designation.If successful, GE Capital would be the first financial institution to lose its designation with help from regulators, though the road map for how that process would work is not immediately clear.The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a regulatory body created by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul and led by the Treasury secretary, is responsible for analyzing and designating companies that could take down the banking system in the event of another crisis.AdvertisementThe Treasury Department, which leads the regulatory council, said in a statement that the council “welcomes the opportunity to evaluate developments at any designated nonbank financial company and their potential effect on financial stability.”AdvertisementIt said the council re-examines each of the designations every year and “evaluates whether any changes at the company, or in its regulation or markets, justify a rescission of the designation.“Before the financial crisis, some of the largest, riskiest nonbank financial companies were not subject to adequate oversight,” the Treasury noted.General Electric filed a “request for rescission” on Thursday, which states that GE Capital “has substantially reduced its risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to the financial system, and therefore does not pose any conceivable threat to U.S. financial stability.”Over the last year, GE Capital has been shedding or exiting most of its financial services businesses. On Thursday, the company told the Financial Stability Oversight Council that it was smaller and had “significantly reduced the risks that any such hypothetical financial distress could pose a threat.”GE Capital recently received approval to sell its deposit business in the United States to Goldman Sachs. Total assets have shrunk 52 percent, to $265 billion from $549 billion in 2012.Its consumer finance arm, now called Synchrony Financial, was spun off last year. In addition, GE Capital has restructured as a holding company owned entirely by General Electric, with American and British subsidiaries.The company’s remaining businesses “do not provide a critical function to the economy that could not easily be supported by other entities,” according to the release.Advertisement“Our submission details the complete transformation of GE Capital,” Keith Sherin, GE Capital’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday. “We have completed over 80 percent of our projected asset reductions, exited leveraged lending and U.S. consumer lending, exited nearly all middle market lending, reduced real estate debt by more than 75 percent and real estate equity by 100 percent and reduced outstanding commercial paper almost 90 percent.”Peter Hancock, chief executive of AIG, discusses a ruling that designates MetLife no longer "systemically important" and the insurance company's exposure to hedge funds.At an investor meeting in December, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, was asked about the prospects for GE Capital once the systemically important designation was removed.“Let’s go through the de-designation process; let’s see how the world is working as it pertains to financial services and things like that,” Mr. Immelt said, adding that he thought the shift in investors’ minds would be “Is it as really as much today about how we use it to position our industrial growth as it is necessarily freestanding.”Shares of General Electric ended nearly flat in trading on Thursday.A day earlier, MetLife, the country’s biggest life insurer, won a major battle in court against the government, overturning its own “systemically important” designation.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Collyer of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said in her order that she had upheld arguments that regulators failed to adequately assess MetLife’s vulnerability to extreme financial distress and the potential economic impact of the designation.The Treasury Department has said it is disappointed with the decision, but it has not yet said whether it will appeal. The judge’s full opinion is under seal.The American International Group and Prudential Financial are the other two nonbanks that were given the “too big to fail” label.Appearing on CNBC on Thursday, Peter Hancock, the chief executive of A.I.G., said his company would watch the progress of the MetLife decision if it is appealed. He noted that if the decision was upheld it would open up an opportunity for A.I.G.Liz Moyer contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on April 1, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: G.E.
