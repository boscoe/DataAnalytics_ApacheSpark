What gets published gets done.”The review was announced by the government in July, and a final report was to be published before next year’s budget.Some progress has been made in adding more women to leadership roles in the business world in Britain.A separate government-ordered review this year found that women now constitute nearly a quarter of all directors on the boards of the FTSE 100, a stock index that measures the performance of the largest publicly traded companies in London.The number of female directors of FTSE 100 companies has almost doubled since the British government first called for a review of the issue in 2011, according to a March report by Mervyn Davies, a former government minister and former chairman of the British bank Standard Chartered.As part of the report, Mr. Davies called for women to hold a third of FTSE 100 board positions by 2020.However, Ms. Baldwin said on Wednesday, the financial services sector is an industry “where the problem of gender diversity is particularly marked — especially in senior management.”In a gender-gap report by the World Economic Forum last year, Britain ranked 26th among 142 countries worldwide on the basis of four factors: economic participation and opportunity; educational attainment; health and survival; and political empowerment.Iceland ranked first, and the United States was 20th.Britain, however, ranked 46th worldwide in the category of economic participation and opportunity, which examined the difference in pay between men and women; the number of women who served as managers or senior officials in government and business; and participation in the labor force.The United States ranked fourth in that category.Advertisement
