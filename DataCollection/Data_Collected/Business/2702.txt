PARIS — Société Générale, one of France’s largest banks, is splitting the roles of chairman and chief executive to comply with European rules, it said on Monday.The bank, based in Paris, is handing the role of chairman to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, an Italian economist who served on the executive board of the European Central Bank from 2005 through 2011.Frédéric Oudéa, who had held both top roles since 2009, will remain as chief executive, a position he has held since 2008. The change is subject to the approval of shareholders at a meeting in May.Société Générale was the only major European bank that still combined both roles in one person, arguing that it made the institution better able to handle crises. But regulators worried that allowing a single executive to hold both titles risked undermining the board’s independence at what is considered to be a too-big-to-fail institution.“This change in corporate governance, prepared in 2014, meets the requirements applicable to banks in Europe,” Société Générale said in a statement. “Taking place just after the group successfully joined the European Banking Union, and in an increasingly demanding economic, competitive and regulatory environment, it will allow Société Générale to continue implementing its strategy and its transformation.”The bank had net profit of 836 million euros, or about $966 million, in the third quarter of 2014, up about 57 percent from the period a year earlier.If shareholders approve the split at the top, more than 90 percent of those on the bank’s board will be independent directors, aside from employee directors, and more than 40 percent of the board seats will be held by women, the bank said.
