More than once this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission was close to securing a landmark accounting fraud case. Then it came undone, the result of divisions within the S.E.C. And now the case might be back on track — that is, unless it’s not.Behind the scenes at the regulator, an extraordinary political battle has disrupted the case against the Computer Sciences Corporation, forcing on-again, off-again negotiations that at times have imperiled the case altogether. This week, the agency explored new ways to break the stalemate, including a reduction of the penalty that Computer Sciences would have to pay, according to lawyers briefed on the matter.The S.E.C., which already backed down from demands that the company admit wrongdoing, has proposed imposing a roughly $100 million penalty against Computer Sciences, a large technology company that holds contracts with governments around the world. That sum falls far short of the $190 million that the company had already agreed to pay when it struck a tentative settlement with the S.E.C. last year, the lawyers briefed on the matter said.Even so, the S.E.C. discussed whether to penalize a former controller of the company, whom the agency had not originally planned to charge. The S.E.C. is weighing whether to bring a complaint against that executive, as well as the company’s former chief executive and chief financial officer, according to the lawyers. The S.E.C. could announce the case as soon as next week, though the discussions could fall apart, as they have before.AdvertisementThe dizzying series of about-faces — at times changing faster than one can say “percentage-of-completion accounting,” the source of the misconduct — emanated from the S.E.C.’s commissioners, a majority of whom must approve the settlement for it to become official. That has proved elusive as the case pitted the commission’s two Democrats, champions of strict enforcement cases, against two Republicans who are loath to levy big corporate fines, reflecting how party line divisions complicate the agency’s effort to punish corporate misconduct.AdvertisementMary Jo White, the agency’s chairwoman and a political independent, would typically break an impasse like this, casting the deciding vote or swaying a reluctant commissioner. But for Ms. White, a former United States attorney in Manhattan known for promoting corporate punishments, the Computer Sciences case was off limits. Under federal ethics rules, she had to step aside because her husband, John White, a partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, represented Computer Sciences in the S.E.C. case. Because Cravath’s involvement neutralized Ms. White, it has arguably opened the door for the company to obtain a smaller penalty.The story behind this case and the last-ditch effort to save it — an account based on interviews with the people briefed on the matter — offers a look behind the curtain of a Wall Street regulator’s secret negotiations. The process is both hectic and slow, the interviews show, so much so that the S.E.C. missed a legal deadline to file a portion of the Computer Sciences case last week, a rare misstep. And at times, the pace of the negotiations accelerated after reporters from The New York Times asked S.E.C. officials for comment.
                Before President Obama named Mary Jo White to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, she was the top federal prosecutor in New York City.            In recent days, the S.E.C. moved closer to a deal, the interviews show, discussing the contours of a settlement that would offer something to everyone: To help sway the Democrats, Luis A. Aguilar and Kara M. Stein, the S.E.C.’s enforcement division discussed charging the former controller. Hoping to appease Michael S. Piwowar and Daniel M. Gallagher, the agency’s Republicans, the enforcement division discussed lowering the corporate penalty.That shift underlined how S.E.C. enforcement actions — nonpartisan regulatory decisions — are beholden to politically appointed commissioners. And while that effort might yield mixed results in the Computer Sciences case, strengthening some aspects and weakening others, it also raises questions of fairness, with former executives becoming something of a bargaining chip.Some S.E.C. officials have suggested that commissioners should untangle the Computer Sciences settlement from the possible case against the former controller. Under that proposal, the commissioners would support the original $190 million settlement with the company, while the enforcement division continues to separately investigate the former executive.A spokeswoman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.The Computer Sciences case encapsulates a broader tension within the S.E.C., where an ideological gulf sometimes stymies the sort of horse-trading that is the lifeblood of other financial agencies. The disputes — which divide the Democrats against the Republicans and leave Ms. White straddling the split — have also spilled into the S.E.C’s process for giving companies “waivers” from certain restrictions that arise when settling a case.Some commissioners privately argue that their concerns are rooted not in political motivations but in their desire to properly punish corporate wrongdoing. The commissioners regularly share their views publicly and to the enforcement division, and those views just happen to clash.AdvertisementIt is unusual, but not unprecedented, for S.E.C. commissioners to balk at a proposed settlement only to eventually support a tougher one. In 2013, for example, after a majority of commissioners overruled a tentative settlement with Philip A. Falcone, the hedge fund magnate, the S.E.C. extracted a harsher penalty that required him to admit wrongdoing.Ms. White was involved in that case, and supported the stricter punishment for Mr. Falcone. But in more than four dozen other actions, including the Computer Sciences case, she has had to step aside, an earlier examination by The Times found, costing the S.E.C. the benefit of her expertise as a former federal prosecutor who has pledged a tough line on Wall Street.Most of the recusals came in cases involving Debevoise & Plimpton, where she was once a partner. Those recusals ended in April, the two-year mark of her S.E.C. tenure, and she participated in far more votes on enforcement actions last year than nearly all her fellow commissioners, The Times’s report showed.In the roughly 10 cases that Cravath handled, forcing Ms. White’s recusal, her husband was involved in at least four. The involvement of Mr. White, a former S.E.C. official who specializes in corporate disclosures, often amounted to sending an email or working behind the scenes on a company’s disclosures.Cravath and Mr. White are relative newcomers to the Computer Sciences investigation, which gained steam in 2011, when the company hired the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft to conduct an internal investigation into suspected misconduct. After Cadwalader disclosed the results of its investigation to the S.E.C. and Ms. White joined the agency, Computer Sciences hired Cravath, which had a longstanding relationship with the company’s general counsel.The S.E.C. ultimately concluded that the company had violated anti-fraud and bookkeeping provisions of securities laws. The investigation focused on how Computer Sciences accounted for a large contract with the National Health Service of Britain.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And with Ms. White recused, the case fell into the hands of the divided commissioners, complicating the path to a settlement.For example, without Ms. White, the S.E.C.’s enforcement division had to seek support from the agency’s Republican commissioners, both of whom oppose huge corporate penalties. Mr. Gallagher, who calls big fines “shareholder penalties,” has long indicated that he will approve fines that are equivalent to the theoretical benefit that the illegal acts generated. After discussing the Computer Sciences case with Mr. Gallagher, the S.E.C. investigators lowered their demands for a financial penalty to $190 million, from roughly $300 million, according to the lawyers briefed on the matter, who added that the S.E.C. often begins negotiations with an inflated demand. The S.E.C. is now discussing whether to lower the penalty again to address lingering Republican concerns, the lawyers said.The Democrats had their own concerns. Initially, they questioned why the S.E.C. declined to charge the company’s auditor, Deloitte, and why Computer Sciences would not need to admit wrongdoing, according to the lawyers briefed on the matter. The S.E.C. sought admissions from Computer Sciences, but Cravath argued that doing so could imperil the company’s role as a government contractor.AdvertisementMore recently, the Democrats focused on whether the S.E.C. planned to charge enough former executives. The S.E.C. has decided to take action against individuals, including former low-level employees and high-ranking executives. While the chief executive and chief financial officer were not necessarily at the center of the scheme, they signed annual certifications saying that the company’s financial statements did not contain material misrepresentations.But other former executives, including the former controller, were conspicuously absent from the S.E.C.’s list of people to charge. The controller had previously received a so-called wells notice, the lawyers said, warning that the S.E.C. might pursue action against him.And just days ago, while negotiations dragged on, the S.E.C. missed an important deadline: The five-year statute of limitations for charging certain misconduct expired.A version of this article appears in print on May 29, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Political Fights Throw Sand in Gears of S.E.C. .
