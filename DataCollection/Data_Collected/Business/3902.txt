To fill the highly visible role of co-head of corporate banking, Deutsche Bank has poached a senior executive from one of its biggest rivals.The German lender said on Wednesday that it had hired Jeff Urwin, JPMorgan Chase’s co-head of global banking, to take up that position. He will hold that title along with the other existing co-head of corporate banking, Colin Fan.Mr. Urwin is expected to start around the beginning of June.The selection marks the end of a monthslong search after the November departure of Robert Rankin, who left Deutsche Bank to become the chief executive of Consolidated Press Holdings, the investment vehicle of the Australian billionaire James Packer.It also marks the latest move by Mr. Urwin, who rose up the ranks of JPMorgan after the firm acquired his previous employer, Bear Stearns, in a government-backed fire sale in 2008. Since then, he rose from co-chief of North American investment banking to the head of Asia-Pacific operations and then global head of investment banking.At Deutsche Bank, he will, along with Mr. Fan, supervise the firm’s core investment banking and trading businesses. Both men will report to Anshu Jain, the bank’s co-chief executive.“I am pleased to welcome Jeff to Deutsche Bank,” Mr. Jain said in a statement. “He is a trusted, long-time adviser to clients and an experienced team leader. Jeff’s decision to join us underscores our commitment to being a client-centric bank.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
