A further payment of up to £1 billion would be made later, depending on the performance of the combined businesses of Three and O2.The merger would be the latest in a series of deals that are transforming the telecom landscape across Europe, particularly as cable and telecom companies seek to offer consumers bundled services that combine mobile, broadband, television and landlines.The combination of O2 and Three would create a mobile carrier with about 31 million customers and a much stronger challenger to EE, which the British telecom giant BT recently agreed to buy for £12.5 billion.It would also shrink the number of main mobile providers in Britain to three, including Vodafone.Britain’s competition authorities have previously stated that they would prefer to have at least four mobile carriers, so any deal would most likely face regulatory scrutiny over how it could affect consumers, particularly in the pricing of services.The deal also would be the largest international acquisition by a company controlled by Mr. Li, one of Asia’s richest men.Advertisement
