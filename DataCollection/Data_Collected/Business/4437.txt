Kraft Foods is recalling 242,000 cases of its original flavor Macaroni & Cheese because some of the boxes contain small pieces of metal. The boxes have “best when used by” dates ranging from Sept. 18 through Oct. 11 of this year and are marked with the code “C2.” They were sold throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and in some countries in the Caribbean and South America. The recall covers 7.25-ounce boxes that were sold individually and in packs of three, four and five. Kraft says it is aware of eight episodes of consumers finding metal in the boxes, but has not been informed of any injuries.A version of this brief appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Kraft Recalls Mac & Cheese After Metal Shards Are Found.
