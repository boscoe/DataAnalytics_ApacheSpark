WASHINGTON —  Consumers increased their borrowing in November, as stronger demand for auto and student loans offset a drop in credit card debt, official data showed on Thursday.The Federal Reserve said that consumer borrowing rose by $14.1 billion after a $16 billion increase in October. The gains have pushed consumer debt excluding real estate loans to a record level of $3.3 trillion.The latest figures suggest that an improving economy and strong employment gains over the last year may be making consumers more comfortable with taking on more debt.

The four-week average, a less volatile measure, slipped by 250, to 290,500. That average has fallen 16 percent in the last 12 months and has stayed below 300,000 since September. The unemployment rate has slid to 5.8 percent from 6.7 percent at the start of 2014.AdvertisementIn the monthly jobs report being released on Friday, employers are expected to have added 243,000 jobs in December, according to FactSet. That would follow job gains of 321,000 in November and put total job growth in 2014 at just shy of three million, the best performance since 1999.

The decline was outweighed by a $15 billion increase in the category that covers auto and student loans. Borrowing for education and cars has risen rapidly this year.The November increase put total borrowing 7 percent above where it was a year ago. Auto and student loans were up 8.4 percent, while credit card debt rose at a slower rate, 3.4 percent, compared with the same period a year earlier.The Fed’s monthly consumer credit report excludes mortgages and other loans secured by real estate. It also does not immediately provide separate data for auto loans and student loans.But a quarterly report issued in November by the New York Federal Reserve Bank that tracks all types of consumer borrowing showed that total household debt, including home mortgages, increased by $78 billion in the July-September quarter to $11.7 trillion. That is still below the peak for total debt, $12.7 trillion, reached in the third quarter of 2008.A version of this article appears in print on January 9, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Student Loans and Car Sales Contribute to a Rise in Consumer Debt.
