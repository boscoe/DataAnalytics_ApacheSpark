Output at U.S. factories fell for a third straight month in February, driven by a big drop in production at auto plants.The Federal Reserve said Monday that manufacturing output fell 0.2 percent in February, following a decline of 0.3 percent in January. Overall industrial production edged up a slight 0.1 percent in February, as unusually cold weather in many parts of the country led to a surge at utilities.In a separate report Monday, an index of homebuilders sentiment suggested they were feeling slightly less confident in their sales prospects, but their overall outlook remains favorable.The weakness at factories is attributed in part to a stronger dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive on overseas markets, and supply disruptions from the labor dispute at West Coast ports.

They say rising consumer spending will likely offset the recent lackluster showing in manufacturing. Solid job gains and lower gasoline prices should give households more to spend on other items.Advertisement“We expect that the strong domestic economy will ensure that manufacturing output continues to grow at a reasonable pace despite the strong dollar,” said Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics.AdvertisementThe February factory weakness was led by a 3 percent plunge in production of motor vehicles and parts, the third straight decline in the category. Production of machinery and primary metals such as steel and appliances also fell.A 7.3 percent surge in utility output reflected frigid temperatures on the East Coast and record snowfall levels in the Northeast.Output in mining fell 2.5 percent in February, with oil and gas well drilling down 17.3 percent — the biggest one-month drop in nearly three decades. Oil prices have skidded by about half since last summer, which has led drilling companies to hold off on new wells and reduce oil and gas extraction.

It’s the third monthly decline in a row for the index. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good, however.Labor shortages, a dearth of available land parcels cleared for new home construction and tougher mortgage-lending standards weighed on builders’ confidence this month, said David Crowe, the builder group’s chief economist.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Its measure of current sales conditions fell three points to 58, while a gauge of traffic by prospective buyers declined two points to 37. Builders’ outlook for sales over the next six months held steady at 59.Though new homes represent only a fraction of the housing market, they have an outsize impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to the association’s data.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
