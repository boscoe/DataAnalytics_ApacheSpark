The United States Justice Department has proposed that the bank pay $14 billion to settle the case.Such an argument is not falling upon sympathetic ears — in Washington or Berlin.On Tuesday, Sigmar Gabriel, the powerful German politician who leads the minority party in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government, put into words what many critics of the bank have been wondering for some time now.“I don’t know whether to laugh or be angry that the bank that declared speculation to be its business model now declares itself a victim of speculators,” Mr. Gabriel said to reporters.Catering to hedge funds is a major business for Deutsche Bank, and bank officials have blamed hedge funds that are betting against the stock for its plummeting share price.Responding to a question about the size of the proposed penalty, Matthew Jones, a member of the I.M.F.’s financial stability team, said it was not the fine that was the problem but the question of underlying profitability, compensation and capital levels at institutions like Deutsche Bank.The goal of all regulators now is to “create a culture of responsible finance,” he said.Advertisement
