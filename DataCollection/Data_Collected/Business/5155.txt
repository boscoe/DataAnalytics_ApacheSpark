The French luxury goods group LVMH, the world’s biggest maker of luxury goods, posted a 3 percent rise in like-for-like first-quarter sales on Monday, helped by the euro’s weakness against the dollar and what it called an “excellent start to the year” at Louis Vuitton. The company said wines and spirits sales fell 1 percent on a comparable basis in the first quarter. The fashion and leather unit had a revenue rise of 1 percent like-for-like, below the 9 percent rise in the year-ago period. “This is not a home run, but a very solid set of results,” said Luca Solca, an Exane BNP Paribas luxury goods analyst. LVMH’s overall first-quarter sales rose 16 percent on a reported basis to 8.3 billion euros ($8.8 billion).A version of this brief appears in print on April 14, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Weaker Euro Helped Lift First-Quarter Sales at LVMH.
