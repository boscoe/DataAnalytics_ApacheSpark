The agency said one report involved a burn injury to someone’s finger and another said a desk was damaged.The development of the speakers predated Apple’s purchase of Beats for $3 billion last year. Customers can request a refund or store credit for $325, slightly more than the speakers’ $300 price tag.Apple has suspended sales of the speakers “for the time being,” according to a company spokesman, Tom Neumayr.Wednesday’s recall affects all of the Beats Pill XL speakers sold worldwide since January 2014. About 222,000 units were sold in the United States and 11,000 were sold in Canada. Apple did not disclose how many units it has sold worldwide, although the United States is largely seen as the company’s biggest global market.“Customer safety is always a top priority at both Apple and Beats, and we have voluntarily decided to recall this product,” the company said in a statement on its website.Customers seeking to turn in their speakers must first submit a request online. Apple will pay for return shipping and process refunds and credit within three weeks, according to the company’s statement.Overheating is not a new issue for Apple products. Last year, the company offered replacements for a potentially faulty power adapter for several of its iPhone models.In 2006, Apple recalled more than a million batteries used in some of its iBook and PowerBook computers because they posed a fire hazard. That recall followed two smaller recalls of batteries for similar issues in 2004 and 2005.Brian X. Chen contributed to this article.Advertisement
