Mondelez International, maker of Cadbury Creme Eggs, has tweaked the recipe of the chocolate shell of its gooey treats ahead of their main Easter selling season, drawing an angry response in Cadbury’s home market of Britain. The change affects only Creme Eggs in Britain, since those sold in the United States are manufactured by Hershey. Mondelez said on Monday that the Creme Egg would now use a “standard, traditional Cadbury milk chocolate” for its shell, rather than the Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate recipe it has used in the past. Mondelez also reduced the number of Creme Eggs sold in its multipacks to five from six, citing “a range of economic factors.”A version of this brief appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: British Fans of Creme Eggs Outraged by Recipe Change.
