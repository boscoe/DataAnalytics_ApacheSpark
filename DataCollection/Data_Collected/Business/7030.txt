Other data on Tuesday showed new-home sales increased to a more than seven-year high in May.Manufacturing is lagging an overall rebound in the economy after output slumped at the start of the year. Despite the weakness in factory activity, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this year.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4 percent last month. These so-called core capital goods orders slipped 0.3 percent in April."These are encouraging signs,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ”We need to see further gains over the next couple of months before we can more firmly conclude that manufacturing orders are rebounding."Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the American economy, has been hurt by the strong dollar and investment spending cuts in the energy sector after crude oil prices plunged more than 60 percent last year.The number of oil drilling rigs in the United States has dropped to near a five-year low, prompting oil field companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton to cut their capital expenditure budgets for this year. The pace of decline in oil rig counts has slowed in recent weeks, however, as crude prices edged higher.The dollar has gained about 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014, taking a bite out of the profits of multinational corporations.Factories also have been hampered by businesses’ placing fewer orders while working through a stockpile of goods accumulated last year.In a second report, the Commerce Department said new-home sales rose 2.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000 units in May, the highest level since February 2008. April's sales pace was revised sharply higher.Last month, shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, rose 0.3 percent after a similar gain in April.A 6.4 percent drop in transportation equipment, however, weighed down overall orders for durable goods, items that are meant to last three years or more; such orders fell 1.8 percent last month. That was primarily because of a 35.3 percent plunge in civilian aircraft orders.In a third report, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary United States Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to a reading of 53.4 in June, the lowest since October 2013, from 54 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in factory activity.Advertisement
