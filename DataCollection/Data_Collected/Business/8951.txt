That represents a drop from the 1.5 billion Swiss francs originally agreed to last July, according to a statement issued then.A BTG spokesman said on Tuesday that the difference was an adjustment stemming from the cost of BSI cooperating with the United States Justice Department in a self-reporting tax program earlier this year.BSI, founded in 1873, is one of Switzerland’s oldest banks. The Lugano-based bank will keep its name and continue to run independently, BTG said. The combined company will hold $186.5 billion in assets under management.That is a significant boost for the Brazilian bank, which on its own had $99 billion in assets as of June 30. BTG also said that Alfredo Gysi would step down as the president of BSI’s board and be replaced by Joseph Rickenbacher, effective on Wednesday.Brazilian banks have long sought a global presence. Now in the face of recession and a recent downgrade of the country’s sovereign debt rating by Standard & Poor’s, they face increased pressure to diversify markets.Last week, Standard & Poor’s lowered its rating on BTG Pactual and more than a dozen other Brazilian financial institutions. The ratings agency noted that “the expected economic contraction in 2015 will take its toll on banks, which in our view will move to a correction phase over the next 12 to 18 months and offset the recent improvement in their asset quality and profitability.”Advertisement
