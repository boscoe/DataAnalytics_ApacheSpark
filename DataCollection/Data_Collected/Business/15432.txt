Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist for Voya Investment Strategies, says investors recognize that the Federal Reserve and other central banks are keeping the stock market stable. So investors are putting more money into energy, materials and tech stocks instead of the companies they turned to during the market turmoil at the start of this year.Advertisement“Central banks continue to step in to absorb the risk,” Ms. Cavanaugh said. Investors “don’t need the utilities and telecoms anymore.”
