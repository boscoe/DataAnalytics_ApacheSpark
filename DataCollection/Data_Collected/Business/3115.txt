At a time of increasing scrutiny of procedures to open blocked heart arteries, cardiologists are turning to — and reaping huge payments from -- controversial techniques that relieve blockages in the arms and legs.Unlike heart procedures, which must be done in a hospital or outpatient facility, where oversight is typically more intense, the opening of the peripheral arteries and veins of the arms and legs can be done in a doctor’s office.Medical experts are questioning the necessity of some of these treatments, and many believe the condition is more safely treated with drugs and exercise. Nonetheless, some of the nation’s most highly reimbursed cardiologists are making millions of dollars from Medicare for performing these procedures, as payments for relieving blockages in the heart have fallen.Earlier this month, the Justice Department said it joined two whistle-blower lawsuits accusing one of these doctors of performing unnecessary procedures, including placing a stent in the leg of a patient who later died of complications.AdvertisementThe cardiologist in question, Dr. Asad Qamar of Ocala, Fla., was paid $18 million by Medicare in 2012, making him the top-billing cardiologist in the country, according to an analysis by The New York Times of Medicare data. Dr. Qamar was also the leader in billing for procedures to treat peripheral blockages.AdvertisementNationwide, the shift in doctors’ emphasis is significant. The number of procedures to open blockages in heart vessels fell by about 30 percent from 2005 to 2013, to about 323,000 for patients covered under Medicare. Over the same time, the number of similar procedures for vessels outside the heart soared by almost 70 percent to 853,000, according to the Advisory Board Company, an analytics and research firm that analyzed Medicare payment data.The Times’s analysis of the 2012 billing records for the 10 top-billing cardiologists in the country showed that eight of the doctors made about half of their reimbursements from Medicare by performing procedures to ease the narrowing in an artery or vein in patients’ arms or legs. Some continue to do a high number of coronary interventions.These types of lucrative procedures — in 2012, Medicare paid nearly $12,000 for one type of these operations — have been the focus of a turf battle among specialists.The county’s top billers for these procedures included a handful of vascular surgeons and radiologists in addition to the cardiologists.The doctors who perform the procedures say they are saving Medicare money by doing them outside a hospital, that they reduce the number of more serious conditions, and that the Medicare payments are justified to cover their high expenses.While there is considerable agreement among specialists about how and when to treat heart blockages, there is far less consensus in the treatment of blockages elsewhere.As in the vessels of the heart, plaque can build up in peripheral arteries, restricting blood flow. One common condition in the legs, known as peripheral artery disease, can cause pain or a burning sensation and make walking difficult.AdvertisementMany medical experts say that most patients can be treated with exercise, weight loss and medication, although patients with extreme cases are at risk for amputations. About one in 20 people over age 50 has the condition in some form.As the number of procedures to treat these blockages has climbed sharply, the debate around their appropriateness is intensifying. The Society for Vascular Medicine, for example, warns that people typically do not need invasive treatment.“We’re pretty conservative with how we treat peripheral artery disease,” Dr. Darren B. Schneider, the chief of vascular and endovascular surgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, said. “We only perform revascularization procedures on patients with peripheral artery disease who have disabling leg pain or who are at risk of amputation, which is less than 10 percent of all the patients we see.”Dr. Ashish Pal, a cardiologist in Davenport, Fla., who says he was one of the early heart doctors to branch out and begin treating peripheral vessels, disagrees. “These patients are grossly undertreated,” he argued. In 2012, Dr. Pal received $4.5 million from Medicare with the bulk coming from procedures done outside the heart, according to federal data.But the spike in procedures comes after a crackdown by regulators on unnecessary heart procedures.The Justice Department joined a whistle-blower lawsuit in 2011 claiming that Dr. Elie H. Korban, a cardiologist based in Jackson, Tenn., falsely billed Medicare for medically unnecessary cardiac procedures in patients. While he continued to insert coronary stents, Dr. Korban made more than half of his $2.4 million in Medicare payments the next year from peripheral vessel procedures.
            Among Medicare patients, operations to improve blood flow in the heart (including balloon angioplasties and stents, but excluding coronary bypass surgery) have fallen by 30 percent since 2005. But in the peripheral vessels, mainly in the leg, similar operations have increased by 66 percent.

That’s one of the reasons experts, including the Advisory Board Company, say they expect to see volumes continue to rise. Doctors are also performing high numbers of so-called “ablations,” which use a laser or radio wave to close off a damaged vein.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Doshi, a cardiologist in Schaumburg, Ill., who opened a clinic in May 2012 dedicated to performing peripheral procedures after learning he could do so at a conference earlier that year.That year, he received $2.6 million in Medicare payments, about half of which came from work outside the heart. Dr. Doshi and other physicians noted the Medicare payments included the costs associated with the procedures and office overhead.Some medical experts say patients have benefited greatly from the peripheral artery treatments, which have lowered the number of leg amputations. In a series of more than two dozen emails sent from Dr. Qamar’s account to a New York Times reporter, the importance of treating peripheral artery disease and saving limbs was emphasized.Because the field has been viewed as something of a “stepchild,” as Dr. Pal described it, less research and fewer studies have been conducted into what treatments work best and when to intervene.“The evidence base is not as clear,” said Brian Contos, an executive director of the Advisory Board Company, noting that only in the last year did a doctors’ professional society issue general guidelines on revascularizations done outside the heart.Doctors have not reached agreement on what treatments should be followed, as they have over the years in coronary disease, according to Dr. Curtiss T. Stinis, a cardiologist and the director of peripheral interventions at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, . “The guidelines are not as focused or narrow,” he said.The uncertainty surrounding when it is appropriate to do these types of peripheral procedures is likely to be one of the key issues in the case against Dr. Qamar, who heads up the Institute of Cardiovascular Excellence in Ocala.AdvertisementAccording to one of two lawsuits joined by the Justice Department, Dr. Qamar’s cardiac procedures had come under strict review by Medicare as early as 2010. By 2012, a majority of Dr. Qamar’s billings — $13 million of the total $18 million in payments he received from Medicare — came from operations to treat arteries mainly in the legs, The Times’s analysis showed.Nearly all of Dr. Qamar’s patients who were scanned for peripheral vascular disease received interventions, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that it would be “statistically impossible to medically support the number of interventions for which Dr. Qamar and ICE billed for in 2010-11."Dr. Qamar said through a spokesman earlier this month that the billings included other doctors in his practice. Medicare discourages the use of a single physician’s billing number for payments, while acknowledging that it occurs.Dr. Qamar’s spokesman emphasized his high costs for doing these procedures.In one instance, Dr. Qamar placed a stent in the leg of a female patient with major blockages in her heart and minor blockages in her legs. She died from complications from that stent before her heart blockage could be treated, the lawsuit contends.Dr. Qamar denies accusations that he performed unnecessary procedures. In a video response posted on YouTube, Dr. Qamar called the accusations “baseless” and “fiction.” He said his clinic had the lowest amputation rates for peripheral disease in the entire country.Doctors and others say it is only a matter of time before the same spotlight that has been focused on cardiac procedures starts to shine on possible unnecessary peripheral revascularizations.“There is just a wide gray zone that is going to receive additional scrutiny,” Mr. Contos said.Sarah Cohen contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on January 30, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Medicare Bills Rise for Stents Put Into Limbs.
