Gorman, positioned the bank’s quarterly results as an outgrowth of years of efforts to reshape the bank after it almost went under during the financial crisis.“We had early confidence that the transformation of Morgan Stanley’s business and balance sheet would deliver returns to all of our stakeholders, and I am proud that the levers we articulated are increasingly evident,” he said on a call with analysts Monday morning.As was the case at a rival, Goldman Sachs, much of the improvement came from increased revenue at the bank’s stock and derivative trading desks, where revenue jumped 35 percent from a year ago. The firm attributed the jump to an increase in client activity.Morgan Stanley executives have been pushing to make the bank less reliant on its trading operations, but the results in the latest quarter underscore how important trading still is for the firm.Revenue rose more modestly for its wealth management division, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which the company has emphasized as a source of more steady growth. The bank’s stock ended the day up 0.6 percent, after rising higher earlier in the day.The firm earned $2.31 billion in profit for the quarter, or $1.18 a share, compared with $1.45 billion, or 74 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.Adjusted for certain one-time items, the earnings were 85 cents a share, compared with the 78 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Net revenue rose to $9.91 billion, from $9 billion in the period a year earlier.The earnings announcement was the last one for Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, who recently said she would be leaving the firm to take the same position at Google.Advertisement
