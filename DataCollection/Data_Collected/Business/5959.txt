Mark Halperin, a political journalist for Bloomberg, issued an apology on Monday for a television interview he conducted with Senator Ted Cruz, in which he questioned the senator on his Cuban heritage, and asked him to speak Spanish.The interview with Mr. Cruz, Republican of Texas, was interpreted by some as disrespectful.“I kept waiting for Halperin to ask Cruz to play the conga drums like Desi Arnaz while dancing salsa and sipping cafe con leche — all to prove the Republican is really Cuban,” the columnist Ruben Navarrette wrote in The San Jose Mercury News.Mr. Halperin said in his apology that the interview was intended to be “the type of lighthearted banter that he’s done with us before on the show.”“In no way was I asking Senator Cruz to ‘prove’ he was an ‘authentic’ Latino,” Mr. Halperin said.Advertisement“I apologize to those that were offended and to Senator Cruz,” he added. “I promise that I will work to make the tone and questions better next time.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
