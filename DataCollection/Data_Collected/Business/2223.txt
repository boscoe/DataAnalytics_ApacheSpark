Barclays Capital failed to stop 6,100 unsuitable switches between mutual funds on behalf of its customers over a five-year period that ended in June, resulting in $8.6 million of customer harm, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said on Tuesday.The brokerage firm unit of the British bank will pay $13.75 million to settle Finra’s investigation into whether it improperly switched customers in and out of certain mutual funds in violation of suitability standards.The settlement includes $10 million in restitution to affected mutual fund customers and $3.75 million in fines. Barclays neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the findings.A Barclays spokesman had no comment.Broker-dealers have obligations under Finra rules to ensure that customers gain an advantage by switching mutual funds at the recommendation of their broker. Transaction fees associated with switching funds can undermine those advantages. Finra said that Barclays Capital did not have sufficient supervisory systems from January 2010 to June 2015 to prevent unsuitable switching.Barclays failed to act on thousands of alerts about potentially unsuitable transactions, Finra said. The regulator also said that Barclays did not provide adequate guidance to supervisors to ensure that mutual fund transactions for retail brokerage customers were suitable based on the client’s objectives, risk tolerance and account holdings.A review of six months’ worth of transactions found that some 39 percent of mutual fund switches were unsuitable, Finra said, affecting 343 customers who had $800,000 of financial harm, including realized losses.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
