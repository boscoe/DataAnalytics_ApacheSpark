The decision by Green Dot to stop selling MoneyPak, its popular prepaid card, will take a bite out of the company’s projected revenue and bottom line this year, and that has taken a toll on the company’s share price over the last several days.Green Dot, the nation’s largest seller of prepaid debit cards, has estimated that its decision last year to discontinue MoneyPak, partly because it had become a popular method of payment for online swindlers, could shrink operating revenue by $10 million to $40 million. The company, based in Pasadena, Calif., has also estimated its operating cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, may be $2 million to $10 million lower without sales of MoneyPak this year.Green Dot discussed the potential ramifications when it announced fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. On Tuesday, the company filed an investor presentation as part of a regulatory filing that provided more detail about its 2015 earnings. The company also posted the filing on its website.Green Dot’s shares have fallen 30 percent, to just $14, since the company reported earnings that missed Wall Street expectations and it offered a less optimistic outlook for 2015, in part because of the loss of MoneyPak sales.The company said last week that it would stop shipping MoneyPak cards to stores that sell them this month. It anticipates that most MoneyPak cards will be gone from store shelves by the end of March.Last summer, Green Dot announced it intended to stop selling MoneyPak as it moved to a newer technology. It is replacing MoneyPak with a product that will enable customers to add money to existing prepaid cards by swiping them at a special machine at the registers of stores that used to sell MoneyPak.The company said its decision to discontinue the paper MoneyPak card was also prompted by growing concern about the ease with which swindlers were using MoneyPak to conduct both online and telephone scams.Scams involving prepaid debit cards have been on the rise for the last few years and have resulted in dozens of warnings to consumers from the F.B.I., state law enforcement agencies and even a congressional committee. The cards allow for quick and easy money transfers, often done with a great deal of anonymity, a feature that has attracted scam artists. In July, The New York Times reported that such scams are thought to cost consumers tens of millions of dollars each year and have become more numerous as the prepaid debt card industry has grown into an $80 billion a year business. The scams involving MoneyPak have continued even after Green Dot announced its intention to stop selling it. MoneyPak cards have a unique numerical code, or PIN, on the back of each paper card. Anyone with that code has access to the money stored on the card. Scam artists who use MoneyPak as a method of payment persuade unsuspecting victims — often the elderly — to voluntarily give them the code.Until now, Green Dot has been quiet about commenting on the financial effect that its decision to stop selling MoneyPak would have on its earnings. But the company’s estimate seemed to catch investors and Wall Street analysts who cover the company by surprise.Analysts at JPMorgan Chase who follow the company published a research note on Jan. 30 that said Green Dot’s earnings guidance suffered from a “larger than expected MoneyPak impact.”
