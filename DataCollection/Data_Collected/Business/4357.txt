DETROIT —  In a notable victory for General Motors, a lawsuit that helped spur the biggest safety crisis in the company’s history has been withdrawn in exchange for a settlement from its compensation program, according to two people briefed on the agreement.The lawsuit was the second brought by the family of a Georgia woman, Brooke Melton, who died in 2010 in a car with a faulty ignition switch that has now been linked to at least 64 deaths.For G.M., the agreement removes the significant legal threat of senior officials, including Mary T. Barra, the automaker’s chief executive, being questioned under oath about the company’s failure for years to recall the defective vehicles.It was depositions in the Meltons’ first lawsuit that exposed the dangerous flaw in millions of small cars.Advertisement“The attorneys for the Melton family may have uncovered additional information that suggested G.M. did too little to protect consumer safety,” said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor who has been closely following G.M. safety issues.AdvertisementThe terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A G.M. spokesman confirmed that the case had been resolved, but declined to provide other details.Ms. Melton was killed after she lost control of her 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt on a Georgia highway when the ignition key slipped into the accessory position, shutting down engine power and disabling the car’s airbags.The family’s initial lawsuit was settled two years ago for $5 million, but only after G.M. officials admitted in depositions that the company had been unsuccessfully grappling with defective ignitions for a decade.Lawyers for Ms. Melton’s family also discovered that G.M. had secretly upgraded its switches without changing the part’s identification number — further frustrating efforts to pinpoint the cause of dozens of accidents that caused deaths and injuries.The revelations in the initial case forced further investigations within G.M. that led to the company’s recall of about 2.6 million small cars, and prompted dozens of subsequent recalls of other models.After the switch recall prompted a congressional investigation and other government inquiries, Ms. Melton’s family filed a second suit last year, claiming G.M. had knowingly sold unsafe cars.A lawyer for the victim’s parents, Ken and Beth Melton, said an aim of the second suit was to force G.M. to admit it had concealed evidence of the deadly ignition problem.
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            “One of the important issues for the Meltons was accountability,” said Lance Cooper, the family’s lawyer. “They are grieving parents who simply wanted the truth and for no one else to suffer a similar loss.”AdvertisementMr. Cooper was not available for comment beyond his prepared statement. A spokeswoman in his office said Ms. Melton’s parents also declined to discuss the case.The family’s first lawsuit played a pivotal role in uncovering how G.M. had failed to fix faulty ignitions for years, despite knowing about crashes in which vehicles suddenly lost power.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Beasley, said the initial suit was “directly responsible for alerting the government and the public to a massive cover-up by General Motors.”G.M.’s compensation program allows accident victims or their family members to file claims even if they had previously received settlements from the company. The program’s administrator, Kenneth R. Feinberg, can then authorize additional compensation beyond the original settlement.

Explore the size and scope of the recalls, and find out if your car has been affected.            But victims or family members cannot pursue a lawsuit once they have been compensated through the program.The ignition-switch recalls announced last year mushroomed into a far-reaching crisis for G.M., which spent about $3 billion to recall vehicles and compensate accident victims in 2014.It also led to widespread changes inside the nation’s largest automaker, including the dismissal of 15 employees, a shake-up of its vast engineering organization and the institution of a new safety department.AdvertisementMs. Barra was questioned at four congressional hearings, and the company was fined $35 million by federal regulators for failing to fix the ignition defect in a timely manner.While the withdrawal of the Melton suit eliminates one legal headache for G.M., other potential pitfalls remain.A federal bankruptcy judge, Robert E. Gerber, could rule soon on whether the company can retain a liability shield in its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring that protects it from claims involving accidents that occurred before the Chapter 11 filing.The company is also seeking to avoid claims that cars built before it went bankrupt have lost value in the marketplace because of recalls and safety problems.Whatever Judge Gerber decides, a number of class-action cases involving accidents after 2009 are proceeding, with a possible trial set for next January. Depositions are expected to begin this spring, including possible testimony from senior executives and former employees who were fired over their role in the delayed ignition-switch recall.Hilary Stout contributed reporting from New York.A version of this article appears in print on March 14, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: G.M.
