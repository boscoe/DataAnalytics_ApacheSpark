LOS ANGELES – Three new niche films generated O.K. audience interest over the weekend, as “Deadpool” remained the mainstream movie of the moment.Starring Ryan Reynolds, the R-rated “Deadpool” (20th Century Fox) collected about $55 million at North American multiplexes, for an astounding two-week domestic total of $235.4 million, according to comScore, which tracks box office data. Overseas, “Deadpool” has taken in an additional $256.5 million.DreamWorks Animation’s “Kung Fu Panda 3” (Fox) chugged away in second place, taking in an estimated $12.5 million, for a four-week total of $117.1 million. That total is about 20 percent behind “Kung Fu Panda 2” at the same point in its release.The Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews “Deadpool.”Third place went to “Risen” (Sony Pictures Entertainment), a biblical drama that cost about $20 million to make. It collected roughly $11.8 million.Advertisement“The Witch” (A24), a period horror film about a Puritan family and a demonic goat, took in $8.7 million. A24 acquired rights to the movie, which made its debut at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival, for roughly $1 million. Critics responded favorably, but audiences gave it a C-minus in CinemaScore exit polls, perhaps because of the extremely difficult-to-decipher 1630 dialect used by the actors.Rounding out the top five was “How to be Single” (Warner Bros.), taking in $8.2 million, for a two-week total of $31.8 million.AdvertisementThe third new film, “Race” (Focus Features), which recounts the story of Jesse Owens, the African-American track star who triumphed at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, arrived to $7.3 million in ticket sales. Focus acquired certain distribution rights for about $5 million; it was independently financed for roughly $25 million.A version of this article appears in print on February 22, 2016, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Deadpool’ Retains Top Spot at the Box Office.
