The company plans to use the majority of the proceeds from the sale of its British unit to reduce its €45.6 billion of net debt.Telefónica generates roughly two-thirds of its revenue from its combined Spanish, German and Brazilian businesses, and it has made several acquisitions in those countries to protect against rising competition from other operators.That includes Telefónica’s recent takeover of the German carrier E-Plus for €8.6 billion that helped bolster the company’s revenues by 69 percent to €1.9 billion in the first three months of the year. The increase reflected the company’s larger operations in Germany after buying its local rival.In Brazil, where the country’s economy has started to falter, Telefónica last year agreed to buy the local broadband provider GVT for €7.2 billion. Despite fears surrounding weaknesses in the country’s economy, Telefónica reported a 4.8 percent increase in its Brazilian unit’s revenue, to €2.8 billion.And in Spain, the company’s operations reported somewhat improved performance, as its quarterly revenue fell 3.8 percent, to €2.9 billion. That compares with a 4.9 percent drop in Telefónica’s revenues in the last three months of 2014.Advertisement
