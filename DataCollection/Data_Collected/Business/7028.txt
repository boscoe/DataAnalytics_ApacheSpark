Bouygues, the French diversified industrial group, said on Tuesday that its board had rejected an unsolicited takeover offer from Altice for its mobile and broadband business, Bouygues Telecom.Altice, the cable and mobile services provider led by the French entrepreneur Patrick Drahi, had offered to pay 10 billion euros, or about $11.2 billion, in cash, according to a person briefed on the talks.Bouygues, which is led by the French industrialist Martin Bouygues, and Altice both confirmed on Monday that Altice had offered to buy the business, but they did not outline details of the takeover bid.The deal would have combined two of France’s largest mobile providers — Numericable-SFR and Bouygues Telecom — and overtaken Orange as France’s largest cellphone company. The transaction would also have changed the telecommunications landscape in France, reducing the number of main mobile providers to three from four.AdvertisementIn a news release, Bouygues said its board had voted unanimously not to engage in negotiations with Altice.AdvertisementThe company said there was significant risk that regulators would not approve the deal and that it thought Bouygues Telecom was well positioned to take advantage of growth in the telecommunications sector, driven by consumers’ increasing use of digital devices.“The board paid great attention to the consequences of market consolidation on employment as well as the social risks inherent to such an operation,” the company said in the news release.“The Bouygues group,” the news release continued, “has always strived to write an industrial story that creates value in the long term with its employees and suppliers, and in the interests of its customers, while respecting its commitments in terms of investment for the development of French infrastructures.”A representative for Altice was not immediately available to comment.The deal could have faced opposition in France as politicians, including the economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister, Manuel Valls, raised questions about whether the deal would lead to a loss of jobs. Mr. Macron and Mr. Valls have said the country’s telecommunications sector needs to focus on investment.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Altice, which is based in Luxembourg, ultimately paid more than €13.5 billion for the SFR business last year and combined it with Numericable, its cable arm.For Bouygues, France’s third-largest mobile provider, a deal with Numericable-SFR would have brought additional scale as it struggles to compete against the larger Orange and SFR.Bouygues has also faced a bruising price war in the mobile market as Iliad, an upstart rival founded by the French entrepreneur Xavier Niel, has siphoned away customers by offering low-cost deals and improved customer service.AdvertisementTo appease regulators, a combined Numericable-Bouygues Telecom would most likely have been forced to shed assets like wireless spectrum. Iliad, France’s fourth-largest mobile provider through its Free brand, would be a likely buyer for that spectrum and other Numericable-Bouygues assets, according to a person briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Iliad made an unsuccessful bid for T-Mobile US last year.The deal would have been the latest coup for Mr. Drahi, who since 2002 has built Altice into a global operation with cable and cellphone assets in Europe and the Caribbean.In May, Altice agreed to buy a 70 percent stake in Suddenlink Communications of St. Louis for $9.1 billion, giving it a foothold in the United States.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
