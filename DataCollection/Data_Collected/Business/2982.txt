LONDON — Aer Lingus said on Tuesday that its board of directors would be willing to recommend that shareholders accept the latest takeover bid from the parent of British Airways, valued at about $1.5 billion, if certain conditions were met, paving the way for potential deal.Aer Lingus, an Irish carrier, rejected two takeover offers late last year from the parent company, the International Consolidated Airlines Group, or I.A.G.“The board has indicated to I.A.G. that the financial terms are at a level at which it would be willing to recommend, subject to being satisfied with the manner in which I.A.G. proposes to address the interests of relevant parties,” Aer Lingus said in a news release.The International Consolidated Airlines Group needs to win the support of the discount carrier Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus and is the Irish airline’s largest shareholder, as well as the Irish government, which has a 25.1 percent stake.On Tuesday, the International Consolidated Airlines Group said that Aer Lingus would operate as a separate business with its “own brand, management and operations” and would continue to provide connections to Ireland.Aer Lingus would “join the joint business that I.A.G. operates over the North Atlantic with American Airlines, leveraging the natural traffic flows between Ireland and the U.S. and the advantageous geographical position of Dublin for serving connecting flows,” the airline group said.In its latest proposal, the International Consolidated Airlines Group has offered to pay 2.55 euros a share, or about $2.86, including a dividend. That is up from its prior offers of €2.30 a share and €2.40 a share. The deal values Aer Lingus at about €1.36 billion.Ryanair has said it would be prepared to consider an offer for Aer Lingus between €2.50 and €2.70 a share.Analysts have said the International Consolidated Airlines Group deal would be attractive, in part because Aer Lingus holds many takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow Airport near London, the main hub of British Airways.The Irish airline market, given its proximity to Britain and potential to increase British Airways’ traffic at its hub, also makes the deal attractive.The International Consolidated Airlines Group is one of the world’s largest airline companies, carrying more than 77.3 million passengers in 2014. Its portfolio of carriers includes British Airways and two Spanish carriers: Iberia, a full-service airline, and Vueling Airlines, a low-cost carrier.The company posted revenue of €15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014, up 7.4 percent from the period a year earlier.
