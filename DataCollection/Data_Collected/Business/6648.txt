Sears’s first-quarter loss narrowed but sales continue to slump as it prepares the introduction of its real estate investment trust this week to raise cash. Sears Holdings, which operates Sears and Kmart stores, said that it expected the real estate investment trust that it is forming, Seritage Growth Properties, will be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Sears is planning to sell to the REIT about 235 properties, most of them Sears and Kmart stores, and lease them back. The company expects $2.6 billion in proceeds. Sears is trying to replenish its cash as it tries to turn around its long-suffering retail business. The company lost $303 million, or $2.85 a share, in the latest quarter. Losses, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $2 per share. That compares with a loss of $402 million, or $3.79 per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $5.88 billion from $7.88 billion. Sales at Sears’s domestic locations open at least a year dropped 14.5 percent, while sales at domestic Kmarts open at least a year declined 7 percent.A version of this brief appears in print on June 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Sears Is Under Pressure as Rollout of REIT Nears.
