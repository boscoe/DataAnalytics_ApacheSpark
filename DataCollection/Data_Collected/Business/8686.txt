Many there suggested that Mr. Murdoch had shuttered the tabloid at the center of the scandal, The News of the World, costing many people their jobs, in an effort to save her. She subsequently stepped down and was arrested and accused of phone hacking, among other crimes. She was later acquitted.The statement announcing her return mentioned nothing of the phone-hacking scandal, though it did mention that she had been cleared during “investigations of various U.K. newspaper groups.” It said she was “returning to a post that she held four years ago, and will have added responsibilities for the acquisition and development of digital properties.”Ms. Brooks also declined to mention the circumstances of her return. “I am delighted to return to News UK,” she said in the statement announcing her return. “It is a privilege to be back amongst the most talented journalists and executives in the business. I am confident that we can meet the many challenges of this digital age with a combination of cutting-edge technologies and world-class journalism.”She will start on Monday.Advertisement
