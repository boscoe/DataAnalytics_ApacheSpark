McAndrews, Pandora’s chief, added, “We pursued this settlement in order to move the conversation forward and continue to foster a better, collaborative relationship with the labels.”Despite these agreements, Pandora and Sirius XM still face class-action suits filed by members of the 1960s band the Turtles, known for “Happy Together.” And a further announcement Thursday by Pandora suggested that it might still have problems with music publishers, the side of the business that deals with songwriting copyrights.Pandora said that it was abandoning an effort to secure lower songwriting royalties retroactively to 2013, when it bought a small radio station in South Dakota. The company contended — but music industry groups disputed — that owning a radio station entitled it to the slightly lower rates that terrestrial radio broadcasters pay.Pandora said it was taking a $23.9 million charge in its third-quarter results, representing the difference between the rates it had wished to pay and its deals with the licensing agencies Ascap and BMI. Yet Pandora also said that it might still apply for the radio broadcasters’ license to cover future periods, a move that may antagonize music publishers.For its third quarter, Pandora reported $311.6 million in revenue, up 30 percent from a year ago. Its label settlement and write-down of royalties contributed to a net loss of $85.9 million, compared with a loss of just over $2 million last year.Advertisement
