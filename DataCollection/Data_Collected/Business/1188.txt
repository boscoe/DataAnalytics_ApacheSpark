Streaming video from Netflix, HBO and other leading services will no longer count toward data limits under T-Mobile’s higher data plans. T-Mobile already exempts many streaming music services from data limits, but audio does not use as much data as video — a few hours of which can quickly eat up an entire month’s allotment under some plans. The data exemption, called Binge On, applies to 24 services, including most of the major ones, and two from T-Mobile’s competitors Verizon and AT&T, but not YouTube or videos from Facebook feeds. Unlimited video streaming is restricted to those who have data plans of at least three gigabytes, which are a step up from the most basic plans. New customers can sign up starting on Sunday. Existing customers will automatically get it next week.A version of this brief appears in print on November 11, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: T-Mobile Exempts Some Video From Top Plans’ Data Limits .
