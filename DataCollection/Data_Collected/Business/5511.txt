The result was led by a big jump in demand for commercial aircraft. Outside of the transportation category, however, orders fell for a sixth straight month.More worrying was a 0.5 percent drop in demand in a key category that serves as a proxy for future business investment. The retreat followed a 2.2 percent drop in February and marked the seven straight monthly decline.“The report was yet another false positive that looks good in the headline but is eroding away underneath,” said Michael Montgomery, U.S. economist with IHS Global Insight.U.S. manufacturers, who were hurt earlier in the year by a labor dispute at West Coast ports, have been grappling with a sharp rise in the value of the dollar, which makes exported goods more expensive. A stronger dollar also makes imports cheaper and more competitive in the United States.Demand for commercial aircraft, a volatile category, jumped 30.6 percent in March after a 2.2 percent decline in February. Orders for motor vehicles rose 5.4 percent, and the overall transportation category expanded 13.5 percent. Excluding transportation, however, the weakness was widespread with orders down 0.2 percent.Demand for primary metals such as steel edged down 0.2 percent, while orders for machinery dropped 1.5 percent. Demand for communications equipment fell 5.3 percent. Orders for computers and related equipment rose 11 percent in one of the few areas of strength in March.Advertisement
