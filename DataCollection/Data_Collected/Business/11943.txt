TVimpelCom, the Amsterdam-based telecommunications operator, said it would pay $795 million to resolve American and Dutch investigations into a bribery scheme in Uzbekistan. The settlement was announced on Thursday in a federal court in Manhattan, where a subsidiary pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate an American law against corruption by paying $114 million in bribes to a Uzbekistan official. That official, referred to as a “close relative of a high-ranking Uzbek government official,” matched the description of Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan. The Justice Department said VimpelCom, TeliaSonera, a Nordic telecom operator, and Mobile TeleSystems paid more than $800 million to shell companies controlled by the official to help them operate in Uzbekistan.A version of this article appears in print on February 19, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Vimpel Com Pays $795 Million to Settle Bribery Inquiries.
