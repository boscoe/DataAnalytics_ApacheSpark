Boeing plans to use so-called far ultraviolet, a part of the spectrum that the airline says is different from the waves used in tanning beds and is not harmful to people.The bathroom incorporates hands-free devices in the faucet, soap dispenser, trash flap, toilet lid and seat, and hand dryer to reduce the number of surfaces passengers would have to touch. Boeing says it is also working on a hands-free door latch.But donâ€™t expect to see one on a plane anytime soon. Boeing says it still needs to study the idea, including designing a system to lift and close the toilet seat by itself so that all surfaces are exposed during the cleaning cycle. Once the new bathrooms are offered to airlines, it could take years for carriers to update their fleet.Advertisement
