Stocks fell across industries on Wednesday as investors appeared to fret about a number of things: stock valuations, economic growth and rising interest rates.Markets started the day higher, propelled by a jump in energy stocks, but then quickly gave up the gains. A comment by the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, suggesting that stocks were generally overvalued added to the selling pressure.Uncertainty over how quickly interest rates will climb also weighed on markets as yields on bonds continued to rise. Some market experts say they think the Fed will have to increase its short-term rate relatively soon to fight inflation. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note rose to 2.25 percent, its highest level in two months.“There are creeping worries that inflation, which was seen as nonexistent, will soon be part of landscape,” said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott. “There is data suggesting the Federal Reserve will not be in a hurry to raise rates, but people are worried.”AdvertisementEight of the 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the day lower, led by a 1.2 percent slump in telecommunications companies.AdvertisementThe S.&P. 500 fell 9.31 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,080.15.

But a separate report showed that labor costs jumped 5 percent in the first quarter, after a 4.2 percent rise in the fourth quarter.“I think we’re going to get higher rates, and the stock market is going to struggle with this,” said Jim Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management, noting that the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in March, down nearly half from its peak less than six years ago. “It doesn’t take much to overheat when you’re near full employment.”
