CreditBrendan Bannon for The New York Times        BUFFALO —  Until two weeks ago, Ace Callwood had never set foot in this chilly, postindustrial city, but he committed, sight unseen, to move his fledgling technology business and its four employees here. The lure that drew him was cash: a guaranteed investment of at least $250,000 and a shot at as much as $1 million.Mr. Callwood’s company, Painless1099, was one of 11 finalists in 43North, America’s largest business-idea contest, which recently held its second annual competition. With $5 million in prize money, the venture aims to retain local entrepreneurs and attract new ones to Buffalo, a city that has lost more than half its population, and many of the industrial giants that once fueled its economy, over the last 65 years.Buffalo’s downtown is filled with signs of both the area’s struggles and its steps toward revitalization. New restaurants and retailers, along with the decades-old ones that have endured, sit adjacent to derelict buildings, many of which still bear architectural traces of the area’s more prosperous past. The toll of Buffalo’s economic troubles is even starker in the outskirts of the city, which has a poverty rate that tops 30 percent and a median household income of around $31,000.This city has been a focus of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who visits often and pledged $1 billion in tax breaks, grants and other aid. A portion of that money helped seed 43North, which emerged from brainstorming sessions with consultants hired to help develop a plan for the so-called Buffalo billion. The program also has private sector sponsors.AdvertisementOne of their suggestions was to create a fund for microgrants to promising new ventures — perhaps $5,000 each to 100 or so recipients, recalled Jordan Levy, a venture capitalist who is the chairman of 43North’s board of directors.Advertisement“It was the stupidest thing I’d ever heard,” said Mr. Levy, a partner at SoftBank Capital. “Who is going to come to Buffalo if it’s not the biggest, most monumental business competition in the entire world?”Business competitions have their roots in academia; there are dozens of university-affiliated contests for students, some with lucrative prizes.But a growing number of regions are, like Buffalo, beginning to use them as economic development tools intended to increase local entrepreneurship. Organizations in Pittsburgh, Detroit, northern Michigan, St. Louis, Alaska, Wisconsin, Nevada and elsewhere have run contests awarding cash to those building new ventures in the area. The grants are typically in the $5,000 to $50,000 range.“We’re seeing more people trying to do what 43North is doing — trying to attract people to a city or state,” said Katie Baker, the director of iStart, a site that sells software for competition organizers. “It’s an easy way for economic development groups to create a pipeline of prospects.”The $5 million 43North contest stands out for having the biggest prize pool of any competition in the United States and the largest individual prizes. Most of the money comes from state sources, although corporate and philanthropic sponsors also contribute.Instead of splitting their funding among dozens of companies, the organizers decided to direct it like a fire hose at just a few. The grand-prize winner collects $1 million, and 10 finalists receive investments of either $250,000 or $500,000. In return, each company gives 43North a 5 percent equity stake and commits to being based in Buffalo for at least 12 months.The inaugural contest last year drew nearly 7,000 applicants. This year, 11,000 companies entered.Painless1099 was started in Richmond, Va., where Mr. Callwood, 25, and one of his two co-founders met as university students. After experimenting with a few profitable entrepreneurial projects like Coffitivity, a productivity app that mimics the ambient sounds of a coffee shop, the team hit on the idea of creating a tool to automate tax planning for America’s growing number of freelance workers. On the hunt for seed funding, Mr. Callwood came across 43North and decided to apply. The group learned in early October that it had made the cut.AdvertisementIn addition to cash, 43North gives its 11 winners a year of support services, including mentorship and free office space. Its most valuable perk, though, may be the community created. Assembled together into 43North’s incubator space, the entrepreneurs have peers with whom to talk, network and commiserate.“We’ve built incredible personal and professional relationships here,” said Daniel Shani, 29, the chief executive of Energy Intelligence, an alternative energy start-up that began in Boston and moved to Buffalo after winning $500,000 in last year’s competition.“You can get office space and mentors anywhere; there are a lot of smart people in a lot of cities that can help you grow your business,” Mr. Shani said. “The people are what really separates this from other accelerators or competitions that we’ve been a part of.”City officials and business leaders are eager to assist growing companies, and Buffalo’s residents are welcoming to newcomers, he added.The Painless1099 team encountered that enthusiasm on its very first day in the city, as the group wandered around searching for potential places to live. “We met a lot of neighbors who were like, ‘Do you want to watch the Bills game with us?’ It was scary friendly,” said Justin Kauszler, 26, sounding both pleased and bemused.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Gavigan, the executive director of 43North. “We want entrepreneurship to be part of the culture and to be something that people see that they can pursue.”While many of 43North’s finalists are transplants, the top prize in both years has gone to a local company. This year’s $1 million winner, ACV Auctions, is an online auction platform that lets car dealers buy and sell wholesale inventory. Founded 11 months ago, the company plans to use the cash to expand to new markets and hire additional employees for software development, design, customer service and sales.ACV and last year’s winner, ASI, a start-up developing a new manufacturing process for metal components, are both firmly rooted in the Buffalo area and determined to remain there as they grow. But will those who arrived from elsewhere stick around?AdvertisementAs last year’s cohort approaches the end of its yearlong residency commitment, the answer, for many, remains uncertain. Mr. Shani, now a passionate Buffalo booster, plans to retain a presence in the area, but where his core team goes next will depend in part on where it secures its next funding round and commercial customers.Lauren Washington, 32, who moved from New York City last year to work on KeepUp, a social media management app, is the only full-time member of her team living in Buffalo. Her six other employees work remotely, and Ms. Washington, who is currently pitching investors, has not yet decided where she will be in a few months.As more places experiment with business competitions and grants, the big question hanging over those efforts — do they work? — remains hard to answer.An analysis by the World Bank of one of the world’s largest contests, a Nigerian competition that awarded grants of around $50,000 to several thousand entrepreneurs, found some promising signs. Three years after winning, the businesses that received grants had higher survival rates, sales, profit and employment than those in a control group.But business dynamics vary widely in different geographies, and in the United States, it is hard to find contests with track records long enough to generate meaningful data.“This is an understudied area,” said Yasuyuki Motoyama, the director of research for the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, an organization that funds entrepreneurship programs and scholarship. Mr. Motoyama has been examining one of the larger efforts in the United States, the Arch Grants program in St. Louis, which awards $50,000 to its winners.Of the 65 companies that received grants since the program began in 2012, only five have gone out of business, according to Ginger Imster, the program’s executive director. Six have relocated to other cities. The remaining ventures have created or retained around 300 jobs in Missouri and raised $65 million from investors, by the program’s calculation.Mr. Motoyama sees anecdotal evidence that Arch Grants recipients benefited from having a peer group of fellow entrepreneurs in proximity, and from the aid the organization’s staff and mentors offered in connecting them with potential customers, investors, employees and other resources. He wonders, though, if that early helping hand will carry through to longer-term business success.Advertisement“Selecting winners is really difficult,” he said. “Look at the venture capital industry; even the professionals have a hard time. It’s very unlikely that public entities and nonprofits can choose winners.”Mr. Levy, who knows too well about the long odds in venture capital, agrees with that assessment — but he doesn’t care. He sees other measures for success in Buffalo.“Most incubator and accelerator programs are failures. The companies that have gone through them are failures,” he said. “I don’t necessarily think this will be different. But it’s doing what it’s supposed to do: It’s bringing companies to Buffalo, and it’s changing the mind-set. It’s spurring people to take risks that they didn’t take before.”A version of this article appears in print on November 5, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Buffalo Entices Entrepreneurs to Relocate With $5 Million in Rewards.
