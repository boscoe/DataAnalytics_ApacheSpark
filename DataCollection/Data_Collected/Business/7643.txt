That adds to an estimated 40 million members Amazon had attracted so far to Prime, which offers free shipments on many goods for an annual $99 fee.Eager Prime Day shoppers in the United States made its Fire TV Sticks “the fastest-selling deal on an Amazon device ever,” the company said. Amazon said it also sold 47,000 televisions on its United States site, a spike of 1,300 percent compared with the same day last year, and 41,000 Bose headphones compared with just eight the previous Wednesday.“Going into this, we weren’t sure whether Prime Day would be a one-time thing or if it would become an annual event,” Mr. Greeley said. After Prime Day’s results, he said, “we’ll definitely be doing this again.”Independent data confirmed the sales surge. ChannelAdvisor, which tracks third-party sales on Amazon, said that Amazon’s sales on Wednesday jumped 93 percent in the United States and 53 percent in Europe compared with the same day of the week last year.But neither Black Friday nor this week’s Prime Day are Amazon’s biggest-grossing sales days. According to ChannelAdvisor, Amazon recorded far higher sales on the Monday after Thanksgiving last year, which has come to be known as Cyber Monday.Still, the Prime Day sales numbers “are impressive, considering it didn’t even exist last year,” said Sarah O’Dea of ChannelAdvisor.An Amazon spokeswoman, Ana Rigby, confirmed that Cyber Monday was its biggest shopping day of the year, but declined to disclose any sales figures for that day.The event, commemorating Amazon’s 20th anniversary, was a bid by Amazon to add more users to its Prime membership base. Though Amazon remains the undisputed leader in e-commerce, other retail giants have increased efforts to steal away shoppers, including Walmart, which this year started offering unlimited shipping for $50 a year.Walmart had a sale of its own on Wednesday. Popular deals included a $399.99 deal for a 32-gigabyte Apple iPad Air and $12.35 dolls of characters from Disney’s “Frozen” movie.On Amazon, the day’s best-selling item in the United States was “The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy” DVD. Top sellers in other countries included a Lenovo touch-screen notebook (Britain), a green smoothie mix (Japan) and Croc sandals (Germany and Austria).Advertisement
