Last fall, the company struck a deal to license two of its main magazine titles to the Meredith Corporation, providing content for those publications.Now, the company itself will become a part of Sequential Brands, whose business revolves around buying brands and then licensing them out for a fee.All told, Sequential Brands expects its portfolio to fetch nearly $3.75 billion in annual sales with the addition of Martha Stewart Living.“This merger is positioned to further the growth and expansion of the unique Martha home and lifestyle brand,” Ms. Stewart, 73, said in a statement. “We now have the opportunity to tap into Sequential’s expertise and resources to expand our merchandising business both domestically and abroad.”Under the terms of the deal, Sequential Brands will pay $6.15 a share, using a mix of cash and stock. That price represents a roughly 20 percent premium to Martha Stewart Living’s closing price last Wednesday, before The Wall Street Journal reported on the discussions.But all the same, investors seemed dismayed by the announcement, as Martha Stewart’s stock price fell 12 percent on Monday to $6.12, below the offer price.Martha Stewart Living was granted a 30-day “go-shop” period, in which it can solicit higher takeover offers.Sequential Brands was advised by Tengram Capital Partners and the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, while its board was advised by Consensus Securities.Martha Stewart Living was advised by Moelis & Company and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. Ms. Stewart herself took counsel from Grubman, Shire & Meiselas and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.Advertisement
