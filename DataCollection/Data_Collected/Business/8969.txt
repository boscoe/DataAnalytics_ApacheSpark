LONDON — The London Stock Exchange Group said on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell Proquote, a market data provider and retail trading platform in Britain, to the Australian company Iress.Proquote is marketed as a “cost-effective” option for smaller trading firms and funds, in-lieu of more expensive providers like Bloomberg and Reuters terminals.In a news release, the stock exchange operator said that Proquote was no longer “central to its strategy” for its information services business. The exchange acquired Proquote in 2003.The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Last year, the London exchange bought Russell Investments, the owner of the Russell 2000 stock market index, for $2.7 billion. In February, the group put the investment management arm of Russell Investments up for sale in a widely expected move to focus on increasing the size of its index business.The Proquote deal also includes LSEHub, an order-routing business that links institutional investors and brokers.The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter.Iress, which is based in Melbourne, Australia, provides technology for financial markets and wealth management in Australia, parts of Asia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. It employs about 1,340 people.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
