That is an increase from 858 million francs in the period a year earlier.UBS said the period was “characterized by very low levels of client activity and pronounced risk aversion” by its customers.The fourth quarter included a tax-related gain of 715 million francs, alongside 365 million francs in charges for litigation and regulatory matters and a 257 million francs charge to repurchase debt.“Despite a very challenging environment, we had an excellent year, both in terms of shareholder returns and strengthened client relationships,” Sergio P. Ermotti, the UBS chief executive, said in a news release. “Going forward, we will continue with the disciplined execution of our strategy while investing for profitable and sustainable growth.”UBS warned the underlying macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical risks that have weighed on the markets recently are “unlikely to be resolved in the foreseeable future.”Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.“Negative market performance and substantial market volatility since the start of 2016, low interest rates, and the relative strength of the Swiss franc, particularly against the euro, continue to present headwinds,” UBS said.In the fourth quarter, operating income rose slightly to 6.78 billion francs, from 6.75 billion francs in the same period a year earlier. Operating expenses increased to 6.54 billion francs, from 6.34 billion francs in the fourth quarter of 2014.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined to 1.76 billion francs in the quarter, from 1.87 billion francs in the same period a year earlier.In recent years, UBS has shrunk its investment bank and shifted its focus to wealth management, an area it sees as more consistently profitable, but which was hit hard by turbulence in the markets in the fourth quarter.In the wealth management division, UBS said pretax profit declined to 344 million francs in the period, from 646 million francs in the fourth quarter of 2014.UBS said that its wealth management business saw 3.4 billion francs in net new money outflows in the fourth quarter.The wealth management business in the Americas, which is operated separately, reported a pretax profit of $13 million in the fourth quarter, from $217 million in the same period a year earlier.UBS’s investment bank posted a pretax profit of 80 million francs in the period, from 217 million francs in the fourth quarter of 2014.Advertisement
