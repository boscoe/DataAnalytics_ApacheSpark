Here’s a look at some of the highlights.Fox lost “American Idol,” so cue the reboots. The way Fox executives explain it, familiar titles do not require the same “marketing muscle” as new shows, Dana Walden, the co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Monday morning. Among the findings in the intellectual property drawer? “Lethal Weapon,” “Prison Break,” “The Exorcist” and …The “24” reboot will debut after the network’s broadcast of the Super Bowl. Last year, “The X-Files” premiered after the National Football Conference championship game — which was watched by 45 million people on Fox — and that six-episode limited series promptly turned into a hit. So, how about more than 100 million viewers? After the post-Super Bowl debut, Fox plans to broadcast the second episode of “24: Legacy” the following night.Speaking of “The X-Files,” Fox won’t be bringing it back any time soon, which is disappointing news for the network. Mr. Newman said that the earliest the show could possibly come back would be at least a year from now, if not longer. Apparently pulling together the schedules of David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson and the show’s creator, Chris Carter, has not been that easy. Ms. Walden did say they were all “on board” for a return.NBC is no longer the only player in town. After the success of January’s “Grease: Live!,” Fox is committing to the live musical game. Mr. Newman said the network did not have any official titles yet but was looking to add at least one live musical event to the schedule.MONDAY8-9 p.m. “Gotham”9-10 p.m. “Lucifer”TUESDAY8-8:30 p.m. “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”8:30-9 p.m. “New Girl”9-10 p.m. “Scream Queens”WEDNESDAY8-9 p.m. “Lethal Weapon”9-10 p.m. “Empire”THURSDAY8-9 p.m. “Rosewood”9-10 p.m. “Bones”FRIDAY8-9 p.m. “Hell’s Kitchen”9-10 p.m. “The Exorcist”SATURDAY7-10:30 p.m. College FootballSUNDAY7-7:30 p.m. The N.F.L.7:30-8 p.m. “The OT”/“Bob’s Burgers”8-8:30 p.m. “The Simpsons”8:30-9 p.m. “Son of Zorn”9-9:30 p.m. “Family Guy”9:30-10 p.m. “The Last Man on Earth”Advertisement
