The move will make Mitsubishi the first Japanese automaker to stop production in the United States and Europe. Dan Irvin, a spokesman, said the company had reviewed its global supply chain and decided it was necessary to end production. Mitsubishi officials said they hoped to find a buyer that would maintain the factoryâ€™s employment. Rod DeVary, the president of the U.A.W. Local 2488, said workers were told Friday that the plant would stop production on Nov. 30. Annual production at the plant, which makes the Outlander sport utility vehicle, has fallen to 64,000 vehicles from more than 200,000 in 2002. Advertisement
