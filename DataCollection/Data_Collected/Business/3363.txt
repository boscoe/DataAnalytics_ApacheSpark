The ratings agency lowered Greece’s long-term rating by one notch to B- and warned about its weak cash position. But the new Greek government, barely two weeks in power, is insisting it will not give up on demands to overhaul the country’s bailout agreements and bring an end to years of austerity. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece met on Friday with the government’s top finance officials, who said the new administration would not renege on its election pledge to renegotiate the bailout deal. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis hopes to make more progress in getting Greece’s creditors to agree to change course on Wednesday at a special meeting of the eurozone’s 19 finance ministers, which was called Friday by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the so-called Eurogroup, to discuss Greece’s debts.
