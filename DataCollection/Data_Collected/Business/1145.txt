FRANKFURT — Volkswagen’s recent disclosure that it reported false fuel economy and carbon dioxide readings to European regulators was prompted by an internal whistle-blower, the company said on Sunday.Volkswagen admitted last Tuesday that it had underreported carbon dioxide emissions on 800,000 diesel- and gasoline-powered cars in Europe. That disclosure added to the automaker’s credibility problems, which began in September when it admitted that it had installed software on millions of its diesel cars in recent years to enable them to cheat on air pollution tests.In trying to determine who was responsible for the diesel cheating scandal, Volkswagen’s internal investigators have reportedly been hampered by an ingrained fear of delivering bad news to superiors. But in the case of the new disclosure, some employees have evidently been willing to come forward under the company’s new management.Volkswagen on Sunday broadly confirmed a report in Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper, that an engineer at the company had volunteered information about how employees had manipulated tests for carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy. Tires, for example, were filled with more air than normal, the newspaper reported.Advertisement“In the course of internal investigations, employees have admitted that there were irregularities in communication of fuel consumption values,” Volkswagen said in a statement on Sunday.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            Eric Felber, a Volkswagen spokesman, said he could not provide further details.The diesel cheating scandal involves the company’s manipulation of pollution control systems on 11 million cars that enabled them to pass emissions control tests in laboratory settings but allowed the cars on the road to emit up to 40 times the allowable limits of nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can damage lungs.AdvertisementThe more recently disclosed problem involves understating the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by 800,000 Volkswagen cars — mainly diesels but also some gasoline vehicles — sold in Europe. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.The United States and the European Union have both set standards aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars. But unlike the United States, many countries in Europe have added a further inducement to owners of gasoline and diesel cars: allowing tax credits based on low carbon emissions in relation to higher fuel economy. Volkswagen said last week that it would set aside 2 billion euros, or about $2.1 billion, to pay back European tax credits the company and car owners had received under false pretenses.In the case of the diesel scandal, the cheating apparently began around 2008 after it became apparent that Volkswagen would be unable to achieve the clean-diesel promises it had made publicly as the company bet a big part of its future on diesel vehicles.Overstatement of carbon dioxide goals may have followed a similar course. In 2012, Martin Winterkorn, who was then the chief executive of Volkswagen, said at the Geneva International Motor Show that by 2015 the company would cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 30 percent from 2006 levels. If met, the goal would have meant that Volkswagen vehicles would have performed even better than the targets set by European regulations in the effort to slow global warming.Employees were afraid to admit to Mr. Winterkorn that they could not meet the goals, and decided to cheat, Bild am Sonntag reported. The newspaper’s reports about Volkswagen have been reliable in the past, and a person close to top management, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said he had no reason to doubt the information.Mr. Winterkorn resigned within a week of the disclosure of the diesel deception by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States.AdvertisementThe company has said that 11 million cars, including 500,000 in the United States, have the illegal software. Volkswagen is trying to find a way to make the vehicles compliant with regulations.But it remains a mystery who was responsible for the software used to fool regulators about nitrogen oxide emissions.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Employees may be more willing to speak under the new chief executive, Matthias Müller, who replaced Mr. Winterkorn and vowed to overhaul the company’s management culture.As part of an effort to demonstrate more openness, top officials at Volkswagen personally informed Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany, about the false carbon dioxide claims before issuing the public statement last week, according to a person briefed on the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Mr. Müller and Hans Dieter Pötsch, chairman of the supervisory board, traveled to Berlin to speak with Ms. Merkel and other high-ranking government officials. The meeting was first reported by Bild am Sonntag.Volkswagen’s most recent admissions about false carbon dioxide claims also put pressure on the German government, raising questions about why regulators did not scrutinize automaker data more closely.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about underreported carbon dioxide emissions in 800,000 diesel- and gasoline-powered Volkswagen vehicles in Europe referred incompletely to the approach the United States and European countries take in regulating carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars. Both the United States and European countries have specific regulations on such emissions; it is not the case that the Europeans are more focused on reducing carbon dioxide emissions than the United States. (European countries have, however, added further incentives, like giving tax credits to owners of gasoline or diesel cars based on their low emissions of carbon dioxide.)A version of this article appears in print on November 9, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline:  Under New Management, Volkswagen’s Investigation Turns Up a Whistle-Blower .
