The inquiry by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers Focuses from the 2012 and 2013 model years, according to documents posted Wednesday on the agency’s website. In the documents, the agency said 73 drivers had reported problems with latches. In one case, a driver reported an injury when a door rebounded after an attempt to close it. Others said the doors had to be tied to keep them shut. One complaint read, “It is just a matter of time until someone falls out of a moving vehicle and is killed or injured.” Advertisement
