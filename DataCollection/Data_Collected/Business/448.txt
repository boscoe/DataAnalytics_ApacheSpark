It also administers employee share plans, pensions and employee benefit programs.Last year, Equiniti took a controlling stake in MyCSP, which administers the Civil Service pension plan in Britain. It also owns Selftrade, an execution-only stockbroker.The Equitini offering is expected to include sales to institutional and professional investors, as well as to brokers and other financial intermediaries who will facilitate the sale of shares to retail clients in Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.Barclays and Goldman Sachs are leading the offering.
