The recall covers cars from the 2011 and 2012 model years mainly in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The cables can weaken and break as people move in the seats, causing the seatbelts to fail. G.M. says it knows of no crashes and one minor injury. Thirty-six warranty claims have been made, the company said. G.M. also is recalling 53,000 Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon pickup trucks to fix seat frame hooks that were not installed properly. G.M. says it knows of no crashes or injuries caused by the problem.
