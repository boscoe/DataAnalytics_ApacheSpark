The issue affected transactions at the company’s R.B.S., National Westminster Bank, Coutts and Ulster Bank brands.“We are aware of an issue which has resulted in a delay to payments and direct debits being applied to some customer accounts,” an R.B.S. spokesman said. “We have fixed the underlying issue, we apologize for the inconvenience caused, and we are working flat out to get these payments updated for our customers no later than Saturday.”The spokesman added, “We will ensure no customers are left out of pocket as a result of this issue.”The disruption is one of several embarrassing technology problems for R.B.S. in recent years.The lender was fined 56 million pounds, or about $87 million, by British regulators last year over a technology failure that left millions of customers unable to access their accounts for several weeks in 2012.A computer malfunction in 2013 left customers unable to use their debit and credit cards for a time during the Christmas shopping season.R.B.S. is expected to complete a program this year to increase investment in its information technology systems by £750 million.The British government announced this month that it would begin to sell down its 80 percent stake in the bank and said it was prepared to sell some of that stake at a loss. The government has said it hopes that selling some of its shares will improve the marketability of its remaining holdings in the bank.Shares of R.B.S. were down 0.17 percent at 349.70 pence in midday trading on Wednesday in London.Advertisement
