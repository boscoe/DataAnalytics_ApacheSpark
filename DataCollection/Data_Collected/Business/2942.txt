LONDON — The French conglomerate Saint-Gobain suffered a setback on Monday in its bid to take control of Sika, the Swiss specialty chemical maker.In December, Saint-Gobain agreed to buy a controlling stake held by the Burkhard family in Sika for 2.75 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.1 billion. But Sika’s board of directors and its management have publicly opposed the deal. On Monday, Sika said that it would restrict the voting rights of the Burkhard family to 5 percent of its shares under its articles of association. Because of its unusual ownership structure, 84 percent of Sika is owned by public shareholders, but the Burkard family controls its voting rights.Sika said the family had previously been exempted from the rule because of its “close association with Sika” and “repeated public assertions of its intention to retain this close association and to protect the company against takeovers.” “Now that the Burkard family/SWH have formed a group with Saint-Gobain, this historical privilege must be considered lost, together with the right to convene extraordinary General Meetings,” Sika said in a news release. Under the proposed deal, Saint-Gobain would acquire Schenker-Winkler Holding, a Burkhard family-owned company that has 16.1 percent of Sika’s capital and 52.4 percent of its voting rights.In a news release, Saint-Gobain said on Monday that Sika’s actions “are clearly against all corporate law and governance principles in Switzerland.”Last month, the Burkhard family called for an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders to remove several directors who have opposed the sale, including Sika’s chairman, Paul J. Hälg.Shares of Sika rose 1.3 percent to 2,967 francs in afternoon trading in Zurich on Monday, while shares of Saint-Gobain declined 1.7 percent to 37.89 euros, or about $42.45, in Paris.Sika is one of the world’s largest makers of specialty chemicals for the construction industry, including adhesives and sealants used in waterproofing and soundproofing. It employs more than 16,000 people in 84 countries and posted revenue of 5.14 billion francs in 2013.Saint-Gobain, which traces its roots to 1665, produces flat glass and high-performance materials for the housing and industrial markets, as well as iron pipes and building materials for the construction industry. It employs about 190,000 people in 64 countries and posted revenue of €42 billion in 2013.
