It had 436 million euros, or about $479 million, in revenue in 2014 and employs 1,200 people.Last month, Cellnex acquired a 90 percent stake in a company that controls more than 7,300 towers in Italy from the Italian mobile telecommunications provider Wind Telecomunicazioni for €693 million. Wind kept a 10 percent stake in the Italian company that was sold.Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and CaixaBank are serving as global coordinators on the offering.Advertisement
