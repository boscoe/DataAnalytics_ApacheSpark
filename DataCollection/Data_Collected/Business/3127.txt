LOS ANGELES — While viewers work through this year’s Oscar films, a court here is still working its way through one of last year’s nominees, “Gravity.” On Friday, Judge Margaret M. Morrow of the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles dismissed a complaint by the author Tess Gerritsen, who had claimed that Warner Bros. breached a contract with her when it made “Gravity” without giving her credit or 2.5 percent of the film’s net profit.In a 48-page ruling, Judge Morrow ruled that Ms. Gerritsen, who in 1999 sold rights to her novel “Gravity” to New Line Cinema and one of its units, did not sufficiently support her claim that Warner, which has since absorbed the New Line operation, was now bound to give pay and credit under that deal. In a statement, Warner said it was “gratified” by the ruling. A lawyer for Ms. Gerritsen, Glen Kulik, said he expected to respond with an amended complaint. “I do not think that will be hard to do,” he said in a statement.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
