LONDON — A British appeals court on Monday declined to overturn the conviction of Tom Hayes, a former trader at Citigroup and UBS, for conspiring to manipulate a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor, but it did reduce Mr. Hayes’s sentence.At a hearing on Monday, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal reduced Mr. Hayes’s sentence to 11 years in prison, down from 14 years, his original sentence following his conviction in August.Mr. Hayes was the first person to go to trial in Britain on criminal charges related to manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. His case was seen as a bellwether for British authorities, who have been criticized in the United States for not being as aggressive as the Justice Department when it comes to pursuing financial crime.“The culpability was high and the harm serious. A deterrent element was plainly required,” the court said in its ruling.Advertisement“However, we are of the view that taking into account all the circumstances (in particular his age, his non-managerial position in the two banks, and his mild Asperger’s condition), that the overall sentence was longer than was necessary to punish the appellant and to deter others.”AdvertisementA lawyer for Mr. Hayes did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.The conviction of Mr. Hayes came more than three years after a conspiracy among traders to manipulate Libor first came to light.The ensuing scandal has led to billions of dollars in fines and has rocked the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks, including Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            “This court must make clear to all in the financial and other markets in the City of London that conduct of this type, involving fraudulent manipulation of the markets, will result in severe sentences of considerable length which, depending on the circumstances, may be significantly greater than the present total sentence,” the appeals court said in its ruling.The Serious Fraud Office, a British agency that investigates fraud, had accused Mr. Hayes of being a ringleader among more than a dozen traders in what authorities said was a brazen scheme to manipulate Libor, which helps determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans. He was accused of misconduct engaged in from 2006 to 2010.Mr. Hayes’s lawyers had argued that he was open about his conduct and did not believe at the time that he was acting dishonestly.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The authorities said he admitted to rigging rates and provided testimony against many former friends and colleagues, including his half brother.Mr. Hayes testified during the trial that he decided to cooperate with British authorities because he feared being extradited to the United States, where he is also facing criminal charges, and wanted to remain close to his wife and child.AdvertisementAfter providing the voluntary testimony to British authorities, Mr. Hayes stopped cooperating with prosecutors in 2013 and chose to plead not guilty to the charges in Britain.Mr. Hayes worked at the Royal Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Canada before joining UBS in 2006, where he worked in Tokyo trading yen derivatives. In 2009, Citigroup lured him away with a multimillion-dollar deal, but he was terminated by the bank the next year.His lawyers argued that Mr. Hayes did not believe his conduct was dishonest, saying that he made no effort to hide his actions. In his voluntary testimony, Mr. Hayes told the authorities that the practice was “widespread” and “blatant” in the industry.A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Court Reduces Sentence for Ex-Trader in Libor Case.
