The object in question, known as an extruder, is a two-piece syringelike object with corkscrew-type ridges around the outside that can be used to squeeze Play-Doh into what looks like decorative cake frosting. The case began to draw national attention after a TV station in Tulsa, Okla., KTUL, polled parents for their reaction. By Christmas, Hasbro’s Facebook page was flooded with comments. The company said in a statement that it was “in the process of updating all future Play-Doh products with a different tool.” Unlike many parents who were not amused, Erin Rivers, a mother of two from Melbourne, Fla., “just started cracking up at it, I couldn’t help it.” She said her children did not notice, but she wondered why no one at Hasbro did: “Not one person said, ‘Does anyone else think this looks like a penis?’ ” Advertisement
