Pabst Brewing said on Wednesday that it was going home to Milwaukee to open a new brewery and restaurant next year near the site of its original brewery. Pabst, which is now based in Los Angeles, said it planned to sign a multiyear lease and open to the public next summer. Pabst traces its roots to 1844 in Milwaukee, but it closed its brewery there nearly 20 years ago. Pabst said its new brewery would make many of its pre-Prohibition brands, as well as new craft beers. The site will include a tasting room, beer garden and a restaurant and bar.A version of this brief appears in print on July 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Pabst Brewing Plans a Return to Milwaukee.
