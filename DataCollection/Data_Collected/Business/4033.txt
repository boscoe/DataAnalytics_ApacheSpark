NXP Semiconductors, a big chip manufacturer, is near a deal to acquire a smaller peer, Freescale Semiconductor, in a cash-and-stock transaction, people briefed on the matter said on Sunday.An agreement could be announced as soon as Sunday evening, one of these people said, while cautioning that the talks could still collapse.If completed, the combination would unite two big makers of chips for industries ranging from automobiles to networking to mobile payments.As of Friday evening, NXP had a market value of about $21 billion, while Freescale had a market capitalization of about $11 billion.Both companies were previously parts of bigger corporations: NXP was formerly a division of Philips, while Freescale was a division of Motorola. Both were also owned by groups of private equity firms and returned to the public markets in rocky initial public offerings.Representatives for NXP and Freescale were not immediately available for comment.News of the discussions was reported earlier by Reuters.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
