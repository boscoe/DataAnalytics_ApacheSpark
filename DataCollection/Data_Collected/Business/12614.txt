WASHINGTON — Automatic braking will be standard in most cars and light trucks within six years, and on heavier sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks within eight years, under an agreement that transportation officials and representatives from 20 automakers announced on Thursday.The voluntary pact means that the important safety technology will be available more quickly than if the government had gone through the lengthy process of issuing mandatory rules, said Mark Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.“A commitment of this magnitude is unprecedented, and it will bring more safety to more Americans sooner,” Mr. Rosekind said.But some safety advocates have filed a petition asking the government to issue those mandatory regulations.AdvertisementThey say voluntary agreements aren’t enforceable, and that since automatic braking is already available in some cars, issuing rules requiring the technology could be done faster than the six to eight years allowed under the agreement announced on Thursday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Federal auto safety regulators estimate that more than half of those crashes could be avoided or mitigated by automatic braking or systems that warn drivers of an impending collision.Of the 194 most popular vehicle models already on the market, 17 come with automatic braking as standard equipment. It is available as part of an options package in 71 other models.A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Automakers in Agreement on Standard for Brakes.
