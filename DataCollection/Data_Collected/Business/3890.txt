It would also be the first major bet by HP since announcing plans to split itself into two last year.All told, however, buying Aruba would not significantly dent HP’s finances: The target company had a market value of about $2 billion as of market close on Tuesday, before Bloomberg News reported on the talks.Buying Aruba would bolster HP’s networking business. The 13-year-old networking equipment maker specializes in wireless networking access point hardware and software, tools used by the likes of hotels, universities and shopping malls.The company reported $728.9 million in its fiscal year ended July 31, up nearly 22 percent from the prior year. Its net loss narrowed during the same time, to $29 million.Shares in Aruba leaped 22 percent on Wednesday after the Bloomberg News report, while those in HP fell nearly 10 percent.Representatives for HP and Aruba declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.Advertisement
