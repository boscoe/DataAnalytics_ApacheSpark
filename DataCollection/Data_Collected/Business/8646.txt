Rosekind, the safety agency’s administrator, estimated that 34 million defective inflaters existed in about 30 million vehicles in the United States.But on Tuesday, another agency official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that regulators now believed that 23.4 million defective inflaters were installed in a total of 19.2 million vehicles in the United States. The official said that some vehicles had been “double-counted” in the earlier estimate and that other vehicles included were sold in markets outside the United States.The official said that the worldwide estimate of faulty Takata airbags remained at about 34 million.In the briefing, the official said that Mr. Rosekind and other safety regulators were eager to hold a public event this fall to raise consumer awareness of the airbag problem, and prioritize repairs in regions of the country where heat and humidity could increase the likelihood of failures.“One possible outcome will be an order to automakers and suppliers that would provide a framework to address the greatest risks,” the official said.So far, 4.4 million airbag inflaters have been replaced among the 23.4 million in the defective population, the official said.But Mr. Rosekind has expressed concern that the replacement program has been sluggish, and that more attention should be directed at fixing airbags in southern parts of the United States. He has visited Florida to raise awareness about faulty airbags, and to encourage consumers to heed recall notices and schedule repairs.At least 11 automakers have been affected by the recall of faulty Takata airbags.A consortium of automakers is conducting testing for causes of the defect. The agency official said on Tuesday that the government had completed the first phase of its own testing program and would continue the effort.The official declined to say how long it would take for all the affected airbag inflaters to be replaced.The agency is also investigating whether Takata violated federal laws in failing to recall the defective airbags sooner. The official said the agency was cooperating with a Justice Department inquiry into Takata as well.Advertisement
