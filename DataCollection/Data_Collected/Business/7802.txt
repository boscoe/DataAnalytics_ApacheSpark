Kohlberg Kravis Roberts reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday, buoyed by gains in its biggest holdings and a favorable fund-raising environment.The company, led by Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, said its profit — a metric called economic net income, which includes unrealized gains or losses — was $839.9 million in the quarter, a 67.4 percent gain from $501.6 million in the same period a year earlier.Its private equity portfolio helped to drive the gain, lifted by the publicly listed companies in which the company owns shares, like the hospital operator HCA Holdings, Qingdao Haier and GoDaddy. The share prices of many of those companies had double-digit gains in the quarter. The holdings surged despite a slight decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the same period.The company also marked up the value of its private investments, including the First Data Corporation, the payment processor that filed documents this week laying the groundwork for a public offering of stock. Kohlberg Kravis took the company private in 2007 at the height of the buyout boom before the financial crisis.AdvertisementOver all, the private equity portfolio gained 7.4 percent in the quarter.Kohlberg Kravis’s earnings amounted to 88 cents a share after taxes, beating expectations of 62 cents a share in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.Advertisement“Our strong investment performance resulted in $840 million of economic net income, a record quarterly figure for K.K.R.,” Mr. Kravis and Mr. Roberts, the co-chief executives, said in a statement. “Additionally, we continued to scale several growth areas including our infrastructure and alternative credit businesses.”
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            Kohlberg Kravis’s distributable earnings, a measure of the amount of cash generated that will be given to shareholders, fell by 30 percent to $491.4 million, compared with $701.0 million over the same period last year.The figure was lower in part because the firm sold fewer of its private businesses than it did during the same quarter last year, when Kohlberg Kravis closed a $5.8 billion sale of Oriental Brewery of South Korea to Anheuser-Busch InBev, leading to a bumper quarter.Kohlberg Kravis also demonstrated its fund-raising prowess, closing two big funds so far this year. It raised $1.3 billion for its Lending Partners II fund, more than double the amount raised for the first fund. The private equity giant also raised $3 billion for a second fund to invest in global infrastructure projects, three times the amount it raised for its first infrastructure fund.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
