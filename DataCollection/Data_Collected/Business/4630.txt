The company, which is majority owned by Japan’s SoftBank, said operating profit rose to 515 million euros ($564 million) from 243 million in 2013, while revenue rose to around 1.5 billion euros from 519 million euros. The chief executive, Ilkka Paananen, said in a statement that the rapid growth was thanks to users’ increased play of existing games, which it updates regularly with extended story lines and features. Supercell’s video titles are free to download and get revenue primarily from the fraction of users willing to make small in-game purchases. Advertisement
