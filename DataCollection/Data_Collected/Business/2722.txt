BEIJING — Prices for new homes in China continued to fall in December, data showed Sunday, with persistent oversupply expected to keep pressure on real estate prices and investment, even though year-end sales surged.Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed prices for new homes had fallen in 68 of the 70 major cities the bureau monitors, a figure unchanged from November.“On average, prices of new homes and existing homes in December in the 70 cities fell 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent respectively from a month ago,” said Liu Jianwei, senior statistician at the bureau, according to Xinhua, China’s official news agency.Sales had surged as recent policy changes, including cheaper loans and the official interest rate cut in November, increased interest in purchasing homes and developers pushed to make sales by the end of the year, the statistician said.AdvertisementProperty sales in December in 70 major cities reached the highest level seen in 2014, up nearly 9 percent from November, according to data from the bureau.AdvertisementChina’s top listed residential developer, China Vanke, reported a 129 percent surge in sales in the final month of 2014, compared with a year earlier, while sales during the same period for the midsize developer Country Garden leaped 167 percent.The gloomy house price news foreshadowed economic growth figures for 2014 that are due out on Tuesday, with expansion expected to have slowed to 7.2 percent, the weakest showing since the depths of the global financial crisis.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
