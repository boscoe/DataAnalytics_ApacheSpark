AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressFebruary proved to be a strong month for stocks in the United States, even though it ended in downbeat fashion.Major stock indexes closed lower on Friday, capping a week of subdued trading that nonetheless delivered a couple of new highs for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. It also brought the Nasdaq within striking distance of its March 2000 peak.The Nasdaq notched the biggest monthly gain at 7.1 percent. But the S.&P. 500’s 5.5 percent increase was its best monthly performance since October 2011, and a turnaround from its 3.1 percent slide in January. The Dow rose 5.6 percent for the month.Trading was listless for much of Friday as investors balanced encouraging reports on housing and consumer confidence against data showing that the United States economy grew at a slower annual rate in the final months of 2014 than previously estimated. Oil rose, recouping some of its losses from a day earlier. Technology stocks were among the biggest decliners.“Many people are trying to figure out what to do, taking some profits when they can,” said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief strategist. “It’s a wait-and-see attitude.”The Dow ended down 81.72 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,132.70. The S.&P. 500 slid 6.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,104.50. The index is down 0.5 percent from a high of 2,115.48 on Tuesday. The Nasdaq fell 24.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,963.53. The index has been inching closer to the 5,000-point mark, something it has not done since March 2000 at the height of the dot-com boom. It is now within 86 points of that era’s peak, though nowhere near a record when inflation is taken into account.The three main stock indexes in the United States are all up for the year.The bull market, now in its sixth year, has been powered by strong corporate earnings growth and low interest rates, which make stocks more attractive relative to bonds. Strong job growth and improving consumer confidence have also encouraged traders, despite signs of sluggishness in Europe and elsewhere.Some of that confidence appeared shaken on Friday, when the Commerce Department reported that the United States economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the October-December quarter, weaker than the 2.6 percent estimate last month. But other bellwethers were more upbeat: An index of pending home sales, an indicator of potentially completed sales, rose in January, and the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment slipped this month but remains at the highest level in eight years.“The market does not have a clear catalyst to either cause it to sell off or to surge forward, and we’re getting a little expensive from a valuation perspective,” said David Heidel, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.Investors should get a better sense of the economy and consumers’ willingness to spend next week when automakers report their February sales figures and the government issues its monthly update on hiring.All told, eight of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 ended lower, with technology stocks notching the biggest decline. The sector is up 4.2 percent this year. Consumer staples rose the most. Those stocks are up 2.9 percent this year.Energy companies were among the biggest decliners in the S.&P. 500.Southwestern Energy fell $1.27, or 4.8 percent, to $25.08, while NRG Energy lost 79 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $23.98. Chesapeake Energy slid 52 cents, or 3 percent, to $16.68.Benchmark United States crude rose $1.59, to $49.76 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude rose $2.53, to $62.58 a barrel, in London.Oil prices in the United States appeared to stabilize in February around the $50-a-barrel mark. That has made a crucial variable of business more predictable for investors, Mr. Kinahan said.“That’s really the kind of thing that gives stability to the stock market,” Mr. Kinahan said.United States government bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.99 percent from 2.03 percent late Thursday.In metals trading, gold edged up $3 to $1,213.10 an ounce, silver fell 7 cents to $16.51 an ounce, and copper was flat at $2.72 a pound.In other energy futures trading, wholesale gasoline rose 6 cents to $1.768 a gallon, heating oil jumped 16.3 cents to $2.30 a gallon, and natural gas rose 3.7 cents to $2.734 per 1,000 cubic feet.Advertisement
