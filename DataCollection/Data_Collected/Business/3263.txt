Paris — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods group, said on Tuesday that its profit jumped by 64 percent last year, bolstered by stronger demand in the United States and Europe, despite an overall softening of global demand for high-end goods.LVMH, whose brands include Givenchy and Bulgari in addition to Louis Vuitton, as well as Dom Pérignon and Veuve Clicquot Champagne, posted a 2014 net profit of 5.65 billion euros or $6.4 billion, up from €3.4 billion a year earlier.Revenue growth was more modest, up 6 percent, to €30.6 billion, largely because of an unfavorable currency exchange-rate environment, the company said.Consumer spending on luxury goods continued to rise in 2014, but at a far slower pace than in previous years. That has crimped the sales of Europe’s big luxury houses, not only at LVMH but also at Richemont of Switzerland and Kering, the French company formerly known as PPR, whose brands include Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent.AdvertisementWorldwide sales of personal luxury goods are estimated to have reached more than €220 billion, or $249 billion, in 2014, up 5 percent from 2013, according to a recent study by Altagamma, the Italian luxury industry association, and the consulting firm Bain & Company.AdvertisementBut that compares with growth of 7 percent in 2013, and it is only about half the double-digit pace reported from 2009 to 2012. Major luxury markets like China have suffered from a cooling economy and a government crackdown on conspicuous consumption, while the crisis in Ukraine and a falling ruble have kept free-spending Russian tourists at home. Sharply lower oil prices have also raised concerns that elites in the Middle East may soon have less cash to spend on fancy clothes and jewelry or fine wines and spirits.LVMH said operating profit at its fashion and leather goods business rose 2 percent to €3.2 billion while sales rose to €10.8 billion, from €9.9 billion a year earlier.“Despite a climate of economic, currency and geopolitical uncertainties, LVMH is well equipped to continue its growth momentum across all business groups in 2015,” Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman, said in a statement.Louis Vuitton is by far LVMH’s most valuable and recognizable brand, accounting for no less than one-third of total group sales and almost half of its profit. But as at rival megabrands like Gucci and Prada, Louis Vuitton has found that its cachet has begun to fade in recent years. The company’s commercial success prompted a wave of new store openings worldwide, eroding the brand’s perceived exclusivity.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It has also reduced the number of products bearing the house’s 120-year-old brown-and-gold “LV” monogram, which has fallen out of favor with luxury consumers seeking subtler, more exclusive markers of status and wealth.At the fore of this makeover is Nicolas Ghesquière, who joined Louis Vuitton in 2013 as artistic director for women’s wear after 15 years at Balenciaga. Among Mr. Ghesquière’s 2014 hits was a new handbag that harkened to Vuitton’s heritage as a luggage maker. The Petite Malle — a boxy, $5,200 clutch shaped like a miniature travel trunk — proved an instant favorite with the red-carpet set and was spotted on the arms of stars like Jennifer Connelly, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Michelle Williams.Vuitton also sought to inject the brand with some fresh buzz through the introduction in October of a limited edition of accessories incorporating its classic monogram, but created by a series of guest that included the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Christian Louboutin and even Frank Gehry, the architect who designed the new Fondation Louis Vuitton museum in Paris.“It is a way to market the brand as something very near to contemporary art,” Claudia d’Arpizio, a specialist in the luxury industry at Bain & Company in Milan, said in a recent interview, referring to the Vuitton capsule collection. “They are trying to increase the perception and the value of their products, not only from a functional or intrinsic material standpoint, but from an artistic standpoint.”AdvertisementPerformance was strongest in the United States and Japan, where sales increased 8 percent over the previous year — a trend that accelerated in the fourth quarter of the year thanks to a weakening of the euro. In the rest of Asia, which is dominated by China, revenues fell by 1 percent, while European sales increased by 3 percent, the company said.LVMH’s net profit was bolstered by a €2.8 billion capital gain in December from the distribution of its 23 percent stake in Hermès, a rival French luxury house, to the group’s shareholders. The disposal of that holding was part of a court-ordered settlement of a four-year dispute with Hermès, after LVMH secretly built up a large minority holding in the family-controlled company, which makes goods including handcrafted Birkin and Kelly purses and colorful silk scarves. The civil settlement followed an €8 million fine in 2013 for violation of French market rules.Under the terms of the deal with Hermès, which was announced in September, Mr. Arnault, France’s richest man, was allowed to maintain with a residual stake in Hermès of 8.5 percent for his personal account, an investment currently valued at €2.6 billion.The proceeds from the Hermès share sale helped to bolster LVMH’s already substantial cash stockpile. Analysts expect the company to eventually deploy those funds toward further acquisitions or reinvest them into some of its smaller fashion brands like Berluti, Kenzo, Donna Karan and Loewe.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
