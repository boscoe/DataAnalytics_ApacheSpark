FRANKFURT — The European Central Bank, asserting its new role as the eurozone’s chief bank supervisor, advised lenders on Thursday not to dispense too much of their profits in dividends to shareholders or in pay packages to executives, in order to gird themselves for global financial stress.Banks should be restrained in paying out dividends, the central bank said in recommendations issued on Thursday, because of “a challenging macroeconomic and financial environment that puts pressure on banks’ profitability.”Lenders should be preparing for regulations that will require them to use more of their own money, or capital, to do business, the central bank’s new supervisory arm said. Banks that failed stress tests last year — mainly in Italy — were also told not to distribute dividends at all until they had met capital requirements.The central bank also said it would begin a thorough review of lenders’ executive pay, another measure intended to ensure that banks are not distributing money that should be used to increase capital.Advertisement“Banks should base their dividend policies on conservative and prudent assumptions,” Danièle Nouy, head of the supervisory unit, said in a statement, “so that after any payout they can still fully cover their current capital requirements and prepare themselves to meet more demanding capital standards.”AdvertisementThe European Central Bank took responsibility for supervising banks in November, as part of an attempt to ensure that lenders in all 19 eurozone countries are subject to equally rigorous oversight.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the central bank has since faced criticism for not putting enough pressure on banks to raise more capital.Thursday’s statement could be a sign, though, that the central bank will be more aggressive than national regulators have typically been in urging lenders to operate more prudently, while also speaking more openly about what it is telling banks to do.The European Central Bank said it had sent letters to the 123 large banks that it supervises directly, and asked national supervisors to deliver the same message to smaller banks in their jurisdictions.The review of bank bonuses and other pay is intended to make sure that executive compensation is “consistent with a bank’s ability to maintain a sound capital base,” the statement said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
