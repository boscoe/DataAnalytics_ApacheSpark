Users of RushCard prepaid debit cards continued to report residual problems on Thursday, a week after thousands lost access to their accounts, though several posted on social media sites that their cards were again working.Earlier Thursday, Russell Simmons, one of the founders of RushCard, put a message on Twitter.
            We are still working through all of @RushCard's problems. We have made progress, but see that there a number of people still affected.        In a statement, RushCard’s chief executive, Rick Savard, said that while the “vast majority” of the customer issues had been resolved, “we have a handful of people left who are still not able to access correct information about their accounts.”“Their funds are there but their information is still inaccurate,” he said.A source close to the company who spoke on condition of anonymity said RushCard has been adjusting fees and offering courtesy credits on a case-by-case basis.Mr. Savard said the company was preparing to make “a significant announcement on how we plan to make this right with our customers who were severely inconvenienced and in some case suffered hardships.”RushCard, which is based in Cincinnati, has been struggling to reconnect thousands of cardholders with access to their accounts. A technical malfunction during a processing system conversion on Columbus Day weekend left hundreds of thousands of customers unable to use their cards, in some cases for more than a week, prompting an outpouring of grievances on social media.AdvertisementMr. Savard and Mr. Simmons have taken to Twitter and Facebook to try to respond to customer complaints.AdvertisementOn Thursday, Mr. Simmons posted that the company had fixed inaccurate account information that had displayed transactions twice instead of once. The post said there had been an issue with the information but that account balances had not been affected.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I want to make sure that every single RushCard customer today is able to use the card as I intended them to use it: to pay their bills, to get gas, to feed their families and help them manage their finances.”Some customer cards were wrongly rendered inactive during last week’s conversion.Also, in the last week, some customers found that their direct payroll deposits or government benefits linked to their cards had been returned. RushCard said it had new processes in place this week to ensure that deposits are posted in a timely manner. It directed cardholders who were affected to contact their employer or government benefits administrator to obtain the funds or have them resubmitted to RushCard.One customer who said she had a card for 11 years responded on Facebook that she would rather not do that. “I would rather wait a few days and get a paper check ... no thanks RushCard you’ve done enough.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
