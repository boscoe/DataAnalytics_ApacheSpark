Most were steel and coke plants, with some found to have provided fake environmental data.Beijing is determined to tackle hazardous smog by imposing higher environmental standards and strengthening monitoring in high-polluting regions. Some unqualified steel mills have been closed permanently.China put a new environment law into effect at the start of 2015 and can now impose unlimited fines and even prison sentences on officials who fail to conform with new standards.The Ministry of Environmental Protection has already used its strengthened powers to take on local governments in Hebei and elsewhere. Local leaders were summoned to explain themselves when they failed to comply with emergency pollution guidelines.Chinese steel mills, already suffering from persistently low prices as a result of overcapacity and slowing economic growth, are now paying an estimated 160 renminbi, or about $25, per metric ton of steel to comply with environmental guidelines.
