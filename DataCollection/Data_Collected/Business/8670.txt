Walmart said it would reopen five stores in the United States whose closure had prompted a union to file a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming retaliation against workers for organizing. The stores will reopen in late October or early November, and Walmart will encourage previous employees to apply for jobs, a company spokesman, Lorenzo Lopez, said on Wednesday. Walmart had said the closures, which affected more than 2,000 workers, were for plumbing and other repairs. The complaint filed by the union, the United Food and Commercial Workers International, is still pending. It said that Walmart closed a store in Pico Rivera, Calif., because workers had been trying to organize for better pay and benefits. The other four stores were included as cover, the union said. Walmart has denied the claims.A version of this brief appears in print on September 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Walmart to Reopen 5 Stores Named in Union Complaint.
