In I.R.M., the firm is betting on a management team that claims a collective 120 years of experience in the industry, with experience at companies like Enron Oil & Gas, Shell and Sheridan Production Partners.I.R.M., which is based in Houston, will focus on oil production areas in both the Mid-Continent and the Rockies regions, with its first operations in the Anadarko drilling basin that covers parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Colorado.Its operations will focus on using advanced drilling technology to extract oil from the ground.“The opportunity to grow a start-up E.&P. company behind a great management team fits squarely within our investment thesis and our track record of success,” James R. Levy, a managing director at Warburg Pincus, said in a statement, referring to oil exploration and production. “We look forward to working alongside the I.R.M. team to create value.”Advertisement
