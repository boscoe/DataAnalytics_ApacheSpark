LONDON — The reinsurer PartnerRe said on Wednesday that its board was willing to engage in discussions with the Italian investment company Exor to see if it would improve an unsolicited $6.8 billion takeover offer.But PartnerRe also took Exor to task for what it said were “misleading statements” by Exor about its approach, describing them in a letter to shareholders as a “negotiating tactic.”Exor, which is controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, wants PartnerRe’s directors to recommend that shareholders accept the deal over a planned merger with a reinsurance rival, Axis Capital Holdings.“PartnerRe’s board of directors is open-minded and focused on creating value for our shareholders,” Jean-Paul L. Montupet, the PartnerRe chairman said in a news release. “Although we were disappointed that Exor has made misleading statements regarding our prior discussions, we are interested in a proposal that may lead to superior value for our shareholders.”AdvertisementHe added that “we believe that PartnerRe is worth materially more than Exor has offered and the terms they have proposed are deficient.” Still ,he said “we stand ready to negotiate with Exor in good faith to determine their willingness to propose a transaction that, taking into account price, closing certainty, timing and other terms, is in the best interests of our shareholders.”AdvertisementPartnerRe and Axis, which are both based in Bermuda, agreed in January to a so-called merger of equals that would create a new player in the specialized field of reinsurance with a combined market capitalization of more than $11 billion.Earlier this month, PartnerRe rejected an unsolicited takeover approach from Exor of $130 a share, saying that Exor never expressed a willingness to increase its bid and that the offer undervalued the company.Following the first Exor offer, the deal with Axis was revised so that PartnerRe’s shareholders would receive a one-time special dividend of $11.50 a common share, in addition to shares in the combined company.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the reinsurer said its board continued to support the pending merger with Axis.“PartnerRe expects to undertake these discussions with Exor as expeditiously and constructively as possible in order to come to a decision that is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,” the company said.In its letter to shareholders, PartnerRe that Exor was “unwilling to be flexible on price” in its initial offer and that the current offer was “unacceptable on value and terms,” including various structural risks in the deal.Shares of PartnerRe rose less than 1 percent to $134.72 in early trading in New York on Wednesday.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
