HONG KONG — Chinese stocks rebounded sharply on Tuesday after the government took further steps to rein in short-sellers.The main Shanghai share index closed 3.7 percent higher, reversing three days of losses, after the country’s two main stock exchanges said they would make it more difficult for investors to bet on falling share prices.In announcements late Monday, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges said that effective Tuesday, they would discontinue so-called same-day transaction settlements, in which trades are completed the day they are made, for short-sellers. They blamed the practice for causing “abnormal fluctuations in share prices and impacting the stable operation of the market.”Instead, such investors — who borrow shares and sell them in a bet they can be repurchased at a lower price before they must be returned — will be required to keep their trading positions open overnight and can settle the trade only the following day.AdvertisementThe sharp rise and fall of China’s markets in recent months has clearly been shaped by record levels of margin financing, in which investors borrow money to buy shares. But the impact of short-selling has been less clear.AdvertisementOutstanding margin financing peaked in mid-June at 2.3 trillion renminbi, or about $370 billion, according to figures from Wind Info, a financial data supplier. Short-selling volumes peaked in April at a much lower level, about 10.3 billion renminbi, and have declined in a choppy fashion since then. As of Friday, outstanding margin financing totaled 440 billion renminbi. Short-selling volumes, measured by the value of shares on loan, were 4.9 billion renminbi.
                The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country’s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.            Responding to the announcement on Tuesday, several of China’s major brokerages, including Citic Securities, the largest, said they would suspend their short-selling services.In a statement Tuesday evening, the People’s Bank of China reiterated recent pledges to continue supporting the markets, having committed last month to underwriting a government-backed program of stock purchases worth at least $20 billion.“We will pay heed to the stability of financial markets, and stand ready to dissolve risks,” the bank said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Market regulators and the police have also pledged to curb what they said was “malicious” short-selling, without elaborating on what that might mean.From their peak in mid-June, Chinese stocks have declined by about a third, shedding more than $3 trillion in market value.The announcement this week by the stock exchanges and big brokerages of new curbs on short-selling comes as China’s securities regulator has placed increased scrutiny on automated or computer-driven trading strategies. As a part of this increased supervision, it has suspended more than 30 accounts linked to electronic trading, including one belonging to the securities arm of Citadel, the big American hedge fund group.On Tuesday, the broker handling the suspended Citadel account, Guosen Securities, issued a statement saying it would “strengthen the management” of its trading business and work together with Chinese regulators in order “to firmly support the stability of the capital market.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
