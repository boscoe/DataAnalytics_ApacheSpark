The company recalled all its products last month. No illnesses are connected to the recall, and Jeni’s says it is making ice cream again and reopening shops on Friday after intensive cleaning. Blue Bell Creameries, based in Texas, also shut down and recalled all products after listeria in its products was linked to three deaths. The report said Jeni’s managers did not have an adequate sampling and testing program, and were not sufficiently sanitizing some surfaces, including the floors. Jeni’s employees responsible for ensuring compliance showed a “lack of competency” by failing to comply with some of those guidelines, according to the report. Jeni’s did not immediately comment on the report. Advertisement
