LOS ANGELES — Toronto International Film Festival officials on Thursday said they had withdrawn the film “London Fields” from their lineup because of a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the film’s director, Mathew Cullen, against some of its producers, including Chris Hanley and his Muse Productions company.In dropping the film, festival programmers cited the legal action and “uncertainty surrounding the creative vision of the version” that had been set for a world premiere in Toronto on Friday. Mr. Hanley and a spokeswoman for the film did not immediately respond to queries.
In a statement, a spokeswoman for the film said its producers called the festival cancellation “an ill-considered decision made against our rights.” The statement called Mr. Cullen’s legal complaint a “publicity stunt,” and said they would “vigorously oppose it.”“London Fields” stars Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, Billy Bob Thornton and others in a noir thriller based on a novel by Martin Amis. Mr. Cullen, in a suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, said its producers committed fraud by substantially changing the movie without his consent and not paying him, among other things.Another prominent film, Sydney Pollack’s documentary “Amazing Grace,” which was completed after his death in 2008, was earlier withdrawn from the festival after its subject, Aretha Franklin, filed suit challenging the right of its producers to portray her in the movie.A version of this article appears in print on September 18, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Toronto Festival Officials Withdraw ‘London Fields’.
