LONDON — The Bank of England said on Tuesday that it would increase the size of a capital buffer it requires banks to hold to ensure they can provide lending and other essential banking services in times of financial stress.Lenders in Britain would be required to set aside the equivalent of 0.5 percent of their assets as weighted by risk by March 29, 2017, the central bank’s Financial Policy Committee said on Tuesday.The Bank of England said it would like to gradually increase the so-called countercyclical capital buffer rate to 1 percent of risk-weighted assets. The rate, which is now set at zero, is intended to vary over time to reflect the risk that the banking system would incur losses on exposures in Britain in the future.“Risks associated with domestic credit are no longer subdued, as they were in the period following the financial crisis; and global risks, which can also affect U.K. exposures indirectly, are heightened,” the bank’s Financial Policy Committee said as part of its quarterly policy statement on Tuesday.AdvertisementThe Financial Policy Committee also said that uncertainty surrounding a June 23 referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union could lead to further depreciation of the pound and affect the cost and availability of loans in Britain.Advertisement“The committee assesses the risks around the referendum to be the most significant near-term domestic risks to financial stability,” the central bank said. “It will continue to monitor the channels of risk closely and support mitigating actions where possible.”The increase in the capital buffer, however, is not expected to result in another round of fund-raising by lenders, the central bank said.The Prudential Regulation Authority, a regulator within the Bank of England, is reducing a separate capital buffer requirement that overlapped with the countercyclical capital buffer.Removing the overlap will mean banks that account for about 75 percent of lending in Britain will not see their overall capital requirements increase, the Bank of England said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Most of those banks, however, already hold enough capital to meet the requirements, the committee said.“The F.P.C. recognizes that these banks may wish to build capital over time in order to retain some excess over regulatory capital buffers, but their current position means that any such action will be able to take place gradually,” the committee said.The central bank also revealed the elements of the “stress tests” that are to be given later this year to measure the ability of Britain’s largest lenders to survive a financial crisis or severe economic downturn.The tests will apply to seven of Britain’s biggest banks and building societies, which account for about 80 percent of the lending to the British economy. This year’s tests will examine macroeconomic and trading risks to bank portfolios, as well as projections for potential fines and other costs for improper conduct.The results will be released in the fourth quarter.Four of Britain’s biggest banks will be part of a Europewide separate stress test that will be conducted by the European Banking Authority this year.A version of this article appears in print on March 30, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Bank of England to Raise Capital Buffer Requirement.
