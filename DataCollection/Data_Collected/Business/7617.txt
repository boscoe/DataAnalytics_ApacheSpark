The National Journal, the political magazine owned by Atlantic Media, will cease publishing a print edition at the end of the year, the company said Thursday.The pace of news in Washington has increased, the company said in a statement, and the publication has evolved to encompass tools and services, and a membership plan that has grown to account for half its revenue. It will now focus its efforts online — producing daily news, in-depth reporting, and tools for those core readers — and on live events. An updated digital platform will have its debut in September.“I’ve come to think of our journalism as the capstone to a quieter work underway, underneath,” said Atlantic Media’s chairman, David Bradley, in a memo to staff. It rests now, he said, “on a very stable, very smart and rapidly expanding platform.”A version of this article appears in print on July 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; The National Journal to Stop Publishing a Print Edition.
