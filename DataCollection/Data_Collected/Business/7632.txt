The European Commission announced two antitrust investigations on Thursday into the chip maker Qualcomm, the latest in a number of recent competition inquiries aimed at United States technology giants.Europe’s antitrust officials said they would investigate whether Qualcomm, one of the world’s largest chip makers, had abused its dominant market position in the region by offering financial incentives to potential customers if they bought equipment solely from the American company.European authorities will also examine whether Qualcomm unfairly set prices below its manufacturing costs to force competitors from the market. The company’s chips are used in smartphones and other mobile devices, which are increasingly central to how people use online services.“We want to be sure that high-tech suppliers can compete on the merits of their products,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top competition official, said in a statement on Thursday. “Many customers use electronic devices such as a mobile phone or a tablet, and we want to ensure that they ultimately get value for money.”
                The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.            European antitrust investigations can take several years to complete. If companies are found to have broken the region’s competition rules, they can appeal the decisions in Europe’s courts.AdvertisementIn response to Thursday’s announcement, Qualcomm said that it was disappointed that European authorities had opened the investigations but that the company would continue to work with the region’s antitrust officials.Advertisement“We continue to believe that any concerns are without merit,” Qualcomm said in a statement.The move by European officials comes after an agreement by Qualcomm this year to pay a $975 million fine for violating China’s antimonopoly law. As part of that deal, the company agreed to offer licenses for some of its communications systems for high-speed data to smartphones at a significant discount to what it charges companies elsewhere.The American chip maker has also been the focus of previous antitrust investigations by European officials. The region’s authorities dropped a two-year inquiry in 2009 after failing to find evidence that Qualcomm had charged excessive royalties for access to its patents.Yet in 2010, Icera, a British chip maker owned by Nvidia, filed a new complaint, accusing Qualcomm of using unfair financial incentives to attract new customers. That complaint formed the basis for the European Commission’s latest antitrust investigations into Qualcomm, which might not lead to formal charges.If found to have broken the region’s tough antitrust rules, the chip maker could face fines of up to 10 percent of its annual revenue and could be forced to change some of its business practices. In 2009, for example, the American chip maker Intel was fined $1.45 billion — the largest antitrust penalty levied by the European Union — for abusing its dominant position to deny consumers a choice for computer chips.Other American technology giants have also been in Europe’s sights.This year, Ms. Vestager brought formal antitrust charges against Google over suspicions that it favored some of its own online search services over those of its rivals. The search giant has until the middle of August to respond to the antitrust charges, which come after a four-year investigation into the company. She is also looking into whether tax practices in Ireland and Luxembourg gave preferential treatment to Apple and Amazon.And in a recent review of the region’s so-called digital single-market proposals, aimed at jump-starting Europe’s online economy, the European Commission announced a competition inquiry into the online shopping sector.While European officials have emphasized that these investigations have not unfairly focused on American companies, many industry executives have accused the region’s policy makers of focusing on the global giants in a bid to help European rivals — many of which have struggled to compete globally — bolster their market positions across the 28-member bloc.A version of this article appears in print on July 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: European Officials Open 2 Antitrust Inquiries Into Qualcomm.
