LONDON — Two Bank of England officials dropped their recent calls for higher interest rates and joined a unanimous vote this month to keep the benchmark rate unchanged, according to central bank minutes released on Wednesday.The officials pivoted as concerns over low inflation heightened last month, and some economists now say that they do not expect a rate increase until the second half of this year, or even 2016.The two members of the Monetary Policy Committee, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, first broke ranks in August, voting to raise rates. They were the first dissenting votes since Mark J. Carney became governor of the Bank of England in 2013, and the first calls to raise rates since 2011.But inflation fell to 0.5 percent in December, a steeper drop than expected and the lowest rate in 15 years. That was also well below the government’s target of 2 percent inflation in the medium -term.AdvertisementAccording to the January minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee, Mr. Weale and Mr. McCafferty argued that the sharp decline in inflation was most likely driven by “temporary factors” like low oil prices and stable food prices, and “was unlikely materially to affect the behavior of households and businesses in such a way that it became self-perpetuating.”AdvertisementNevertheless, the minutes continued, the two “noted the risk that low inflation might persist for longer than the temporary factors implied, and concluded that this risk would be increased by an increase in bank rate at the current juncture.”The minutes described the decision by the previously dissenting members to keep rates unchanged as “finely balanced.”Many analysts had said they expected the Bank of England to inch interest rates higher this year, but they have dialed back those expectations in recent weeks in light of the inflation report.Howard Archer, the chief economist for Europe and Britain at the research company IHS Economics in London, said it was still possible that the Bank of England would raise rates this year, but that he did not expect any action before November.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The panel also left unchanged a stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $567 billion, in government bonds that it has bought over the past five years.Sharply lower oil prices, combined with a price war among Britain’s largest supermarkets, contributed to the drop in consumer prices in December, economists said.AdvertisementAccording to the minutes of the January meeting, the central bank expects inflation to reach “a trough of around zero” in March, as lower oil prices drive down gas prices, and estimates that there is a “roughly even” chance inflation could temporarily dip below zero in the first half of the year.Mr. Carney has said the decline in inflation is good news for British consumers in the short term, as households benefit from rising wages and lower prices.The concern is that low or falling prices could linger and oil prices could decline further, according to the committee’s minutes.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
