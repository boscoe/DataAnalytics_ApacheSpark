The action affects vehicles with 3-liter V6 diesel engines, including the 2013 Audi Q7, the 2014-15 Audi A6, A7, A8, Q5 and Q7 and the 2013-16 Volkswagen Touareg. Porsche has also halted sales of its 2014-16 diesel Cayenne sport utility vehicle. An Audi spokesman said the company was still determining how many vehicles are involved. The Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday that new testing showed that software in Volkswagen’s V6 diesel engines allowed for rigging emissions tests, just like the company’s smaller four-cylinder engines. Volkswagen says it is meeting with the E.P.A. to better understand the new test results. Also on Wednesday, the credit ratings agency Moody’s downgraded Volkswagen’s debt because of the possible financial impact of the emissions scandal. Advertisement
