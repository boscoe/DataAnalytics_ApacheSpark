BEIJING — China will introduce on May 1 a program to insure bank deposits, the government said on Tuesday, ushering in an overhaul seen as vital for freeing up the highly protected banking sector.Deposits of up to 500,000 renminbi, or about $81,000, will be insured under the program, which is expected to help reduce financial risks and protect the rights and interests of savers, the State Council, or cabinet, said on the government’s website.The move will bring China a step closer to dispelling investors’ belief that the government will always bail out Chinese banks, no matter how reckless their dealings, just to protect depositors’ savings.Crucially, it will also let the authorities abolish controls on deposit rates, which are still managed by the government to shield banks from competition and safeguard profits.AdvertisementAfter staging one of the world’s biggest bank bailouts from 1998, China has spent many of the years since trying to dispel the belief of both banks and investors that the state will always pick up the bill for irresponsible lending.AdvertisementJiahe Chen, chief strategist at Cinda Securities, said old habits would probably die hard. “Domestic depositors fundamentally don’t believe that Chinese banks could go bankrupt and their money could disappear,” he said. “Even if you have the deposit insurance program, if the bank really fails, depositors will still go to the government as a last resort.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
