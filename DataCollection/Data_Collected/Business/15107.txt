LONDON — Banco Santander of Spain said on Wednesday that its profit declined by nearly half in the second quarter on restructuring charges and a contribution to a fund to help finance bank “bail-ins” in Europe.For the three months ended June 30, the lender reported a profit of 1.28 billion euros, or about $1.4 billion. That compared with a profit of €2.54 billion in the second quarter of 2015.The second quarter included a gain of €227 million on the sale of its stake in Visa Europe. But it also included restructuring costs of €475 million and a charge of €120 million associated with the Single Resolution Fund, which is part of a mechanism intended to shift the burden of rescuing European lenders onto investors, rather than funding bailouts through state aid.Santander’s earnings in Spain, its home market, declined 10 percent to €208 million in the quarter, driven primarily by its contribution to the fund. That compared with €232 million in the second quarter of 2015.AdvertisementAnd profit in the bank’s British unit declined 28 percent, to €390 million from €545 million in the same period a year earlier.AdvertisementBritain is an important market for Santander, one of Europe’s largest banks, and has been a steady source of profit for the lender. But the pound weakened against the euro in the prelude to and aftermath of Britain’s vote to leave the European Union in June, hitting earnings when expressed in euros.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In June, the Federal Reserve announced that Santander’s and Deutsche Bank’s businesses in the United States had failed a stress test intended to examine the ability of banks to weather a future financial crisis.Over all, Santander said it would have reported a profit of €1.65 billion in the second quarter on an underlying basis, which excludes certain one-time gains and charges.Also on Wednesday, the Italian bank UniCredit said it had ended talks to combine its Pioneer Investments unit with Santander’s asset management arm. The two banks had announced a preliminary agreement to combine the businesses in April 2015.UniCredit said that the banks “held detailed discussions to identify viable solutions to meet all regulatory requirements to complete the transaction, but in the absence of any workable solution within a reasonable time horizon, the parties have concluded that ending the talks was the most appropriate course of action.”Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
