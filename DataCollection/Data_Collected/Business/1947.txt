LONDON — Banks, building societies and investment firms in Britain would need to issue an estimated 27 billion pounds, or about $41 billion, in new debt by 2020 to comply with European Union rules intended to lessen the need for future bailouts, the Bank of England said on Friday.The new rules, known as the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities, or MREL, would require European banks and other regulated financial institutions to maintain sufficient equity and other liabilities to absorb losses in a time of financial stress. The goal is to minimize risk for the overall financial system while protecting depositors.Under the rules, banks would be required to issue certain debt that could be converted to equity and those debt holders and other investors would have to shoulder losses.“The implementation of MREL is a crucial step forward in ensuring that any bank, large or small, carries sufficient resources to be resolved in an orderly way, without recourse to public subsidy and without disruption to the wider financial system,” Mark J. Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Friday in a news release.AdvertisementThe Bank of England, which is responsible for putting into effect in Britain the European Union rules, said that lenders and other regulated financial institutions would need £223 billion in such debt to comply with the new rules.AdvertisementThe bulk would come from existing debt that is expected to mature in the next four years and that would be reissued to comply with the new rules, the Bank of England said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
