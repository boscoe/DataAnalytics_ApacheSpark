Siemens’s health care, transportation and energy management units drove industrial profit to 10.4 percent of sales, from 10.2 percent a year earlier, which was helped by the weak euro and continued cost cuts. Siemens said it now expected earnings per share of €6 to €6.40, or about $6.50 to $6.93, up from its previous projection of €5.90 to €6.20 for the year ending in September. Like its American rival General Electric, Siemens turned to measures like job cuts, disposals and an increased focus on technology as slowing growth in China and low oil prices dimmed the outlook for industrial goods. Digital Factory, Siemens’s factory automation unit, remained its most profitable business; its profit margin was 16.9 percent, down from 18.8 percent a year earlier. Siemens confirmed on Monday it was buying the American engineering software firm CD-adapco for $970 million. Advertisement
