An increase in long-term interest rates rattled investors on Tuesday, nudging major United States stock indexes lower for the second day in a row.Traders around the world have been selling off government bonds in recent weeks. That trend accelerated on Tuesday, bringing down bond prices and, in turn, driving up the benchmark United States bond yield to its highest level since late November.“A dramatic increase in yields brought our market down in the morning, and as the pressure on the bonds eased up, the stock market came back,” said David A. Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management.The Dow fell 36.94 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,068.23. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 6.21 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,099.12. The Nasdaq slid 17.38 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,976.19. The three indexes are up for the month and year.AdvertisementThe indexes headed lower as soon as regular trading opened on Tuesday, following declines in European markets as the bond market sell-off sent yields higher.AdvertisementThe yield on the 10-year German government bond rose to 0.67 percent, from 0.61 percent the day before. It traded as low as 0.08 percent last month.In the United States, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped as high as 2.36 percent. The selling eased by late afternoon, and the yield fell to 2.25 percent, down from 2.28 percent on Monday. The yield was below 2 percent as recently as April 28.The sudden turn in the United States bond market seems to have little to do with American economic trends. The selling started last month in Europe, according to traders, and has since spilled into United States markets.“What’s really going on is an overseas market is hitting the U.S. market,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.Worried about the strength of the global economy, nervous investors crowded into government bond markets in Germany and the United States earlier this year, pushing prices up and rates down. In the middle of April, the 10-year United States Treasury yield sank as low as 1.86 percent, according to FactSet data. The 10-year German bund paid much less, yielding as little as 0.07 percent.But what happened next has left many investors scratching their heads. A lot of traders decided they owned too many German government bonds and decided to sell. Some bonds rose so high that they carried a negative yield.

And that, in turn, helped increase long-term interest rates in the United States.“Selling begets selling. It’s a snowball effect,” said Edward Acton, Treasury strategist at RBS Securities, in Stamford, Conn.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
