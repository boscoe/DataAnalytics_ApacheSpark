MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3 percent after the news on Tuesday, and Chinese shares opened lower, with the main Shanghai index down more than 1 percent. China’s services sector, which had been one of the few bright spots in the sputtering economy, also showed alarming signs of cooling. “Given sluggish activities during the summer, G.D.P. may fall below 6.5 percent in the third quarter,” economists at ANZ said in a research note. The Caixin/Markit index dropped to 47.3 in August, the lowest reading since March 2009, from July’s 47.8. A similar activity survey by Ciaxin/Markit for the services sector showed its growth momentum fell to 51.5, its lowest level since July 2014, from July’s 53.8. Advertisement
