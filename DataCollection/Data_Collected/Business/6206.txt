It later offered $30 million.Judge Brendan L. Shannon, in bankruptcy court in Delaware, said on Wednesday that RadioShack had the right to alter bidding procedures in reliance on its business judgment.A RadioShack lawyer said the two-day auction had grown tense, and the company felt bidders might walk away if incremental bidding dragged on.Bankruptcy judges are hard-pressed to reopen auctions — even when they could yield higher bids — in part to discourage bidders from declining to take part and then advancing new bids after the fact, when an asset’s value is established.Judge Shannon said he did not think Wonderland was “trying to game the system” in this case, but still felt it was inappropriate to reopen bidding.Also, RadioShack and several state attorneys general held a nine-hour mediation last week in Dallas over the treatment of customer data. Standard General agreed to limit its customer email access to the last two years, and to allow access to only seven of 170 fields of data RadioShack kept on its customers, said Ken Paxton, a lawyer for Texas’s attorney general.Standard General will receive names and addresses for 67 million customers, down from the 117 million initially sought.Competition from online rivals forced RadioShack into Chapter 11 in February. Unlike many bankrupt retailers, it intends to survive its stint in Chapter 11, with Standard General planning to keep the purchased stores in business by establishing a co-brand with Sprint.Advertisement
