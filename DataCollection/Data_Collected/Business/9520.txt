In July, Lloyds said that it would expand its overhaul, cutting an additional 3,000 jobs and reducing costs by a further £400 million by the end of 2017.The lender warned at the time of the summer announcement that Britain’s decision in June to leave the European Union, known as “Brexit,” could slow the country’s economy.Lloyds had 74,117 employees as of June 30. The bank said on Wednesday it would create 110 new roles across its group operations, retail, customer products and marketing, finance and risk divisions, resulting in a net reduction of 1,230 jobs.“This process involves taking difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way,” Lloyds said in a news release. “All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today.”The bank said it would try to achieve the job cuts through voluntary departures. “Compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort,” it said.The announcement drew the ire of unions representing Lloyds employees.In a news release, Rob MacGregor, the national officer for the Unite union, called the job cuts “horrific news” for the staff of Lloyds and said the union would oppose the elimination of those jobs and push Lloyds management to offer “alternative suitable employment” to those affected.“We’re deeply concerned that both the scale and the pace of job reductions are increasing,” Ged Nichols, the general secretary of the Accord union, said in a news release.“We know the outlook for banks is tough due to record low interest rates, falling revenues and the changes in technology and customer behaviors,” he added. “But this ‘death by a thousand cuts’ approach does nothing to give confidence to those who will be staying with the business, trying their best to meet customers’ needs and help to sustain the group for the future.”The job cuts came as the British government announced last week that it would seek to sell down its remaining 9.1 percent stake in Lloyds over the next 12 months through a trading plan managed by Morgan Stanley and would not proceed with a plan to sell shares to retail investors.The government, which at one point held more than 40 percent of the lender, has said that it expects to recoup all of the £20.3 billion that it injected into the bank during the financial crisis.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
