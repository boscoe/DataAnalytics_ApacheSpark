The Nobel medal awarded to the economist Simon Kuznets in 1971 sold Thursday night on the auction block for $390,848.This was the first medal to sell in the field of economics, and one of only a handful of the 889 medals awarded since 1901 ever to have been sold. The actual medallion, made of 23-karat gold, is worth about $8,700.“Simon Kuznets was such an important figure to economics and economics policy,” said Laura Yntema, auction manager at Nate D. Sanders Auctions in California, which handled the auction. “We were definitely happy with the final result.”While the bidding opened at $150,000, two parties drove the price past $250,000, Ms. Yntema said, volleying back and forth about eight times. The bidding closed at $320,000, but the winner paid a total of $390,848, including a commission of about 21.5 percent, which goes to the auction house.AdvertisementThat was not too far from the price paid for a Nobel Prize in Physics medal, awarded to James Chadwick for his discovery of the neutron: It sold for $329,000 last year. In 2012, William Faulkner’s estate hoped to sell his 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature for at least a half-million dollars. But the sale was called off when the bids topped out at $425,000.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

James D. Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins received the prize in 1962 for their co-discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. Dr. Watson’s medal, purchased by a Russian entrepreneur, sold for $4.76 million in 2014, not long after Mr. Crick’s medal sold posthumously for $2.27 million.Simon Kuznets, who died in 1985 at the age of 84, helped lay the foundation of the modern field of economics by creating standard measures of national income and economic growth. His 83-year-old son, Paul, sold the medal in 2013.Advertisement“I was surprised and very pleased,” said the younger Mr. Kuznets, a retired economist, of the sale price. “Hopefully, somebody or some institution will enjoy having it.”A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: What’s an Economist’s Nobel Medal Worth? $390,848.
