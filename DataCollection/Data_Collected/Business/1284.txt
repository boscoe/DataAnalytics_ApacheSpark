The Postal Service on Friday reported a $5.1 billion loss for the just-completed 2015 fiscal cycle, the ninth consecutive year it has lost money but a modest improvement over 2014. The loss reflects continued erosion in the delivery of first-class mail as well as expensive mandates for funding retiree health care. Over all, revenue was up, and the service made an operating profit of $1.2 billion, reflecting continued growth in its package delivery business. But a special rate surcharge is set to expire next year, which promises to cut revenue by $2 billion annually. The volume of mail delivery should continue to shrink, and expenses will rise. “The road is difficult for a number of reasons,” said the chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett. The service continues to press for legislation that would provide relief from its funding requirement for retiree health benefits and give it greater flexibility in setting rates. The Postal Service registered revenue of $68.9 billion in 2015, a $1.1 billion increase over 2014.A version of this brief appears in print on November 14, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Postal Service Reports Loss of $5.1.
