They agreed to cap greenhouse gas emissions from international flights.The pact — the first climate change agreement to apply worldwide to a specific sector, one that produces the equivalent annual carbon dioxide output as that of Germany — was greeted with almost universal support.John Kerry, secretary of state of the United States, called the aviation deal “unprecedented.”Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, council president of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations body that will oversee the agreement, acknowledged negotiations had been tough, but added that almost all nations now had a “practical agreement and consensus on this issue.”Despite the backslapping, much still needs to be resolved before the 15-year aviation accord comes into force beginning in 2021. The first six years of the deal will be voluntary.Carriers including Delta Air Lines and Air China are expected to eke out some climate change reductions by making their aircraft fleets more efficient and increasing their use of biofuels.But most of the industry’s focus will fall on a complicated offsetting system, in which airlines buy credits from climate change projects, like renewable energy programs often in the developing world, to counterbalance their own carbon emissions.These programs allow global polluters, which do not reduce their own emissions, to fund projects in other industries that often lead to greater greenhouse gas reductions at a lower price than can be found within their own sectors.Past efforts at such so-called market-based mechanisms to mitigate the world’s worst polluters, though, have routinely missed the mark. Severe price fluctuations in the carbon credits have stalled investments, disreputable climate change projects have undermined the credibility of plans, and the public has become distrustful that companies are genuinely reducing their carbon footprints.And while the global aviation industry will spend the next two years figuring out the details of the new pact, analysts warn it is not a surefire bet that the plans will offset airlines’ carbon dioxide emissions. That is especially true because the sector’s climate change impact will rise by as much as 700 percent by midcentury, according to United Nations estimates, as more and more people fly.Much, experts say, will depend on the details of the agreement, including which climate change programs can be used to offset airlines’ carbon emissions and how such projects are monitored to ensure they lead to meaningful greenhouse gas reductions.These issues are likely to be subject to heavy lobbying by airlines, governments and environmental groups over the next two years.Amid this jockeying, the details of the agreement will be crucial if the global airline industry is to avoid previous mistakes, particularly in Europe, where the world’s largest carbon market has arguably failed to limit the region’s carbon dioxide emissions, giving these so-called offsetting programs an increasingly bad name.“It makes sense for the aviation sector to use carbon offsets, but it’s really challenging to get it right,” said Stig Schjolset, head of carbon analysis at Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, a research group in Oslo. “The experiences of all the previous carbon markets do not bode well.”The success, or potential failure, of the aviation agreement will be felt worldwide.Efforts to tackle climate change have been rekindled after world leaders, including President Obama and Xi Jinping, China’s president, among others, signed the so-called Paris Agreement that aims to limit future global temperature rises to as little as 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.The international aviation sector is not included in that agreement (although domestic flights are), and the industry often has been loath to cap its own greenhouse gas emissions. Many carriers in the West had fretted that rivals in emerging markets would not face the same restrictions under previous efforts to reduce the sector’s climate change impact, including pushes to require carriers to buy carbon credits to offset international air travel.“In this game, you should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” said Cameron Hepburn, a professor of environmental economics at the University of Oxford. “We needed to get a deal done to move forward.”The latest agreement, signed on Oct. 6, is by no means perfect.Many of the world’s largest polluters, including Brazil, Russia and India, have opted out of the initial trial phases and will only join when the agreement becomes mandatory from 2027. It also will only cover about 80 percent of the growth in the industry’s carbon emissions from 2021, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade body.And the cost of buying these carbon credits from global climate change projects — a price that may rise from $6.2 billion, or 5.7 billion euros, in 2025 to $24 billion in 2035 — is likely to be picked up by regular travelers.“It will operate like a carbon tax,” said Guy Turner, founder of Trove Research, an environmental consulting company in London. “The cost will be pushed through as higher airfares.”Still, the aviation agreement, if successful, may eventually offset as much as 2.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, or the equivalent of taking 35 million cars off the road each year, according to estimates from the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.For that to happen, says Nathaniel Keohane, head of the global climate program at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, only certain carbon offsetting projects — those that would not have happened without the financial support of the aviation industry — should be included in the new agreement.That has not always been the case in previous offsetting plans, where existing projects like wind farms or efforts to reduce methane emissions at industrial plants were able to sell carbon credits, often for a significant profit, to heavy polluters in the West.Such projects, analysts say, do not lead to additional greenhouse gas reductions because they would exist even without the financial support of the likes of airlines, so should not be included in the sector’s new climate change plans.“The difference between getting the rules right or wrong is enormous,” said Mr. Keohane. “Aviation emissions are a wedge that starts small and grows exponentially over time.”Analysts stress that offsetting projects created before the aviation industry’s accord comes into force from 2021 also should be excluded, so that any carbon dioxide reductions relate to future emissions and not past climate change efforts.Already, there are almost enough existing climate change projects worldwide to offset almost all of the aviation industry’s total carbon emissions for the entirety of the new agreement through 2035, according to estimates from Point Carbon.So by excluding some, if not all, of these well-established offsetting projects, experts say, the aviation industry can ensure that its buying of carbon credits pays for future greenhouse gas reductions, instead of providing merely a potentially new revenue source for longstanding renewables or other green-friendly projects.“If you include emissions credits from before 2020, it relates to a different carbon period,” said Mr. Schjolset of Point Carbon. “Which projects they allow to airlines to use will really decide whether this works or not.”Advertisement
