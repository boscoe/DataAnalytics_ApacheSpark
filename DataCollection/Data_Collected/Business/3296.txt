LONDON — BT is getting into the cellphone business, again.The former British telecommunications monopoly agreed on Thursday to buy EE, Britain’s largest cellphone network for 12.5 billion pounds, or about $19 billion.The move comes more than a decade after BT spun off its previous mobile business, known as BT Cellnet, which Telefónica of Spain eventually bought in 2005 for roughly $28 billion.The British company’s proposed deal for EE — which is the British mobile telephone business of Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany — is one of the biggest acquisitions announced in Europe’s fast-consolidating telecom world in the past 12 months. It would be the latest in a series of takeovers in a sector where planned regulatory changes are expected to fuel acquisitions across the European Union.Those plans are aimed at reducing the number of carriers across the 28-member bloc where there are now more than 100 operators. Regulators hope the consolidation will jump-start investment in a European industry that has failed to keep pace with its counterparts in the United States and Asia.“BT’s announcement quite clearly reshapes the British market,” said Steven Hartley, a telecom analyst at the technology research group Ovum.By adding EE’s 31 million British customers to its existing operations, BT would become the country’s largest provider of both cable and cellphone services. The combine company would be able to offer so-called quad-play packages that combine broadband, cellphone, fixed-line and pay-TV services.The move comes as rivals like Vodafone — the world’s second-largest carrier in terms of subscribers, behind China Mobile — are investing billions of dollars to expand their high-speed mobile networks and buy cable assets, as people increasingly use their mobile devices to surf the Web.EE was created in 2010 when Deutsche Telekom and Orange combined their British operations. EE has invested heavily in its high-speed mobile services, known as 4G.“This is a major milestone for BT,” Gavin Patterson, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement. “By acquiring the country’s largest mobile operator, we can accelerate BT’s mobility strategy.”The deal, which BT hopes to close before the first quarter of 2016, must still receive regulatory approval. The combined business would hold leading market positions in broadband and cellphone services, so the British telecom regulator may force BT to offload assets, customers or spectrums, the government-mandated radio waves that carry phone calls and wireless data.While BT’s broadband assets and EE’s cellphone business have few overlaps, analysts said that regulators may see the consolidation as providing less competition for consumers in the overall telecom market. And in a sign that rivals are already lining up against BT’s perceived dominant position, Vodafone’s chief executive, Vittorio Colao, called on the British authorities to look carefully at the deal.“BT is creating the same situation as you have in other European markets where the incumbent dominates and is almost twice the size as competitors,” Mr. Colao told reporters on Thursday. “Remedies will have to be put in place.”As people worldwide change the way they use cellphones, browse the Internet and watch television programs, mobile and cable operators have been slugging it out to offer bundled packages of services.That has included a number of high-profile deals like AT&T’s proposed $48.5 billion acquisition of the satellite television operator DirecTV. In Europe, where people pay the equivalent of roughly $40 for a monthly cellphone contract — or about half of what Americans pay on average — the likes of Telefónica of Spain have been scooping up smaller competitors to improve their regional cellphone and broadband coverage.In total, mergers and acquisitions in the global telecom industry reached more than a combined $145 billion in 2014, according to data from Thomson Reuters. The figure represents roughly a 40 percent drop compared with the previous year, though the total for 2013 was skewed because of Verizon Communications’ $130 billion purchase of the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless that it did not already own.Under the terms of the latest deal, BT would pay up to $9.5 billion in cash to Deutsche Telekom and Orange, depending on the British company’s closing stock price when the deal is completed. That includes issuing news shares worth $1.5 billion to help finance the takeover.The remainder of the acquisition will be paid through BT shares. Once the takeover is finalized, Deutsche Telekom will hold a 12 percent stake in the former British monopoly, while Orange will retain a 4 percent holding.As part of the agreement, Deutsche Telekom has agreed not to raise its stake in BT to more than 15 percent over the next three years, and will not sell its shares until at least mid-2016. Orange also can not increase its stake in BT to more than 4 percent, and has agreed not to sell its stake in the next 12 months.Shares in BT rose 5.2 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday in London, while the stock price of Deutsche Telekom was relatively flat in Frankfurt, and Orange was down 1.2 percent in Paris.BT’s planned acquisition comes as competition in Britain’s telecom market has intensified.Hutchison Whampoa, one of the flagship companies of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said last month that it had agreed to enter exclusive talks to buy O2, the British cellphone carrier owned by Telefónica. The deal — worth roughly $15 billion — would combine O2 with Hutchison Whampoa’s mobile carrier brand Three. O2 had previously held discussions with BT, but those talks broke down.By re-entering the cellphone market, analysts say BT is conceding that the shedding  of its previous cellphone business had been a mistake.Crippled with debt and in a price war with other British cellphone carriers, BT had to offload its mobile business to improve its own financial position. But as people have increasingly turned to their smartphones to surf the Web, the lack of a cellphone business had put BT at a disadvantage with local rivals that owned both mobile and broadband assets.“At the time, they had little other choice,” said Mr. Hartley of Ovum, in reference to BT’s previous spin-off of its mobile assets. “But getting back into the market now makes sense.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/06/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Telecom Giant BT to Buy EE.
