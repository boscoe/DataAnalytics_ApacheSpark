The spinoff, announced in January, is intended to transfer the value of that stock to Yahoo’s shareholders without incurring the capital gains tax of more than $10 billion that would be due if Yahoo simply sold the stock and returned the cash to its shareholders.Key to the plan is Yahoo’s intention to include its small-business services division in the spinoff, which will be called Aabaco Holdings.Under federal law, such spinoffs must include an operating business, not just stock holdings, to qualify for tax-free status. Historically, companies have bundled tiny businesses with huge stock portfolios in their spinoffs to meet the letter of the law.But an Internal Revenue Service official warned in May that the government was considering tightening the rules, potentially affecting the Yahoo plan.In its securities filing on Friday, Yahoo also noted that Chinese tax authorities had imposed new rules in February that would potentially subject such transfers to a 10 percent tax, and there has been little guidance on how to interpret those rules.Yahoo’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, has sought to reassure shareholders that the deal will proceed as planned, but the company’s stock has fallen as Wall Street worried that the deal might not pass muster with the I.R.S.Ms. Mayer is sure to face questions about the transaction on Tuesday, when she holds a webcast with analysts to discuss the company’s second-quarter financial results.In its filing on Friday, Yahoo acknowledged the risks and gave itself the option of canceling the deal.If it does proceed with the spinoff but tax authorities later impose a hefty bill, Yahoo said that Aabaco — and indirectly, its shareholders — will have to pick up the costs.In the filing, Yahoo did not name an executive team or board for Aabaco, nor did it provide details of the small-business unit that it plans to include in the company.Advertisement
