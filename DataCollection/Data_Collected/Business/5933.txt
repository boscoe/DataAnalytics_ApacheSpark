Gina Rodriguez was home in Chicago last month when she stopped at a Subway sandwich shop on the way to the golf course with her father. The Hispanic teenager working behind the counter instantly recognized her as the star of the CW Network’s breakout comedy-drama “Jane the Virgin” and said that the order was on the house. Ms. Rodriguez protested, but the girl insisted, telling the actress how inspirational it was to see someone on television who looked like her and grew up in her neighborhood.Later, at the golf course, Ms. Rodriguez bumped into more fans: the course’s owners, a white couple in their late 60s who said they tuned into the show each week.That broad appeal, spanning different generations and ethnic groups, is part of the magic of “Jane the Virgin,” Ms. Rodriguez said in a recent interview.Adapted from a Venezuelan telenovela, the show tells the story of a 23-year-old virgin who becomes pregnant after she is accidentally artificially inseminated. While outrageous and whimsical, the series is grounded by the universal relationships among Jane, her mother and her grandmother.Advertisement“Jane the Virgin” has earned critical acclaim and a Peabody Award for entertainment programs — and a Golden Globe for Ms. Rodriguez, who is of Puerto Rican descent. It is also given some of the credit for increasing the demand for English-language series that attract both English-speaking Hispanic viewers and wider audiences.AdvertisementTelevision networks are expected to highlight a number of programs featuring Hispanic leads during their presentations to advertisers, known as upfronts, this week. In addition to “Jane the Virgin” on the CW, there is “Telenovela,” a comedy starring Eva Longoria, and “Shades of Blue,” a police drama starring Jennifer Lopez, both on NBC. The push is part of a broader, albeit gradual, evolution in Hollywood to better reflect the United States’ diversity on the small screen, television executives said, while also trying to avoid the over-the-top stereotypes that have undermined other Hispanic-themed shows.“All of a sudden, there were Latino pilots coming out right and left,” Ms. Rodriguez said, alluding to the early success of “Jane.” “This wasn’t happening five years ago. The second people see the return, they want in.”More than ever before, that audience is a mix of ethnicities and cultures. The United States Census Bureau found in 2013 that 17.1 percent of the American population, or more than 54 million people, identified as Hispanic or Latino. And Hispanic viewers watched more than 130 hours of traditional and time-shifted television a month at the end of 2014, according to Nielsen.
                The upfronts shine a spotlight on the highly anticipated fall television season. How well do you know your television trivia, current and past?            “There has been a sea change, and shows that are working are much more reflective of the audience out there,” said David Stapf, president of CBS Television Studios, which is behind “Jane the Virgin.”Landing shows with cross-cultural appeal also can be good for business. For years, executives at Spanish-language television networks complained that ad spending was not keeping pace with the fast rise of the Hispanic audience. But marketers have started opening their wallets to reach those viewers, and the broader English-language networks are eager for a cut of the cash.“I think the pivot has already happened,” said Keith Turner, president for advertising sales at Univision, who listed a number of industries, including automakers, pharmaceutical companies and quick-service restaurants, that had ramped up their ad spending with the Spanish-language broadcaster.Spending on Spanish-language television networks surged 14.7 percent, to $7.2 billion, in 2014 compared with the previous year, according to WPP’s Kantar Media measurement firm. That represents a much quicker pace than the growth of ad spending for all of television, which increased 5.5 percent, to $78.1 billion, in 2014.AdvertisementYet struggles remain. Some marketers still are not convinced of the value of advertising to the demographic, industry executives said. Another challenge is figuring out how to reach Hispanic audiences with culturally relevant messages, both on Spanish- and English-language programming.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Despite its critical acclaim, “Jane the Virgin” wasn’t a smash ratings success. Still, it attracted an average of more than one million viewers and saw steady gains during the course of the season.The appetite for shows featuring a strong Latin voice has changed sharply in the past decade, said Ben Silverman, chairman of the Los Angeles-based multimedia studio Electus, who brought the concept for “Jane the Virgin” to the CW.Mr. Silverman previously worked on “Ugly Betty,” an adaptation of a Colombian telenovela about a quirky young woman working in a competitive publishing empire, which ran from 2006 until 2010. While viewers quickly embraced “Ugly Betty,” Mr. Silverman said that it was difficult to get the next wave of Hispanic-centered shows onto the air.Since then, a census has shown the quick rise of the country’s Hispanic population. At the same time, audiences have fragmented across traditional and digital networks, creating the opportunity to produce programs that appeal to groups that are more tightly defined but also more dedicated.“This time, there is a lot more of an appetite to build off what we’ve done with ‘Jane,’ ” Mr. Silverman said.Ms. Rodriguez, 30, said that she was frequently asked why a lack of diversity has persisted in Hollywood. She added that she was teaming up with Mr. Silverman to make a documentary addressing that question.Its significance, she said, is personal. For years, Ms. Rodriguez said, she struggled to land high-profile roles but also turned down others that she thought perpetuated stereotypes. She said she was surprised when she was asked to audition for the role of Jane. “They are not looking for this little brown baby to be a lead of anything,” she remembered thinking of herself at the time. “And Jane, no less. Jane. My name is Gina, but I am used to going in for Maria or Luisa. So it was really nice to hear Jane.”AdvertisementThe role was refreshing, she said, because it captured the essence of the culture without banging it over people’s heads. “Jane the Virgin,” she said, is essentially built around a mother-daughter-grandmother dynamic that could translate to other races and ethnicities: “It’s just a girl who wants a dream to come true.”Ms. Rodriguez has managed to charm critics and television executives alike, many of whom have pointed to her as one of Hollywood’s next shining stars. Mr. Silverman said he told her that rather than trying to become a famous actress, she should aspire to become Oprah.Ms. Rodriguez, who now is filming “Deepwater Horizon,” about the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, said her aspirations included writing a series of books for teenagers, continuing with “Jane,” appearing in blockbuster films and TV series and creating television shows that break through societal norms for diversity and beauty.“Everybody wants to tap into the Latino demographic,” she said. “Latinos need to be informed of their power.”A version of this article appears in print on May 11, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: How Is U.S. TV Changing?
