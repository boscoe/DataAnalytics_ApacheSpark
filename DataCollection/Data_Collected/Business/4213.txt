Clifford Hudson, said, although he declined to provide details. Nerds are a drink add-in for around 30 cents. Drinks have been a big part of Sonic’s growth strategy, with the company letting people mix and match flavors and offering them at half price between 2 and 4 p.m. The company says drinks represent 30 percent of total sales.
