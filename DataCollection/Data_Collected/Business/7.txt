The global price of a barrel of oil remains near its lowest point since the depths of the 2009 recession â€” a result of a supply glut and battle for market share between the OPEC oil cartel and the United States, which has shifted toward the role of global swing producer.
Note: Prices are based on Brent crude oil spot averages, adjusted for inflation. Oil production figures are millions of barrels a day of crude oil, including lease condensate. The latest monthly data available for this measure is April 2015.Sources: U.S. Energy Information Administration; IHSAdvertisement
