Kruszewski, Stifel’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Stifel’s strategy involves a continued expansion from its roots as a regional brokerage firm in St. Louis into a major financial player. Under Mr. Kruszewski, the company has struck 35 takeovers since 1999, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Those deals have included the purchase of Thomas Weisel Partners, the technology-focused investment bank, and the acquisition of a majority stake in Miller Buckfire & Company, a firm that specializes in providing bankruptcy advice.The newest addition is the Barclays operation, which has about 180 financial advisers and oversees about $56 billion in client assets. The British bank has been shedding some noncore businesses in recent years.As part of the deal, Stifel will serve as exclusive distributor for some of Barclays’ stock and bond offerings.“We are pleased to have been able to find in Stifel a buyer that is committed to helping the franchise to grow over the long term, and providing for our clients an expanded range of products and services,” Barclays’ chief executive of global wealth and investment management, Akshaya Bhargava, said.The deal is expected to close by the middle of November.Advising Stifel on the deal was Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, which itself was acquired by Stifel nearly two years ago.Advertisement
