The agency said on Friday that the drug, Xalkori capsules, was approved for patients with the ROS-1 gene mutation, who make up about 1 percent of patients in the United States with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of the disease. The twice-a-day drug is part of a new generation of medications that fight disease by targeting specific genes found in certain patients. It was initially approved in 2011 for another subset of lung cancer patients. Pfizer posted sales for the drug of $488 million in 2015, according its annual report.Advertisement
