But in a surprising finding, the study, published by the journal Nature on Wednesday, found that honeybees — which get trucked from place to place to pollinate major crops — did not show the significant ill effects that wild cousins like bumblebees did. A second study published in the same journal showed that in laboratory tests, bees were not repelled by the pesticides and may even prefer pesticide-coated crops, making the problem worse. Exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides reduced the density of wild bees and resulted in less reproduction as well as colonies that did not grow when compared with bees not exposed to the pesticide, the study found. Scientists in Sweden conducted a study using 16 patches of landscape, eight where canola seeds were coated with the pesticide and eight where they were not. In areas treated with the pesticide, there were half as many wild bees a square meter than there were in areas not treated. Advertisement
