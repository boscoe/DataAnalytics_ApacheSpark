She said that the amount was “very substantial” and that shareholders would face significant risk if they continued to litigate instead of settling.Maurice R. Greenberg sued the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2011, contending that their takeover of A.I.G. in 2008 was improper.The settlement covers investors who bought A.I.G. securities from March 16, 2006, to Sept. 16, 2008, when the company received its first bailout.Judge Swain overruled an objection by two people who bought shares before the beginning of that period but who said they should be included in the class.For the plaintiffs’ lawyers’ work, Judge Swain awarded the law firms Barrack, Rodos & Bacine and the Miller Law Firm $116.46 million in fees and more than $4 million in expenses.Investors, led by the State of Michigan Retirement Systems, which oversees several state pension plans, accused A.I.G. of failing to disclose the risks it took on through its portfolio of credit default swaps and a securities lending program.They said the failures had led investors to buy stock and debt they otherwise would not have bought, resulting in billions of dollars in losses.A government rescue in 2008 led taxpayers to take a nearly 80 percent stake in the New York-based insurer.The government has since sold its stake in A.I.G., resulting in a positive return of $22.7 billion to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.Advertisement
