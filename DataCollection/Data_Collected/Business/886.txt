Ketchum assumed one of the most trying roles as head of Finra, Wall Street’s self-regulating organization, with a mission to amplify its power.Six years later, Mr. Ketchum, 64, has announced that he plans to retire as chief executive in the second half of 2016, according to a statement from the agency on Friday. Finra’s board will look at internal and external candidates to replace Mr. Ketchum, the statement said.The retirement concludes Mr. Ketchum’s three decades as a regulator for the financial industry. Finra itself was born out of the 2007 combination of the Nasdaq stock market’s National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange’s regulatory arm.Mr. Ketchum served in both organizations, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he was the director of the division of market regulation. He also had a brief stint at Citigroup as general counsel.Although Finra is an independent organization and not part of the government, it is authorized by Congress to protect investors by writing and enforcing rules for the securities industry.After Mr. Ketchum’s move to overhaul Finra’s enforcement division, the organization brought 8,271 disciplinary actions against individuals and companies in 2014 and ordered $100 million in fines to be paid to investors.Advertisement
