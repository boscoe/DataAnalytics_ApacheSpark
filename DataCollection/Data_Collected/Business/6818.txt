They are valued at $2.9 billion in total.Australia’s biggest investment bank, the Macquarie Group, and the private equity firms Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital have contacted Morgan Stanley, which G.E. hired to sell the businesses.But Macquarie and the private equity firms are struggling to find value in a diverse spread of businesses that have neither the scale nor potential margins that would make them eager buyers, said the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The lukewarm interest in the commercial business contrasts with the fiercely competitive auction for G.E.’s consumer lending business in Australia and New Zealand. Varde Partners, K.K.R. and Deutsche Bank agreed in March to pay $6.3 billion for the business, beating out, among others, TPG, Macquarie and Apollo Global Management.One investment banker who has done a preliminary analysis of GE Capital’s lending and leasing businesses said the private equity firms might find it difficult to put together a funding package to buy such a diverse mix of businesses, some of which are small, have few customers and are managed by just a few people.In an effort to keep the private equity giants interested, Morgan Stanley has not instituted a strict timetable of when preliminary bids must be submitted.GE Capital, Morgan Stanley, Blackstone, K.K.R., TPG and Macquarie either declined to comment or did not return calls seeking comment.Advertisement
