Laurence Fink, chief executive of the world’s largest money manager, explaining why he is a "little more bullish," said that he believes the market will be higher by year end.BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, reported a 6 percent increase in its fourth-quarter earnings on Friday as investors continued to allocate money to the company’s exchange traded funds despite a volatile stock market.For the full year, BlackRock’s fast-growing iShares franchise took in $130 billion, consolidating the company’s position as the largest provider of E.T.F.s. In the fourth quarter alone, the company had net E.T.F. inflows of $60 billion.E.T.F.s are funds that trade on the stock exchange and track a wide variety of indexes. Although many investors have been pulling money out of traditional actively managed mutual funds, BlackRock’s E.T.F.s, especially those that invest in bonds, have consistently taken in money.That money has continued to come in even after the market disruption last August, when the stocks of some of the company’s largest E.T.F.s plunged, suggesting that investors have not lost confidence in these investment vehicles.AdvertisementRegulators and numerous industry experts have warned that some E.T.F.s, especially those that invest in hard-to-sell assets like high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, might pose broader risks to the market.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            E.T.F. providers have countered that their funds have held up well, not least over the last few months, when many investors were pulling money out of high-yield funds.AdvertisementIn late December, when the investment firm Third Avenue Management closed the door on investors who wanted to remove money from its poorly performing high-yield fund, similar credit E.T.F.s were able to satisfy redemption requests with no serious disruptions.“Despite all the worries, the E.T.F market has proven to be the best liquid and safe way to get exposure to the markets,” Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, said in an interview on Friday.Mr. Fink pointed out that during the worst period of the turbulence in the junk bond market last month, investors bought and sold $20 billion worth of the $14 billion iShares high-yield exchange traded fund, with only $1 billion of actual redemptions.“People were able to buy and sell however much they wanted without upsetting the market,” Mr. Fink said.At BlackRock, total assets under management remained flat for the quarter at $4.6 trillion — an achievement given that many investors, spooked by the market’s downward turn, have been pulling their money out.The company earned $861 million, or $5.11 a share, up from $813 million, or $4.77 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.AdvertisementFor the full year, earnings grew 2 percent, to $3.2 billion.The company’s other main business areas, funds offered to retail and institutional investors, grew modestly in the quarter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

BlackRock now manages $1.1 trillion in E.T.F.s, the most in the industry.And this year, the company’s bond E.T.F.s, which invest in a range of sectors including corporate bonds, emerging markets and Treasury securities, attracted $50 billion of new money.Nevertheless, Mr. Fink was quick to highlight that BlackRock in 2015 attracted $61 billion in assets for its stock and bond funds that actively try to beat the market.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
