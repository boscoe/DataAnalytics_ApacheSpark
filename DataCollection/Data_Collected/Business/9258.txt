Yahoo signaled on Monday that it was willing to risk a fight with the federal government to spin off its 15 percent stake in the Alibaba Group, the Chinese Internet giant.Yahoo disclosed in a regulatory filing on Monday that its board voted last Wednesday to let the company stick with a plan to spin out its shares in Alibaba into a separate publicly traded company.The Internal Revenue Service declined to rule that transaction tax-free, a critical reason for using the relatively complex transaction. Simply selling the Alibaba stock could generate a tax bill that analysts have estimated at about $9 billion.But over the last several months, the I.R.S. has strongly hinted that it would begin cracking down on these spinoffs, which involve fusing a big block of shares with a tiny operating business.AdvertisementYahoo plans to spin off its stake in Alibaba with a division focusing on small businesses, creating a new company called Aabaco Holdings. The company disclosed previously that its plan had the blessing of its corporate lawyers.Shareholders have pressured Yahoo to pursue such a transaction, arguing that they were rightfully owed the proceeds of any eventual sale of the Alibaba stock.AdvertisementIn the absence of a ruling from the I.R.S., Yahoo will proceed with the spinoff by year-end, and potentially face an audit in several years that could declare that the move was taxable. The company would then most likely go to court to challenge the decision.A version of this article appears in print on September 29, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Full Speed Ahead.
