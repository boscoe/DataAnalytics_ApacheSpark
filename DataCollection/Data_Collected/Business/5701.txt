Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa declared a state of emergency as bird flu continued to spread around the state, including possible cases at four poultry farms announced on Friday. Nearly 17 million chickens and turkeys in the state are dead, dying or scheduled to be killed because of the disease. The proclamation, in effect until May 31, activates disaster response procedures and allows state agencies to help dispose of dead birds, an increasing problem in the state, where 27 percent of its 60 million egg-laying chickens will be wiped out. Iowa is the nation’s leading egg producer, providing one of every five eggs eaten in the country, and ninth in turkey production. “This is a magnitude much greater than anything we’ve dealt with in recent modern times,” Governor Branstad said. Over all, chicken and turkey producers in the Midwest could lose more than 21 million birds because of the disease.A version of this brief appears in print on May 2, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Iowa Declares Emergency as Bird Flu Spreads .
