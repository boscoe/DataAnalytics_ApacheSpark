WASHINGTON —  More Americans bought homes in May, a sign of economic strength that is pushing up average prices.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that sales of used homes climbed 5.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million. May was the third consecutive month of the sales rate’s exceeding five million homes on an annual basis, putting home-buying on pace for its best year since 2007.Solid hiring since 2014 and relatively low mortgage rates have stirred up demand and helped generate more first-time buyers, though rising sales have propelled prices because relatively few properties are listed for sale."We can credit that to the stronger job market, a more confident consumer" and some additional listings in an otherwise tight market, said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.MARCH+6.5%APRIL–2.3%MAY+5.1% 5.6 million5.24.8   4.44.0’14’15Some of the buying might also reflect a rush to capture the benefits of lower interest rates and relatively cheap prices that are jumping higher each month.Advertisement"There may be some anticipation of prices going even higher, which is sparking a move off the sidelines," Ms. Lee added.AdvertisementMedian home prices climbed 7.9 percent over the last 12 months to $228,700, about $1,700 shy of the July 2006 peak.The market has just 5.1 months’ supply of homes, versus an average of six months in a healthy market.Economists say that the sales gains of recent months could be short-lived if prices increase so sharply that buyers are priced out of the market. The recent rise in mortgage rates could also curtail sales, as it did in the middle of 2013.

First-time buyers also accounted for a growing share of sales, a sign that younger buyers are returning to the market after enduring an economic downturn and sluggish rebound that delayed their purchases.About 32 percent of the homes sold last month went to first-timers, compared with 27 percent a year ago. The improvement is substantial but lags the historical average of 40 percent.More Americans signed contracts to buy used homes in April, which should translate into more completed sales in coming months. The Realtors’ seasonally adjusted pending home sales index climbed 3.4 percent to 112.4 in April, the highest reading since May 2006.Low mortgage rates have helped, although rates are now starting to steadily rise in ways that might limit sales later in the year. Average 30-year fixed rates were 4 percent last week, according to the mortgage giant Freddie Mac. That average has increased from a 52-week low of 3.59 percent.A version of this article appears in print on June 23, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Home Sales Rose in May, With Help From Strong Hiring and Low Rates.
