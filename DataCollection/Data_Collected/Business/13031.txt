A rare bright spot was GU, its value brand.“If wage increases were on the horizon, consumers would be able to accept some price increases. But wages aren’t going up, so there’s a strong propensity to save,” said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.Yanai, whose group is Japan’s largest clothing retailer and has made him the country’s wealthiest man, still has plans to make it one of the world’s biggest brands.The group has made a major push overseas.Yanai, who also presides over brands including Comptoir des Cotonniers and J Brand, says he aims to open 100 Uniqlo stores in the United States, the world’s biggest clothing market, over the next few years.But the group, and Uniqlo in particular, have struggled overseas in a crowded market where rivals such as Gap are already well established, and where it faces price competition from fast-fashion brands such as H&M and Inditex’s Zara.Losses from Uniqlo’s operations in the U.S. market widened in the past six months, as it closed stores.That and troubles at home left the company with an operating profit for the three months to February that more than halved to 23.4 billion yen (£152.7 million) — less than half the market forecast. It slashed its full-year outlook for the second time this year, and is now focusing on cutting production costs.Advertisement
