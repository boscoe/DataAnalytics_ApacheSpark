The company said the charge, which amounts to 77 cents a share, would result in lower earnings for the full year. The added funds were needed to cover higher costs for development while keeping the $49 billion aircraft program on track for initial deliveries in 2017, the company said. This is the second charge Boeing has taken on the KC-46, one of its biggest military development efforts, bringing the total after-tax charges to just over $800 million. Boeing says it will adjust its earnings per share outlook when it reports results on Wednesday, but its outlook for revenue and cash flow will remain unchanged. The tanker investment would have a cash impact this year, but Boeing would “make up for it in other ways” to maintain its full-year cash outlook, said a company spokesman, Bernard Choi. Advertisement
