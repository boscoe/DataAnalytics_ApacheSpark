The trading plan, which is being managed by Morgan Stanley, had been set to expire this month.The move continues the government’s efforts to end its ownership of some of the nation’s largest banks. The British government took significant stakes in Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland as part of a bailout during the financial crisis, but it is eager to terminate its holdings in the two lenders. It still owns about 80 percent of R.B.S.The government has not laid out a timetable for ending its ownership of stakes in the lenders, but it has expressed a desire to do so, at a profit for taxpayers, sooner rather than later.“We’re determined to get on with the job of returning Lloyds to private ownership,” George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a news release on Monday. “That’s why I’m extending the plan for six months, so that we can make even more progress in returning money to the taxpayer and paying down the national debt.”The government held as much as 40 percent of Lloyds after the lender received a bailout in 2008 of 17 billion pounds, or about $26 billion at current exchange rates, but it has pared its holdings since September 2013 as the bank’s prospects have improved.Lloyds returned to an annual profit last year and paid its first dividend since the government bailout in May.The British government has recovered more than £10.5 billion of the bailout money given to Lloyds, including nearly £3.5 billion from the trading plan, which was first announced in December 2014 and involved a measured sale of a portion of its holdings, the Treasury said.“As with all disposals, delivering value for money for the taxpayer is a key consideration and shares will not be sold below the average price per share paid for them,” U.K. Financial Investments, which oversees the government’s holdings in Lloyds and R.B.S., said in a news release.The government has sold about 4.2 billion shares at an average price of more than 80 pence a share since December 2014, U.K. Financial Investments said. The government paid an average of 73.6 pence a share when it first took a stake in Lloyds.Shares of Lloyds rose 1.4 percent to 88.99 pence in late morning trading in London on Monday.“Today’s announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back,” a Lloyds spokesman said. “This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.”On Monday, the Treasury said the government was also planning for a share sale to retail investors in the next 12 months, with details to be disclosed “in due course.”Mr. Osborne vowed in the weeks before last month’s general election in Britain to sell a portion of the government’s Lloyds stake to retail investors, possibly this year.The government delayed plans in the fall to sell to retail investors amid turmoil in the markets.Advertisement
