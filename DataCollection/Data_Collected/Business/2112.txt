He pleaded guilty in September to one count of unauthorized access to a computer and was ordered to pay Morgan Stanley restitution of $600,000 and forfeit the computer equipment he used.Judge Kevin T. Duffy of Federal District Court in Manhattan announced the sentence on Tuesday to a relieved Mr. Marsh.“We are ecstatic by the judge’s sentence,” said Robert C. Gottlieb, his defense lawyer. “We are grateful that Judge Duffy felt that leniency was warranted in this case.”Mr. Marsh and his lawyer have contended that he did not intend to sell the information, share it or post it online. One theory was that foreign hackers got into his home computer and took the information.A spokesman for Morgan Stanley had no comment on Tuesday.Prosecutors said Mr. Marsh used the bank’s computers from June 2011 to December 2014 to gain access to confidential information about certain clients in 6,000 unauthorized searches. He obtained names, addresses, telephone numbers, account numbers and investment information on approximately 730,000 client accounts. He uploaded information to his personal computer at home in Hoboken, N.J.This year, Morgan Stanley said he took data on roughly 10 percent of the firm’s 3.5 million wealth management customers.Mr. Marsh was talking about job opportunities with two other financial institutions from late 2013 to the end of last year. He retrieved the client information to use it for his personal advantage, prosecutors said in September.Advertisement
