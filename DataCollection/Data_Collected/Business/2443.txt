In a sharp escalation of penalties against automakers that skirt safety laws, the nation’s top auto safety agency has fined Honda Motor a record $70 million for grossly underreporting fatal accidents and injuries to the government, regulators said on Thursday.The penalty doubles a fine levied against General Motors last year as the agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, faces scrutiny for being slow to identify safety problems and failing to use the full extent of its legal powers.Honda, the agency said, broke the law in two ways, each earning the maximum fine of $35 million. It did not report hundreds of death and injury claims to the agency for the last 11 years nor did it report certain warranty and other claims in the same period. Both types of reports are considered crucial to helping regulators identify potential safety defects.“Today’s announcement sends a very clear message to the entire industry that manufacturers have responsibility for the complete and timely reporting of this critical safety information,” Mark Rosekind, the new head of the agency, said on Thursday.The unfiled claims included eight, including one involving a death, for problems with airbags made by the Japanese supplier Takata, which itself has been embroiled in a safety crisis that has spurred the recall of millions of vehicles worldwide. The airbags can explode violently when they deploy, sending metal fragments flying into the cabin; five deaths have been linked to the defect.AdvertisementHonda, the automaker most affected by the Takata recalls, said it used other channels to report those eight claims to regulators, but it did not specify how. As far back as 2004, Honda had received reports of rupturing airbags, The New York Times reported in September.AdvertisementUnder a system called Early Warning Reporting, automakers are required to disclose claims they receive that blame vehicle defects for serious injuries or deaths. The system was set up in 2000 after a wave of highway rollovers in Ford Explorers with Firestone tires. It was intended to give the safety agency better access to accident data and more leverage over the industry.In November, Honda disclosed that it had consistently underreported claims for over a decade. An internal audit found that it had not reported 1,729 written claims or notices on injuries or deaths from mid-2003 through mid-2014 — far more than the approximately 900 reports that it did make for that period.A Honda employee identified the problem in 2011, and regulators notified Honda of potential underreporting in 2012, but the company did not take action until September 2014. In November, after receiving preliminary findings of the audit, the agency demanded that Honda submit more information on its reporting. That request came after the Center for Auto Safety, a private advocacy group, accused Honda in an open letter  in October of systematically underreporting the Early Warning claims.

A  Times investigation into the agency’s handling of major safety defects over the last decade found that it had often been slow to identify problems, tentative to act and reluctant to use its full legal arsenal against automakers.Mr. Rosekind, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, was confirmed as the administrator of the agency in December, almost a year after David L. Strickland resigned as its leader.This week, Mr. Rosekind said that the agency was overhauling its recall infrastructure to see how it could be improved and added that he wanted more resources, including additional workers, for the agency.
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            “This is an agency that is so under-resourced,” he said. “It’s more severe than I realized from the outside.”He also said he would support giving the agency more power by increasing the maximum fine of $35 million that the agency can levy against an automaker.AdvertisementThe penalty against Honda follows multimillion-dollar penalties against three other automakers last year. In May, regulators imposed a penalty of $35 million against G.M. after it failed to report for more than a decade an ignition defect in the Chevrolet Cobalt and other small cars that has been linked to at least 42 deaths. In August, the agency levied a penalty of nearly $17.4 million on Hyundai for not reporting in a timely manner a defect that affected braking in its cars. And in October, the agency fined Ferrari $3.5 million for failing to submit Early Warning reports on fatal accidents.In 2014, the agency issued more than $126 million in civil penalties, including the $70 million fine against Honda, which the automaker agreed to in December.“These fines reflect the tough stance we will take against those who violate the law and fail to do their part in the mission to keep Americans safe on the road,” Mr. Foxx said.Aaron M.
