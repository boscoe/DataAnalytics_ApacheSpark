The Urus S.U.V., unveiled as a concept at the Beijing Auto Show in 2012, also broadens Lamborghini’s portfolio beyond two sleek two-seat super sports cars — the Aventador and the Huracán. Ian Fletcher, lead analyst at IHS Automotive, said the S.U.V. could attract customers “who find the dramatic styling of Lamborghini products appealing but find its typical sports cars restrictive.” The Urus is expected to enter the market in 2018 with 3,000 vehicles a year, more than doubling Lamborghini’s current output of 2,530.
