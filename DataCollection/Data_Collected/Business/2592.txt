Ascap, the giant music licensing agency, has appointed Elizabeth Matthews as its new chief executive, a generational shift as the century-old organization adapts to the digital age.Ms. Matthews, 46, will begin her duties immediately, said the nonprofit organization, whose full name is the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, in an announcement on Tuesday. She succeeds John A. LoFrumento, who retired late last year after 17 years as chief of the organization. Ascap was founded in 1914 and handles the performing rights of songs when they are played on the radio or streamed online.Ms. Matthews is relatively new to the organization, having joined as general counsel in 2012 after a career at Viacom Media Networks.Ascap and its rival Broadcast Music Inc., or BMI, collect a total of nearly $2 billion in performing-rights royalties each year, and for decades both have operated under federal antitrust regulations. Last year, they asked the Justice Department for changes to these regulations, arguing that the rules prevented them from reaping fair royalty rates from online services like Pandora.Last year, Ascap lost a federal rate-setting case against Pandora, and BMI is set to begin a similar trial next month.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
