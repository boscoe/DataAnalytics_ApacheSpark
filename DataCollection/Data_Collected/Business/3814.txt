Target said this free shipping was now available to all online orders coming from the continental U.S. or from military postal facilities that meet the $25 threshold. The company says handling fees may still apply. Brian Sozzi, chief executive of the research firm Belus Capital Advisors, said, “The U.S. consumer now views free shipping as a right.” He added that he thought retailers would do away with the charges altogether. Target began offering free shipping for orders worth $50 or more in June, and it offered free shipping on all items over the holidays. Amazon offers free shipping in the United States for some items when the value of the order exceeds $35. Subscribers to Amazon Prime, which costs $99, get free two-day shipping. Customers who order more than $50 from Walmart’s website can get free shipping if they can wait from six to eight days for delivery. Target has been working to win back customers since a 2013 data breach, in which hackers stole millions of customers’ credit and debit card records. Advertisement
