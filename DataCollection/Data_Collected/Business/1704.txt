Yellen, indicated that the American economy was on track for an interest rate increase this month, though she was careful to point out that the Fed would need to review any coming data before making a decision.Government bond prices fell after Ms. Yellen’s comments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.18 percent from 2.15 percent.The data Ms. Yellen was referring to include the November jobs report, which comes out on Friday.
