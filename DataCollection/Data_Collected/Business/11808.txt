LONDON — Hikma Pharmaceuticals said on Wednesday that it had nearly halved the cash portion of its offer for the German drug maker Boehringer Ingelheim’s generic drugs business in the United States because sales were lower than it anticipated in 2015 and could continue to be below expectations.Hikma, which is based in Amman, Jordan, said it would now pay $647 million in cash and issue 40 million new shares to Boehringer, representing about 16.71 percent of its outstanding stock.That is $535 million less than the $1.18 billion in cash that Hikma said it would pay when the deal was first announced in July.Hikma said that it expected revenue in the generics business, Roxane Laboratories and Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane, to be lower than anticipated. Hikma said that was a result of higher-than-expected rebates paid to wholesalers, as retailers increasingly bought the business’s products through third parties.Advertisement“The rebates relate to all Roxane products, although some specific product rebates have been offered on a case-by-case basis,” Hikma said in a news release. “The rebates resulted in lower net selling prices on marketed products than had previously been expected.”AdvertisementThe news sent Hikma’s shares down nearly 20 percent in early trading in London on Wednesday.Hikma said it expected that sales from the business could continue to be affected in 2016 and 2017.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Hikma said it expected that Roxane’s full-year revenue in 2016 would continue to be negatively affected and would be lower than revenue in 2015.Hikma said it now anticipated full-year revenue for Roxane in 2017 to be $700 million to $750 million, down from its prior expectation of $725 million to $775 million.“We remain very excited about the strategic and financial value of this acquisition, which will transform our position and scale in the U.S. generics market,” Said Darwazah, the Hikma chief executive, said in a news release.“Whilst there will be a short-term impact related primarily to higher than expected product rebates, we have agreed a reduced purchase price to reflect this, and we remain confident in our outlook for the business,” he added.Roxane Laboratories, founded in 1885, sells more than 80 medications, including oral liquids, tablets, capsules and nasal sprays. It was acquired by Boehringer in 1978.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
