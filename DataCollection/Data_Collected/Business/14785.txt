To the Editor:Re “Buyback Surge May Signal Danger, Not Growth” (Strategies, by Jeff Sommer, June 26):As your article’s headline says, the surge in stock buybacks may signal danger, and certainly does not signal growth. To grow, businesses must invest. So if a company uses its money to buy shares, it should mean that management cannot find an investment that will provide a return on equity at least equal to that of the past. That’s a bad sign for the company’s outlook.Furthermore, most buybacks do not make sense for the shareholder. Sound investment advice is “buy low, sell high.” Instead, data show that corporate buyback activity increases when stock prices are high, like now, and shrinks when stock prices are falling or low. However, the more likely reason is that buybacks boost the share price of executive stock options.The only positive appears to be the boost in share price by the reduction in the number of shares. So it would appear that a company buys back shares because its business outlook is poor, or that management hopes to please investors by raising the share price.The Securities and Exchange Commission should evaluate selected companies to learn whether stock buybacks have benefited shareholders over a market cycle.Hollister SykesCranford, N.J., June 26Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.A version of this article appears in print on July 10, 2016, on Page BU6 of the New York edition with the headline: Letters.
