It remains undeveloped, except for temporary office structures, since Japan Post tore down the Osaka Central Post Office in 2012, intending to build a 40-story office and retail tower complex.Japan Post has shelved the project while it “considers the economic environment and development plans in the neighborhood.”The neighborhood does not look promising. Within sight of Japan Post’s temporary premises is the giant office and retail complex Grand Front Osaka. That development, which opened in 2013, is 30 percent empty.Though Miki Shoji says vacancy rates for prime Osaka offices fell to 8 percent in November from 9.85 percent a year earlier, that remains above the rate of 5 percent to 6 percent that is considered healthy, and the city’s average annual office rent has fallen 1.5 percent over the past year.That is because there is no influx of outside tenants, said Yasutaka Inoue, managing director at the Osaka-based developer Keihanshin Building. “When a big office tower is built in Osaka’s city center, new tenants move in from the same area, not from outside Osaka,” he said.Keihanshin generates 90 percent of its revenue in Osaka but wants to increase its focus on the Tokyo market, Mr. Inoue said.In Nagoya, the center of Japan’s third-biggest regional economy and home to Toyota Motor, the property market was optimistic amid plans for a super-high-speed train service, though it will not be in operation for at least 12 years.The number of office property transactions in Nagoya jumped 8 percent in the first half of 2014 from a year earlier to 94 deals, according to Ichi, a local broker. And the city’s offices are filling up faster than Osaka’s, with the vacancy rate down to 7.5 percent in November from 9.8 percent a year earlier, Miki Shoji data show.But that trend looks unsustainable.More than 3.5 million square feet of prime office space are set to become available in the coming two years, including five major office towers.That would add more than 10 percent to the current total, and one local broker predicts it could push Nagoya’s vacancy rate back as high as 17 percent.Though some prime office buildings in Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka have started to fill up over the past year, rents have not risen. Demand is just not strong enough, said developers and brokers, boding ill for a sustained recovery in real estate prices.“Investors will need greater skill and better expertise to generate good returns on properties outside Tokyo,” said Katsumi Tanimoto, general manager of business development at the Fukuoka-based property investor Genkai Capital Management.
