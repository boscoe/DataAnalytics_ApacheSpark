Economists had forecast claims rising to 275,000.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, fell to the lowest level since April 2000.The economy barely grew in the first quarter, held back by a range of factors, including the dollar, bad weather and port disruptions. Retail sales and manufacturing data suggest that the pace of activity, while picking up, remains modest.In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand fell 0.4 percent last month as the cost of energy products and food declined.It was the third time this year that the index dropped and followed a 0.2 percent increase in March.Producer prices also were weighed down by declining profit margins at retailers and wholesalers. In the 12 months through April, producer prices fell 1.3 percent, the biggest year-on-year decline since 2010, after declining 0.8 percent in March.Economists had forecast the P.P.I. rising 0.2 percent last month and falling 0.8 percent from a year ago.A drop of 0.7 percent in the index for final demand goods accounted for more than 70 percent of the decline in the index last month. Energy prices fell 2.9 percent after rising 1.5 percent in March. Food prices fell for a fifth straight month.Last month, the volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, fell 0.8 percent after slipping 0.2 percent in the previous month.An important measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services ticked up 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in March.While the weakness in the index is unlikely to be fully reflected in next week’s consumer inflation data, as the relationship between the two has weakened, economists said the very benign inflation environment would persist for a while.Advertisement
