AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersTOKYO — Toyota Motor took the unusual step of projecting a drop in annual vehicle sales on Wednesday, in a move that could let Volkswagen take the industry crown as the market leader this year as demand slumps in Japan, Indonesia and other key markets.The forecast underscores the resolve of Toyota’s chief executive, Akio Toyoda, to steer the company through measured, profitable growth, rather than to chase volumes after getting burned by a capacity glut after the 2008 global financial crisis.Toyota said Wednesday that it expected 2015 global vehicle sales, including those of its subsidiaries, Daihatsu Motor and Hino Motors, to slip 1 percent to 10.15 million vehicles. Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker, has not forecast a drop in annual vehicle sales since at least 2000, a company spokeswoman said. That excludes a midyear revision in 2011, when natural disasters temporarily halted production. Toyota did not provide initial forecasts for 2009 amid uncertainty during the financial crisis.Mr. Toyoda has declared a three-year freeze on building new factories — through the financial year ending in March 2016 — to focus on becoming leaner and more profitable, even after Toyota took the top sales spot back from General Motors in 2012. Toyota expects growth in China, the world’s biggest auto market, to halve this year after sales fell short of its target in 2014 in a slowing economy and amid political tensions between Beijing and Tokyo. In contrast, China helped Toyota’s rival, Volkswagen, reach growth of 4.2 percent to 10.14 million vehicles last year. Volkswagen’s aggressive expansion plans could help it overtake Toyota.Toyota expects its parent-only sales to rise 0.4 percent to 9.18 million vehicles, with a 7 percent fall to 1.45 million in Japan, where a sales tax increase last year has hurt demand. It expects overseas sales to rise 2 percent to 7.73 million vehicles because of a healthy United States market.Advertisement
