Best Buy, the nation’s largest consumer electronics chain, has started its first wedding registry, catering to couples interested in the latest devices, from flat-panel TVs to Apple iPads. The site, www.BestBuy.com/WeddingRegistry, will be added to the retailer’s mobile app next week. Kiosks will be installed in the company’s 1,000-plus large-format United States stores by early April, where customers can check out registries and print shopping lists. Couples will have the option of syncing their registries with MyRegistry.com and Theknot.com. Best Buy is seeking new ways to increase sales and make itself more relevant to shoppers, particularly those in their 20s and 30s. “Electronics and small appliances are as important to today’s newlyweds as silverware and towels,” said Wendy Fritz, Best Buy’s head of gift strategy.A version of this brief appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Best Buy Opens Wedding Registry in Bid for New Sales.
