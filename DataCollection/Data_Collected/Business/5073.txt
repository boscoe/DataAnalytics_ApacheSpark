His appointment, which is subject to board approval, will begin in October.He will be replaced, on an interim basis, by Stephen J. Adler, the president and editor in chief of Reuters, Thomson Reuters said.“We believe Andrew is a natural choice and a good fit for us given his track record, international experience and proven ability to deliver top-quality journalism while also growing digital revenues globally,” John Botts, senior nonexecutive director of Euromoney, said in a statement. He will help accelerate Euromoney’s move to a digital-only format for its publications, Mr. Bott said.Those include Euromoney magazine and niche titles like International Tax Review, among more than 100 magazines, newsletters and journals. Its parent company is Daily Mail and General Trust, which owns the British tabloid The Daily Mail.“Euromoney has established a global platform built on strong brands and a world-class digital backbone,” Mr. Rashbass said, crediting its current chairman, Richard Ensor.At The Economist, Mr. Rashbass oversaw a period of growth in print and online, attracting the kinds of affluent global readers that many other publications covet. John Micklethwait, the editor of The Economist at the time, has since joined Bloomberg News.At Reuters, a news service with reporters across the globe, Mr. Rashbass scrapped a plan to start Reuters Next, a news operation aimed at consumers, which prompted the departures of several executives.Advertisement
