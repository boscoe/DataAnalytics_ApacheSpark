Sony has received approval from the European Commission to complete its $750 million purchase of the half of the Sony/ATV Music Publishing catalog owned by the Michael Jackson estate, the commission announced on Tuesday.The transaction would give Sony full control of the songwriting rights to more than two million songs — including works by Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and the catalog’s jewel, about 250 Beatles songs — more than 20 years after the company formed a joint venture with Jackson. Sony already owned the other half of the catalog.The deal had been opposed in Europe by Warner Music, a competitor to Sony, and by Impala, a trade group representing independent music companies, which had argued that it would give Sony/ATV an outsize influence. Sony/ATV also administers the music publishing catalog of EMI, and together the two catalogs give Sony/ATV a global market share of about 28 percent, according to industry estimates.In a statement released on Tuesday, the commission said it had found that “the transaction would have no negative impact on competition in any of the markets for recorded music and music publishing in the European Economic Area.”Helen Smith, the executive chairwoman of Impala, called the decision “clearly wrong,” and said that it went against the European Union’s earlier views on consolidation in music. In 2012, for example, when Sony and other investors took control of EMI’s publishing catalog, they were required to sell off about $35 million in assets.An article on Wednesday about the European Commission’s approval of Sony’s acquisition of half of the Sony/ATV Music Publishing catalog owned by the Michael Jackson estate described the transaction incorrectly. It is a purchase deal, not a merger.A version of this article appears in print on August 3, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Sony Closes Big Music Deal With Michael Jackson Estate.
