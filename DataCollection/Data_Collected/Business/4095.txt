LONDON —  The British bank Barclays said on Tuesday that it fell to a loss in 2014, its annual results dragged down by charges related to potential fines and litigation costs for conduct by its employees. It also posted lower income in its investment bank as it continues to shrink that business.Barclays’  annual results included 2.8 billion pounds, or about $4.3 billion, in litigation and conduct charges. That included £750 million in the fourth quarter related to continuing investigations into the potential manipulation of foreign currency trading markets, bringing the total set aside in 2014 for those investigations to about £1.25 billion.The bank opted not to settle in November when a group of the world’s biggest banks agreed to pay a combined $4.25 billion to end investigations by British, Swiss and United States authorities, who accused them of conspiring to manipulate currency markets. Barclays still faces inquiries by the authorities in Britain and the United States.The bank’s fourth-quarter results also included an additional £200 million in charges related to the improper selling of payment protection insurance, a product that has cost British banks billions of pounds in redress in recent years. Barclays set aside about £1.1 billion in total for the loan insurance payouts and other customer compensation in 2014.AdvertisementAmong a laundry list of legal disclosures in its annual report, Barclays also said that it had been providing information to the United States Justice Department in connection with an inquiry into “precious metals and precious metals-based financial instruments.”For the year that ended on Dec. 31, Barclays reported a net loss of £174 million ($268 million), in contrast to a profit of £540 million for 2013. Excluding the legal provisions and other one-time charges, Barclays said its full-year pretax profit had risen 12 percent to £5.5 billion, from £4.9 billion in 2013. The adjusted results exceeded analysts’ expectations.Advertisement“We remain focused on addressing outstanding conduct issues, including those relating to foreign exchange trading,” Antony P. Jenkins, chief executive of Barclays, said in a news release. “I regard the behavior at the center of these investigations as wholly incompatible with our values, and I share the frustration of colleagues and shareholders that matters like these continue to cast a shadow over our business. But resolving these issues is an important part of our plan for Barclays.”The bank’s bonus awards for 2014 declined 22 percent to £1.86 billion.Mr. Jenkins received total compensation of £5.47 million in 2014, including a bonus of £1.1 million. He turned down a bonus the previous two years, citing Barclays’ continued restructuring and litigation expenses as a reason for not taking his bonus in 2013.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We’ve a lot of work to do, but we’ve made good progress and the bonus reflects that.”For the fourth quarter, the bank posted a loss of £1.68 billion, compared with a loss of £642 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.Operating expenses declined 10 percent to £16 billion in 2014, from £17.8 billion in 2013.Barclays reduced its overall payroll by about 5 percent, to 132,300 people, in 2014, down from 139,600 in 2013. The lender announced plans last year to eliminate up to 19,000 jobs as part of its revamping, including 7,000 in its investment bank by 2016.A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Barclays Logs $268 Million 2014 Loss, After Charges for Potential Legal Costs.
