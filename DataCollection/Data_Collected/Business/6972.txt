In a separate statement, Bouygues said that it had received an unsolicited offer from Altice and that its board would review the proposal on Tuesday. “No negotiations are in progress,” the company added.The deal, if finalized, would combine two of France’s largest mobile providers — Numericable-SFR and Bouygues Telecom — and oust Orange as France’s largest cellphone company. The transaction also would change the telecommunications landscape in France, reducing the main mobile providers from four to three.Word of the potential combination comes just over a year after Bouygues Telecom lost out to Altice in a very public bidding war to acquire SFR from the French media conglomerate Vivendi. Altice ultimately paid more than 13.5 billion euros for the SFR business last year and combined it with Numericable, its cable arm.Altice, which is based in Luxembourg, and Bouygues, the diversified industrial group headed by Martin Bouygues that controls Bouygues Telecom, are in advanced talks regarding a merger, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.The potential takeover was first reported by the Journal du Dimanche, a weekly newspaper in France.Any potential deal could face opposition in France. Emmanuel Macron, France’s economy minister, told reporters on Sunday that the time was not right for consolidation in the country’s telecom sector and that the industry should focus on investment.The deal would be the latest coup for Mr. Drahi, who since 2002 has built Altice into a global operation with cable and cellphone assets in Europe and the Caribbean.Altice is one of the largest telecom operators in France, with about 6.5 million fixed-line customers and 22.5 million mobile customers through its Numericable-SFR business.In May, Altice agreed to buy a 70 percent stake in Suddenlink Communications of St. Louis, Mo., for $9.1 billion, giving it a foothold in the United States.That deal was seen as a prelude to Mr. Drahi’s potentially making a play for Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable provider in the United States, after a $45 billion merger with Comcast collapsed because of regulatory concerns.Altice approached Time Warner Cable, but the talks never advanced beyond a preliminary stage.Time Warner Cable agreed in late May to a $56.7 billion alliance with Charter Communications, a United States cable and broadband rival.For Bouygues, France’s third-largest mobile provider, a deal with Numericable-SFR would bring the scale it needs to compete against larger players, namely Orange and SFR.A merger would also signal the latest round of consolidation by Europe’s cable and telecommunications providers as they increasingly look to provide bundled broadband and phone services to attract customers.Bouygues has faced a bruising price war in the mobile market as Iliad, an upstart rival founded by the French entrepreneur Xavier Niel, has siphoned away customers by offering low-cost deals and improved customer service.To appease regulators, a combined Numericable-Bouygues Telecom could shed assets such as wireless spectrum. Iliad, France’s fourth-largest mobile provider through its Free brand, would be a likely buyer for that spectrum and other Numericable-Bouygues assets, according to a person familiar with the discussions. Iliad made an unsuccessful bid for T-Mobile US last year.Bouygues had hoped to leapfrog Orange and bolster its business last year by acquiring SFR, but it ultimately lost out to Altice.Highlighting its need to gain scale, Bouygues made a series of escalating counteroffers for SFR and publicly trumpeted its competing bid last year, despite an agreement by Altice and Vivendi to talk exclusively.During the SFR fight last year, French officials came out publicly in favor of a deal with Bouygues, but they did not interfere in the deal with Altice.Advertisement
