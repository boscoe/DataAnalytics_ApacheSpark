Wall Street bonuses just aren’t what they used to be.As the industry’s profits declined, the average bonus for Wall Street employees grew just 2 percent in 2014, to $172,860, according to a report on Wednesday by Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller. Although still large by many standards, these bonuses grew far more slowly than in the previous two years.The sluggish growth reflects the challenges still facing Wall Street, including choppy markets and new regulations that have reined in profit to some extent. The industry added 2,300 jobs in the city in 2014, after two years of job losses, but the number of jobs in the sector is still much smaller than before the 2008 financial crisis.The comptroller’s office uses tax withholding data to track Wall Street pay, which it says is a crucial contributor to the state’s economy. A range of businesses, including restaurants and luxury real estate, pin their fortunes on Wall Street bonuses. Mr. DiNapoli estimates that each new job on Wall Street leads to the creation of two other jobs in other industries in the city.This economic engine, however, has not exactly been humming. The number of jobs on Wall Street last year, 167,800, remains below the level of 188,300 in 2007, according to the latest report. While much of the city has bounced back from the recession, Wall Street — traditionally a major driver of economic recoveries — has not led the way.AdvertisementMr. DiNapoli struck an optimistic note on Wednesday, pointing to the 1.4 percent gain in jobs in 2014, though he tempered his remarks with caution.Advertisement“Maybe we’re seeing a delayed resurgence on the Street that will contribute to the economic recovery,” he said. But he added that it “remains to be seen whether this trend can and will be sustained in the coming year.”

Bonuses are a closely watched barometer of Wall Street’s health, often rising in good times and falling when revenue is tight. In 2013, the average bonus rose 19 percent, to $169,850, from the previous year, according to a revised estimate by the comptroller on Wednesday.Still, the year-to-year fluctuations of bonuses are also influenced by somewhat arcane factors, like the widely used policy of deferring a portion of compensation. The 2013 figures included an unspecified amount of pay that had been awarded in earlier years, making bonuses appear larger.Similarly, the numbers for 2014 do not include compensation that was awarded for that year but not yet paid out.

The total profits for the industry — defined as the broker-dealer operations of firms that are members of the New York Stock Exchange — totaled $16 billion in 2014, a 4.5 percent decline from 2013.That’s a far cry from 2009, when the industry’s profit, not adjusted for inflation, was more than $60 billion, according to the comptroller’s office.Wall Street’s overall bonus pool for 2014 grew slightly faster than individual bonuses measured on average. Mr. DiNapoli’s office found that the 2014 bonus pool rose 3 percent, to $28.5 billion, from the previous year. (The discrepancy between the two metrics was a result of the fact that a larger number of employees shared in the 2014 bonus pool than in the 2013 one.)Despite Wall Street’s importance to the state and city economies, the average New Yorker probably won’t be shedding any tears over the slow growth in bonuses.Mr. DiNapoli said that in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available, the total compensation for an average Wall Street employee was about five times as high as that for workers in the rest of the city’s private sector.A version of this article appears in print on March 12, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Wall St. Bonuses Rose Just 2% in ’14.
