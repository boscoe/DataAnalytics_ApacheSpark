Jurors found that the Pinnacle hips were defectively designed and that the companies had failed to warn the public. A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson said the company would appeal. It was the second federal trial involving the Pinnacle device. Johnson & Johnson was cleared of liability in the first trial, which ended in 2014. More than 8,000 Pinnacle lawsuits have been consolidated in Texas federal court.Advertisement
