AdvertisementSupported byBy Alexandra AlterThe Perseus Books Group, a large independent publisher, is up for sale again.The company announced on Wednesday that it had hired the investment banking firm Greenhill & Company to advise it on a possible sale, after receiving multiple inquiries from potential buyers.The announcement, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, follows by about a year the collapse of Perseus’s planned sale to a larger publishing company, the Hachette Book Group. That ill-fated deal included a complex three-party agreement among Perseus, Hachette and the Ingram Content Group, which would have bought Perseus’s printing and distribution business.Perseus, which was founded in 1996, could make an attractive acquisition because of its broad backlist of around 6,000 titles, which include best sellers and notable works like “A Problem From Hell” by Samantha Power. The company also generates steady revenue from its distribution contracts with more than 600 independent publishers.Perseus’s publishing operation, which includes imprints like Da Capo Press and Basic Books, produces around $90 million to $100 million in revenue annually, according to a person with knowledge of the company’s finances. The distribution service yields around $300 million in sales. Perseus takes a percentage of sales that accounts for around $40 million annually, the person said.While many major publishers, like movie studios, depend on breakout hits for profits, Perseus has relied instead on its distribution deals, and on steady and largely predictable sales for its popular backlist books and travel guides. According to a statement released by the company, sales have been rising at Perseus, and the last three years have been the most successful in the company’s history.“What’s intriguing people about this business is consistent growth and this significant recurring revenue that makes the business perform differently than the typical hit-driven media company,” said David Steinberger, the chief executive of Perseus Books.Advertisement
