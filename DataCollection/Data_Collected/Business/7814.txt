American, the world’s biggest airline, on Friday reported its most profitable quarter, after excluding one-time costs and gains. The results capped an astonishing earnings season for the nation’s biggest airlines, several of which reported record profits in the April-through-June quarter. Still, American warned that an important revenue figure, revenue for each seat flown one mile, would decline between 6 and 8 percent in the third quarter, and the stock fell about 7 percent. American’s fuel bill fell by more than $1 billion, or 37 percent, compared with the quarter last year. American reported adjusted profit of $2.62 a share, topping the $2.58-a-share forecast in a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 5 percent to $10.83 billion, a sharper drop than Wall Street had expected. Analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast $10.93 billion. Advertisement
