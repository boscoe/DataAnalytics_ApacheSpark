Flush with investments from hedge funds and other institutions, the marketplace lenders say they are providing valuable credit to important, underserved segments of the economy, often with less trouble and at a lower cost.The Treasury Department said in a statement on Thursday that it was seeking “to study the potential for online marketplace lending to expand access to credit and how the financial regulatory framework should evolve to support the safe growth of the industry.”For now, the Treasury’s effort appears more of a fact-finding exercise, rather than a deliberate attempt to establish new regulations. The department is inviting public comment on the sector and plans to hold a round-table discussion this summer with input from the $12 billion industry, borrowers and consumer advocates.Marketplace lending began as a peer-to-peer model, where individuals could lend money through website to other individuals or small business. Today, much of the investments come from large investors that are funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to the marketplace lenders.Some of the more established companies, like Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace, have been vastly increasing their volume in recent years, while facing an ever-expanding field of upstart competitors. Even Goldman Sachs is starting an online consumer lending operation that mimics some of the marketplace approach.Without the overhead costs of large banks, the online lenders say they can charge lower interest rates and swiftly make a decision on whether to extend credit. Most marketplace lenders only facilitate the loans, which are held by investors.“While still a small component of the total consumer and small business lending market, it is a rapidly developing and fast-growing sector that is changing the way consumers and small businesses secure credit,” Antonio Weiss, a senior Treasury official, wrote in a blog post on the agency’s website.Still, despite the largely supportive tone of the Treasury’s statements, the department is also raising some pointed questions about the loosely regulated industry.In its request for information released Thursday, the Treasury said its questions included how borrowers are assessed for creditworthiness and whether lenders should be required to have “skin in the game,” meaning they retain some of the risk in case of default.Advertisement
