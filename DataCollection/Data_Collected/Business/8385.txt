An index of builder sentiment rose this month to 61, its highest level since November 2005, the National Association of Home Builders said on Monday. The reading was 60 in both June and July.

The fact that builder confidence “has been in the low 60s for three straight months shows that single-family housing is making slow, but steady progress,” said Tom Woods, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, and a home builder based in Blue Springs, Mo. Builders’ view of current sales conditions and buyer traffic improved in August, while sales prospects over the next six months were stable.
