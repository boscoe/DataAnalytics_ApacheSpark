Analysts had expected $11.58 billion.Earnings on a reported basis dropped to $1.4 billion, or 33 cents a share, a 31 percent decline compared with the same period last year, when earnings were $2.1 billion, or 48 cents a share.After adjustments to account for charges related to divestment and consolidation of some of Coke’s bottling and distribution operations and for a restructuring program, Coca-Cola earned 51 cents a share, or about 1 cent more than analysts had estimated.“Our third-quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect the continued execution of our strategic initiatives to restore momentum, which are beginning to take hold across our global business,” said Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola.As it has for other American companies that generate a large portion of sales and earnings abroad, the strong dollar dented Coke’s performance. “Organic” revenue, which eliminates the impact of currency swings, grew 3 percent, for example.The company said it continued to benefit from raising prices slightly and reducing package sizes, essentially charging customers more for less.Volume sales, which measure the amount of its product being sold, grew, although such sales of Coke’s “still,” or uncarbonated beverages, grew about three times more than sales of “sparkling” beverages.Sales of Coca-Cola, the company’s signature brand, grew 1 percent. Sales of Coke Zero, the company’s diet soda aimed at young men, grew 8 percent.But sales of Diet Coke, another diet version of its iconic soft drink that has virtually the same ingredients as Coke Zero but a different flavor profile, fell 8 percent.Advertisement
