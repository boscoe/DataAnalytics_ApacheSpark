It comes at a time when so-called interdealer brokers have been hurt by lower trading volumes as they face uncertainty in the global markets and higher regulatory costs.The deal would include ICAP’s global brokering business; associated technology and brokerage platforms, including its electronic interest-rate swap platform iSwap; ICAP’s associated information services revenue; and some of ICAP’s joint ventures.Under the agreement, Tullett Prebon would issue about 309.9 million new shares in the combined company to ICAP and its shareholders. Once the deal is complete, ICAP and its shareholders would own about 56 percent of Tullett Prebon, with the remainder held by Tullett Prebon’s existing investors.As part of the deal, Tullett Prebon would take on about 330 million pounds, or about $500 million, in gross debt.“Interdealer brokers continue to play a vital role at the heart of the global wholesale O.T.C. markets,” John Phizackerley, the Tullett Prebon chief executive, referring to over the counter transactions, said in a news release. “This important acquisition will deliver to Tullett Prebon shareholders significant cost synergies and gives the combined business greater client and product coverage and a stronger global footprint.”The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to be completed next year.Tullett Prebon said it expected to achieve cost savings of at least £60 million from the deal, primarily by eliminating duplicated management and support costs. The combined business would employ about 5,500 people.The companies first announced they were in discussions this month.ICAP’s global brokering business acts as an intermediary for businesses and individuals looking to trade a variety of asset classes, including bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates and stocks.The global brokering business focuses on so-called voice brokering, in which orders are negotiated on the phone, rather than through electronic orders, as well as a hybrid of voice brokering and electronic trading. It had 1,458 voice brokers as of the end of March.The business operates in 35 locations in 22 countries, including one in Jersey City.It is by far ICAP’s largest revenue generator, but it has experienced declining revenue in recent years and has been less profitable than the company’s remaining businesses, which include electronic trading and post-trade services.Michael Spencer, the ICAP chief executive, called the transaction a “historic moment for both companies.”“By coming together, they will benefit from improved scale, allowing for a significantly improved product suite and service for customers,” Mr. Spencer said in a news release. “Financial regulatory reform means that the global financial markets have profoundly changed, and this transaction means both companies will be better suited to meet the market’s changing needs and better serve our customers.”After the deal’s completion, Ken Pigaga, ICAP’s chief operating officer, would leave ICAP to join Tullett Prebon’s board and become its chief operating officer.Mr. Spencer would hold the honorary title of president of Tullett Prebon and would be available to advise its board, but would not become a director.Separately, ICAP on Wednesday reported a pretax profit of £83 million in the first six months of its fiscal year on revenue of £595 million.Advertisement
