AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersBEIJING — Activity at China’s factories shrank at the fastest rate in at least three years in August, as domestic and export orders tumbled, increasing investors’ fears that the economy may be lurching toward a hard landing.Even more worrying, China’s service sector, which has been one of the bright spots in the sputtering economy, also showed signs of cooling, a similar business survey said.Hurt by soft demand, overcapacity and falling investment, the economy has also been buffeted by plunging shares and a shock devaluation in China’s currency, the renminbi, in a confluence of factors that is rattling global markets and could strain relations with China’s major trading partners.The purchasing managers’ index for manufacturers released on Tuesday by China’s National Bureau of Statistics fell to 49.7 in August from 50 in July. That was the lowest level since August 2012, although expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. Readings above 50 points indicate growth; reading below indicate contraction.New orders — a measure of domestic and foreign demand — fell to 49.7 in August from 49.9 in July. New export orders contracted for an 11th straight month.A nongovernment survey conducted by the research firm Markit and released by Caixin, a Chinese news media company, pointed to an even sharper cooldown, with the purchasing managers’ index dropping to 47.3, the worst reading since March 2009. The Caixin survey focuses on smaller companies than the government survey.Both surveys showed that manufacturers were laying off workers at a faster rate as their orders declined.The closing of factories in northern China to clear Beijing’s skies for a huge military parade this week probably also hurt output, as did giant explosions in the port city of Tianjin.Analysts said the bleak readings affirmed bets that China, which has lowered interest rates five times since November, will loosen monetary policy again soon to avert a sharper economic downturn that could weigh on global growth, even as the Federal Reserve in the United States moves toward increasing interest rates.News of deteriorating business conditions set off fresh selling in mainland Chinese shares, dragging down stocks across Asia as well as American stock futures. “Capital market turmoil has made Chinese businesses and consumers turn more cautious,” Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, said in reference to a plunge of nearly 40 percent in Chinese shares since mid-June.He estimated that the Chinese economy would grow at an annual pace of about 6.5 percent in the second half of 2015, easing to 6.2 percent in 2016.Some analysts believe growth levels are already well below that, contrasting with Beijing’s official goal of 7 percent.The Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, said on Tuesday that it would be beneficial for this week’s meeting of representatives of the Group of 20 major economies to discuss what was going on in China’s economy.Service companies in China are showing clear signs of fatigue, to the point where growth in that sector may no longer be enough to offset persistent weakness at factories. The government’s survey of purchasing managers at service companies showed a slight cooling to 53.4, although that remained well in expansion territory. The corresponding Caixin survey fell sharply to 51.5, its lowest level since July 2014. Caixin’s composite purchasing managers’ index, combining factory and services readings, went below 50 for the first time since April 2014.In another sign that economic weakness was spreading to the service sector, the Caixin index showed that the labor market had deteriorated for the 22nd straight month in August.“We believe further aggressive monetary easing and proactive fiscal policy, along with financial liberalization, are needed to maintain growth at around 7 percent,” economists at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said.He Fan, the chief economist at the Caixin Insight Group, said, “Recent volatility in global financial markets could weigh on the real economy, and a pessimistic outlook may become self-fulfilling.”Advertisement
