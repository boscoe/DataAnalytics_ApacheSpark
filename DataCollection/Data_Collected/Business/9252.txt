All 18 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee urged the panel’s chairman to subpoena Valeant and force it to provide documents relating to price increases of 212 percent for Isuprel and 525 percent for Nitropress. Valeant shares tumbled 16.5 percent. Investors have worried that the industry faces a moment of reckoning for steep price increases for new and older drugs. The Democrats also urged the panel’s chairman, Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, to invite Valeant’s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, to testify at a hearing next week. Advertisement
