WASHINGTON —  Consumer spending in the United States surged in May with the biggest monthly increase in nearly six years — a sign of stronger economic growth ahead.The Commerce Department said on Thursday that consumer spending rose 0.9 percent last month, up from a revised 0.1 percent increase in April. May spending registered the biggest gain since August 2009, an indication that the positive impacts from the solid pace of hiring and cheaper gasoline are starting to ripple through the economy.“We are finally seeing signs of consumers’ beginning to spend the gasoline savings they have been sitting on since the start of this year,” said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.

The savings rate for after-tax income fell slightly to 5.1 percent from 5.4 percent.AdvertisementUntil recently, lower gas prices and an improved job market were not enough to unlock greater consumer spending. Instead, Americans ramped up their savings. This helped put their personal finances on a more sustainable path, but it limited the ability of the overall economy, which relies mostly on consumer activity, to grow at a faster pace and potentially bolster their incomes.AdvertisementThe consumer spending report confirms signs elsewhere that people are loosening the grip on their wallets.Also Thursday, the Labor Department said that the number of people seeking unemployment aid rose slightly last week, but remained at a historically low level that signals an improving job market.

The data also show that employers refrained from layoffs even as the economy contracted in the first three months of the year, a sign they saw the slowdown as temporary.Nearly 2.25 million people received benefits, up 22,000 from the previous week. Still, the total number of beneficiaries has fallen 13 percent in the last year.Only about a quarter of the unemployed receive unemployment aid. Some have exhausted all the aid available, which is capped at 26 weeks in most states. Others, like college graduates looking for work, do not qualify for benefits.A version of this article appears in print on June 26, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Consumer Spending Surges in Sign of Brighter Outlook.
