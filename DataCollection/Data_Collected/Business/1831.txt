The United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation decided on Tuesday to send the cases to District Judge Charles R. Breyer in San Francisco, where the first VW case in the nation was filed.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.Over 500 civil suits have been filed against the company, nearly a fifth in California, the panel said. It noted that relevant documents and witnesses might be found in California, given the role played by the state’s Air Resources Board in uncovering Volkswagen’s actions. The automaker has already admitted using the deceptive software. Many plaintiffs’ lawyers are accusing the company of defrauding customers, who say the value of their cars has dropped.Advertisement
