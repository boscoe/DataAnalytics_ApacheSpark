AdvertisementSupported byBy Nick WingfieldPayPal, the online payments company weeks away from an expected spinoff from eBay, took a leap into the growing digital money transfer business on Wednesday by acquiring Xoom, a big player in the field.PayPal will spend $25 a share in cash to acquire the publicly traded Xoom, or about $1.09 billion. Excluding Xoom’s cash and short-term investments and including its debt, PayPal will end up paying about $890 million for the company.Xoom is part of a wave of upstarts challenging traditional money transfer businesses like Western Union in the enormous global remittances market, which is valued at about $600 billion this year by the World Bank. Frequently used by immigrants to wire money to family in their home countries, traditional global remittance services are often cash-based and rely on money agents in retail locations to complete transfers abroad.Like other Internet remittance services, Xoom makes transferring money more convenient by letting people send it overseas electronically from PCs or mobile phones. The company, which handled about $7 billion in payments during its last fiscal year, currently allows people in only one country, the United States, to send money to recipients in more than 37 countries.“International remittances is an industry that is ripe for disruption,” said Dan Schulman, the president of PayPal. Mr. Schulman is set to become chief executive of the company when PayPal’s spinoff from eBay, the giant online retailer, is completed. That move is expected this month.In a phone interview, John Kunze, the chief executive of Xoom, said PayPal’s global presence was a big motivating factor behind the deal. PayPal’s know-how and relationship with banks and regulators in various countries, he said, will allow Xoom to expand.“You can imagine us getting a global footprint much faster and with much less execution risk,” Mr. Kunze said.The biggest destinations for funds sent through Xoom are India, the Philippines and Latin America. About 60 percent of its customers send payments from their mobile phones, Mr. Kunze said.PayPal is far and away the leader in online payments in the United States, and it is probably best known as the payment system used by many eBay buyers and sellers to complete transactions. As smaller payment processing start-ups like Stripe and Square have appeared in recent years, PayPal has been on the hunt for new areas in which it can continue growing its business.PayPal, which started in the 1990s, is splitting from eBay partly to push into new areas for growth. While eBay fueled the service’s initial growth, analysts have said eBay’s continued ownership has prevented other big online merchants from relying heavily on PayPal.Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement
