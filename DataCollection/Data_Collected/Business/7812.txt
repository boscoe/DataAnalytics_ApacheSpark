The regulator sent letters on Friday asking each airline to detail average fares along the route before, during and after the crash. It demanded an explanation for any price increases and asked the airlines whether they communicated with one another about those fares, which might signal collusion. The review involves Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Continental, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, all of which said they were cooperating with the investigation. United States airlines are already the subject of a Justice Department investigation into whether they worked together illegally to keep fares high by signaling plans to limit flights. Advertisement
