With close to $3 trillion in assets worldwide, they control more assets than hedge funds.And since their strategies are linked to a set of rules, like an index or a model of some sort, E.T.F.s have been attracting large sums of money from lagging mutual funds that rely on a portfolio manager to outsmart the broader market.Exchange-traded funds account for as much as a third of all publicly traded stocks.Or think of it this way: An E.T.F. that tracks a basket of hard-to-trade emerging-market stocks or high-yield bonds will, on any day, attract more buy and sell orders than a bellwether like Microsoft or General Electric.Among bright ideas on Wall Street, this notion of promising investors instant liquidity in some of the most opaque corners of the global marketplace ranks with earlier innovations like securitization in consequence if not risk.That practice of packaging mortgages, then selling them to investors, became a main source of profits for a new generation of investment banks in the 1980s and 1990s.Similarly, E.T.F.s have become cash cows for the firms that originate them, like BlackRock and Vanguard, and those that trade them, like Jane Street in New York and Susquehanna International Group, a private firm near Philadelphia.Advertisement
