Global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in May, making a full year of monthly declines. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a decline of 0.9 percent. European sales were up a better-than-expected 2.3 percent. Britain had strong results from its “Great Taste of America” campaign, Sara Senatore, a Bernstein analyst, said in a client note. In the United States, same-restaurant sales disappointed, dropping 2.2 percent in May, as rivals like Chick-fil-A and Chipotle continued to pick off customers. Analysts had expected a decline of 1.7 percent. McDonalds is running a variety of tests aimed at luring back customers, including extended breakfast hours, custom burgers and new food such as breakfast bowls made with kale and spinach. The company recently said the fast-food giant would join other companies that only report quarterly same-store sales. June will be the final monthly sales report for the chain. Advertisement
