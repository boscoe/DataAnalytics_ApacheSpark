Two years ago, the firm closed its fifth fund at $1 billion, a far cry from the $50 million that it raised for its initial fund.The new fund is the latest huge investment vehicle raised in recent months. In December, Institutional Venture Partners announced that it had raised $1.4 billion for its latest fund. And this week, Accel said that it had raised two new funds with about $2 billion  in investor commitments.Founders Fund tends to make high-profile bets across industries, investing in companies like Facebook, Airbnb and Spotify. Among its most notable recent investments are SpaceX, the rocket company led by Elon Musk, and Palantir, the data analysis firm that Mr. Thiel co-founded.Palantir, which private-market investors have valued at $20 billion, has taken a hit to its lofty valuation in recent months as mutual funds that own shares in the company have cut their estimations of the stock price.News of Founders Fund’s fund-raising efforts was reported earlier by The New York Post.Advertisement
