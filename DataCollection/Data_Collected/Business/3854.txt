The data issued on Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that United States banks earned $36.9 billion in the October-December period, down from $39.8 billion a year ago. Over all, growth in lending helped increase revenue at most banks. Sixty-one percent of banks reported an increase in profit in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, and only 9.4 percent of banks were unprofitable. But the gains were outweighed by the big banks’ costs for settling cases related to sales of risky mortgage securities before the crisis and the mortgage income declines, the agency said. Three of the biggest United States banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup — together posted $4.4 billion in legal costs during the quarter. Advertisement
