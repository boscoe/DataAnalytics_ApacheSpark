Mr. Hockey said on Friday that the home had been sold and that more than 100 property purchases were under investigation.Australian property has long been a popular choice for Chinese buyers but the flow of money has accelerated. China overtook the United States to become the largest source of foreign investment in Australia last year, riding a surge in real estate purchases.Foreign buyers will continue to be allowed to purchase new homes in a bid to increase the housing stock but will have to pay an application fee of 5,000 dollars for properties worth up to 1 million dollars, with higher fees for more expensive properties and agricultural and commercial real estate, the government said.Foreign buyers who breach the new laws will face up to three years in jail or fines of 127,500 dollars for individuals and 637,500 dollars for companies, and third parties who knowingly assist foreign investors to breach the rules will also face civil and criminal penalties.The Property Council of Australia said it welcomed the “long overdue” clampdown on illegal foreign buying.“However, the government is undermining its own aim of making homes more affordable by simultaneously penalizing legitimate foreign investment in new housing.”There will also be increased scrutiny of foreign investment in agriculture, amid concerns about a growing number of sales of farms and food processing businesses to foreign interests.The threshold of 55 million dollars for the Foreign Investment Review Board to scrutinize agricultural purchases will be extended beyond farming to a wider range of agribusinesses such as seafood, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetable processors under the new proposals.
