Highlighting the true worth of the company, Jana argued, required potentially drastic steps.“Over the past several months we have been engaged in a constructive dialogue regarding the steps it can take to restore investor confidence and unlock shareholder value,” Barry Rosenstein, the head of Jana, wrote in the letter.Jana, one of the most prominent activist investors, disclosed that it had bought more than $2 billion worth of stock, making it one of the company’s larger shareholders.Perhaps the most prominent recommendation is splitting off Qualcomm’s chipset business, which makes chips for cellphones. Mr. Rosenstein contended in the letter that investors and analysts essentially valued the unit at zero.The company could fix that perception by either making a better argument for closer integration of the chipset and patent-licensing businesses or parting with the chipset division. It’s a move that the company itself had proposed more than a decade ago.Other steps that Mr. Rosenstein suggested include speeding up an already planned $15 billion stock buyback; cutting costs; shrinking the company’s 15-member board and replacing some of its directors; and pursuing potential mergers and acquisitions.In response, Qualcomm issued a statement that said: “Our board of directors and management periodically review our corporate structure. Prior reviews have concluded that the synergies provided by our business model create more value for stockholders than could be created through alternative corporate structures. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance stockholder value and are committed to pursuing the right course of action for all of our stockholders.”Shares in Qualcomm initially rose more than 3 percent on Monday, though by midday they had reversed course and were down slightly.Advertisement
