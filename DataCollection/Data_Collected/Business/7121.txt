But for parents who navigate the city’s traffic snarls multiple times a day, commuting to and from work and ferrying their children to school and various activities, the talk can take on a desperate tone.Such was the case for Joanna McFarland, Carolyn Yashari Becher and Janelle McGlothlin, three working mothers with a total of eight children, who attend seven schools and are involved in karate, soccer, tennis, horseback riding, baseball, music, dance, gymnastics and skateboarding. “You’re stressed,” Ms. McGlothlin said of her driving schedule. “You’re in traffic. You’re snapping at them because you’re worried.”Their solution was to start a ride service called HopSkipDrive. It’s one of two such California companies catering to busy families. The other one, Shuddle, serves the San Francisco Bay Area. HopSkipDrive’s passengers are children ages 7 to 17 whose parents request and pay for rides at least 24 hours in advance using a smartphone app or the company’s website. A ride costs $20; a package of 50 is $600. Trips longer than five miles or 30 minutes cost extra. Nearly 2,000 people have signed up for the service so far, according to the company. The service is especially useful for families without full-time nannies, stay-at-home parents caring for more than one child, and divorced parents, said Ms. McFarland, a former general manager for the consumer website Oversee.net. Gathered on a recent afternoon in a conference room in the Los Angeles co-working space that houses their business, the women chatted like old friends — and two of them are. Ms. McFarland and Ms. McGlothlin met seven years ago through their children. At a party in late 2013, they were complaining about their transportation challenges with a group of other mothers. “I jokingly said, ‘We need to buy a van and hire the moms and the babysitters in the neighborhood to drive our kids around,’ ” Ms. McFarland said. The idea stuck. The two joined forces with Ms. Becher, a former real estate lawyer who at the time was founder and executive director of the Neuromuscular Disease Foundation and had separately started working on a similar concept several years earlier. When she met Ms. McFarland and Ms. McGlothlin, they decided to start HopSkipDrive together, tapping their friends and families, in addition to angel investors and venture capitalists, for financing. They declined to say how much they raised. Instead of buying a van, they hired drivers who had their own cars, following the model used by the ride-hailing businesses Lyft and Uber. The service also requires drivers to have at least five years of child care experience, and it conducts rigorous background checks, including fingerprinting prospective drivers and vetting them for driving under the influence of alcohol and being convicted sex offenders. And it performs monthly checks to ensure that all drivers maintain clean driving records.Many of the company’s 100 drivers are mothers themselves, and they are permitted to bring their own children along on rides. Teachers, former nannies whose charges have grown up, nurses and real estate agents fill out the ranks. As independent contractors, drivers are paid a part of the cost of each ride (they do not receive tips). The company also has 12 full-time employees, most of whom work at its headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. HopSkipDrive’s founders say that being female entrepreneurs and mothers gives them an advantage. “It’s really about understanding the needs of our drivers, our riders, our parents, our employees,” said Ms. McGlothlin, who owns the branding and copywriting company WriteBrand in addition to working as chief marketing officer for HopSkipDrive.All of the founders’ children who are 7 or older use the service. As the women set about building the business, they focused on their own concerns as parent-customers. Safety, of course, was paramount. HopSkipDrive drivers must attend training sessions that include how to handle sick passengers and how to ensure that children are safe once they arrive at their destination. “When they show up to baseball and the coach isn’t there, they’re going to wait,” Ms. McFarland said of the drivers. “They’re not going to just leave.”She and her co-founders say their service is safer than sending a child off with a friend’s nanny — or even another parent. “How well do you know your kid’s friend at school when you set up a car pool?” Ms. McGlothlin asked. HopSkipDrive sends parents a series of alerts when the driver is en route to pick up the child, once the child is in the car and after they arrive at the destination. Parents can also monitor the car’s progress, route and speed on their smartphones during the drive; a team of HopSkipDrive employees monitors all rides as well. “I get an alert when they’ve been dropped off that summarizes the average speed of the driver, the maximum speed of the driver and how long it took them to get there,” said Rachel Capata, a HopSkipDrive customer whose two daughters use the service four days a week to get to volleyball practice. “I feel like I know where my kids are the whole time.”Such precautions are wise, according to Arun Sundararajan, a professor in the Stern School of Business at New York University. “It’s absolutely critical that they don’t sacrifice safety over speed of growth,” he said, adding that a major car accident involving a HopSkipDrive vehicle, or an untrustworthy driver in the company’s ranks, could be catastrophic for the business. Creating a plan for such an event, the way some companies set up product-recall plans, would be wise, he said.Barring that, Mr. Sundararajan says he sees “huge potential” for the service to expand to densely populated cities like New York, where many residents have high disposable incomes, do not own cars and routinely travel short distances. But he predicts that in a decade or two, services like HopSkipDrive and Shuddle could become obsolete because of driverless or even flying cars, which are in the development stage. As Mr. Sundararajan put it, “The Jetsons are coming to life.”Advertisement
