LONDON — Shares of the London Stock Exchange fell sharply on Wednesday after the operator of the New York Stock Exchange said that it had decided against making a counterbid for the London exchange.The Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Exchange, had been seen as a potential rival to a planned merger between the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse, which confirmed that they were in discussions in February and agreed to merge in an all-stock deal in March.Jeffrey Sprecher, the chief executive of Intercontinental Exchange, known as ICE, told analysts in a conference call on Wednesday that the company had spent the last two months evaluating the data for a potential merger with the London exchange.“We thought that the combination may have a compelling rationale,” Mr. Sprecher said, as it would bring “together the premier trans-Atlantic capital-raising venues.”AdvertisementBut, he added, “The disappointing level of engagement of the L.S.E. ultimately did not allow us to make a complete determination of the integration benefits, and their related risks that ICE would require to support a bid.”AdvertisementWith hopes for a bidding war dampened, shares of the London Stock Exchange tumbled as much as 9.9 percent before closing down 4.2 percent. In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Börse rose 5.8 percent.Analysts have speculated that the CME Group — which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange — and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing could also ultimately emerge as suitors to break up a marriage aimed at creating a European champion in a rapidly consolidating industry.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
