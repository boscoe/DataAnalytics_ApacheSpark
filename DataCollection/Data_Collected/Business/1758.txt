FRANKFURT — An executive linked to Volkswagen’s emissions scandal has resigned his post as a top manager of the Audi luxury car division, the company said late Thursday.The executive, Ulrich Hackenberg, 65, a member of the Audi management board responsible for technical development, was one of eight executives suspended after Volkswagen admitted in September to programming cars to evade clean air rules. But he is the first of those eight to resign.Besides his post at Audi, Mr. Hackenberg also had responsibilities for the Volkswagen group as a whole, and he was one of the company’s most prominent executives in developing the technology that went into Volkswagen vehicles.Mr. Hackenberg’s resignation came after a demand by Audi’s top labor representative to eliminate any ambiguity about who was in charge. Labor units have an unusual degree of power at Volkswagen.AdvertisementAlthough Mr. Hackenberg was on leave during the suspension, he had retained his title, and his photo continued to appear along with other members of the Audi board on the company website. There was no sign that his departure had been prompted by new information about what role, if any, he had in the emissions deception.Mr. Hackenberg agreed to step down, Audi said in a statement, which did not mention the emissions scandal but praised his contributions to the company during a 30-year career there.AdvertisementA lawyer who represents Mr. Hackenberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Hackenberg is only the second executive to resign in connection with the scandal, as far as is known publicly. As regulators and prosecutors in Germany and the United States conduct investigations, Volkswagen has pursued an internal inquiry, but so far it has not disclosed any findings.Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned days after the company admitted to cheating on emissions tests, which he said he had not been aware of until the deception was disclosed in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency.It was not immediately clear whether other top managers who have been suspended would follow Mr. Hackenberg in leaving the company. Two other executives who have been placed on leave still appear on company websites as occupying their positions. They are Wolfgang Hatz, head of research and development at Porsche, and Heinz-Jakob Neusser, head of development for the Volkswagen brand.Mr. Hackenberg, Mr. Hatz and Mr. Neusser all played central roles in Volkswagen engine development in recent years.Several other top Volkswagen managers have left the company since September, including Christian Klingler, the head of sales and marketing, and Walter Maria de Silva, the head of design. But their departures did not appear to be directly related to the emissions scandal.This week, Volkswagen said that 50 employees had stepped forward to accept an amnesty offer to tell, without risk of punishment by the company, what they know about who might have been involved the deception. Volkswagen said it had begun interviewing those employees.AdvertisementMr. Hackenberg will be replaced at Audi by Stefan Knirsch, 49, who has been Audi’s head of powertrain operations. Powertrain refers to the engines, transmissions and other components that propel vehicles.From 2007 to 2013, Mr. Hackenberg was responsible for technical development of cars under the Volkswagen brand. That is also the period during which Volkswagen was developing and marketing the diesel engines that contained illegal software.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At other times, the vehicles produced many times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxide, a harmful gas. Audi vehicles with 2- and 3-liter diesel engines are among those with software considered illegal in the United States.Peter Mosch, chairman of the Audi workers council and a member of the Audi supervisory board, said late Thursday that it was “correct” for Mr. Hackenberg to leave the company, and that it was important to eliminate any uncertainty about who was in charge.“In light of the current situation, we see his decision to resign as an important step forward,” Mr. Mosch said in a statement.
            VW’s emissions cheating is said to have begun in 2005.        Mr. Mosch also called for Volkswagen to get to the bottom of who was responsible for the misconduct, which has put the company under financial pressure and could lead to job cuts.There are signs that Volkswagen’s business is beginning to suffer. Sales of Volkswagen-brand cars in Britain fell 20 percent in November from a year earlier, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Friday. General Motors’ Vauxhall brand and Ford Motor appeared to benefit most. Vauxhall sales rose 26 percent in the month, and Ford’s were up 13 percent.“Further consequences must now be undertaken, so that something like this doesn’t happen again,” Mr. Mosch said.Mr. Hackenberg was credited with developing Volkswagen’s so-called modular tool kit, a collection of crucial components including motors that can be shared among different brands in the Volkswagen empire. Besides Volkswagen and Audi brand cars, the company also owns Porsche, Seat and Skoda.AdvertisementMr. Hackenberg’s resignation suggests that Audi may be moving more aggressively than the parent company to clarify its role in the emissions cheating scandal.Audi retains a degree of independence even though it is part of the Volkswagen group, and its cars share many parts with other vehicles the company makes. Audi has its headquarters and a factory in Ingolstadt, a city on the Danube between Nuremberg and Munich.Audi also has its own supervisory board, and there is a degree of rivalry between executives in Ingolstadt and those in Wolfsburg, where Volkswagen is based.A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Audi Executive Resigns After Suspension in VW Scandal.
