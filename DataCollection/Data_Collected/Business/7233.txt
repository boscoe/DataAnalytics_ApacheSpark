The auto industry, which at this time last year was embroiled in recall scandals that threatened to tarnish its image among consumers, just finished its best first half in recent memory.During the first six months of 2015, automakers sold more than 8.5 million vehicles in the United States, up 4.4 percent, according to Autodata Corporation. In June, sales were up 3.9 percent, as the seasonally adjusted average rate rose to 17.16 million, the highest such June number since 2005.Industry analysts predicted that the wave of buyers flocking to auto showrooms around the country would most likely continue, as the summer selling season gained momentum with low fuel prices, favorable economic indicators and improving consumer sentiment throughout the United States.“For the rest of the year, we expect to see continued strength,” said Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book.AdvertisementAll major automakers were happy with their June numbers, except for one. General Motors saw its sales fall by 3 percent in June compared with the previous year, even as its pickups did well.AdvertisementBut G.M. was an exception. Fiat Chrysler reported gains of 8 percent for the month, while Ford Motor posted gains of 2 percent. Overall sales rose 4 percent for Toyota, 13 percent for Nissan, 7 percent for Subaru and 4 percent for Honda.Even Volkswagen’s namesake brand, which has struggled mightily over the last year to win over American consumers, reported a 6 percent gain in June. (The company’s luxury arm, Audi, has been successful and continued to be in June, up 8 percent.)MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMJUNE 2014SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesJUNE2015 SALES702,621718,3731,420,994JUNE 2014676,627800,0481,476,675JUNE  2015%F-SeriesSilveradoCamry1500-3500CorollaAltimaCivicCR-VAccordElantraFusionRAV4EscapeRogueCruzeExplorerFORDCHEVROLETTOYOTARAMTOYOTANISSANHONDAHONDAHONDAHYUNDAIFORDTOYOTAFORDNISSANCHEVROLETFORD55,171 51,548 37,408 33,332 30,645 29,418 28,727 28,349 27,477 26,613 25,409 24,843 24,126 23,243 22,647 22,549–  8.9+18.4–  8.0+  0.6–  1.0+12.7–11.1+  8.5–15.0+55.0–  8.0+15.1–  3.9+54.3–12.9+30.4–3.7%+11.4%+3.9%CHANGE   17.16ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+55.0HyundaiElantraHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDJUNE 2015SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE259,353            224,681                   209,912              185,035                                                               134,397                                     124,228                                         67,502         54,137       49,003                                                          44,335   –  3.0+  1.5 +  4.1+  8.2+  4.2+13.3 +  0.1 +  6.9+  6.7+  7.2     %17.615.214.212.59.18.44.63.73.33.0%GENERAL MOTORSFORD MOTORTOYOTAFIAT CHRYSLERHONDANISSANHYUNDAIKIAVOLKSWAGENSUBARUBIGGESTLOSER–15.0%HondaAccordAt G.M., officials pointed to reductions in its rental sales as a culprit for its sagging June performance, but the company was also hurt by the growing trend toward smaller sport utility vehicles and away from passenger cars.G.M.’s cars were down over all by 17 percent in June, according to Autodata — with mainstays like the Chevrolet Cruze and Sonic falling by double digits. Buick-branded cars also plummeted compared with a year ago, with the Verano down 42 percent, the LaCrosse down 44 percent and the Regal down 13 percent. Cadillac sales were also down across the board.That mirrored lackluster performance by other automakers’ passenger cars in June: Ford, Toyota, Honda, BMW, Hyundai and Volvo all landed in negative territory. The biggest exception was Chrysler, whose cars sold 15 percent higher for the month.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That continued the trend that has been building all year.Jessica Caldwell, a senior analyst for Edmunds.com, said the move toward small sport utility vehicles is putting pressure on dealers to move their small passenger cars, which they have struggled to do. Subcompact cars are spending nearly 100 days on dealers’ lots, she said.During the first half of this year, sales of S.U.V.s and light trucks totaled nearly 4.6 million, a 10 percent increase from 2014, according to Autodata. Car sales, by contrast, fell by 2 percent, to 3.9 million.That could make G.M.’s Chevrolet brand in particular one to watch, said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst for Autotrader, because Chevy will introduce five new or redesigned sedans this year.Advertisement“They’ve got all these new cars coming into a market that doesn’t love cars,” Ms. Krebs said.A version of this article appears in print on July 2, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Strong 1st Half for Auto Sales, and Outlook Is Bright .
