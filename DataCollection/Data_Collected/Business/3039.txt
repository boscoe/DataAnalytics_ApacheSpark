WASHINGTON —  A gauge of United States business investment plans fell for a fourth straight month in December. It was a potential sign that slowing global growth and falling oil prices were weighing on the economy, but other data on Tuesday suggested any damage would be limited.Consumer confidence vaulted near a seven-and-a-half-year high in January, and new-home sales in December hit their highest level since June 2008.Referring to the gauge of investment plans, Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York, said the drop in capital spending would probably limit growth, “though stronger consumer spending should keep G.D.P. from slowing too much.”The Commerce Department said orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft — a closely watched proxy for business spending plans — dropped 0.6 percent last month after a similar decline in November. Orders for these so-called core capital goods started decreasing in September; there have not been four successive months of declines since 2012.AdvertisementEconomists, who had expected a 0.5 percent gain, said the surprise drop last month probably reflected weak overseas demand for a wide range of capital goods and declining demand at home for energy-related equipment. They also cited the strengthening dollar as a factor.

A number of United States producers have already curtailed drilling activity and announced job cuts during an oil glut that has pushed down crude prices by about 60 percent since June.AdvertisementDollar strength is also undermining corporate profits. Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest household products maker, said full-year sales would most likely fall 3 percent to 4 percent because of the stronger dollar. The chemical company DuPont also forecast lower operating earnings for 2015.Microsoft said on Monday that the dollar was a factor behind a decline in its quarterly earnings as well.Weak equipment spending is likely to catch the attention of Federal Reserve officials, who have been eyeing midyear for a possible interest rate increase. Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.“The dollar’s strength is starting to show up in terms of weaker orders, a new soft spot for manufacturing that perhaps will give some of the policy makers pause if not worry,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.6 percent in November and 0.9 percent in October.

The government will publish its first snapshot of fourth-quarter growth on Friday.AdvertisementWith core capital goods orders falling, overall orders for durable goods (items as varied as toasters and aircraft that are meant to last three years or more) tumbled 3.4 percent in December. It was the fifth straight monthly decline.Still, the economy appears to be in reasonable health. Services sector activity picked up in January for the first time since June, the financial data firm Markit said separately, and the Conference Board said consumer sentiment jumped this month to its highest level since August 2007.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Additionally, mortgage rates trended lower, fueling a jump in home loan applications this month.“January’s impressive surge in mortgage applications suggests we may see continued momentum in new-home sales,” said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at BNP Paribas in New York.Another report, however, showed a deceleration in house price gains. The Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.3 percent in November from the year before, the slowest since October 2012.Housing trailed growth in the overall economy last year, but it is expected to get a boost from a strengthening job market. Slowing house price gains, together with moves by the government to ease credit conditions, are also helping.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mixed Signals in Raft of Economic Data.
