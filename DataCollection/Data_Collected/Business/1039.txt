Even the law firms nimble enough to overcome the economic turbulence in recent years are not feeling invincible these days. The revenue looks good because costly litigation and specialized legal work are flourishing. But a generational divide is percolating just under the surface.Rising associates in the millennial generation, worried about the future, are pushing up against the current law firm leaders, who are almost uniformly older men intent on staying for a few more years to top off very successful careers.If any discipline is a window into the debate about balancing short-term profits over long-term survival, it is the legal profession, one of the most traditional businesses in the world. Forward-looking firms are revamping how they find new business and how to deliver the results more efficiently to their clients; some are experimenting with giving associates more leeway in building their own practices. But the largest portion of firms, by far, are holding firm to a time-honored business model in which associates climb a ladder to partnership over many years. It is a model, some who study the legal profession say, that could lead to a wave of firms splintering when current leaders retire.“Some law firms could crumble after this generation because they don’t have a lot to sell to the next generation,” said William Henderson, a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, who has spoken and written extensively on the challenges facing the profession.Advertisement“I don’t know of a single firm that has made the millennial shift,” he added, referring to handing over the reins to a younger generation. “Firms are worried about this, but most are tinkering in the margins.”
            Among managing partners at 100 law firms in the AmLaw 100, the annual American Lawyer survey of law firm rankings, only 3 percent belong to Generation X, those born from 1965 to 1982.

That is because at nearly two-thirds of the biggest law firms, partners who are 60 and older control at least one-quarter of the firm’s revenue, according to the 2015 “Law Firms in Transition” report by Altman Weil, a legal industry consultant. And only 31 percent of such firms have a formal succession planning process, the research found.Generally speaking, change at law firms is “limited, tactical and reactive,” the report said, with little incentive for innovation because fellow law firms were also inclined toward the status quo.AdvertisementBut some are trying new approaches.In an effort to broaden its approach, Bryan Cave, a 950-lawyer firm that began in St. Louis 142 years ago, started a “business academy” two years ago to give associates the opportunity to brainstorm ways to better serve clients. At its most recent meeting last spring, about 100 entry-level associates offered ideas to improve client service. A winning idea was to offer electronic tagging of federal bankruptcy filings so interested clients are updated automatically, according to Therese D. Pritchard, the firm’s chairwoman.Outlets like the business academy do not guarantee associates will stay forever, said Ms. Pritchard, who has been at the firm for 16 years and took over its leadership a year ago.“There is less of an expectation generally that lawyers will start with one firm and stay there,” she said. “It’s harder and harder to make partner at law firms these days.”A few firms are looking to secure their futures by creating a more entrepreneurial environment that allows associates to carve out practices in areas that interest them. That idea is being tried by Nixon Peabody, an 800-lawyer firm based in Boston.“Lawyers almost always look backward,” said Andrew I. Glincher, the firm’s managing partner. “We are focusing on the next leadership level, urging people to attend trade events, to know what laws and regulations change client business and to learn and anticipate what affects the client.“It’s more than the billable hour.”But the billable hour, in one form or another, remains a mainstay of law firms’ financial structure. And declines can have profound effects in the short term.In the face of cuts in legal spending by corporations in the last seven years, the current generation of managing partners has shored up profits by reducing support staff and letting go underproductive partners and excess associates. Once unthinkable in the exclusive world of New York white-shoe law firms, even prominent firms like Weil, Gotshal & Manges laid off lawyers and support staff in 2013 to come to grips with a decline in corporate legal business. In a statement, Barry M. Wolf, executive partner, said that while the firm would take steps to increase its revenue, “actions to enhance revenue alone will not be sufficient to position the firm as necessary for these new market conditions.”Law firms also merged with other firms, hired competitors’ lawyers who brought clients with them and added heavy amounts of legal technology and automation to make the work they do for clients more efficient. Big American firms like Fulbright & Jaworski in Houston merged with firms in other countries, a trend that pushed the overall number of lawyers working for American firms up last year.AdvertisementYounger lawyers now filling the ranks of associates have won some concessions. Firms have more readily adopted popular policies like paid parental leave, flexible hours and a modest amount of telecommuting.But while few millennials — and those even younger — are inclined to sign up for lifetime employment, the current law firm partnership structure magnifies the gap between generations, new research shows. Current firm leaders are largely boomer-era achievers and significantly older than their counterparts in corporations. Less than 5 percent of managing partners or their equivalents in the top 100 firms were born between the early 1960s and the early 1980s, the Generation X period. In comparison, almost 20 percent of Fortune 100 corporations and 30 percent of companies traded on the Nasdaq stock market have leaders in that generation, according to the research.“The boomers inherited clients and don’t give them up, or the income they generate, until they retire,” said Heather Morse, marketing director at the law firm Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger in Los Angeles, who researched the age gap.As a result, she noted, “the rising generation — people who are less afraid of risk because they grew up more independent — are more likely to jump to other firms instead of waiting their turn for promotion to head practice groups and later to become part of firm management.”
                From Wall Street to Washington and in the towers of academia, people are buzzing about what some say is the pernicious focus in corporate America on short-term profits.            Partners in law firms divide the profits at the end of the year, a tradition that encourages maintaining the current structure.But Mr. Glincher of Nixon Peabody said he remained committed to the idea of encouraging entrepreneurial associates like Joseph A. Carello, who has a growing practice providing legal services to craft breweries.Mr. Carello, 33, joined the firm’s Rochester office after law school to practice employment law in 2007. He realized the boom in upstate New York breweries and distilleries created issues concerning trademark protection, packaging and labeling, safety, real estate and environment regulations.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Cameron Cloar-Zavaleta, 35, who was a commercial airline pilot before he went to law school then started working in Nixon Peabody’s San Francisco office in 2008, began noticing the controversy over the use of drones.He had a busy practice doing litigation and regulatory work for airline manufacturers, then began speaking at conferences and taking on clients who were manufacturing or operating drones.But he noted that building a practice took a big investment of time — and might take years to pay for itself. He decided this summer to move on to an in-house airline company job as a lawyer.Without major changes, law firms may be heading into rocky terrain in about five years, said Bruce MacEwen, who writes about law firm economics and has a website, Adam Smith, Esq.“When the baton is being passed, that may be the time when there are firm breakups with people going different ways,” he said.Even so, law firms are unlikely to change their model anytime soon.“There’s not enough pain to make them change of their own volition,” Mr. MacEwen said.Ms. Pritchard of Bryan Cave does not necessarily disagree about the likelihood for change — but for a different reason.“I don’t really see a change in structure in my lifetime,” she said. “It’s a service business that’s a little bit like an apprenticeship. You are hired and you grow into the opportunity to own the business.”A version of this article appears in print on November 5, 2015, on Page F12 of the New York edition with the headline: Esquire, Jr.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
