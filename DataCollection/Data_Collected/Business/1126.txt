As the James Bond theme thundered — ba-da, ba-daaaa! — and 50 camera crews clamored for a better view, a white Suburban with tinted windows rolled up to the Americas premiere of “Spectre” on Monday in Mexico City. Swarming fans, many wearing Day of the Dead makeup, had been waiting for hours. Had the superspy himself finally arrived?When an anxious-looking woman and an older man in a lumpy suit stepped out, the look-who-it-isn’t letdown was palpable. Well, maybe the next S.U.V. would carry Daniel Craig, the current Bond, James Bond. Fans went back to their chant — Dan-iel, Dan-iel — as the mystery man and woman disappeared up a set of red-carpeted stairs.If the crowd only knew. The fate of moviedom’s longest-running franchise, which again finds itself at a critical juncture, is in those little-known hands.For the last 20 years, ever since their father handed over the keys to the series, the ferociously private Barbara Broccoli, 55, and her half brother, Michael G. Wilson, 73, have micromanaged Bond’s every move. While moviemaking is a collaborative process, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson have final say over every line of dialogue, every casting decision, every stunt sequence, every marketing tie-in, every TV ad, poster and billboard.AdvertisementIn particular, it is the steely-eyed Ms. Broccoli who runs the Bond franchise. She was the one who decided to recast the central character in 2005, giving the job to Mr. Craig, whom she had spotted in an indie drama called “Layer Cake.” She was the one who, with “Spectre” hanging in the balance after the on-set injury of Mr. Craig early this year, figured out how to keep the $300 million production on track.AdvertisementYes, a woman is in charge of the world’s most aspirational male brand.Although she almost never speaks in public and keeps an absurdly low profile in Hollywood — born in Los Angeles, she now lives and works in London — Ms. Broccoli has an iron-fisted reputation.“Barbara scares the hell out of people,” Mr. Wilson said in a rare sit-down interview at the St. Regis Hotel in Mexico City a few hours before the premiere of “Spectre,” which opened in the United States on Friday. “Everyone is frightened to death of her.”“Good!” shouted Ms. Broccoli, who was seated beside him. She laughed.“I mean it,” Mr. Wilson continued, as she shot him an O.K.-that’s-enough look. “They all know I’m a big pushover so they don’t care about me.”It may take all of her mettle to get James Bond through his next set of challenges. After a four-film period of stability and prosperity — the last Bond movie, “Skyfall,” took in $1.1 billion worldwide and “Spectre” has already been outselling it in many European markets — the spy series finds itself most definitely stirred if not outright shaken.
                A ranking of the most popular films in the James Bond franchise, based on how much they pulled in at the box office.            The complicated Mr. Craig, 47, has professed a desire to move on before, but this time he seems to really mean it. (“I’d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told a British magazine in October when asked if he wanted to continue playing the character.) Moreover, the final scenes of “Spectre” seem designed to set up the departure of this particular 007, or at least close a chapter.The Bond contract is also expiring for Sony Pictures Entertainment, which has distributed the last four movies. At least three studios — Sony, Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox — are expected to battle for the right to take Bond into the future.“My main concern is what happens to the franchise next,” Sam Mendes, who directed “Spectre” and “Skyfall,” said in a phone interview, noting Mr. Wilson’s age. “Can one of them do it without the other? Does its management go to another generation? I don’t know the answer to those questions, and I don’t think they know.”AdvertisementWhile Ms. Broccoli is the more aggressive partner, according to studio executives who have worked on Bond, she operates in lock step with Mr. Wilson, who got his producing start in 1977 when he helped rig underwater bombs in the Bahamas for “The Spy Who Loved Me.” Mr. Wilson brushed aside any notion that there would be big changes in how the franchise was managed. “We’re in it for the long haul, whatever that may be,” he said.As for Mr. Craig’s future, Ms. Broccoli shut down that question. “Maybe I’m in denial, but I don’t want to think about another Bond,” she said evenly. “Until he definitely says otherwise, I’m not going to give it another thought.”
            Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson reflect on the actors who have played the iconic leading man.        Bond’s future studio home is another issue, and it’s complicated.“We’re really not in the frame of mind to be wooed at the moment,” Ms. Broccoli said. “We’re focused on getting this picture out.”She added: “The future is a little uncertain, but whether we stay at Sony or go somewhere else, we’ll make it work. We are very, very protective of Bond. Bond is our baby.”Bond is unlike any other Hollywood franchise. For starters, it is gargantuan: The 24 movies have taken in more than $5 billion at the domestic box office, after adjusting for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo. The series — the first to go after a global audience — has generated billions more in overseas ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games.The franchise’s complicated ownership structure is also unique.Back in the 1930s, Albert R. Broccoli, the son of immigrant farmers (family lore holds that the family is descended from Italians who crossed cauliflower with rapini to create broccoli), set out to make a name for himself in Hollywood. He eventually formed a business partnership with a producer named Harry Saltzman; together, they came to control the film rights to Ian Fleming’s sex-drenched James Bond novels.They made a financing deal with the independent studio United Artists. In the 1970s, Mr. Saltzman — facing mounting personal debt — sold his 50 percent stake in Bond to that studio. Over the coming decades, as United Artists was absorbed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was in turn sold and resold a half-dozen times, Mr. Broccoli, who was known as Cubby, maintained creative control over Bond.In 1995, he handed operations at the family company, Eon Productions, over to Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson. Cubby Broccoli died in 1996, after the release of “GoldenEye.” By that time, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson, who had long been involved in the making of the films, were in position to take over custody of the franchise uncontested.Advertisement“They’ve managed to keep in their family, through passion and pride and unbelievable effort, the greatest movie franchise out there,” said Gary Barber, MGM’s chief executive. “It’s pretty damn amazing.”(Although MGM and Eon, which stands for Everything or Nothing, have had knockout fights over the decades, Ms. Broccoli emphatically praised Mr. Barber, who rescued MGM from bankruptcy in 2010, and Jonathan Glickman, president of the motion picture group at MGM.)Because MGM no longer distributes its own movies, the last four Bond pictures have been released through Sony. But Sony’s contract expires with “Spectre,” and MGM is expected to begin actively shopping the distribution rights next year. If Bond moves to a new distributor, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson will have their grit tested once more: New studio executives, particularly marketers, tend to want to put their stamp on Bond.“If we get the wrong partners, there are liable to be conflicts,” Mr. Wilson said.Eon and MGM have no contractual obligation to consider Sony first, but Michael Lynton, the chief executive of Sony Entertainment, very much wants to sign a new deal. Sony lacks blockbuster franchises of its own, and Bond delivers both profits and clout.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Without question,” Mr. Lynton said in a phone interview. “It’s a spectacular franchise, and Barbara, Michael and the MGM team are a pleasure to work with.”Still, Sony also finds itself at a crossroads. After enduring a battle with the activist investor Daniel S. Loeb and a devastating attack by hackers, the studio shook up its movie division this year, bringing in a new movie chairman, Thomas E. Rothman, who has a track record of financial discipline. Sony can’t exactly back up a Brink’s truck to keep Bond while preaching austerity to the rest of Hollywood.And the expiring deal is lavish, requiring Sony to pay 50 percent of the “Spectre” production costs — which total some $250 million after accounting for government incentives — for only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs are recouped. Sony also shoulders tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs.In an email stolen by hackers and widely published online, Andrew Gumpert, who oversees business affairs for Sony, figured that the studio would realize about $38 million in profit if “Spectre” performed as “Skyfall” did. (Sony earned about $57 million from “Skyfall,” which was less expensive to make, while MGM collected roughly $175 million and Eon’s share amounted to $109 million.)There is one other factor working against Sony. Mr. Lynton this year pushed out the studio’s longtime movie chief, Amy Pascal, and she was the Sony executive with the strongest relationship with Ms. Broccoli. Was Ms. Broccoli upset by Ms. Pascal’s exit?Advertisement“Yes,” she said. “Amy has been a big part of the success of these movies, and we adore her.” Asked which Sony executive they are closest to now, Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson struggled for an answer. Ms. Broccoli ultimately offered that Josh Greenstein, Sony’s relatively new head of marketing, “does fantastic work.”Ms. Broccoli thought James Bond was a real person until she was 6 or 7. She was a toddler on the set of “Dr. No” in Jamaica in 1962. In 1967, while in Japan on the set of “You Only Live Twice,” she had a serious case of tonsillitis and recuperated in Sean Connery’s suite, which was the best appointed.If her father was larger than life, Ms. Broccoli tends to disappear, at least in public. At the Mexico City premiere, Mr. Wilson stood onstage and greeted the 5,000 attendees while she struck a silent pose off to the side. When they were honored last year by the Producers Guild of America, they walked together to the podium, but only he spoke.In an interview, she was friendly and warm, if guarded. At times, she laughed mightily. Friends say an even more charismatic woman emerges in private. “She is vivacious and funny and smart and extremely warmhearted and the most loyal person you will ever meet,” Mr. Mendes said. “But she is absolutely old school. She wants all of the attention to be on the movie. She hates it when producers try to make it about them.”It may be the ultimate sign of power in Hollywood: She has nothing to prove, and does not need to curry favor with studios. Although a skilled producer of theater — “Once,” which she produced with her ex-husband, Frederick M. Zollo, won the 2012 Tony Award for best musical — she does not make movies outside the Bond universe.Ms. Broccoli attended Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where she studied motion picture and television communications. But her real training came at her father’s elbow. She was an assistant on “Octopussy” in 1983. As a third assistant director on “A View to a Kill” in 1985, she directed traffic on a walkie-talkie. In 1989, while working on “Licence to Kill,” she oversaw the climactic tanker truck sequence.Mr. Wilson, a writer and producer of “Licence to Kill,” came up in a different way. He joined the family as a teenager when his mother, Dana, became Cubby’s third wife (Cubby and Dana then had Barbara). He graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 1963 with a degree in electrical engineering, later studying law at Stanford University. After nine years in independent practice, he joined Eon in the 1970s to help with a legal tangle. Down to earth — he wandered around the St. Regis Hotel here in hiking shoes — Mr. Wilson eventually started writing and producing alongside Cubby Broccoli.Since there are no more Fleming books to adapt outright, each new Bond movie starts with Ms. Broccoli and Mr. Wilson rereading the old novels, they said. “We really like to kind of saturate ourselves in the world he created,” she said. Then, working in their stately London offices near the Hyde Park end of Piccadilly, they try to channel the fears and insecurities of the global moviegoing audience.Advertisement“We think, ‘What is the world afraid of? Where are we headed?’ Then we try to create a villain that is the physical embodiment of that fear,” Mr. Wilson said. With “Spectre,” they zeroed in on government surveillance.“Spectre” was a particularly arduous shoot. It did not snow in Austria until the last minute. They faced bad weather in Italy. And Mr. Craig injured his knee while performing a stunt. Although he continued working, Mr. Craig eventually had to undergo surgery, which threw the carefully calibrated schedule into disarray.
                Always big dreamers, Bond villains come in many flavors.            Ms. Broccoli, who personally went with Mr. Craig to visit doctors at one point, “was nothing less than heroic,” Mr. Mendes said. “There is no way we would have completed the film on time without the way Barbara managed Daniel and Daniel’s injury.”Asked about her handling of the incident, Ms. Broccoli seemed to grow uncomfortable. “It was Daniel who handled it,” she said. “He decided that he would carry on, and he did the rest of the picture with some really serious issues.”Mr. Wilson sighed and interrupted.“What Sam meant is that Barbara sat down with her production team and immediately figured out how to shoot the picture in a way that gave Daniel some therapy and time. She completely reorganized everything — filming overseas, major stunt and action sequences — and she did that, like, over a weekend.”Ms. Broccoli still would not concede that she did anything special. “We have an amazing team,” she said quietly.At that point, a Sony operative arrived and put Ms. Broccoli out of her misery, insisting that an agreed-upon hourlong interview had to end early. But a reporter had (at least) one more question: Does Ms. Broccoli consider herself a feminist and, if so, does she look back on some of the “Bond girls” and wince?“I am absolutely a feminist,” she said. “If you think about the women in the recent films, they’re far more interesting and complex than they once were. Bond has changed, too, in how he deals with women.”She added: “Women still have a long way to go. There are not enough women in positions of power in the film industry. And now there are all these questions about women in Hollywood not being paid equally. When that happens, it’s outrageous.”AdvertisementMr. Wilson gave her a sideways glance. “That doesn’t happen with us,” he said.“No it doesn’t,” Ms. Broccoli said with a smile.A version of this article appears in print on November 8, 2015, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Secret Agent in the Family.
