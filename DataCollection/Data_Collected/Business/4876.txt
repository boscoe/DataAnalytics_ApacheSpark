LONDON — European bankers saw their pay increase in 2015, though they still lag behind their American counterparts, according to a snapshot of bonuses released on Wednesday by Emolument.com, a salary benchmarking website in Britain.European bonuses were up 18 percent to 136,000 pounds, or about $201,000, in 2015, while bankers’ bonuses in the United States ticked up to the equivalent of £216,000, for the same period.The snapshot of data showed that British banks had increased their bonuses by £5,000, to £126,000, and that Swiss bankers had taken a relative hit, with bonuses falling 26 percent to £162,000.Emolument analyzed bonuses from 434 directors working in Europe for top British, European and American banks. Emolument compiles salary and bonus data from professionals who contribute anonymously.AdvertisementThe company noted that although American banks again paid well, upholding their reputation as being more generous with compensation, they were mostly relying on positive stock performance to increase existing holdings rather than on substantial increases in new awards.Swiss banks suffered from disappointing returns, and there was wide variation on pay between areas, Emolument said.AdvertisementOf course, bonuses are all relative. In a news release, Thomas Drewry, the chief executive of Emolument, noted that, “ ‘Are you up or down on last year?’ is the question deemed proper enough in bonus-related conversations, and that in itself becomes a substantial indicator of how much the bank wants to keep you.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
