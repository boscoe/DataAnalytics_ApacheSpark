DAVOS, Switzerland — The power brokers assembled here discuss the marvels and potential of what ever-new software and robots can bring in terms of efficiency and productivity, but the Vatican has issued a more sobering message.In a letter to the World Economic Forum’s executive chairman, Klaus Schwab, Pope Francis beseeched the business moguls and government leaders to remember the poor.“We must never allow the culture of prosperity to deaden us, to make us incapable of ‘feeling compassion at the outcry of the poor, weeping for other people’s pain, and sensing the need to help them, as though all this were someone else’s responsibility and not our own,’” Pope Francis wrote in the letter, quoting from a previous papal letter.It is a theme that the pontiff has hit on throughout his papacy, including at previous World Economic Forums.AdvertisementThe reminder from the Vatican arrives at the opening of the World Economic Forum, a high-powered networking event nestled in a luxurious Swiss resort where corporate chieftains come to rub elbows with politicians and academics.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Yet he also acknowledges that they could lead to greater unemployment, further widening an already broad divide between the rich and the impoverished.Pope Francis’s letter, which was read aloud by Cardinal Peter Turkson, the president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, clearly worries about the latter. The pontiff argues that “useful and dignified employment” opportunities have dwindled, and implies that technology runs the risk of overriding human decency.“Weeping for other people’s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realizing that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality,” Pope Francis wrote.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
