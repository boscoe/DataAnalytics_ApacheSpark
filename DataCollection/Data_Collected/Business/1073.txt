Hart, as the acting chief . At the time, the airline provided no timetable or information about when Mr. Munoz might return to the job.Mr. Munoz, a longtime railroad executive, was appointed in September after United dismissed its previous chief executive, Jeff Smisek, during a corruption investigation into the airline’s trading favors with the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.Advertisement
