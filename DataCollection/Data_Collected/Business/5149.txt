Amazon discouraged sales of Hachette books to pressure the publisher, and Hachette’s writers and their allies took to the barricades. The impasse was broken when Amazon signed a contract with Simon & Schuster in October and then used the same terms to broker peace with Hachette. A deal with another major house, Macmillan, promptly followed.All the agreements allow the publishers to set their own e-book prices, a major point of contention, but give them financial encouragement to price cheaply.HarperCollins issued a brief statement Monday saying it had “reached an agreement with Amazon and our books will continue to be available on the Amazon print and digital platforms.” An Amazon spokeswoman declined a request for comment.The HarperCollins negotiations became public when Business Insider reported at the end of March that the publisher was refusing to sign the contract. “No print or digital HarperCollins books will be available on Amazon once its existing contract runs out,” the publication quoted a source as saying, raising the possibility of Hachette redux.While the possibility of that happening was unlikely, HarperCollins is making aggressive efforts to broaden its range of outlets so it does not have to depend too heavily on Amazon.So are the other publishers. When Macmillan announced its agreement with Amazon in December, its chief executive, John Sargent, wrote in a blog post that “we have not addressed one of the big problems in the digital marketplace. Through great innovation and prodigious amounts of risk and hard work, Amazon holds a 64 percent market share of Macmillan’s e-book business. As publishers, authors, illustrators and agents, we need broader channels to reach our readers.”Advertisement
