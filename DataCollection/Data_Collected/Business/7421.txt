LONDON —  A retail banker by trade, Antony Jenkins was elevated to the top job at Barclays three years ago to radically reshape an aggressive investment banking culture at the British lender that politicians and some investors saw as out of control.It wasn’t enough.While he was praised for his efforts to change the company’s cultural identity, Mr. Jenkins was ousted on Wednesday as chief executive after directors lost confidence in his ability to improve returns to shareholders.“We’ve got quite a bureaucracy here,” John McFarlane, the Barclays chairman, told reporters on Wednesday. “It needs to be much more clear on what we’re doing — much more decisive and with much more pace — so that we are leaner and more agile and more energetic.”Mr. McFarlane, who replaced David Walker as the Barclays chairman this year, will serve as executive chairman beginning on July 17 until a replacement is found.AdvertisementThe move comes as several European banking rivals have replaced their top executives this year, as they look to adjust to tighter regulatory scrutiny and try to move beyond a series of legacy issues and investigations that have plagued results.When Mr. Jenkins took the helm of the bank in 2012, the lender was reeling from its admission that traders had conspired to manipulate a global benchmark interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.The scandal cost the American banker Robert E. Diamond Jr. his job as chief executive as the lender faced pressure from regulators. Mr. Diamond had aggressively moved to make Barclays a Wall Street powerhouse and ran the investment bank when it bought the American capital markets unit of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers in September 2008.John McFarlane, the chairman of the British bank, said that Antony Jenkins was ousted after directors lost confidence in his ability to improve returns to shareholders.Mr. Jenkins, 53, was seen as the perfect choice to follow Mr. Diamond and make the business a bit more boring and risk-averse. He was even referred to as “Saint Antony” by some in financial circles for his focus on changing the bank’s culture.In his three years as chief executive, Mr. Jenkins spent much of his time on doing just that, as well as improving its capital and exiting riskier business lines. As part of efforts to be leaner, Mr. Jenkins also announced plans last year to greatly shrink its investment bank and cut as many as 19,000 jobs across the lender, which celebrated its 325th anniversary this year.AdvertisementAlthough the bank has recovered from its lows after the interest-rate rigging scandal, the performance of the company’s stock price and its dividend have been sore points for some investors, who have questioned the turnaround. The lender also has continued to be dogged by regulatory investigations of possible misconduct, which have weighed on earnings.Mr. McFarlane noted on Wednesday that the stock price was still hovering at the same level it was six years ago and that the company’s dividend remained flat. He said that more needed to be done to reward shareholders.
            A number of financial giants replaced top executives this year.        Barclays had been “cumbersome in its execution” in trying to achieve better returns, Mr. McFarlane said. The board had concerns that the pace of change was slowing, he said, and had “a real sense of urgency to make this happen.”Among the independent directors, he said, there had been “some rumblings of concern about the style of leadership” at the bank for some time — namely that the existing management’s plans for rewarding shareholders were “too far out in the future.”Mr. Jenkins also differed with Thomas King, the head of Barclays investment banking business, over the strategic direction of the unit, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Mr. King had discussed the possibility of retiring in recent weeks, but did not give the bank an ultimatum, said one person with knowledge of Mr. King’s thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Barclays is in the midst of a restructuring that has slashed the size of its investment bank. It is also focusing on several core or growing businesses, which include its corporate and retail bank in Britain, its African banking business and its Barclaycard credit card operations.Mr. McFarlane said that the nonexecutive directors had met in recent weeks and had decided unanimously that a change was needed. After a series of director meetings in the last few weeks, the board met on Tuesday and decided that Mr. Jenkins should leave, Mr. McFarlane said.AdvertisementMr. McFarlane said he first broke the news to Mr. Jenkins last week that he might be asked to leave.“This is a very difficult thing for him to swallow,” Mr. McFarlane said. “He was very professional, professional as usual.”Mr. Jenkins noted in a statement on Wednesday that he had taken the role of chief executive at a difficult time for the company.“It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago, both for our industry and even more so for us,” he wrote. “I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then.”Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered appointed new chief executives this year as they reshaped their businesses. In June, Deutsche Bank announced that Anshu Jain, one of the company’s chief executives, would step down and that Jürgen Fitschen, the other chief executive, would stay another year but would leave before his contract expired in 2017.“Notwithstanding Antony’s significant achievements, it became clear to all of us that a new set of skills were required for the period ahead,” Michael Rake, the Barclays deputy chairman and senior independent director, said in a statement.Shareholder returns and the size of the dividend have been routine complaints at the company’s annual meeting of investors in recent years, particularly as investors have bristled with management over the size of bonuses paid to its bankers.The management change will only further burnish Mr. McFarlane’s reputation as a turnaround specialist.In a similar fashion, he was asked to step in as executive chairman when he joined the British insurer Aviva in 2012 and has been called “Mack the Knife” by some in the British press for his willingness to replace top management and cut costs. (Mr. McFarlane is not fond of the nickname and suggested in a call with reporters on Wednesday that no one other than journalists actually calls him that.)For now, Barclays will take its time in finding a successor for Mr. Jenkins, Mr. McFarlane said.One possible internal candidate is Tushar Morzaria, who is well regarded after joining the bank as group finance director in 2013 from JPMorgan Chase. “We’re going to get it right,” Mr. McFarlane said.A version of this article appears in print on July 9, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Barclays Dismisses Chief, Seeking Higher Returns .
