FRANKFURT — Volkswagen’s in-house bank said on Tuesday that profit was likely to fall this year because the automaker’s diesel emissions scandal would increase the interest the company must pay to raise money from financial markets.The unit, Volkswagen Financial Services, reported its financial results on Tuesday, saying it had subtracted about 450 million euros, or about $500 million, from 2015 earnings after vehicles leased to customers lost more value than expected, in part because of the scandal. The unit still reported a net profit of €1.2 billion for last year, a 35 percent increase from the previous year.The financial hits were a result of the turmoil that has enveloped Volkswagen since it admitted widespread cheating on emissions tests going back years. Volkswagen Financial Services has been temporarily unable to issue bonds in the United States or Europe because of its parent company’s problems, executives of the unit said on Tuesday at a news conference in Frankfurt.The emissions scandal has “intensively challenged the entire Volkswagen Group and therefore Volkswagen Financial Services as well,” said Lars Henner Santelmann, chief executive of the banking unit.AdvertisementVolkswagen Financial Services is one of Europe’s largest banks, considered significant enough to be supervised directly by the European Central Bank. It has also been a major source of profit for Volkswagen, as well as a way to promote sales by providing customers with money to buy or lease Volkswagen vehicles.AdvertisementVolkswagen’s financial reporting has effectively been delayed while the company negotiates with the United States government about the fines it must pay after admitting last year that 11 million cars, including about 600,000 in the United States, were equipped with software that generated low emissions only when the cars were being tested.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            At other times Volkswagen diesels emitted many times the allowed amounts of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to serious lung ailments and premature death.Volkswagen has pushed back publication of its 2015 financial results to the end of April, from March 10, which makes it impossible for the financial services unit to prepare the documents required to sell bonds in the United States and Europe, company executives said. The financial state of the parent company is crucial information for investors, who need to know whether Volkswagen can provide financial backing to the banking unit if needed.Bonds are one of the main ways that Volkswagen Financial Services and many other banks raise money; Volkswagen uses the money to write loans to customers. While the Volkswagen banking unit will probably have to pay higher rates to issue debt this year, the cost is likely to be offset by exceptionally low interest rates in Europe.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As part of an effort to lower borrowing costs for European businesses, the central bank said on Thursday that, for the first time, it would use newly created money to buy debt issued by corporations.Bonds issued by Volkswagen would almost certainly be eligible for the purchase program. The central bank has already bought so-called asset-backed securities issued by Volkswagen under a previous stimulus program, company executives said. Asset-backed securities are car loans or other credit bundled for resale to investors, who acquire the right to payments on the loans.All of the major ratings agencies have downgraded debt issued by Volkswagen Financial Services, in part because of concerns that vehicles leased to customers would be worth less than expected when customers returned them. The company is required to subtract the decline in value from profit.The ratings agencies’ concerns were confirmed on Tuesday when Volkswagen Financial Services said that it subtracted about €450 million from 2015 profit to cover such declines. That figure includes €96 million in depreciation of vehicles leased through VW Credit, Volkswagen’s finance unit in the United States, which is a legal entity separate from Volkswagen Financial Services.Mr. Santelmann, the chief executive, said that Volkswagen Financial Services would earn an operating profit of at least €1.7 billion in 2016, compared with €1.9 billion in 2015.A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: VW Financial Services Lowers Profit Outlook in Wake of Scandal.
