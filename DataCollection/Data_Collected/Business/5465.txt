Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams of Ohio said on its website that it had recalled all its frozen products. On Monday, Blue Bell Creameries of Texas did the same. Blue Bell’s ice cream has been linked to 10 listeria illnesses in four states, and three deaths. It was not immediately clear if the recalls were connected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said no known illnesses had been linked to Jeni’s products. The listeria was found in a sample of Jeni’s ice cream randomly collected by Nebraska officials at a Whole Foods in Lincoln. John Lowe, the company’s chief, said, “We will not reopen the kitchen until we can ensure the safety of our customers.” Listeria generally affects only the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, pregnant women and their newborn infants. It usually is not found in ice cream because the bacteria cannot grow at freezing temperatures. It is commonly found in processed meats, unpasteurized cheeses and unpasteurized milk, but other foods as well. Advertisement
