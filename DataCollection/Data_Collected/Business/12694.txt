The penalty announced on Tuesday was the latest that Lumber Liquidators has absorbed for formerly selling laminate flooring made in China. In this case, Lumber Liquidators faced allegations that the imported flooring contained high levels of the carcinogen formaldehyde that violated California’s air quality controls.
