Struggling to increase sales of its single-cup coffee machines, Keurig announced on Wednesday that it is hiring the chief executive of Pinnacle Foods, Robert J. Gamgort, as its next chief. Shares of Pinnacle, which makes Duncan Hines cake mixes and Wish-Bone salad dressings, fell more than 11 percent on Wednesday. Mr. Gamgort, who has led Pinnacle for nearly seven years, will join Keurig in May. Sales of Keurig’s K-Cup coffee-filled pods, which accounted for more than 80 percent of the company’s revenue, rose 1 percent, to $3.6 billion, last year. Sales of its machines fell 23 percent, to $632.6 million.A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Pinnacle Foods C.E.O.
