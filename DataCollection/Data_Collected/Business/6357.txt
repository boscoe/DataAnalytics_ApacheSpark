Kors, the hottest name in affordable luxury a year ago, said revenue was up 17.8 percent for the fourth quarter that ended March 28, but that was the smallest increase since Kors went public in December 2011. Analysts said Kors’s rapid expansion had led to brand fatigue among shoppers. “It may take some time for the customer base to want to purchase Michael Kors again,” said Betty Chen, analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. The company’s same-store sales in North America fell 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Kors shares fell more than 24 percent to $45.93. Advertisement
