The case involved information about a variety of companies, including the Vega Group, Premier Oil and Enodis.The group made more than 732,000 pounds, or about $1.1 million, from May 2006 to May 2008, according to the British authorities.Last year, a criminal court in London ordered Mr. Saini to repay £464,564.91 by March 12. About £222,047.06 remains unpaid as of Tuesday, the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain said.On Tuesday, Mr. Saini was sentenced to an additional 538 days in prison for failing to abide by a so-called confiscation order and failing to repay the money, the F.C.A. said.“The F.C.A. welcomes the court’s decision today,” Georgina Philippou, the regulator’s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a news release. “Individuals should not be able to benefit from their crimes, and today’s outcome should serve as a warning to those considering committing insider dealing.”Mr. Saini was previously sentenced to three years and six months in prison in July 2012. The prison term imposed on Tuesday was added to that sentence, the F.C.A. said.He also is subject to a restraint order on his assets until the money is repaid with interest, the regulator said.Advertisement
