The deficit in February totaled $192.6 billion, up 0.1 percent from a year ago, the Treasury announced. So far this budget year, the deficit stands at $353 billion, down 8.7 percent from the same period in 2015. That improvement is not expected to last. The Obama administration and the Congressional Budget Office are forecasting deficits for the full year that will be significantly higher than last year’s $439.1 billion, the lowest in eight years. The C.B.O. sees the deficit climbing by 24 percent, to $544 billion; the administration is more pessimistic, forecasting a deficit of $616 billion.A version of this article appears in print on March 11, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: February Deficit Up Slightly From Year Ago, U.S. Reports.
