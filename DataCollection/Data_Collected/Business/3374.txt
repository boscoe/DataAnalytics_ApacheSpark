A blockbuster jobs report on Friday sent investors fleeing traditional places of comfort: dividend-paying stocks, as well as bonds and gold. The selling left major indexes slightly lower.When nervous investors crowd into safe-haven assets, it is known on Wall Street as a “flight to safety.” Friday’s activity constituted a flight from safety, as investors grew more confident that the economy would grow.“The January employment report was strong across the board,” said Michelle Girard, an economist at RBS Securities, in a note to clients. “The data were clearly very healthy.”Gold fell more than 2 percent. As bond prices fell, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 1.96 percent from 1.82 percent, a large move. Yields on shorter-term Treasury securities moved even more.AdvertisementHigh-dividend utility stocks, one of the best-performing parts of the market over the last 12 months, took a beating. The Dow Jones utility index, a collection of 15 utility companies, plunged 4 percent, its worst day since August 2011.AdvertisementJanuary’s jobs report startled investors who have become accustomed to near-zero interest rates.
