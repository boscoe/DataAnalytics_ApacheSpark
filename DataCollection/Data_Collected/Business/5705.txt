Customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer bank were unable to log into their accounts online for several hours on Friday.The Chase bank’s website was overwhelmed by customer activity during what is normally the busiest day of the month, rather than the result of any malicious attack, according to a person briefed on the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Friday is typically the busiest day of the week for bank websites, and traffic on the first day of the month is generally the heaviest, the person said.Website outages are a sensitive topic for Chase and other banks because of the spate of hacking attacks in recent years. An intruder last year got access to the email addresses and phone numbers of tens of millions of Chase customers.On Friday, the bank’s customers began complaining publicly around 10:30 a.m. about difficulty logging into the website.Chase put up a message on its website apologizing for the problems, and gradually restored service. By around 3:30 p.m., most customers could again get access to the site.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
