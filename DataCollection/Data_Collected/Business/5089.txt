The top three United States airlines — Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines — have asserted recently that their Gulf-based rivals had received more than $42 billion in state aid. They claim the subsidies allowed the Gulf carriers to compete unfairly by buying newer planes and offering better service and amenities. The United States carriers asked the government to freeze any new flights from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where the airlines are based, and review open-skies agreements that the United States had signed with the two countries. The Commerce, State and Transportation Departments said in a statement that they took the allegations seriously and would seek public comments. Advertisement
