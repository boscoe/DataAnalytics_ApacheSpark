WASHINGTON —  Consumer prices in the United States rose in May at the fastest clip in over two years, as gasoline prices surged, suggesting the impact of lower oil prices on inflation probably is fading.Other data on Thursday showed the economy gaining speed after stumbling in the first quarter. New applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a near 15-year low and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a six-month high in June.The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in April, the Labor Department said. That was the largest increase since February 2013, and left the index unchanged in the 12 months through May after a 0.2 percent yearly decline in April.While energy prices are stabilizing, a strong dollar is weighing on underlying inflation pressures. The so-called core C.P.I., which excludes food and energy costs, rose 0.1 percent, the smallest increase in five months, after a 0.3 percent jump in April.

In the 12 months through May, the core C.P.I. rose 1.7 percent, slowing from a yearly increase of 1.8 percent in April.AdvertisementIn a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week that ended June 13. It was the 15th straight week that claims held below 300,000, a threshold usually associated with a firming labor market.AdvertisementThe claims data covered the period in which the government surveyed employers for the payrolls portion of June’s employment report.“The labor market appears to be in good health through the June payroll survey period,” said Guy Berger, an economist at R.B.S. in Stamford, Conn. “This ongoing labor market resilience is important, because it underpins our forecast of a rebound in the economy during the remainder of 2015.”Growth prospects were further bolstered by a third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showing its business activity index jumped to a reading of 15.2 in June, the highest level since December, from 6.7 in May.

Measures of new orders and shipments also rose to their highest levels since November.While manufacturers reported a rise in the cost of inputs, they were also increasing prices for their goods, a trend that supports the view that inflation will creep higher in the months ahead.The economy’s gains were underscored by yet another report from the Conference Board showing its Leading Economic Index rose 0.7 percent last month after a similar gain in April.“Both reports provided some support to the current underlying narrative that the positive momentum in domestic economic activity is being sustained,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.A 10.4 percent jump in gasoline prices in May accounted for most of the increase in the C.P.I. It was the biggest increase since June 2009, and followed a 1.7 percent decline in April.A version of this article appears in print on June 19, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Consumer Prices Climb as Gas Prices Jump .
