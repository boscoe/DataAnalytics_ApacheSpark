Still, she added, “with underlying price pressures still very weak and the recovery seemingly slowing, strong monetary policy support will be needed for the foreseeable future.”Fears had been building since last year that the region could lapse into deeper economic stagnation and unemployment as the annual rate of inflation turned negative in December and hit its lowest point, minus 0.6 percent, in January. Consumer prices have been improving in recent months, and they were flat at the last reading, in April.Energy costs, which began falling sharply in June 2014, weighed on prices in May and were down 5 percent from a year earlier. But the so-called core inflation rate, which strips out energy and food prices, rose 0.9 percent; economists and policy makers favor the core measure as a truer indicator of price trends than the headline figure.While lower fuel prices have been a boon for consumers, economists have expressed fears that Europe is headed for a broad decline in prices known as deflation, which saps growth and punishes borrowers by raising the real cost of loan repayment.The current level of inflation, which International Monetary Fund economists have termed “lowflation,” is too weak for comfort and far below the European Central Bank’s target of just under 2 percent. With unemployment in the region above 11 percent and output well below potential, the central bank has not been able to hit that target since January 2013.To address those concerns and restart growth, the central bank in March began buying bonds on a large scale in a policy known as quantitative easing. The bank has pledged to buy 60 billion euros, or about $66 billion, in bonds each month through at least September 2016, hoping that lower yields and a weaker euro will restore momentum and break the deflationary pressures.That policy, along with the fall in energy prices, appears to be giving a push to a recovery in the region.The eurozone economy grew at a 1.6 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, sharply outpacing the United States economy, which contracted.Deflationary pressures are a concern to policy makers across the globe. Some analysts expect that the Federal Reserve, for instance, may hold off until late this year on its expected campaign to raise interest rates, until United States growth moves to firmer footing and prices begin to rise.A report on Tuesday from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the group of 34 industrialized nations, showed that consumer prices in the group rose just 0.4 percent in April from a year earlier.Advertisement
