Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide said on Wednesday that it was considering a sale of itself, months after the company unexpectedly replaced its chief executive and announced a spinoff of its time-share business.In a statement, the hotelier said that it had hired Lazard to advise it on a potential sale or other strategic alternatives.“Our board has always been focused on maximizing long-term shareholder value, and this is a time of enormous opportunity and change in our industry,” Bruce W. Duncan, the company’s chairman, said in a statement. “No option is off the table, and we will take the time we need to thoroughly evaluate our opportunities and achieve the best result for our shareholders, business partners and associates.”Shares of the hotel company were up nearly 8 percent in midmorning trading on Wednesday, at $87.01.The move is somewhat unsurprising, given recent changes at Starwood. In February, the company said that its then-chief executive, Frits van Paasschen, had resigned, replacing him on an interim basis with a director, Adam Aron.The departure of Mr. van Paasschen came amid pressure over lower-than-expected growth.It also comes after Starwood agreed to split its time-share division into a separate publicly traded company, becoming the latest corporation to break itself up.Separately on Wednesday, Starwood said that it earned $99 million in its first quarter, down 27 percent from the same time last year. Excluding items like restructuring charges, the company’s earnings per share amounted to 65 cents, meeting analyst expectations.A version of this article appears in print on April 30, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Starwood Up for Sale.
