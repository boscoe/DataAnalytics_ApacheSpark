The chief executive and chairman of JPMorgan Chase says that interest rates should rise "as long as the American economy is chugging along."JPMorgan Chase said on Thursday that its revenue and profit were up modestly in the fourth quarter of 2015, despite weakness in its global trading business.The bank, America’s largest, earned $5.4 billion, or $1.32 a share, in the fourth quarter, up 10 percent from the quarter a year earlier, but down from the third quarter of 2015. The results were better than the expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had forecast profit of $1.25 a share.Much of the improvement in profit came from continuing cuts to the bank’s expenses and work force, which the bank has pushed aggressively in an era of higher regulations and relatively slow growth.“We’re very happy with our expense story for the year,” the bank’s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with analysts on Thursday.AdvertisementShares of JPMorgan closed up 1.5 percent, at $58.20.One area of weakness was lending to oil and energy companies, as a result of the falling price of oil. JPMorgan put more than $100 million aside in the fourth quarter to cover losses in the area and said it would need to put more aside if oil prices stayed low.AdvertisementThe company’s Wall Street operations were helped by lower legal costs. However, revenue shrank at nearly all of the underlying trading and investment banking businesses. Investors have been shying away from taking risks as global growth has stuttered, particularly as a result of the slowdown in China, and interest rates have begun to move up in the United States.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            “You have a big change in the world out there — people are getting adjusted to China slowing down,” the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said in the call with analysts.JPMorgan is the first of the big banks to report fourth-quarter results. Citigroup and Wells Fargo will report on Friday.JPMorgan’s results were largely in line for predictions of a relatively sluggish quarter for the banking industry. For the big banks, results have been driven mostly by cost cuts rather than business growth.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For the year, however, revenue fell 1 percent.Still, the relatively good final quarter brought the company’s profit for the year to a record $24.4 billion.The bank’s results point to some strength in the American economy. Core lending grew 16 percent from the final quarter of 2014.“We think that the U.S. economy looks pretty good at this point,” Mr. Dimon said.The results indicate that annual bonuses for 2015 will probably be lower than the previous year. In the Wall Street division, the amount set aside for compensation in 2015 fell 5 percent, while in the much larger consumer bank it fell 7 percent.One of JPMorgan’s more significant announcements on Thursday was that it brought down a regulatory surcharge imposed on the country’s biggest banks: the so-called global systemically important bank surcharge. The bank had initially faced the highest G.S.I.B. surcharge of any American bank, but the bank said it believed it had lowered that by two notches — to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent — by reducing certain types of deposits and assets.A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Cost-Cutting Helps Lift Profit 10% at JPMorgan Chase.
