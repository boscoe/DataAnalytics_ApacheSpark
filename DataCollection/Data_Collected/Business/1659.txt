While a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, the index remains above 43.1, which is associated with a recession.Factory activity has also been undercut by business efforts to reduce an excessive inventory build, which is putting pressure on new orders. The institute said a gauge of new orders tumbled 4 percentage points, to 48.9, last month.Inventories at manufacturers continued to shrink, and their customers reported stocks of unsold goods were too high for a fourth consecutive month.Ten out of 18 manufacturing industries, including apparel, electrical equipment, appliances and components, and computer and electronic products reported contraction in November.Manufacturers cited dollar strength, slower Chinese and European growth and lower oil prices as headwinds. Recent data on business capital spending plans and factory output had offered hope that the worst of the sector’s woes were over.But with auto sales and construction spending remaining robust early in the fourth quarter, economists still expect gross domestic product to expand at around a 2 percent annual pace, almost matching the third-quarter pace.“The good news is that the much more important services sector continues to do very well, benefiting from solid domestic demand,” said Harm Bandholz, chief United States economist at UniCredit Research in New York.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.11 trillion rate, the highest level since December 2007, after rising 0.6 percent in September.Construction outlays were up 13 percent compared with October of last year. Spending in October was buoyed by a 0.8 percent rise in private spending, which touched its highest level since January 2008. Outlays on private residential construction hit their highest level since December 2007.Investment in private nonresidential construction projects rose 0.6 percent, to a near seven-year high, with spending on manufacturing plants rising a robust 3 percent.Public construction outlays jumped 1.4 percent to a five-year high as a surge in federal government spending offset a dip in investment by state and local government.“Despite the free-fall in oil patch activity, total construction in the rest of the economy is doing quite well,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.Advertisement
