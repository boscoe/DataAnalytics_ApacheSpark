A simpler explanation for the “Brexit”/Donald Trump phenomenon is that our zeal to consume at the lowest prices possible (i.e., efficiency) can jeopardize some kinds of jobs via outsourcing and technological substitution.The appeal of Brexit and Mr. Trump is their claimed promise of job security, all the while being completely silent on the resulting inefficiency. The reality is that protectionism is always a fleeting promise; not only does it tend toward inefficiency, it also brings no guarantee that your specific job will be protected when the music stops.Paul E.
