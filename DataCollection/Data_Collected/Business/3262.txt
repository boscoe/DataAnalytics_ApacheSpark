DETROIT —  Fiat Chrysler reported that profit for its American division fell 56 percent in 2014, mostly because of charges related to the merger of the Italian automaker Fiat and the former Chrysler.The company said on Tuesday that its United States unit had net income for the year of $1.2 billion, compared with $2.76 billion the previous year. The decrease was caused, in part, by charges of $1.17 billion to extinguish debt and make payments to the United Automobile Workers union for stock it owned in Chrysler as part of its government bailout in 2009. Also, the division benefited from nearly $1 billion in favorable tax adjustments during 2013, further widening the year-over-year decline in profits.Worldwide vehicle sales also increased 15 percent to 2.8 million cars and trucks, up from 2.4 million the previous year.The one-time charges and gains damped what otherwise was a year of exceptional growth for the Chrysler side of the company. The division reported revenue of $83.1 billion, a 15 percent increase from $72.1 billion in 2013.AdvertisementThe division also increased its share of the American market to 12.4 percent, compared to 11.4 percent in 2013. The surge was propelled by big demand for Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups, as well as improved sales of cars.Profit slipped in the fourth quarter because of charges and the tax benefits accrued in the period a year earlier. The division reported net income of $669 million during the quarter, compared with $1.62 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenue increased to $23 billion during the quarter, up from $21.2 billion in the previous year.AdvertisementThe Chrysler side of the company has provided the bulk of the profit to Fiat Chrysler in recent years, and that trend is expected to continue this year. The American division is not only introducing anticipated new products like the compact Jeep Renegade S.U.V. this year, it also is expanding the lineup of the Fiat brand in the United States and reintroducing Alfa Romeo to the market.A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fiat Chrysler Profit in U.S. Declined 56% in 2014 on Charges From Merger.
