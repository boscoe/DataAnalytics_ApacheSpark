The rise in the popularity of streaming music has prompted some prominent names to enter the competition. The Jay Z venture Tidal, Google Play and, most recently, Apple Music are the latest paid services for streaming songs, creating serious competition for companies like Pandora and Spotify.Ranging in price from free to $19.99 a month, different streaming services offer varying levels of control to the user — from customizable radio stations to on-demand listening, in which users can pick the exact song they want to hear. Some services require listeners to be connected to cellular data or Wi-Fi, while others allow them to save songs to their devices for listening offline in places like airplanes and the subway.Here’s a comparison of how some of the most popular streaming music services stack up against one another in terms of catalog size, cost, advertising and more.Cost: Subscriptions are $9.99 a month, or $14.99 for a family account.Users: 11 million subscribers as of February 2016.Catalog: More than 30 million songs.What you get: Users with free accounts have access to Beats 1, an Internet radio station.
