"Somebody's going to make a lot of money," says James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, discussing oil prices, bank layoffs and the Chinese economy.Morgan Stanley swung from a loss to a better-than-expected profit in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago — at the same time that it announced a new strategic plan for improving profitability even more.The Wall Street bank said on Tuesday that during the final quarter of 2015 it earned $753 million, or 39 cents a share, up from a loss of $1.75 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected profit of 33 cents a share. Morgan Stanley’s revenue of $7.7 billion in the quarter was also slightly higher than analysts had expected.Its wealth management and Wall Street divisions both performed largely in line with results from recent quarters.AdvertisementAs has been the case at several other banks struggling with new regulations and market turmoil, Morgan Stanley’s improving profits were driven largely by expense cuts. For all of 2015, the bank increased its revenue by 3 percent and cut its expenses by 13 percent.AdvertisementBut it was Morgan Stanley’s big plans for the future that investors and analysts were paying the most attention to Tuesday morning. The firm’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, outlined several steps the bank is taking to cut expenses and increase profits over the next two years.“Further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary,” Mr. Gorman said in a call with analysts Tuesday morning.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            “Now our entire focus is on driving results,” he added.The initial investor response appeared to be relatively favorable.Shares of Morgan Stanley rose about 1 percent on Tuesday, after falling more than 25 percent since the beginning of December.The bank has been particularly hurt in recent years by the size of its fixed-income business — the unit that trades bonds, commodities and currencies. The business has been a major reason that a key measure of the bank’s profitability — its return on equity — has not met expectations.While Mr. Gorman has aimed at getting the company’s return on equity to 10 percent, in 2015 it was 8.5 percent, according to the latest results.Last month, the bank announced that it was laying off a quarter of its fixed-income staff, and this month Mr. Gorman made several changes in the top management ranks.AdvertisementTuesday morning, Mr. Gorman said that the recent cuts had eliminated several trading desks outside the United States that were not performing — including those that traded base metals and smaller currencies.Mr. Gorman’s goal is for the fixed-income operation to require much less of the expensive regulatory capital that has made the business such a drag on Morgan Stanley’s overall profitability.Mr. Gorman’s plans to increase profits notably do not call for any growth in revenue over the next few years.Beyond fixed income, Mr. Gorman described something called “Project Streamline,” which will reduce expenses, in large part by moving jobs away from more expensive locations like New York.“We have too many entities, too much duplication of operations and processes and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower-cost centers,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Regulators have not always approved such expenditures in the past.Mr. Gorman said he was hopeful that regulators would recognize the efforts Morgan Stanley was making to reshape its business.“I do think our strategy is pretty clear,“ he said, adding it was “certainly consistent with where the regulatory push has been.”A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Its Profit Rising, Morgan Stanley Charts a New Course.
