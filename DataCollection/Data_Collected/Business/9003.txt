CORFU, Greece — In the running debate over how to revive the Greek economy, there is one thing that locals and foreigners can agree on: The airport on this resort island, like many others in tourist-dependent Greece, does not befit a eurozone country.The big, divisive question is whether the Greek government will be willing and able to hand over management of Corfu and many of the country’s other busiest airports to outside professional management, as part of Greece’s economic makeover.The dispute is shaping up as an early test of the viability of Greece’s new $97 billion bailout program, which demands the privatization of many state-run assets — including management of the airports. Whatever the outcome of the Greek national election next Sunday, challenges like Corfu will await the new government.The airports could also become a barometer of whether the new Greek government will be capable of fulfilling any of the program’s tough conditions, which include either selling or transferring management of state assets like railroads and seaports. The bailout program requires these conditions as a way to repair Greek government finances and spur economic growth.AdvertisementPrime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to the bailout conditions before he called for the coming election, which he hopes will consolidate his authority and marginalize the most left-wing dissidents in his Syriza party.AdvertisementAt Corfu, the airport’s shortcomings include a runway that ends so close to a public highway that the air traffic controller must switch on a stoplight during takeoffs to halt traffic. Otherwise, the cars can be buffeted by turbulence, or startled drivers might veer off the road.Inside the terminal, the luggage conveyors frequently break down. The rusting restroom fixtures rarely work, and some toilets lack seats. On summer weekends, when charter flights carry thousands of vacationers to and from cities like Birmingham, England, or Brussels, the overflow can force passengers to wait outside under the broiling Mediterranean sun.“The first and last picture of any island is the airport,” said Dimitris Diavatis, who owns two hotels on Corfu. “If people are waiting in the sun, that is going to destroy the good picture from their one or two weeks here.”Air traffic controllers, meanwhile, see a variety of safety concerns, as the government’s debt problems have for years deprived many Greek airports of sufficient money for maintenance and modernization. One exception is the Athens airport, which has already been partly privatized and generally lives up to its role as a modern international hub.But there is little agreement on how best to bring Corfu up to modern standards, along with more than a dozen other airports now owned and managed by the government.The other eurozone countries are demanding that the government turn over airport management to Fraport, the company that runs the Frankfurt Airport and airports in eight other countries, including those in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Lima, Peru. But many Greeks, including the local government on Corfu, see that as an imperialistic incursion and are vowing to resist with all means necessary, including lawsuits and strikes.That the airport contractor in question comes from Germany, which many Greeks consider their chief antagonist among eurozone creditors, only adds to the tensions. For many Greeks, the airports deal is symbolic of their broader concerns about the bailout: They fear that the government is surrendering vital national assets at an extreme discount to Germans intent on forcing the country into economic subjugation.Advertisement“What they didn’t manage in World War II they are managing now,” Kostas Nikolouzos, the left-wing mayor of Corfu, said of Germany, voicing a common sentiment. “It may sound extreme, but it’s true.”Fraport and a Greek partner, the Copelouzos Group, won a bid last year to take over management of 14 Greek airports, including those in Corfu and popular tourist destinations like Mykonos, Santorini, Rhodes and Kos. Most of the airports are on islands, but the deal also includes the airport at Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city.Fraport and Copelouzos agreed to pay 1.2 billion euros, about $1.4 billion, as well as a share of future profits, for a 40-year lease.But the agreement has yet to go into force — initially because the Tsipras government demanded new conditions after it came to power in January. More recently, though, since Greece and its eurozone creditors agreed in July to the country’s third bailout since 2010, Fraport has sought to reopen discussion about the terms.Some Greeks consider Fraport’s partnership with Copelouzos Group a perpetuation of the dominance of Greek oligarchs over the country’s economy. The company’s founder, Dimitrios Copelouzos, is one of the country’s wealthiest people and the main supplier of Russian natural gas to Greece.Mr. Nikolouzos, the Corfu mayor and a member of Syriza, said the deal would give Fraport a stranglehold over Corfu’s economic lifeline.“We are a place totally dependent on tourism,” Mr. Nikolouzos said in his office in a villa that serves as city hall. “Airports belong to the strategic infrastructure of the country.”
            The resort island of Corfu, like much of the Greek economy, relies on tourism.

But part of the rationale of the privatization program is to transfer management of crucial assets to private companies with more international experience and more money to spend on improvements.AdvertisementThe public officials now in charge of many of the airports often show little entrepreneurial drive, critics say. While most modern airports have become de facto shopping malls, the Corfu airport has only a small duty-free outlet and two souvenir shops selling stuffed animals and “I Love Corfu” refrigerator magnets.More profit-oriented management, critics say, would create jobs on Corfu and other islands, helping to address Greece’s staggering unemployment rate — 25.2 percent, by far the highest jobless figure in the eurozone.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But it would clearly welcome more professional airport management.“What we want is for the airports to be functioning efficiently,” said Spiros Rolakis, the union president. “If the state can provide that — which they can’t — or a private operator, the result is what matters.”Recently Serafim Petrou, the union’s secretary, took visitors on a tour of the control center for all of Greek airspace, a region reaching east to Cyprus and south to North Africa.The large control room, in an otherwise abandoned airport on the outskirts of Athens, looked clean and modern. The controllers, mostly young women wearing headsets, stared at large screens, speaking in clipped tones to pilots.But Mr. Petrou said the computer technology dated from the 1990s, and had been under extra strain recently because the conflict in Ukraine had forced many flights to take routes further south, over Greece. “This is an exhausted system,” Mr. Petrou said.One problem, Mr. Petrou and others said, is that landing fees paid by airlines have not been reinvested in the airports. In 2001, the Greek government pledged receipts for landing fees to investors in return for cash upfront. The deal was one of several that helped Greece hide the true size of its debt burden, but later pushed the government close to bankruptcy.AdvertisementOpponents of the Fraport takeover say that landing fees, about €25 million a year in Corfu, would be plenty to make needed improvements, if only airports had access to the money.Fraport’s experience in neighboring Bulgaria might offer clues to how the company might operate in Greece. After taking over two Bulgarian airports at the end of 2006, Fraport made substantial improvements to facilities in the Black Sea resorts of Varna and Burgas.New terminals opened in 2013, with much faster baggage handling, modern restaurants and shops, and roomier arrival and departure areas. Passenger traffic to Varna and Burgas has risen by a total of 500,000 passengers since 2007, to 3.9 million last year.“The management of the two airports is much better, which has helped bring more passengers,” said Blagoi Ragin, chairman of the Bulgarian Hotel and Restaurant Association.Still, Fraport faced criticism in Bulgaria for running the airports in a joint venture with TIM, a powerful Bulgarian conglomerate whose activities include transportation, banking and insurance. In a 2005 cable by the United States Embassy in Sofia, published by WikiLeaks, diplomats wrote that they believed TIM was involved with organized crime.TIM, which has never been found guilty of any wrongdoing, declined to comment.In Germany, Greeks’ resistance to the takeover of the airports by Fraport is seen as an example of Greek pride taking precedence over economic logic.“It’s a win-win situation,” said Frank Kaufmann, a member of the State Parliament in Hesse, which owns a 31 percent stake in Fraport. The deal “is more help than exploitation, from our point of view.”AdvertisementBut Giorgos Mavronas, head of the union that represents Corfu airport workers, said he worried that Fraport would have too much market power and could use it to play islands off one another to get what it wants.“If this goes forward it will be an unprecedented monopoly,” he said recently, sipping a soft drink at a cafe at the edge of Corfu’s old town, which was packed with tourists as dusk fell. “There is no other case in the world where the 14 most important airports are controlled by one company.”“We intend to organize strikes,” Mr. Mavronas said.Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting from Corfu, and Boryana Dzhambazova from Sofia, Bulgaria.A version of this article appears in print on September 19, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Ailing Greek Airport Poses Test for Bailout Plan.
