The new recall covers cars from the 2013 to 2015 model years including 846,000 in the United States that were made at factories in Smyrna, Tenn., and Canton, Miss., Nissan said in documents posted on Friday on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website. Nissan says paint can flake off the latch, exposing bare metal. Over time, the latches can rust and cause the secondary hood latch to remain open. If the main latch is not closed and the car is driven, the secondary latch may not hold down the hood. A Nissan spokesman, Steve Yaeger, said the company had no reports of any crashes or injuries.
