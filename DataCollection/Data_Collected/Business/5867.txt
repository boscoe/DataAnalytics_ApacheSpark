SAN DIEGO —  The publisher of The Los Angeles Times said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy U-T San Diego for $85 million, deepening its hold in Southern California and putting the top newspapers in the state’s two largest cities under common ownership.Tribune Publishing, owner of The Times, Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun, said U-T, which stands for the Union-Tribune, would remain a separate newspaper. Executives were examining how operations might be consolidated, with one possibility being that The Times would print the San Diego paper.“We’re combining two of the most enduring institutions in California,” said Austin Beutner, the Times’s publisher and chief.Douglas Manchester, a prominent San Diego developer who bought U-T in 2011 for about $110 million, will keep its headquarters in the Mission Valley area.Mr. Beutner will be publisher of both papers and chief executive of Tribune Publishing’s California News Group, which will oversee operations in both markets. U-T said Jeff Light, its president and editor, would remain at the San Diego paper.Mr. Manchester will receive $73 million cash and $12 million in Tribune Publishing stock, the newspapers said.A version of this article appears in print on May 8, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Tribune Buys U-T San Diego.
