The fraud office has said the conspiracy took place from February to December 2009.Mr. Cryan entered his plea at a hearing at Southwark Crown Court in London on Friday.In November, Tullett Prebon said it was facing a separate inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain into suspected “wash” trades by two former employees, one of whom is Mr. Cryan. Wash trades are transactions that are considered risk free and conducted simply to generate commissions.Mr. Cryan was dismissed by Tullett Prebon in 2013 and has since sued the company.Tullett Prebon has said it is cooperating with the regulatory inquiries.Mr. Cryan is the 13th former employee of a bank or brokerage firm to face criminal charges in Britain related to the manipulation of Libor, one of the main rates used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans. The authorities in the United States have also brought criminal charges against several of the people charged in Britain.The first criminal trial in the inquiry is expected to begin in Britain in May.Since it first emerged publicly in 2012, the Libor scandal has engulfed some of the world’s largest banks and tarnished the reputations of many of Britain’s leading lenders.British prosecutors and the Serious Fraud Office have said they have identified as many as 22 people who were potentially involved, but they have named only the 13 people who were criminally charged.The resulting scandal has also set off a call for changes in how other benchmarks are set, including the rates for currencies and precious metals.To set Libor and other rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities.Advertisement
