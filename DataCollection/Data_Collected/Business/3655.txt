TOKYO — Japan’s latest recession was as short as it was unexpected.The Japanese economy, the world’s third-largest, started expanding again at the end of 2014, government data showed Monday, after a painful midyear slump that had raised doubts about Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s efforts to rekindle growth and end entrenched deflation.The latest in what seem like countless Japanese downturns — there have been six since 1997 — lasted just two quarters, the shortest technical definition of a recession. Yet the return to growth was more tepid than experts had predicted and may fail to erase concerns that the economy remains fundamentally fragile, despite Mr. Abe’s two-year stimulus campaign.“The economy has escaped the worst phase and is recovering, but the pace is likely to remain extremely slow,” said Yasunari Ueno, an economist at Mizuho Securities, a Japanese brokerage firm.In the preliminary report, the Cabinet Office said gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 2.2 percent in the quarter through December. Economists surveyed by news agencies had been more optimistic, forecasting an expansion of 3.7 percent, on average.AdvertisementSince he returned to power at the end of 2012, Mr. Abe has been trying to inject life into the economy through a set of pro-growth policies known as Abenomics. Much of the work has been carried out by the Bank of Japan, the central bank, which is creating money on a vast scale by buying government bonds and other assets.AdvertisementThe economy did not grow at all in 2014, according to the Monday report, with two quarters of recession — widely attributed to an ill-timed increase in the national sales tax — almost exactly canceling out two quarters of expansion. Growth in the two years since Mr. Abe began his campaign has added up to a modest 1.6 percent, slightly less than the 1.8 rate recorded in 2012, the year before he took office.Economists say 2015 could be a more forgiving year for his program of reforms. Mr. Abe has postponed a second increase in the sales tax, which had been planned for October, hoping to avoid a fresh blow to consumer confidence. And a weaker yen has begun to spur domestic manufacturing by increasing demand for exports from Japan.Tourism, too, is booming, as once-prohibitively expensive Japanese cities start to look cheap to travelers from countries with stronger currencies.“Consumer confidence appears to be improving, and looking ahead I think we can be hopeful,” the economics minister, Akira Amari, said at a news conference after the economic growth report.Cheaper oil is also working in Japan’s favor, with one drawback. The slide in oil prices since the middle of last year has lowered costs for households and businesses in an economy that largely depends on imported energy. But it is threatening another goal of Abenomics: that of keeping consumer prices rising modestly, instead of falling, as they have done for much of the last two decades.
            The Japanese economy rebounded in the final quarter of 2014 from its third recession since 2010.

At 80 trillion yen a year, or close to $700 billion, it is already uncomfortably large for some on the bank’s policy board. Yet letting prices fall again could have even worse consequences for the economy.The bank’s measures are keeping borrowing costs extremely low — an invitation for more spending and investment. They are also holding down the yen’s exchange rate, which helps big manufacturing companies like Toyota and Hitachi that sell large quantities of their products in foreign markets. The stock market is up, and corporate profits are at record highs.AdvertisementOn Monday, the Nikkei 225-share average rose 0.51 percent after the growth report, which was released just before trading began, while the yen fell slightly against the dollar.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The long-planned increase in the sales tax, carried out in April, hit consumers harder than the government and most economists had expected, calling the effectiveness of Mr. Abe’s stimulus policies into question. Wages are still falling, adjusted for inflation, and many workers feel left out.Consumer spending and business investment grew fractionally in the quarter to December, Monday’s report showed, while exports increased at their fastest pace since early 2014. But housing investment continued a decline that began after the tax increase in April.Many economists are forecasting that growth will settle into a slow but still positive trend, expanding perhaps 1.5 or 2 percent this year and next.“Going forward, we expect the Japanese economy to trace a moderate recovery path,” said Naohiko Baba, the chief Japan economist at Goldman Sachs.Where, precisely, that path leads could be determined by the result of annual wage negotiations between unions and large corporations, known as shunto — “spring battle” — which reach their peak in March. Mr. Abe has been pressing business leaders to divert more of their ever-increasing cash reserves back into the economy by investing and raising workers’ pay.By doing so, the prime minister may hope to reverse a growing perception that Abenomics is widening the wealth gap in a society that has long regarded itself as egalitarian. Mr. Abe’s policies have helped lift the prices of assets like stocks and property, owned disproportionately by the well-off. He also wants to lower regulatory barriers and loosen legal protections on job security — measures that supporters say will make Japan more competitive but which make many workers nervous.Competing visions for Japan’s economic future were on display in Parliament on Monday in an exchange between Mr. Abe and Katsuya Okada, leader of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. “I want to do my utmost to move toward a society where effort is rewarded,” Mr. Abe said when challenged by Mr. Okada about the effects of Abenomics on equality.Mr. Okada replied: “The biggest problem with the government’s economic policies is that there is no consideration of how the fruits of growth will be distributed.”A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2015, in The International New York Times.
