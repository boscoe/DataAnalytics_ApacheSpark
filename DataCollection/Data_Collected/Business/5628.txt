It requests documents from 1999 through the present relating to the ET-Plus and its predecessor, the ET 2000, Trinity said in a Securities and Exchange Commis sionfiling.It said it “intends to co- operate” with the request.At least five witnesses have been interviewed by federal investigators, and at least one other subpoena for documents had previously been issued, people familiar with the matter said.Advertisement
