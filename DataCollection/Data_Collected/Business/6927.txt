ConAgra Foods’ smorgasbord is ready to carve. The conglomerate’s $6.8 billion acquisition of Ralcorp in 2013 left a bad taste with shareholders. The activist investor Jana Partners is ready to shake up the board. ConAgra’s myriad brands probably fit better elsewhere. The question is how to slice it.The $17 billion packaged-food group’s shares jumped after Barry Rosenstein’s hedge fund on Thursday disclosed a 7.2 percent stake and announced that it was prepared to nominate three new directors. Jana hasn’t said what more should be done but seemingly believes ConAgra hasn’t adequately addressed the losses from its deal for Ralcorp, the maker of white-label goods. ConAgra recorded a write-down on the value of its private-label business of $1.3 billion in March, the third time it has taken a charge on the division since buying Ralcorp.ConAgra’s chief executive, Gary M. Rodkin, stepped down in April, a month ahead of his planned retirement. His replacement, Sean M. Connolly, has yet to announce his plans. But the former boss of Hillshire Brands clearly isn’t deal-averse. He attracted a bidding war for the purveyor of Ball Park frankfurters and Jimmy Dean sausages, and eventually sold it to Tyson Foods last year for $7.7 billion.There may be some appetite for ConAgra’s various morsels. Analysts at Credit Suisse estimate that the various parts — including branded and frozen foods, private-label goods and another division that sells French fries to fast-food chains — could be worth $42 to $43 a share in a full breakup. The rise in ConAgra’s shares on Friday put them right in that zone.Pulling apart all the various pieces could be complicated, however. TreeHouse Foods has said it is on the hunt for acquisitions. The rival private-label company only has a market value of $3 billion, however, which suggests that it might require some financial contortions — perhaps a reverse Morris Trust — to make a deal work with ConAgra. It also might be hard to wring additional value from offloading frozen foods and taters to the likes of Pinnacle Foods, or even Tyson.Even so, there may be many ways to chop ConAgra. With Jana now involved, there will be pressure to put all options on the table.Kevin Allison is a columnist at Reuters Breakingviews.
