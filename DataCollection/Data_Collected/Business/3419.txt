AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersSHANGHAI — China’s trade performance slumped in January, with exports falling 3.3 percent from year-earlier levels, while imports tumbled 19.9 percent, far worse than analysts had expected.Largely as a result of the sharply lower imports — particularly of coal, oil and commodities — China posted a record monthly trade surplus of $60 billion.The data contrasted sharply with a Reuters poll that showed analysts had expected exports to gain 6.3 percent and the slowdown in imports to be at 3 percent, following a better-than-expected showing in December. The poll had forecast a trade surplus of $48.9 billion.The slide in imports is the sharpest since May 2009, when Chinese factories were still slashing inventories in reaction to the global financial crisis. Exports have not produced a negative annual reading since March 2014.The dismal trade performance will increase concerns that an economic slowdown in China — originally considered a desirable adjustment away from an investment-intensive export model toward one based on domestic consumption — is at risk of derailing. The government is expected to lower its G.D.P. target to about 7 percent this year, after posting 7.4 percent in 2014 — the slowest pace in 24 years.Chinese economic indicators in January and February are typically viewed with caution, given the distortions caused by the shifting weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, and while the median estimate of analysts was for a rise, the range of estimates was extremely wide.However, the figures — in particular the import data — are worrisome even after accounting for cyclical factors; last year the Lunar New Year holiday idled factories and financial markets for a week in January, but this year the holiday comes in late February and January was a full month of business as usual.Andrew Polk, economist at the Conference Board in Beijing, noted that exports tended to be less affected by the holiday than other indicators but added that he was more concerned by the implications of the startlingly negative import figure.“The import data suggests a substantial slowdown in the industrial sector,” Mr. Polk said. “The first quarter looks to be pretty horrible.” Investors had hoped that the announcement of domestic stimulus spending plans, combined with moves to ease monetary policy, including a reduction in banks’ reserve requirement ratios on Wednesday, would restore confidence and increase demand in China’s struggling manufacturing sector. Chinese imports have fallen every month since October, which is seen as reflecting weak domestic demand, and the scale of January’s drop was mostly caused by a fall in import volumes of major commodities. For example, coal imports dropped nearly 40 percent to 16.78 million tons, down from December’s 27.22 million tons, and China also appeared to cut back on its strategic stocking of crude oil imports, which slid 7.9 percent in volume terms.Imports from Australia and the Russian Federation, both major fuel and commodity suppliers, slid 35.3 percent and 28.7 percent, respectively.Advertisement
