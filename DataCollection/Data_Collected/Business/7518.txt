The Treasury Department says the surplus in June totaled $51.8 billion, compared with a surplus of $70.5 billion a year ago. The larger surplus last year was caused by a timing quirk that put June benefit payments into May. For the current budget year, the government is running a deficit of $313.4 billion, a 14.3 percent reduction from the imbalance over the first nine months of the previous budget year. The Congressional Budget Office is forecasting that the deficit for the entire budget year will be $486 billion, about the same as last year. So far this year, government receipts total $2.45 trillion, 8.3 percent higher than in the first nine months of the 2014 budget year. Government outlays total $2.76 trillion through June, 5.1 percent higher than in the previous year. The 2014 deficit was down from $680.2 billion in 2013. Before then, the United States had recorded four straight years of annual deficits topping $1 trillion. These drove the national debt higher; it stands at $18.1 trillion, right below the current debt limit. Private economists have estimated that the government continue operating until October or November, when it faces the prospect of default or a government shutdown if the debt limit is not raised.
