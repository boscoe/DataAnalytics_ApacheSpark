LONDON — The food giant Nestlé said on Wednesday that it had entered exclusive negotiations to sell its Davigel frozen foods business to Brakes Group, the British food service provider owned by the private equity firm Bain Capital.In November, Nestlé, the maker of Kit Kat chocolate bars, Nespresso coffee and Purina pet food, said that it was exploring strategic options for Davigel of France, a provider of branded frozen and chilled food and ice cream to hospitals and restaurants.If a deal goes through, it would signal the latest in a series of sales by Nestlé as it reduces its brand offerings to focus on more profitable business lines. The terms of the transaction were not disclosed.“The transaction is subject to consultations with the relevant works councils and the approval of the competition authorities,” Nestlé said in a news release on Wednesday.AdvertisementNestlé has engaged in a series of brand sales since its chief executive, Paul Bulcke, unveiled plans two years ago for the company to divest some of its underperforming business lines.Those sales include the divestiture of its 10 percent stake in Givaudan, the Swiss flavor and fragrance company; the sale of its PowerBar nutrition business to the cereal giant Post Holdings; and the divestiture of its Jenny Craig brand in North America, Australia, New Zealand and parts of the Pacific to a private equity firm, North Castle Partners.AdvertisementIn January, it had agreed to sell its La Cocinera frozen meals business to the Spanish arm of Findus Group, the British frozen food and seafood supplier.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
