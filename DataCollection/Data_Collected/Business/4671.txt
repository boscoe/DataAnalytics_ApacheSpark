United States Steel says it is temporarily idling its plant in Granite City, Ill., putting 2,080 employees out of work. It announced the move on Wednesday, saying it would consolidate its North American flat-rolled operations to match demand. A spokeswoman, Courtney Boone, said the Granite City plant was the primary flat-rolled material supplier to the company’s Texas-based Lone Star Tubular operations, which make tubes and pipes for the oil and gas industry. The layoffs are effective May 28, she said. It is not known how long they will last.A version of this brief appears in print on March 26, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: United States Steel To Close Illinois Plant Temporarily .
