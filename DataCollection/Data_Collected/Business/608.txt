DETROIT —  Nearly three weeks after workers soundly rejected a tentative agreement, voting at several Fiat Chrysler plants showed strong support Wednesday for a new contract that would enable entry-level hires to gain wage parity with veteran employees.Official results for the two-day balloting period, which ended Wednesday night, are not expected until Thursday.But the contract was approved handily at several United Automobile Workers locals, including at least one, Local 1264, that had rejected the earlier tentative deal. The local represents about 2,000 stamping-plant workers in Sterling Heights, Mich.The agreement covers 36,000 hourly workers and about 4,000 salaried workers at Fiat Chrysler. The union will use the ratified pact as a template for final negotiations with Ford Motor and General Motors.AdvertisementMore than 40 percent of Fiat Chrysler workers are entry level. Under the old contract, they earned $16 to $19 hourly, compared with $28 for workers with more seniority. Under the new agreement, those workers will earn about $29 an hour after eight years.The first tentative contract, which was turned down by 65 percent of union members, called for raises that increased the top entry-level wage to $25. Raises for veteran workers will increase their pay to close to $30 hourly.Support for the new deal, which was announced on Oct. 8, averting a strike, was in stark contrast to the initial pact, which had faced mounting opposition.
                Prodded by its union, the auto industry served as the 20th-century trailblazer in spreading prosperity. But the model of a “social contract” has begun to unravel.            “The big thing for me is the clear path to traditional wages, which I think a lot of people were looking for,” said Scott McGinnis, an entry-level assembly plant worker in Sterling Heights who had voted against the previous agreement.At Local 1264, a notice signed by union representatives reported 84 percent of production employees voting approved the pact. That was a sharp swing from the vote on the earlier proposal, which 57 percent of production workers there had rejected.AdvertisementSeventy percent of workers voting at Local 140 in Warren, Mich., approved the latest agreement, along with 89 percent at Local 51 in Detroit.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Some workers had been concerned the component would hurt their benefits.The union president, Dennis Williams, acknowledged after the defeat of the first proposal that union officials needed to make a better effort to help workers understand the terms of the new contract. For example, the health care cooperative, he said, was misunderstood and proved to be a deterrent to winning support.In response, union officials took to social media and other outlets to communicate with members.“I think transparency has been a lot better this time, in terms of communication with the people,” Mr. McGinnis said.Gerald Meyers, visiting professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business and a former chairman and chief executive of American Motors, said the U.A.W. had learned a lot from its members’ rejection of the initial contract proposal.“Apparently, the union did not have a good feel for what had to be delivered to get a favorable vote,” he said, adding that Mr. Williams apparently “did not have a good feel for what the membership would buy.” Mr. Williams was elected U.A.W. president in June 2014.But even with the greater support, some members voted against the new contract.“This is still a divisive contract, because there are separate deals for separate people,” said Melvin Thompson, a veteran worker at the Warren Truck Assembly plant. “Collective bargaining is designed to put us all in the same pot. Here, some people are still doing better than others, and that doesn’t work in our collective best interest.”A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: This Time, Approval Seems Likely in Fiat Chrysler Workers’ Contract Vote.
