The offer would represent a 27 percent premium to Telecity’s closing price on Wednesday, and values Telecity at £2.3 billion.Shares of Telecity had jumped roughly 19 percent to £10.66 in morning trading in London on Thursday.Under its earlier merger agreement with Interxion, Telecity is prohibited from actively seeking alternative proposals, but it is allowed to enter takeover discussions with third parties in limited circumstances.“Having carefully considered the Equinix proposal in the light of this exception, the board of Telecity Group has determined that it is required by virtue of its fiduciary duties to enter into discussions with Equinix and has decided to permit Equinix to undertake a short period of due diligence,” Telecity said in a news release on Thursday.Telecity said there was “no certainty” that a firm offer would be made by Equinix, one of the world’s biggest providers of data centers. Under British takeover rules, Equinix has until June 4 to announce its intention to make a firm offer for the company.Interxion, based in Amsterdam, said on Thursday that it “remains committed” to the Telecity deal. Interxion added that among the regulatory permission needed, it had received approval from the antitrust authorities in Germany, where the two have competing operations.“Interxion continues to believe that the pending merger with Telecity Group is a strategically compelling combination that delivers meaningful value to Interxion and Telecity Group shareholders as well as their customers,” the company said in a news release.Under its proposal, Equinix, based in Redwood City, Calif., would pay 54 percent in cash and 46 percent in its own stock.Equinix said that if the takeover was completed, it would expand its presence in Europe, including adding capacity to its operations in London.Based in London, Telecity operates data centers in 11 countries in Europe.“In addition, the board of Equinix believes that a potential transaction with Telecity Group would create a more compelling combination than the proposed merger with Interxion Holding N.V. and would deliver greater value for Telecity Group shareholders,” Equinix said in a news release.Equinix provides data center services in 33 markets on five continents. Its shares closed up less than one percent at $258.28 on Wednesday on Nasdaq.Advertisement
