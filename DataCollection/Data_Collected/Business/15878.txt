Renesas and Intersil said in a joint news release that their businesses, which are focused on different kinds of chips, would complement each other, though Renesas’ chief executive, Bunsei Kure, told analysts it could be four or five years before the combination translated into higher profits.Renesas is paying a steep price for Intersil. Its accepted offer of $22.50 a share is 14 percent above Intersil’s closing price on Monday and 44 percent more than the company was worth in mid-August, when a Japanese newspaper reported that executives were negotiating a possible deal.“There are technological synergies, but in terms of profit the acquisition price looks high,” said Masahiko Ishino, an industry analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.The turnaround at Renesas is the result of a national effort in Japan to keep a foothold in microchip production, an area in which the country once led the world but has lost ground in recent years. To survive, Renesas has had to shrink: It has cut its Japanese work force by about 40 percent and turned abroad for new business.Renesas makes microcontrollers, or chips that work like tiny computers and are embedded in products as varied as televisions and cars, where they control functions like power steering and windshield wipers. Many of its customers are in the automobile industry. When its factory in northeastern Japan was badly damaged by the 2011, magnitude-9.0 earthquake, auto plants from Japan to the United States had to curtail production because of supply shortages.Intersil specializes in chips that manage the power supply in electronic devices, and in so-called analog chips, which capture information from things like light and sound and turn them into digital signals.Renesas was already struggling when the earthquake battered its factory, causing it to shut down for months. The company was created in a series of spinoffs and mergers in the 2000s that combined the unprofitable microchip operations of three larger Japanese companies, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and NEC.Since the quake, it has cut some 15,000 jobs, a slow and expensive process in Japan, where the legal system shields workers from layoffs. A government-backed investment fund, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, and others stepped in with a 180 billion yen rescue in 2012. The fund now controls about 70 percent of the company.Follow Jonathan Soble on Twitter @jonathan_soble.Advertisement
