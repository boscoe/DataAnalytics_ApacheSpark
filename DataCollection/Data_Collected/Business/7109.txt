Since General Motors began recalling 2.6 million older small cars with defective ignition switches last year, federal regulators have been criticized for their failure to thoroughly investigate the problem despite receiving clear warnings from vehicle owners.Now, there are signs that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, under a new administrator, Mark R. Rosekind, is quicker to look into potential defects based on owner complaints.The agency recently opened five investigations into vehicles made by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and Mazda after receiving complaints from worried owners about problems with brakes, airbags and anti-collision systems. In one case, the investigation begun after the agency received six complaints on its website.An investigation can often lead to a recall.The largest inquiry involves about 630,000 Jeep Wranglers from the 2007-12 model years after more than 200 owners complained about the airbag warning light illuminating, indicating the safety device would not work in a crash. There were no reports of accidents.AdvertisementFour years ago, a similar problem resulted in the recall of some 2008-12 Wranglers with right-hand drive. Those vehicles are used for export or postal service.AdvertisementThe second inquiry involves about 54,000 Mazda CX-9 sport utility vehicles from 2007-8, which are being investigated after reports that corrosion on the suspension could allow a wheel to break free.“The passenger front wheel disconnected from the lower control arm, resulting in an immediate loss of control,” the owner of a Mazda CX-9 wrote in a complaint last August. “Fortunately, the vehicle was being driven through a residential area at a low speed.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

There were 18 complaints, but no reports of accidents.If the agency finds the concerns are valid, it will typically upgrade the investigation to an “engineering analysis,” a move that can lead to a recall.A version of this article appears in print on June 27, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Auto Regulator Opens Investigations Into 5 Vehicles.
