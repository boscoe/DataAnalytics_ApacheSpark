The company spun off its construction arm, Orascom Construction, in March.OCI posted revenue from its fertilizer and chemical operations of $2.69 billion in 2014 and had about 3,000 employees at plants in Algeria, Egypt, the Netherlands and the United States.Last year, CF Industries seemed poised to merge with Yara International and create a stronger competitor to Potash Corporation of Canada, the world’s largest fertilizer producer.The merger talks collapsed in October shortly after Yara ousted its chief executive and his intended successor backed out of the job in a matter of days.This month, CF Industries agreed to acquire Yara International’s 50 percent interest in GrowHow, Britain’s largest fertilizer producer, for $580 million.CF Industries was founded as a fertilizer broker in 1946 but later expanded into production. CF posted sales of $4.74 billion in 2014 and had about 2,200 full-time employees.Advertisement
