The bags’ metal casing, or inflater, can rupture, sending shards flying into the passenger cabin. Eight deaths and more than 100 injuries worldwide have been linked to the defect.Kelli Felker, a spokeswoman for Ford, said the company would stop using Takata airbag inflaters that contain ammonium nitrate as a propellant in any products that are under development.Ford’s recalls of vehicles with Takata airbags have affected about 1.5 million cars, including the Mustang from the 2005 through 2015 model years, the 2004 through 2006 Ranger and the 2005 and 2006 GT.Although Ford is not one of Takata’s biggest customers, like Honda or Toyota, its announcement increases pressure on the supplier.Over all, a dozen automakers in the United States have recalled more than 19 million cars with the airbags and millions more have been recalled worldwide. Takata, one of the world’s largest airbag makers, has struggled to keep up with the demand for replacement parts as it has come under financial pressure. Takata declined to comment.This month, federal auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced a $70 million penalty for Takata for not promptly disclosing the defects in its airbags. That fine could increase by as much as $130 million if Takata does not meet the terms of the agreement with the agency, which would make it a record civil punishment for the auto industry.The agreement requires Takata to phase out its use of ammonium nitrate unless it can prove that the compound is safe.
