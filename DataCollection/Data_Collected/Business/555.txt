As in the lawsuit against Barclays, the credit union regulator had alleged that Wachovia, now part of Wells Fargo, had sold faulty mortgage securities to several credit unions, causing them losses during the financial crisis.The N.C.U.A. is pursuing lawsuits in California, Kansas and New York against a number of financial firms, including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS, over the sale of what it claims were faulty securities that caused the collapse of five corporate credit unions.The credit union regulator said in a news release that its litigation against banks over the sale of faulty mortgage securities has recovered more than $2.2 billion, with the proceeds going toward reducing contributions to a fund to cover losses incurred by the five failed credit unions.Like many financial firms, Barclays is facing several lawsuits and regulatory actions about the sale and securitization of mortgages in the United States before the financial crisis.From 2005 to 2008, Barclays sponsored and underwrote about $39 billion in mortgage securitizations in the United States and sold $19.4 billion in loans that were originated and sold to third parties by affiliates of an entity it acquired in 2007, according to a disclosure it issued in July as part of its second-quarter results.The lender said on Monday that it “continues to litigate” several lawsuits related to residential mortgage-backed securities and “to respond to requests from various regulatory and governmental authorities” in the matter.Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement
