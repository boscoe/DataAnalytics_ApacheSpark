Larsen, the DSV chairman, said in a news release. Together, he said, UTi and DSV “will be even stronger and able to capitalize on business synergies as well as a greater global reach to the benefit of shareholders, customers and employees.”UTi Worldwide, based in Long Beach, Calif., provides transport, supply chain and logistics services in 58 countries worldwide. It posted revenue of $3.9 billion in the 12 months ended July 31 and employs about 21,000 people.The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies.The transaction is subject to approval by UTi Worldwide’s shareholders and regulatory approval. It is expected to close in the first quarter.Funds controlled by the hedge fund P2 Capital Partners, UTi Worldwide’s largest shareholder with about 10.8 percent of its shares, have agreed to support the deal.“We are operating in an industry where increasingly scale is critical,” Roger I. MacFarlane, the UTi Worldwide chairman, said in a news release. “Joining forces with DSV delivers substantially greater client value and many future opportunities for our people while it is financially very attractive for our shareholders.”DSV, based in Hedehusene, Denmark, provides transportation and logistics services, including air, sea and road freight transportation, in more than 70 countries.
