Embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals International said on Monday that its accounting related to its relationship with a specialty pharmacy was legal and appropriate, but added that its board was nonetheless forming a special committee to investigate the relationship.Valeant, based in Laval, Quebec, disclosed for the first time last week that it had acquired an option to buy the specialty pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, which dispenses some of Valeant’s dermatology drugs. That alone was controversial because such pharmacies can be used to promote high-priced drugs, and Valeant was already being scrutinized by lawmakers, the news media and federal prosecutors for sharply raising drug prices.Valeant’s stock dropped even more last Wednesday after Citron Research, a stock research firm that tends to bet on shares declining, issued a report saying that Philidor and affiliated pharmacies might have been set up to allow Valeant to record phantom sales to the pharmacies to improve its financial results.Valeant executives on Monday said they had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate Citron, accusing it of making false statements to drive down Valeant’s stock.AdvertisementAndrew Left, who runs Citron, said Valeant’s problems go beyond his report. “They should be more focused on building their business and getting more open disclosure than they are about shooting the messenger,” he said.AdvertisementValeant said in a conference call Monday morning that it did not recognize revenue on products being distributed through Philidor and its affiliated pharmacies until the drugs went to the patients. That made it impossible, they said, to use the pharmacies to “stuff the channel,” meaning to sell products to Philidor to help Valeant’s quarterly results, even if the products were sitting on the shelf at Philidor.“The company I’ve heard described in the press the past week is not one that I recognize,” J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, said, adding that Valeant was “committed to transparency.”Robert Ingram, Valeant’s lead outside director, said in the call that the board had “complete and total faith in Mike Pearson.”But investors were not entirely persuaded, and Valeant shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday, to $110.04, less than half the record high of over $260 they had reached in August.
            The drug company is known for growing through acquisitions and cutting costs.        “For investors there remain several nagging questions around the business practices at Philidor,” analysts at Canaccord Genuity wrote in a note on Monday. While still rating the stock a buy, they lowered their price target, saying the “credibility issue” could take time to “eradicate.”One question is why Valeant did not publicly disclose its relationship with Philidor until last week, even though it had purchased an option to acquire Philidor at the end of 2014. The executives said Philidor was too small to be material to Valeant and that the company viewed Philidor as a competitive advantage it wanted to keep to itself.Also, Mr. Pearson insisted in the call that Philidor mainly acted independently. But The Wall Street Journal, citing former Philidor employees, reported on Monday that even before Valeant purchased the option, Valeant employees had been working at Philidor and using fake names when sending emails.AdvertisementMr. Pearson said that allegation would be investigated by the board committee.The Philidor matter is only one of the challenges facing Valeant, which was once a Wall Street darling. Its shares had soared since Mr. Pearson took over in 2008, with investors enamored of his strategy of largely avoiding research and development and instead buying one drug company after another.But the shares have collapsed since August as politicians and the news media have focused more attention on the striking price increases that Valeant often put into effect on the drugs it obtained through these acquisitions, increases sometimes exceeding several hundred percent.Valeant disclosed recently that it had received subpoenas from federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Massachusetts asking for information about its pricing decisions, distribution of its products, the data it provides to Medicare and Medicaid, and its financial assistance programs for patients.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It said that its Bausch & Lomb eye care business had received a subpoena in September from the Justice Department, regarding the company’s payments and agreements with medical professionals related to its surgical products. It said the subpoena was part of a criminal investigation.Specialty pharmacies, a booming part of the industry, typically dispense complex drugs, like ones requiring refrigeration and injection. The pharmacies often help patients learn how to use the drugs and deal with side effects.But Valeant was using Philidor to dispense common pills and creams for ailments like acne and toenail fungus. The idea apparently is to help sell its products, which are much more expensive than some alternatives.If doctors send prescriptions to Philidor, rather than having patients go to a retail pharmacy, it makes it harder for the pharmacies or insurers to switch the patient to a cheaper generic drug.And Philidor handles trying to get reimbursement with insurers, relieving doctors of the hurdles that might otherwise discourage them from prescribing a high-priced drug. Patient co-payments are also reduced or eliminated, removing another barrier to use of Valeant’s drugs.The strategy is used by some other companies as well, most notably Horizon Pharma. Horizon boasts that its “Prescriptions Made Easy” program, which works through specialty pharmacies, has increased subscriptions of expensive pills to treat pain from arthritis.AdvertisementValeant said that Philidor accounted for 6.8 percent of its overall revenue and about 7 percent of its earnings before interest, taxes and amortization in the third quarter. But for one of its fastest-growing new products, the toenail fungus ointment Jublia, more than 44 percent of revenue went through Philidor in the quarter.Vicki Bryan, an analyst at the bond research firm Gimme Credit, said on Monday that Philidor appeared to have sharply increased sales of several Valeant drugs. “So we have to ask how, then, does tiny Philidor and its murky network of affiliated specialty pharmacies generate such a dramatically strong revenue stream for Valeant?”Valeant executives said their company did not provide money for Philidor to start or to expand. But it did work with the company and achieved good results, and it did not want Philidor to start working extensively with other drug companies.So in December, Valeant paid about $100 million initially for an option to acquire Philidor, whose investors could receive up to $133 million in additional payments, of which $33 million has been paid.Philidor, which is based in Pennsylvania, and apparently named after an 18th-century French chess master, failed to get a license to dispense drugs to residents of California because, the state said, the pharmacy had not been truthful in stating its owners and financial officers.Lawsuits and other information suggest that Philidor then acquired stakes in some California pharmacies that it used to dispense drugs to residents of the state. One of those pharmacies, R&O, has claimed in a lawsuit that it sold a stake in itself to an entity that tried to hide that it was a front for Philidor.Valeant executives said they believed that their company was indemnified from any legal liabilities incurred by Philidor.Mr. Pearson said that after the board committee finishes its review, Valeant would consider all options, including exercising its right to acquire Philidor or severing its relationship with it.A version of this article appears in print on October 27, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Valeant Set to Examine Pharmacy Relationship.
