With investors expecting a weak first quarter for the banks, JPMorgan Chase delivered results that were slightly better than the forecasts.JPMorgan, the first of the major banks to report its financial results for the first three months of the year, said on Wednesday that both revenue and profit slid in the first quarter, from a year earlier, largely as a result of bad conditions in the financial markets.The bank’s overall revenue fell 3 percent from the quarter a year earlier, while profit fell 7 percent. The bank earned $5.2 billion in the first quarter, or $1.35 a share. Analysts had been expecting profit to fall to $1.26 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.“Despite challenging market conditions we delivered really quite good performance in the quarter with diversification allowing us to perform well in difficult environments,” the firm’s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said in a call with investors Wednesday morning.AdvertisementJPMorgan’s success in beating expectations helped push up its stock price 4.2 percent on Wednesday. The stocks of other big banks, which will report their earnings over the next week, also rose.AdvertisementThe first quarter is typically a strong time for global banks, as clients prepare to put their money to use — but this year has not followed that trend because of all the volatility in the global markets.The falling prices of oil and stocks pushed down results in JPMorgan’s Wall Street division. Revenue from both stock and bond trading were down, depressing overall market revenue by 13 percent from a year earlier. The volatile markets also put a damper on mergers and acquisitions. Revenue in that business fell 19 percent.
                It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.            JPMorgan put aside another $529 million to cover for potential losses on loans it has made to oil and natural gas companies, which have been hurt by the falling cost of oil. It put aside another $162 million for metals and mining companies.The numbers looked better in JPMorgan’s consumer bank.Consumers took out more mortgages and credit card loans, suggesting some optimism in the economy. Profit in the consumer division rose 12 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
