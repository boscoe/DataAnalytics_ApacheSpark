The stock market finished the first three months of the year on Tuesday on a down note, erasing much of the gains from Monday’s big rally.The Dow Jones industrial average slumped 200 points, knocking it slightly lower for the year. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the quarter with a meager gain of half a percent.The broad decline came as traders seized on the final day of the quarter to do some profit-taking and prune their portfolios. Health care stocks were among the biggest decliners. Oil prices extended their slide.“It’s the end of the quarter,” said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “Today the markets are probably driven by that quite a bit, because people are rebalancing their portfolios.”AdvertisementThe Dow fell 200.19 points, or 1.1 percent, to 17,776.12. The 30-company index was down as much as 203 points. It is now down 0.3 percent for the year.AdvertisementThe S.&P. 500 index slid 18.35 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,067.89. The index is now up 0.4 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 46.56 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,900.88. It ended the quarter up 3.5 percent.Despite the meager gain, it was the ninth-straight quarter that the S.&P. 500 had risen. The index has had just three other winning stretches that long since World War II.That is good news for bulls because the previous three times the market notched a nine-quarter winning streak, the S.&P. 500 index averaged an increase of 8.1 percent in the 10th quarter.Traders often look to close out positions to make their books look as healthy as possible at the end of a quarter. But other factors contributed to the sell-off.“There’s also rising concern about oil prices, especially as the U.S. gets closer to a deal with Iran,” said Paul Christopher, head of international strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “There’s some speculation that Iran will be able to release a lot of oil into the world.”That could stoke fears of deflation, which can hurt corporate profits, he said.The price of oil fell on Tuesday as talks between the United States and Iran progressed somewhat, which could lead to more crude oil on the global market in the coming months.
