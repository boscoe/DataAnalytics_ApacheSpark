Not long after Baker Hughes and Halliburton announced a merger agreement in November 2014, ValueAct, led by Jeffrey W. Ubben, started acquiring stakes in both energy giants.The prominent hedge fund came up with a plan if the $35 billion deal turned messy: to push the chief executives to do what it took to ensure the deal went through.That strategy (and when ValueAct came up with it) is at the heart of a $19 million antitrust lawsuit filed on Monday by the Justice Department.Regulators require active investors — or those who plan to influence business decisions of management teams — to alert the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department and wait for a period of time before acquiring securities above a certain threshold. Passive investments below 10 percent of a company are exempt from these filings.AdvertisementThe line between passive and active can be murky, especially for a firm that calls itself an activist investor.AdvertisementUpon acquiring about $2.5 billion worth of stock in both Baker Hughes and Halliburton, ValueAct failed to notify regulators, violating the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, the government said in the complaint. The purpose of the act is to give regulators a chance to block any investment that might thwart competition.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

From December 2014 to January 2016, ValueAct met with senior management at both companies more than 15 times, according to the complaint. In emails, executives at ValueAct wrote about owning both stocks to “drive new terms to get the deal done.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
