The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said Samsung did not infringe upon Apple’s “quick links” patent, and that two other patents covering the iPhone’s slide-to-unlock and auto-correct features were invalid. The court also said that Apple was liable for infringing on one of Samsung’s patents. Apple and Samsung declined to comment. In December, Samsung paid Apple $548.2 million stemming from a separate patent case, which Samsung has appealed to the United States Supreme Court.Advertisement
