It is unclear if the network has plans to give Mr. Williams a show after the election.The news of Mr. Williams getting a dedicated time slot was earlier reported by CNN.Mr. Williams has spent the last year as MSNBC’s breaking news anchor and as a co-host during primary night coverage and the conventions.Despite the roughly 245 hours he has appeared on-air in that time, Mr. Williams has still had a relatively low profile in the year and a half since he was removed as NBC’s evening news anchor after it was revealed that he embellished his role in a helicopter incident in Iraq, along with other reporting experiences.A daily show would provide him the structure that he was used to in his decade as anchor of the “NBC Nightly News.” The format will also free him from the extemporaneous nature of the sort of broadcasts he has been working on at MSNBC, though Mr. Williams will continue to serve as the network’s breaking news anchor.Like all cable networks, MSNBC has experienced enormous gains in viewership during the election. In prime time, MSNBC had an average 1.3 million viewers last month, a gain of 117 percent over last year. And though the network remains in third place, it has recently made gains on CNN.MSNBC had been showing reruns of its show “All In With Chris Hayes” at 11 p.m., but last week began experimenting with the kind of live news coverage that has been a boon to all of cable news this year.Advertisement
