HONG KONG — The activist hedge fund Elliott Associates has sold shares in Samsung C&T, the South Korean construction company, after Elliott failed to block an $8 billion merger with another Samsung affiliate, Cheil Industries.Under South Korean law, Samsung C&T investors who opposed the deal can sell their shares back to the company by Thursday for 57,234 won, or $49, per share.Elliott confirmed that it had exercised its so-called appraisal rights. It said the decision had been made “in light of, among other things, the continued overvaluation of Cheil Industries, which Elliott believes to be wholly unjustified.”The American hedge fund declined to say how many shares it had sold, but it exercised appraisal rights on about two-thirds of the stake of 7.12 percent that Elliott held, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deal.AdvertisementElliott’s efforts to stop the merger of Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, a Samsung holding company, was a test of shareholder activism in Asia. The move exposed concerns about shareholder rights and succession planning in South Korea, where business is dominated by family-controlled conglomerates known as chaebols.AdvertisementElliott Associates said the deal grossly undervalued Samsung C&T and was an unlawful attempt by the Lee family to consolidate its hold over Samsung companies. It used its 7.12 percent stake to try to block a restructuring, which would transfer more power to Lee Jae-yong, the son of the Samsung conglomerate’s ailing chairman, Lee Kun-hee.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
