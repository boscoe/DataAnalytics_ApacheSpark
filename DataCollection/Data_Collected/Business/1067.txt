The Food and Drug Administration approved a new one-pill H.I.V. treatment on Thursday with a new, apparently safer form of tenofovir, a powerful H.I.V. inhibitor. The pill, called Genvoya, from Gilead Sciences, joins other one-pill treatments like Atripla, Complera, Triumeq and Stribild. The new form of the inhibitor, Gilead said, more efficiently enters cells where H.I.V. replicates, resulting in 91 percent less tenofovir in the bloodstream. That should make the pill less likely to cause kidney damage or loss of bone density, which have become major problems among people with H.I.V. who survive into old age.A version of this brief appears in print on November 6, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: F.D.A.
