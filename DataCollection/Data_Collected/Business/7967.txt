P.&G., maker of products including Tide, Pampers and Charmin, said higher prices helped offset a decline in shipment volume for its fiscal fourth quarter. That kept sales flat after stripping out the impact of currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures. The company has been trying to improve results by cutting costs and shrinking its portfolio of products. The company’s chief, A. G. Lafley, said P.&G. was trying to focus on more profitable products. In its fabric care unit, for instance, he said P.&G. was expanding Tide detergent pods but getting out of cheaper products, like bleach. For the quarter that ended June 30, the company earned $521 million, or 18 cents a share. Not including one-time items, it said it earned $1 a share, which was more than the 94 cents a share analysts expected, according to Zacks Investment Research. Total revenue fell 9 percent to $17.79 billion. That was below the $18.06 billion Wall Street had expected. Shares of P.&G. closed down 4 percent. Advertisement
