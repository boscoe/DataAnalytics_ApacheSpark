Icahn. Freeport said Mr. Moffett, 77, who had been appointed chairman emeritus, would be a consultant to the board and advise the company on its Indonesia operations. He played a central role in developing Indonesia’s Grasberg gold and copper deposit, one of the world’s largest. Freeport shares fell more than 9 percent. Mr. Icahn, who owned 8.8 percent of Freeport as of Sept. 22, has criticized its spending, capital structure and executive compensation in the face of weak commodity prices. Advertisement
