HONG KONG — For millions of ordinary Chinese who have borne the brunt as the mainland’s stock market has plummeted in recent weeks, government measures to bolster the market are offering little relief.Chinese shares fell on Tuesday, with the Shanghai composite index closing down 1.3 percent after a gain on Monday. The Shenzhen index, which covers smaller companies, had another steep drop, down 5.3 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, which fell sharply on Monday, finished down a more moderate 1 percent on Tuesday.The state-run news media reported that an increasing number of companies, 200 on Tuesday alone, were filing for a suspension in trading to insulate themselves from the decline. The China Securities Journal reported that 760 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had suspended trading in their shares, representing about 27 percent of companies on the two markets.The voluntary suspensions, along with rules that automatically halt trading in a company’s stock if it drops 10 percent, combined to keep 44.4 percent of all Chinese stocks from trading for the full session Tuesday. Taking such stocks out of play has probably locked a number of skittish investors into investments they are trying to sell. The hope is that by the time the trading suspensions lift, confidence will have been restored.AdvertisementElsewhere in Asia, shares were mixed, reacting to the events in Greece and the volatility in China’s markets. The Nikkei 225 share index in Japan finished 1.3 percent higher, while the Kospi in South Korea fell 0.7 percent. Australian shares rose nearly 2 percent.
                The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country’s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.            For mainland Chinese stocks, the revival of downward momentum on Tuesday suggested that markets were likely to continue falling, said Li-Gang Liu, the chief economist for greater China at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. In many cases, company valuations, in particular for smaller technology companies listed on the ChiNext market, remain irrationally high, he said.AdvertisementOver the weekend, Beijing suspended new stock listings and persuaded a number of large brokerage firms to set up a $19.4 billion stabilization fund to help support the markets. Those moves are not enough to restore confidence, Mr. Liu said.“I would think that these kind of price-supporting operations will only have a couple of days’ effect and not much sustaining power in the medium term,” he said. “You should allow the market mechanisms to play out, rather than using administrative measures to support share price at certain levels. All evidence has shown elsewhere this type of operations doesn’t work.”Another major problem could arise from where the brokerage firms involved in the stabilization fund are likely to spend the money: on shares in large state-owned firms, whose valuations are more justifiable than those of smaller companies whose stocks have been bid up to irrational prices.“With the public money you can only pick large-cap blue chips, but the valuation bubble is in the small-cap sector, and it’s still unraveling,” said Hao Hong, chief strategist at the Bank of Communications International. “That creates a lot of volatility and a contagion effect. At the moment it’s looking ugly.”Before markets opened on Tuesday, the state media reported remarks by Premier Li Keqiang that China had the confidence and ability to deal with economic challenges and risks. But Mr. Li’s words had little calming effect.Those left footing the bill are individual consumer investors, who make up the bulk of investors in China’s stock markets — in the world’s other major markets, professional institutional investors are more common. Invested in small, overvalued companies, many of these individual investors are taking advantage of government measures to pull out of their holdings and save what money they can, said Mr. Liu, the A.N.Z. economist.AdvertisementHerald van der Linde, who leads Asia equity strategy for HSBC, said it was important to keep in perspective that the potential losses to most families in China would not be major. As of May, only 15 percent of Chinese family assets were in stocks. “It’s a lot of focus, but it doesn’t mean families are suddenly being bankrupt,” he said.Over the past year, as property prices stagnated, many Chinese investors poured into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Cheered on by state media and supported by cheap loans, investors quickly bid up stock valuations to bubble territory, with price-to-earnings valuations well beyond those of comparable markets elsewhere. Since mid-June, the rout, which many analysts deemed inevitable, has cut nearly $3 trillion in market value from China’s stock market, the second-largest in the world, after the United States market.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Hao, the Bank of Communications strategist, said that when shares were doing well, earnings from the stock market had begun to flow back into the property market, causing prices to rise. Now, with the market back to the level it was in March, much of that spending may disappear. “Inevitably consumption patterns will be affected, that’s one thing,” he said. “With this wealth destruction, I would say that there are longer-term effects,” he said. “But let’s survive today first.”Keith Bradsher contributed reporting.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
