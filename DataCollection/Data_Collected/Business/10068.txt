To the Editor:A recent article (“Selling Shampoo, Eye Cream and a Chemical Crackdown,” Oct. 9) sheds light on the need to modernize Food and Drug Administration oversight of cosmetics. But the Personal Care Products Safety Act that it mentions, introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins, would do more harm than good in the name of promoting safety.There is a better way to strengthen consumer protections without stifling innovation. The Cosmetic Modernization Amendments of 2015 sponsored by Representative Pete Sessions would enhance F.D.A. oversight while providing clear direction for all companies.My association represents 700 small and emerging cosmetics businesses, and safety is their top priority. We’ve long supported modernizing F.D.A. oversight, and support the creation of a national safety standard. The Feinstein-Collins bill not only fails to establish that standard, but would also unnecessarily burden small businesses. The last thing American entrepreneurs and job creators need are unnecessary burdens or a patchwork of contradictory regulations.Pam Busiek Deer Park, Ill., Oct. 21The writer is president and chief executive of Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Letters for Sunday Business may be written to sunbiz@nytimes.com.A version of this article appears in print on November 13, 2016, on Page BU4 of the New York edition with the headline: Letters.
