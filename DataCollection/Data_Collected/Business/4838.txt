LeasePlan was acquired by a consortium led by Volkswagen in 2004 for about €2 billion.“LeasePlan emphasizes that these discussions may or may not result in an agreement,” the company said on Tuesday in a news release.LeasePlan first confirmed that its owners were discussing a possible sale of the company earlier in March.None of the debt raised by the investors would be borrowed by LeasePlan, and the company would not be responsible for the repayment of such debt, LeasePlan said.Any transaction or change of ownership would be subject to regulatory approval, in part because the company holds a banking license in the Netherlands.LeasePlan, based in Almere, the Netherlands, leases 1.42 million vehicles and provides fleet and vehicle management services in 32 countries. It posted a profit of €372 million in 2014.Advertisement
