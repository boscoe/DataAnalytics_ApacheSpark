Still, strong demand from would-be buyers has pushed the index up 8.2 percent in the last 12 months.“We could see a bit of a slowing in the recent upward trend in existing-home sales in the coming months,” said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at the bank BNP Paribas.Solid hiring and relatively low mortgage rates have propelled the previous five months of gains in the pending sales index. But buying options are increasingly limited because the market contains just five months’ supply of homes, compared with the historical average of six months in a healthier market.Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A lag of a month or two usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.The decline indicates that sales may soon be peaking after steady growth for much of the year.Completed sales of existing homes climbed 3.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the highest rate since February 2007, the Realtors group said last week. These sales have climbed 9.6 percent over the last 12 months, although the number of existing homes available to buy has edged up a slim 0.4 percent.One result of strong demand and limited supplies is increasing prices, which can eventually hurt affordability and cause would-be buyers to pull back from the market.The median home price has risen 6.5 percent over the last year to $236,400, the highest level — unadjusted for inflation — reported by the Realtors group.Much of that demand has stemmed from an accelerated pace of hiring that dates to early 2014. Employers added 3.1 million jobs last year and are on pace to add 2.5 million this year. Those new jobs have filled the economy with new paychecks that stirred more interest in home buying.Low but rising mortgage rates also increased buyer demand.The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 4.04 percent last week, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac. The rate remains roughly two percentage points below the historical average, but it also represents a sharp increase from the 52-week low of 3.59 percent.Advertisement
