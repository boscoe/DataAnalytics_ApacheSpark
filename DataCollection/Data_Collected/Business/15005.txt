Sainsbury, the operator of the British supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, joined Terra Firma last year as its vice chairman and head of portfolio businesses. He also took an ownership stake in the company.The hiring of Mr. Geczy came a little over a month after Mr. Hands abandoned his long-running legal pursuit of Citigroup, in a case in which he had claimed that the American banking giant misled him about a deal to buy the music label EMI.The acquisition of EMI in 2007 turned out to be a disastrous one for Mr. Hands, damaging his reputation and personally costing him 200 million euros, about $220 million, he said.Facing crushing debt, the music label was seized by its lenders in 2011 and was sold to the Universal Music Group in 2012.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
