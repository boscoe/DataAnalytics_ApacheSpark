AdvertisementSupported byBy Jad MouawadEmirates, the largest airline in the Middle East, said Tuesday it would start flying to Orlando this year, adding a 10th United States destination at a time when American airlines are lobbying the administration to freeze new flights from the three Persian Gulf giants.The new daily service between Dubai and Orlando International Airport will begin Sept. 1. It will be served by Boeing 777-200LRs, with 266 seats including eight first class and 42 business class.The Greater Orlando Aviation Authority said the new service would bring $100 million in extra economic activity to the region, expand access to Central Florida, and give local businesses “efficient access” to new destinations thanks to Emirates’ global reach.But the three big United States carriers — Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines — have been critical of Emirates and two other Gulf-based carriers, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. They accuse the three state-owned airlines of unfair competition because they get government subsidies.The domestic carriers, along with pilot and flight attendant unions, have asked the federal government to review the open skies agreements between the United States and the United Arab Emirates, where Emirates and Etihad are based, as well as Qatar, to address state subsidies. In the meantime, they have sought to block any new flights into the United States.The Gulf carriers reject the claims that they get state subsidies. During a visit to Washington last week, Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, said that plans to eventually fly to 20 cities in the United States were unchanged.Emirates, one of the world’s largest international carriers, already has three daily flights between its home base of Dubai and New York, and operates another daily flight between New York and Milan. It also flies daily to Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington.Emirates said passengers arriving in Orlando would be able to connect to other American cities, the Caribbean and South America, through a partnership with JetBlue Airways, which has a regional hub. JetBlue serves 24 cities from Orlando, including San Juan in Puerto Rico; Bogota, Colombia; and Nassau, the Bahamas.Attempts to freeze flights from the Gulf carriers have divided the airline industry, with many seeing it as an attempt to rollback the open skies agreement that the United States has championed over the past three decades.With American carriers paring down international service at many small and midsize domestic airports, and focusing on their main hubs, airports around the country have been reaching out to foreign carriers to establish new service.Advertisement
