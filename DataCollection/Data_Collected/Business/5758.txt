The Transportation Department said Monday that airlines collected $3.5 billion in bag fees last year, a 5 percent increase over 2013, and $3 billion in reservation-change fees, up 6 percent. Fees began escalating in 2008, when airlines were losing money and facing a sharp rise in fuel prices. But fuel prices have dropped while the fees remain. At Spirit Airlines, which advertises low fares but adds lots of fees, only 63 percent of revenue comes from fares. Southwest still lets customers check two bags or change a reservation free; it gets 95 percent of revenue from the ticket price. Operating profit at 27 airlines rose last year to $14.6 billion, from $11.3 billion in 2013.A version of this brief appears in print on May 5, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fees and Low Fuel Prices Keep Airline Profits Rising.
