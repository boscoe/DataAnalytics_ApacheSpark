Boeing said on Thursday that it delivered 762 jetliners in 2015, exceeding its target of 755 to 760 planes. The tally, which includes delivery of 34 of Boeing’s flagship 787 Dreamliners in the fourth quarter, probably cements the company’s position as the world’s biggest plane maker, topping its chief rival, the Airbus Group, for the fourth straight year. Airbus is expected to say Tuesday that in 2015 it delivered slightly more than the 629 jetliners it delivered in 2014. Boeing delivered 120 of its 737s in the fourth quarter, slightly below the target production rate of 42 a month.A version of this brief appears in print on January 8, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Boeing Exceeds 2015 Forecasts, Most Likely Topping Airbus .
