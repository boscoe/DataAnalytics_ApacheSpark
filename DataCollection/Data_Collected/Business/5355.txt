The criminal case against Sergey Aleynikov — the former Goldman Sachs programmer who was convicted in federal court, then acquitted, only to be charged again in state court — will soon head to a jury after Mr. Aleynikov’s last-ditch effort to toss out the case came up short.In a ruling on Monday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the judge overseeing the weekslong case rejected Mr. Aleynikov’s request for a dismissal, handing a victory to prosecutors who accused Mr. Aleynikov of stealing secret source code from Goldman’s computers. The ruling by Justice Daniel P. Conviser will now prolong a resolution to the long-running tale, which began nearly six years ago when Mr. Aleynikov was arrested on the Fourth of July holiday weekend at Newark Liberty International Airport.While some of Mr. Aleynikov’s arguments appeared to resonate with Justice Conviser — the judge left open the possibility that, if the jury were to convict Mr. Aleynikov, he might overturn the verdict — the effort was considered a long shot. Judges rarely toss out cases midtrial, in part because prosecutors cannot appeal such decisions. Dismissing a case at this point is an extreme step that must happen only when trial evidence is “not legally sufficient” to establish the charges.And after nearly two hours of oral arguments on Monday, and a five-minute recess, Justice Conviser rebuffed Mr. Aleynikov’s request.Advertisement“That, in my view, would be fundamentally unfair,” Justice Conviser said, referring to the lack of appeal for prosecutors at the Manhattan district attorney’s office. “With all due respect to me, I sometimes get it wrong.”AdvertisementIn an opinion read from the bench, Justice Conviser hinted at some skepticism about the prosecution’s case, which hinges on varying interpretations of state laws.“I think there certainly are issues about whether these charges are legally sufficient,” Justice Conviser said.At one point during oral arguments, for example, Justice Conviser remarked that while he understood what prosecutors were saying on a particular issue, “I don’t agree with it.”Mr. Aleynikov’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, had asked the judge to toss out all three charges. While Mr. Aleynikov downloaded part of Goldman’s high-frequency trading code onto his home computer before leaving for a new job, Mr. Marino claimed that doing so was a breach of the bank’s confidentiality agreement, not state laws.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But after some stumbles in the case — and a number of court decisions against federal and state prosecutors who charged Mr. Aleynikov — there was reason to doubt whether Justice Conviser would have ruled on Monday to allow the case to proceed.In 2012, a federal appeals court in New York reversed Mr. Aleynikov’s conviction, ruling that federal prosecutors had misapplied the corporate espionage laws against him. Then, after the Manhattan district attorney’s office took up the case anew, a state court judge tossed out much of the evidence against him, finding that the F.B.I. had conducted an illegal search and arrest of Mr. Aleynikov.AdvertisementLast week, Justice Conviser ruled that prosecutors could not call an expert witness to testify because they had failed to inform Mr. Marino of such plans.But on Monday, as the arguments wore on, Justice Conviser seemed unconvinced.“I’m here with my pants around my ankles,” Mr. Marino said nearing the end of his argument, prompting Justice Conviser to reply: “I don’t think your pants are around their ankles.”Mr. Marino quickly clarified: “Well, they’re definitely slipping.”A version of this article appears in print on April 21, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Ruling Clears Way for Jury Verdict on Former Goldman Sachs Programmer.
