BP, citing low oil prices, tried on Tuesday to whittle away at $13.7 billion in potential fines under the Clean Water Act as the penalty phase started in its trial over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Lawyers for BP said its fine should be modest because it took extensive steps to mitigate the spill, the worst offshore disaster in United States history. “There has been no collapse of the ecosystem,” Mike Brock, a lawyer for BP, said in opening statements. Environmental groups have said it could take decades for the gulf to recover. Mr. Brock also said the penalties should take into account the ability of the defendant named in the case, BP’s exploration and production unit, to pay. The unit’s value has steadily declined during the collapse in oil prices. The government’s lawyer, Steve O’Rourke, said the exploration unit and the parent were effectively the same company. He urged a fine of $11.7 billion to $13.7 billion. Clean Water Act rules say that when assigning penalties the court must look at BP’s ability to pay, the steps it took to clean up the spill and its history of past violations. The penalty phase is expected to last three weeks.A version of this brief appears in print on January 21, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bp Argues for Smaller Fines in Final Phase of Oil Spill Trial.
