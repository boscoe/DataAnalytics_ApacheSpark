That will be combined with $7.5 billion in loans from other international organizations and an expected $15.4 billion in debt relief that Ukrainian officials hope to negotiate with bondholders.The program “is very strongly front-loaded during the first year,” Christine Lagarde, the fund’s managing director, said in Berlin. “We are off to a good start.”After a year of political upheaval and war, Ukraine’s economy is in a tailspin with a currency that pulled back from record lows, the highest interest rates in 15 years and central bank reserves of just $6.4 billion, barely enough to cover five weeks of imports.The I.M.F. said the Ukrainian economy should grow 2 percent in 2016 after a contraction of about 5.5 percent this year and that by end-2015, the government should have enough reserves to cover about three months of imports.Last year, the fund approved a $17 billion, two-year loan, but it deemed the effort insufficient to support the government while it battled pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine. The fighting follows months of upheaval from anti-government protests and Russia’s subsequent annexation of the Crimea region.Ukraine’s parliament last week approved a raft of I.M.F.-backed amendments to a draft budget, which were key preconditions for the bailout.
