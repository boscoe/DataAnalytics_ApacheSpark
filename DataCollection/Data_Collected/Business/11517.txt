American, the world’s biggest airline, said on Friday that its earnings were the highest ever for any carrier. And it is poised for another big year: Airline officials said they expected to save an additional $2 billion on fuel in 2016. The American Airlines Group posted net income of $3.28 billion in the fourth quarter, but the results were inflated by a huge accounting gain from a tax item. Without that and other one-time gains and losses, American said it earned $1.3 billion or $2 per share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5.2 percent to $9.63 billion, but American more than offset the decline with savings of nearly $1.1 billion — 41 percent — on jet fuel. For all of 2015, American earned a record $7.6 billion. Excluding the tax gain, adjusted profit was $6.3 billion, also a record. American did not disclose its average fare, but in the fourth quarter passengers flew 3.8 percent more miles than a year earlier and paid 8.9 percent less per mile. Advertisement
