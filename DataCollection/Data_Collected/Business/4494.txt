The Swedish central bank on Wednesday again cut its main interest rate, bringing it deeper into negative territory to head off deflationary pressures.The executive board of the Swedish Riksbank said that it had cut its main rate target by 0.15 percentage point to minus 0.25 percent, and that it would buy government bonds valued at 30 billion kronor, or about $3.5 billion, over the next few months.The bank said in a statement that it saw signs “that inflation has bottomed out and is beginning to rise,” but that the strength of the currency “risks breaking this trend.” The measures on Wednesday were intended “to support the upturn in inflation,” said the Riksbank, which signaled its “readiness to do more at short notice.”Sweden, like its Nordic neighbor Denmark and most countries along the perimeter of the eurozone, is fighting to keep its appreciating currency from pushing inflation, already at dangerously low levels, into outright deflation.AdvertisementEconomists fear that the self-reinforcing spiral of falling prices will weigh on growth and hurt banks and borrowers. That has led central banks in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland to set negative rates, in effect taxing the money that banks hold rather than lend to the real economy. The European Central Bank, in its own fight against deflation, is also using negative rates.AdvertisementSweden’s bond-buying program, while small compared with the 60 billion euros, or about $63.5 billion, the European Central Bank has said it will buy each month until September 2016, is intended to drive down bond yields, in theory restarting lending and helping the economy to grow faster. The policy, known as quantitative easing, has also been employed by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, with mixed results.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Yellen, and her colleagues on the Fed’s main policy committee were expected by many analysts to signal their readiness to raise interest rates, which are still near zero more than six years after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.Considering the prospect of a Fed interest rate increase and the low-inflation environment, partly attributed to low oil prices, the Riksbank warned on Wednesday that an appreciation of the Swedish currency “could break off the upturn in inflation that has begun, so that it fails to rise sufficiently quickly.”The central bank has had to backtrack enormously since it began raising its key rate in 2010 and reached 2 percent in 2011. That earned criticism from economists, who said it was overlooking the danger of falling prices as it girded against nonexistent inflation.A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Sweden’s Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate Again, to Minus 0.25%.
