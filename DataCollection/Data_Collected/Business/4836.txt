SAN FRANCISCO — Last summer, Andreessen Horowitz turned heads when it poured $90 million — one of its biggest investments ever — into Tanium, a start-up aimed at helping companies manage their computer networks.Now, the venture capital firm has returned for another round of financing.Tanium plans to announce on Tuesday that it has received another $52 million from Andreessen Horowitz, raising its total venture capital funding to more than $140 million.The new investment values the start-up at about $1.75 billion, or nearly double the valuation attached to last summer’s financing round.It’s a vote of confidence in the prospects of Tanium, which likens its core product to serving as the digital nervous system of a customer’s computer network. The eight-year-old company allows its consumers to quickly monitor their “end points,” like laptops and point-of-sale systems, getting status updates in a matter of minutes instead of hours.AdvertisementThat sort of speed and comprehensiveness, the company says, can help customers detect potential breaches in its network much more quickly than competing offerings that can only provide snapshots in a matter of hours or even days.AdvertisementBut the start-up also says that its offering can extend beyond security, such as helping customers organize their networks more efficiently.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
