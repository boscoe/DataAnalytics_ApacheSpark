LONDON — Deutsche Bank said on Friday that it was scaling back its investment banking operations in Russia as the bank’s new co-chief executive, John Cryan, looks to reshape its business.The move reflects the bank’s own organizational challenges as well as the increasing difficulty for international companies of all sorts to do business in Russia in light of Western sanctions and the country’s stumbling economy.Friday’s announcement came a day after Deutsche Bank said that Joerg Bongartz, the longtime chairman of its Russian business and head of its Global Transaction Banking operation there, was moving to Frankfurt and would assume a broader responsibility for the lender’s business in Central and Eastern Europe.Mr. Cryan, who replaced Anshu Jain as co-chief executive of the big German bank this summer, has said that Deutsche Bank must become more efficient, jettison underperforming businesses and simplify its organization structure. Its unwieldy setup “inhibits effective decision making, blurs accountability and embeds wasteful cost,” Mr. Cryan said.AdvertisementOn Friday, the bank said it would close its onshore corporate banking and securities operations in Russia. Instead, its Russian corporate finance and markets businesses will operate from the bank’s other international hubs.AdvertisementDeutsche Bank said it would continue to offer prices in Russian securities to its clients, using third parties for execution, and would continue to provide banking services to core Russian clients.The move, expected to affect about 200 full-time employees, is meant to be mostly completed by the end of the year. Following the pullback, Deutsche Bank will have about 1,100 employees in Russia.“This decision has been made in order to reduce complexity, costs, risks and capital consumption,” the bank said in a news release.The scaling back of Deutsche Bank’s business in Russia comes as Western economic sanctions, the decline in the value of the ruble, and the falling price of oil have weighed heavily on the Russian economy.President Vladimir V. Putin has responded to the Western measures with countersanctions.Deutsche Bank itself is facing regulatory scrutiny over a series of so-called mirror trades in Russia that may have breached laws against money laundering.In July, Deutsche Bank said that it was investigating the circumstances of equity trades entered by clients in Moscow and in London that appeared to offset one another and that the volume of the transactions under review was “significant.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The bank has had poor profitability in recent years and has faced several scandals that have led to huge fines and hurt its reputation.In April, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $2.5 billion in penalties to the United States and British authorities to settle accusations of fixing benchmark interest rates.The fine was larger than that paid by other banks in the case, and many shareholders blamed Mr. Jain, who resigned in June, for bungling negotiations with investigators.Deutsche Bank has set aside 3.8 billion euros, or about $4.3 billion, in additional provisions to cover costs from lawsuits and official investigations into allegations of misconduct, primarily in the years before the financial crisis began in 2008.A version of this article appears in print on September 19, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Deutsche Bank Reduces Russian Operations.
