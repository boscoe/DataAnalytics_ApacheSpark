That is partly because diners were ordering more extras like alcohol and desserts, and the company offered fewer discounts. The modest bump in sales follows a 0.5 percent increase in the previous quarter, making it the first time since 2010 that Olive Garden achieved consecutive quarters of sales gains. Still, customer traffic was down, and the improvement came after a 5.4 percent decline in sales a year ago. Advertisement
