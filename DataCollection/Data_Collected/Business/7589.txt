In the first five minutes of Mr. Smith’s presentation, Macy’s stock jumped by more than 4 percent. In early afternoon trading, the shares were up more than 7 percent.Between its real estate holdings and its retail store business, Macy’s could function as two companies, Mr. Smith said at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference. He added that he was willing to do what was best for shareholders and would not rule out a battle with management.In a statement, a Macy’s spokesman said, “We work continuously to maximize shareholder value and exchange views with a wide variety of shareholders as we do so.”The company said that it was evaluating all of its locations and “their retail and alternative use values.”Mr. Smith most recently prevailed in a battle against Darden Restaurants, winning shareholder support to replace the entire board.The victory came after a one-year showdown between Darden, which owns a chain of restaurants, and a group of disgruntled investors who first called for a separate company for its Red Lobster and Olive Garden chains.Advertisement
