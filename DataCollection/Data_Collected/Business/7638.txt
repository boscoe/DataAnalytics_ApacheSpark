Information on as many as 4.5 million people was stored on servers that were breached during online attacks beginning last year against UCLA Health, the hospital system of the University of California, Los Angeles, officials said Friday. UCLA Health said in a statement that while there was no evidence that hackers acquired personal or medical data, it could not be immediately ruled out. Officials said they were working with the F.B.I. to track the source of the attacks. Beginning as early as September 2014, hackers gained access to a network that contains “personal information such as names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, medical record numbers, Medicare or health plan ID numbers and some medical information,” the statement said. Free identity protection services will be offered to individuals who may have been affected. “We sincerely regret any impact this incident may have on those we serve,” said Dr. James Atkinson, UCLA Health’s interim associate vice chancellor and president.A version of this brief appears in print on July 18, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Online Attacks at UCLA Health Exposed 4.5 Million.
