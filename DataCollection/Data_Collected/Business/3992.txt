TOKYO — Japanese government data on Friday showed soft consumption readings coinciding with a surge in factory output, underscoring the unevenness of the Japanese recovery and posing a headache for the Bank of Japan, which hopes its aggressive asset buying will drive up inflation and prompt households to spend more.If the effect of last year’s tax increase is stripped away, the core consumer price index — which excludes the volatile prices of food but includes oil costs — rose just 0.2 percent in January, compared with the same month last year — less than expected and slowing from 0.5 percent in December.Also in January, Japanese households cut spending more than expected and retail sales fell for the first time in seven months. Household spending fell a more-than-expected 5.1 percent, compared with the same month last year. It was the 10th consecutive month of declines in spending, the longest losing streak since the global financial crisis in 2009. Retail sales dropped a worse-than-expected 2 percent.“If consumer spending doesn’t pick up by April, it will be difficult for industrial production to accelerate,” said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.AdvertisementThe weak consumer mood has kept a lid on spending, as wages have yet to increase enough to make up for the sales tax increase, to 8 percent from 5 percent last April, casting doubt on the strength of the recovery.AdvertisementPrime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking to Parliament on Friday, said the sales tax increase weighed on people’s minds. “Consumer sentiment was surely dampened,” he said.The government initially planned a second tax increase later in October but recently postponed it to April 2017 because of the weak economy. The government might further delay another sales tax increase if an unexpected event such as another global financial crisis or a huge earthquake occurs, Mr. Abe said.In contrast to the gloom felt among households, companies looked to be in better shape, as they began to benefit from the competitive advantage their goods were getting from the weak yen.Factory output jumped at the fastest pace in nearly four years in January, as companies increased spending at home and won more orders in emerging markets, suggesting that exports will keep the economy on track for a moderate recovery.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
