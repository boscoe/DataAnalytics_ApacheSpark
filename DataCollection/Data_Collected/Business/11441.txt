Barclays has been the so-called designated market maker for 1,200 stocks listed on the exchange.Designated market makers at the New York Stock Exchange are responsible for setting the opening and closing prices for stocks listed with the exchange. They used to sit at the center of the American stock market, but they have lost that role as more trading has been done by computers.The market makers are now best known from the photos from the floor of the exchange that run with news reports about movements in the stock markets.Other big banks and brokerage firms previously sold their seats on the floor of the exchange to high-speed firms like Virtu Financial Capital Markets and Knight Capital Group (now KCG). In 2014, Goldman Sachs sold its business on the floor to the Dutch high-speed firm IMC Financial Markets.The sales have created an odd situation: Computerized trading firms like Virtu now dominate one of the last places where humans still play a crucial role in the stock markets.Even on the floor of the exchange, though, most prices are generated by algorithms that determine when to buy and sell. The humans are generally present to monitor the computers and to step in if anything goes wrong, as has happened on several occasions in recent years.Global Trading Systems, or GTS, said it would take on most of the Barclays employees who have been working on the floor.“GTS’s new role as a designated market maker reflects our commitment to providing more liquidity in more places, and to creating a better, more cost-efficient marketplace for retail and institutional investors and listed issuers,” the chief executive of GTS, Ari Rubenstein, said in a statement.Advertisement
