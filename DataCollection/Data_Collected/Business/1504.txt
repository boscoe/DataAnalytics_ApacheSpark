Airplanes spent 23 minutes 32 seconds, on average, taxiing between gates and runways in the first nine months of 2015, according to an Associated Press analysis. That is the longest time since the Bureau of Transportation Statistics started tracking taxi times in 1995, and a 50-second increase over the average last year. But the longer taxi times are included in flight schedules, so planes still arrive on time. This year, 79 percent of flights have been at the gate within 15 minutes of their scheduled time, the best performance since 2012. Passengers are spending more time on planes, but airlines are better managing expectations. For instance, 10 years ago the average scheduled time from gate to gate between Chicago and San Francisco was 4 hours 32 minutes. Today, flights are 11 minutes longer. O’Hare International Airport in Chicago is a top offender. Planes at O’Hare this year spent an average of an extra one minute 18 seconds navigating the taxiways, and taxi times are up three minutes 24 seconds from five years ago. At Love Field in Dallas, taxi times are up two minutes, or 13 percent, the highest percent gain of any major airport.A version of this brief appears in print on November 24, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Planes Taking Longer to Taxi Between Gate and Runway.
