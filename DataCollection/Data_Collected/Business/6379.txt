DETROIT —  Three automakers on Thursday widened recalls of cars and trucks with Takata airbags, and Congress set a hearing next week on the safety issue.The recalls that the automakers — Fiat Chrysler, Honda and BMW — announced on Thursday are part of an action started last week by Takata that raised the number of vehicles affected to 53 million globally, including 34 million in the United States.
                More vehicles, including old models, have been recalled in the United States in 2014 than ever before. Explore the size and scope of the recalls, and find out if your car has been affected.            Takata officials and safety regulators have said that airbag inflaters exposed to moisture over time can explode with too much force, shooting shrapnel into vehicles. Regulators have linked this to six deaths worldwide, all in Honda vehicles.Automakers and regulators are still seeking to pinpoint the root of the problem, which means that even with replacement parts, consumers have no guarantee their vehicles are safe.AdvertisementFiat Chrysler expanded its recalls of vehicles with Takata airbags to about 5.22 million worldwide, involving the 2003 to 2011 model years. About 4.5 million of those vehicles are in the United States.
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            It said that it no longer made vehicles with Takata airbag inflaters and those in its recalls “are distinct from Takata inflaters cited in fatalities involving other automakers.”Honda widened its recall by 350,000 in the United States and 340,000 in Japan. Since 2008, Honda has recalled about 20 million vehicles worldwide with Takata airbag parts.AdvertisementBMW said it was widening United States recalls of models with Takata airbags to 420,661 vehicles, from 140,696.A version of this article appears in print on May 29, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Automakers Expand Recalls of Cars With Takata Airbags.
