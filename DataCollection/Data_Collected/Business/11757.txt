More conventional contributing factors for the rise in sales included relatively mild weather and a “Lobsterfest” promotion.The spotlight is a welcome change for Red Lobster, which was cast off by Darden Restaurants in 2014 after a long stretch of declining sales. The chain, which is now privately held by the investment firm Golden Gate Capital, said the Beyoncé song made Red Lobster a trending topic on Twitter for the first time.Advertisement
