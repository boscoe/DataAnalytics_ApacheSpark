Its shares dropped about 7 percent, to $31.16.But Fox executives — including James Murdoch, the company’s new chief, and Lachlan Murdoch, its executive co-chairman — did their best to strike a confident tone on a conference call with analysts.Addressing industrywide concerns about cable subscriber losses, James Murdoch said that, while certain 21st Century Fox channels are expected to experience slight declines, the total number of paid subscribers for the company’s channels will experience “good growth” both in the United States and overseas. In other words, new networks like Fox Sports 1 and FXX will grow fast enough to offset any erosion from more fully distributed channels like Fox News.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, à la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Still, John Nallen, chief financial officer, said the company’s overall outlook for the coming year had darkened slightly, citing an updated view of the advertising market, sports costs and the stronger dollar.For its fiscal fourth quarter, 21st Century Fox reported a profit of $87 million, or 4 cents a share, down from $999 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The drop-off was largely attributable to the sale of interests in European satellite TV services; excluding that and other one-time items, the company had per-share earnings of 39 cents. Analysts had expected 37 cents. Revenue totaled $6.21 billion. Analysts had expected $6.41 billion.The cable division, the company’s primary profit engine, reported operating income of $1.22 billion, a 1 percent increase from the same period a year earlier. Revenue increased 7 percent, in part because of higher affiliate payments for networks like Fox Sports 1, Fox News and FX. Advertising was particularly strong at the company’s international channels, including the Star India networks.But higher sports programming costs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates dragged down the cable division’s results.Operating income at a different unit that includes the ratings-challenged Fox broadcasting network decreased 22 percent in the quarter, to $113 million, because of lower advertising revenue — ad sales declined 14 percent — and higher sports programming costs, including rights to Women’s World Cup soccer matches.Fox’s movie and television studio had operating income of $269 million, a 21 percent decline. The company said that more than half of the decrease was because of the absence of contributions from Shine, a reality television company that was rolled into a separate entity. The timing of movie releases also played a role; Fox did not have releases in the quarter that matched the 2014 debut of “X-Men: Days of Future Past.”Advertisement
