The terms of the deal were not disclosed.SMCP, which owns the contemporary fashion brands Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot and operates 1,118 stores in 34 countries, is considered a major contender in the so-called accessible luxury sector. Its core brands are aimed at professional women in their 20s and 30s.The labels’ price points are above those of fast-fashion giants like Zara and H&M but below those of elite brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. SMCP had record results in 2015, including a 33 percent increase in sales to 675 million euros, or about $766 million.The chief of SMCP, Daniel Lalonde, said that the deal would fuel the group’s international expansion efforts, “particularly Asia, where we could leverage Shandong Ruyi Group’s expertise.”Currency fluctuations and an economic slowdown in Asia have frayed the fortunes of Western premium luxury brands, but SMCP has been expanding in mainland China and Hong Kong.Philip Guarino, the Europe director of the consulting firm China Luxury Advisors, said there was a “huge opportunity for growth” in Asia for accessible luxury brands.“Customers are more educated and demanding than ever before, more value conscious, and mixing and matching price points in their wardrobes in a very Western way,” Mr. Guarino said.The deal was reported earlier by The Financial Times.Yafu Qiu, the chairman of Shandong Ruyi, said it was a “significant step for Shandong Ruyi in our continued endeavor to become a leader in the fully integrated textiles and fashion business, both in China and globally.”Chinese companies, craving international expertise and market share, have been pursuing Western consumer-focused companies.The Anbang Insurance Group took a run at Starwood Hotels and Resorts before withdrawing a $14 billion offer on Thursday. The Sparkle Roll Group, the Chinese distribution partner of Bang & Olufsen, the Danish maker of luxury electronics, is in talks to buy the Danish company. And last year, Fosun International bought the resort operator Club Méditerranée and a stake in the traveling circus Cirque du Soleil.Advertisement
