He said inspiration came not from Pizza Hut’s rivals but from the ride-hailing service Uber. “It’s easy to use, it’s easy to pay, it’s very easy to track,” Mr. Creed said on Thursday. He added that there was a time when the way to beat the competition was to have a better product, but now he believes that convenience trumps quality, and that “nothing beats making better easy.” Mr. Creed said that insight — “easy” beats “better” — will also help Yum energize its other fast-food chains, KFC and Taco Bell. That means shaving time off drive-through waits, and moving into areas like delivery and mobile ordering. With Pizza Hut in particular, Yum notes the chain’s sales have flagged even as it is cited as a favorite among consumers. One problem, company officials said, is that Pizza Hut generally takes longer to deliver. Sales at established locations last year fell 3 percent, after a 2 percent drop in 2013. Advertisement
