AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks ended closely mixed Monday as investors began another big week of company earnings and looked ahead to a policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.About one-third through the quarterly earnings season, results have been “nothing spectacular,” said Kristina Hooper, investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. More troubling than the middling income reports, she said, is the fact that many companies are failing to meet analysts’ forecasts for revenue. “What we really should be focusing on is the revenue picture, and that’s more negative,” Ms. Hooper said. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and Wednesday, and while the central bank has said it wants to raise interest rates soon, few investors expect that to happen this year because the global economy remains weak. The Fed left interest rates untouched in September, which helped set off a rally that pulled stocks out of the red for 2015 last week.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dipped 3.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,071.18. The S.&P. 500 remains positive for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average, which is still negative for the year, fell 23.65 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,623.05. The Nasdaq rose 2.84 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 5,034.70.Not all the earnings news was bad. Shares in LendingTree, the online mortgage broker, soared $22.98, or 23.5 percent, to $120.98 after the company reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter. LendingTree also raised its revenue estimate for the year and gave an optimistic forecast for 2016. Stock in the Laboratory Corporation of America, a medical lab operator, rose $5.79, or 5.2 percent, to $117.74 after its third-quarter results also topped estimates.Xerox shares fell 31 cents, or 3 percent, to $10.03 after the business services and copier company reported disappointing quarterly revenue. The company said it would conduct a review of its operations in hopes of raising value for its shareholders.Companies continued to combine. The IntercontinentalExchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and other markets and known as ICE, said it would buy the privately held market data company Interactive Data for $5.2 billion. Duke Energy, the biggest electric company in the United States, said it would buy Piedmont Natural Gas for about $4.9 billion. Piedmont shares surged $15.60, or 37 percent, to $57.82. Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist for BlackRock, said he expected the current wave of company deals to continue as global economic growth remained gradual and borrowing costs remained low. The stock market lift from those deals, however, might not last long, he said. Deals have given the market “a bit of a sugar high,” Mr. Koesterich said, driving stocks higher despite disappointing company results.In economic news, the government reported an unexpected drop in new home sales.
