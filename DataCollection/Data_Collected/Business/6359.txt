McDonald’s is tinkering with how it cooks its burgers, with the aim of winning back customers. McDonald’s said it would toast its hamburger buns longer so sandwiches would be warmer, and change the way it sears and grills its beef so that the patties are juicier.“It’s these little things that add up to big differences for our customers,” the chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York.Mr. Easterbrook, who stepped into his role March 1, said the changes were part of the company’s recommitment to “tastier food across the menu.” He also said the company would, as many of its rivals have, stop reporting monthly sales.An earlier version of this article misidentified the wire service from which it originated. It was The Associated Press, not Reuters.A version of this brief appears in print on May 28, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: McDonald’s Will Change How Its Burgers Are Cooked.
