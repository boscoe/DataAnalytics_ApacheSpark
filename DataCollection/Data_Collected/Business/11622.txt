That followed an announcement last March that the number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to look into such cases will be tripled, according to the report, the second one Jones Day has issued annually on the enforcement of the anticorruption law.The law bars giving “anything of value” to a foreign official to obtain or retain business with a government entity.The Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles such cases civilly, resolved 10 enforcement actions against corporations last year, settling them for $75,000 to $25 million, and two cases against individuals, according to the report. That was nearly the same as 2014.In 2015, both federal agencies collected $140 million in fines and disgorgements, which is less than a tenth of the amount received in 2014, a near record year at $1.57 billion, and less than a fifth of the $720 million collected in 2013, according to figures provided in the report.The decline “is largely due to the absence of settlements above $25 million. In 2014, the near-record total was due to the resolution of four settlements above $100 million,” said Hank B. Walther, an author of the report, who is a former government prosecutor and currently a Jones Day partner who defends multinational companies in such cases.The Justice Department indicated last year that it intended to hold more individuals to account for illegal bribery, which can be hard to establish definitively because it requires prosecutors to pinpoint when conduct crosses the line between routine business practices and an illegal action.Even so, the department announced guilty pleas last year by individuals in connection with each of its two corporate bribery enforcement actions, and obtained prison sentences for several former executives who had pleaded guilty.At the same time, the report found, corporations increasingly face multiple investigations across borders for the same conduct. Outside of the United States, other countries are being increasingly active in pressing anticorruption cases. China, Mexico, and South Korea, for example, adopted new anticorruption reforms in 2015, and several other countries, including Brazil and Britain, increased the intensity of their anticorruption enforcement, the report found.Advertisement
