The company, based in New York, said on Wednesday that it would keep running its business, but it also would continue to close stores and sell or renegotiate some of its leases. Cache sells dresses, sportswear and accessories and runs 218 stores, or 20 fewer than it operated in December. The retailer has secured up to $22 million in financingto keep operating. It also will seek a so-called stalking horse buyer for its assets. That involves a potential buyer making an initial offer to set the floor for an auction that invites competitive bids. Advertisement
