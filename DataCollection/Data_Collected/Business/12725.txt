January’s sales pace was revised up to 502,000 units, from 494,000.Such sales surged 38.5 percent in the West last month. They fell 24.2 percent in the Northeast, 17.9 percent in the Midwest and 4.1 percent in the populous South.The report comes on the heels of data on Monday showing that in February, sales of previously owned homes fell 7.1 percent, which economists attributed to tight inventories and difficulties in adjusting the data for last month, which had a leap day. They also blamed snowstorms in January, which caused a drop in contract signings, for the weak sales.A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association also showed some weakness in housing activity, with its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreasing 1 percent last week from a week earlier. The index, however, increased 25 percent from a year ago.With the strengthening labor market bolstering household formation and mortgage rates still low by historical standards, housing fundamentals remain solid.But the dearth of homes for sale, which is limiting options for buyers and pushing up prices, is a major challenge for the industry. While the inventory of new homes on the market rose 1.7 percent in February to the highest level since October 2009, it remained less than half of what it was at the height of the housing bubble.At February’s sales pace, it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, unchanged from January.With housing stock improving, the pace of price appreciation for new homes is slowing. The median price of a new home rose 2.6 percent in February from a year ago, to $301,400.Advertisement
