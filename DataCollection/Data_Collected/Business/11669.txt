In a statement on Thursday, the agency said it resumed processing individual and business tax returns about 5 p.m. Eastern, a day after a “hardware failure” forced the shutdown of several tax processing systems, including the e-file system. The agency’s commissioner, John Koskinen, says taxpayers should see little, if any, impact on their returns or refunds. He says employees worked through the night to get the system back online and apologized for the inconvenience. The agency says taxpayers do not have to take any additional action because of the problem. Advertisement
