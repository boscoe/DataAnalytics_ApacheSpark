It was the 27th straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, ticked up 500 to 275,750 last week."Consistently low readings for initial and continuing jobless claims suggest that the separations side of the labor market remains healthy, and we see little reason to expect a meaningful shift in labor market dynamics in the near term," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.Jobless claims dropped by 6,000 in the week ended Sept. 5.In another report, the Labor Department said import prices fell 1.8 percent last month as the cost of petroleum and a range of goods dropped, after sliding 0.9 percent in July.August’s drop in import prices was the largest in seven months and suggested that a strong dollar and soft global demand were continuing to put downward pressure on imported inflation. Import prices now have declined in 12 of the last 14 months.In the 12 months through August, import prices declined 11.4 percent, the largest drop since September 2009.The unemployment rate, which is at a seven-and-a-half-year low of 5.1 percent, is within the range that most Federal Reserve officials see as consistent with a low but steady rate of inflation. That could bolster expectations that a pickup in wages will help lift inflation toward the central bank’s 2 percent target.For now, inflation is trending lower. Import prices excluding petroleum slipped 0.4 percent in August, the eighth consecutive monthly drop. That most likely reflects the impact of the dollar’s 17.5 percent rise against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014. Imported food prices rose modestly last month and prices for capital goods fell.A third report from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories fell in July for the first time in nearly two years, a tentative sign that businesses were starting to whittle down a huge stockpile of merchandise.Advertisement
