LOS ANGELES — The off-screen drama surrounding the coming music biopic about the rap group N.W.A., “Straight Outta Compton,” increased this week when the studio behind the film, Universal Pictures, was named in a related wrongful death lawsuit.The complaint, filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, concerns the death of Terry Carter, who was run over by a truck in January near the taping of a promotional video for the movie in Compton, Calif. Marion Knight, the former chief executive of Death Row Records, who is known as Suge, is being held on murder charges.Mr. Carter’s widow, Lillian Carter, filed the wrongful death suit against Universal, Mr. Knight and various “Straight Outta Compton” producers, including Andre Young, the music mogul known as Dr. Dre.“Reckless corporate greed, disguised as the quest for authenticity, led to a foreseeable altercation that resulted in the death” of Mr. Carter, the suit said. The suit also claims that Universal provided insufficient security.Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Knight, said by telephone on Thursday, “Mr. Knight denies any wrongdoing. He was defending himself at all times.” A spokeswoman for Universal declined to comment, and lawyers for Mr. Young did not immediately respond to requests for comment.“Straight Outta Compton” is scheduled for release on Aug. 14.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
