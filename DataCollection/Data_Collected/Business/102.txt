The team that covered the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris included eight French-speaking correspondents. A Times journalist who analyzed a definitive study on income inequality once worked at the Federal Reserve.This week, The Times is celebrating a breakthrough: We recently passed one million digital-only subscribers, giving us far more than any other news organization in the world. We have another 1.1 million print-and-digital subscribers, so that in total, we have more subscribers than at any time in our 164-year history.Many news organizations, facing competition from digital outlets, have sharply reduced the size of their newsrooms and their investment in news gathering.But The New York Times has not.We have our subscribers to thank for that.Day after day, the financial support of our readers is making a difference in the depth and breadth of our journalism.Last month, I shared with you a list of 50 of our best works or collections of works that we’ve published since we began digital subscriptions in 2011. The power of those stories reflects the strength of The Times’s newsroom.We still employ as many reporters as we did 15 years ago — and our ranks now include graphics editors, developers, video journalists and other digital innovators who are making our digital offerings ever richer.They are not deskbound aggregators, either. Their job is to find new information that they are using to help our readers make sense of the world.To do this kind of journalism requires expertise.That’s why The Times employs doctors to cover medicine and health, economists to write about the economy and trained cartographers to make maps. Many of our reporters have spent years on their beats, honing their expertise and judgment.We have maintained our commitment to news gathering in recent years because that is consistent with our longtime values.When newsprint was rationed during World War II, The Times cut ads, not news stories, and when the hard times of the 1970s caused some publications to retrench, The Times added feature sections.Now, in the digital era, when so many news organizations are under pressure, you — our readers — are helping to keep us strong.Advertisement
