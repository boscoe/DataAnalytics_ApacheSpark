Staley, who officially joined Barclays on Tuesday.The sale includes a network of 89 branches in Italy with about 220,000 clients, Mediobanca said in a news release. It also includes a portfolio of 2.9 billion euros, or about $3.1 billion, in residential mortgages. The deal is expected to strengthen Mediobanca’s asset management operations.CheBanca, which began in 2008, would have about 146 branches in Italy and about 1,500 employees after the transaction, Mediobanca said.Barclays said it would continue to operate its investment banking and corporate banking businesses in Italy and manage its remaining retail mortgage portfolio.“This transaction is further evidence of the reshaping of Barclays Group to focus on our core businesses,” Mr. Staley said in a news release.Barclays said that it expected to book an after-tax loss of 200 million pounds, or about $300 million, on the sale in the fourth quarter.The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.As part of its restructuring, Barclays is focused on four core businesses: its corporate and retail bank in Britain; its investment bank; its Barclaycard credit card operations; and its African banking businesses.Barclays sold its retail banking operations in Spain to CaixaBank last year and its retail bank and other noncore businesses in Portugal to Bankinter of Spain in September.Barclays and Lazard acted as advisers to Barclays on the transaction.Advertisement
