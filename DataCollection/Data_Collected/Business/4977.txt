Expectations that the Federal Reserve will be slow to raise interest rates after a weak jobs report last week helped send the stock market up on Monday. A jump in the price of crude oil set off a rally in energy stocks.The stock market was closed Friday when the Labor Department reported that employers added just 126,000 workers to their payrolls in March, the smallest increase since December 2013. It was another sign of weaker economic growth in winter and increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to delay raising rates from near zero. Low rates have helped stocks soar over the last six years.David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist at UBS, said that calming words from William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, encouraged investors. In a speech Monday morning, Mr. Dudley pointed to the recent shaky economic news and said he expected the Fed’s rate increases would be “shallow.”“If Fed officials think the economy is not strong enough, they’re not going to do anything to jeopardize the economic recovery,” Mr. Lefkowitz said. “With inflation low and well contained the Fed can be patient. There’s nothing forcing their hand.”
