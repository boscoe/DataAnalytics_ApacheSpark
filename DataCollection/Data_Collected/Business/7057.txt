The company said the recall covers the 2014 and 2015 model years. It said it learned of one fire and found that water could get into the lift gate control modules on some Cherokees and cause an electrical short. No injuries have been reported. Fiat Chrysler said it would notify customers when they can schedule service. Besides the shields, it will replace control modules that have been exposed to water. Until repairs are made, it said, owners of Cherokees with power lift gates should check cargo areas to make sure they are dry. Advertisement
