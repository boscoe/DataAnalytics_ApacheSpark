Exxon Mobil agreed on Thursday to buy InterOil, a driller focused on projects in Papua New Guinea, for at least $2.5 billion as the petroleum giant seeks newer fields.Exxon beat out a competing bid by Oil Search Limited, a Papua New Guinea oil and gas exploration and development company, which had offered to pay about $2.2 billion.InterOil’s holdings in Papua New Guinea are a potential source for liquefied natural gas. The deal includes interests in six licenses in Papua New Guinea covering about four million acres, including a field called Elk-Antelope where the proposed liquefied natural gas project would be anchored.Chris Finlayson, the chairman of InterOil, said, “Our board of directors thoroughly reviewed the Exxon Mobil transaction and concluded that it delivers superior value to InterOil shareholders. They will also benefit from their interest in Exxon Mobil’s diverse asset base and dividend stream.”AdvertisementUnder the terms of the deal, Exxon Mobil will pay $45 of newly issued stock for each share of InterOil. That’s about 8 percent lower than InterOil’s closing price on Wednesday, before the transaction was announced.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Exxon Mobil received legal counsel from the law firms Davis Polk & Wardwell and Blake, Cassels & Graydon. InterOil took advice from Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, UBS and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans.An earlier version of the headline with this article misstated how much Exxon Mobil is paying to acquire InterOil. It is paying at least $2.5 billion, not $2.5 million. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
