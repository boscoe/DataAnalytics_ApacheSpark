Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chief executive, said in a statement.Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a 46 percent decline in earnings: $4.9 billion for the first quarter, compared with $9.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell to $67.6 billion, from $106.3 billion, a 36 percent decline.In a sign of strength, Exxon, which is based in Irving, Tex., cut capital and exploration expenses by almost 10 percent to $7.7 billion, but oil production rose anyway by more than 2 percent to 2.3 million barrels a day, or about 3 percent of global daily production. The company benefited from new production in the Gulf of Mexico, Angola and Russia.The company announced a 5.8 percent increase in its stock dividend to 73 cents a share this week.Royal Dutch Shell’s profit, excluding inventory changes and one-time items, was $3.2 billion, compared with $7.3 billion in the same period a year earlier.The principal reason for the decline in earnings at Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, Europe’s largest oil company, was the 50 percent decline in oil prices from last summer. Natural gas prices also fell in the United States and abroad. But both companies benefited from strong refining earnings driven by lower feedstock costs and improved global demand.“Refining saved the day for Big Oil,” said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil company analyst at Oppenheimer & Company.Oil prices have increased about 20 percent in recent weeks, in part because of turmoil in Yemen, so earnings should improve in the second quarter. But oil prices could swoon again, at least for a time. United States oil inventories continue to mount, reflecting a domestic glut. And companies are drilling wells without completing them, waiting for prices to rise. That means that as soon as pumping more oil is profitable, there could be a flood of new crude on the market.In a conference call, Jeffrey J. Woodbury, Exxon Mobil’s vice president for investor relations, acknowledged that the company was “very alert” to opportunities for acquisitions now that low oil prices have brought down asset values, particularly in American oil shale fields.Analysts said there was cause for concern in Shell’s results. In an indication of how quickly a drop in oil prices can erode margins, the company said its earnings from finding and producing oil and gas were $675 million for the quarter, compared with $5.7 billion a year earlier.“Cracks starting to show” was the language that Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, used in a note to clients on Thursday.He pointed out that profits in what Shell calls “integrated gas,” which refers mostly to liquefied natural gas, fell sharply to about $1.2 billion, compared with about $3.3 billion a year earlier. Liquefied natural gas has been an important earner for Shell and a big part of the calculus in its recent $70 billion bid for the BG Group, which was once part of British Gas and is a major player in liquefied natural gas.Shell continues to struggle in the Americas, where it lost $1.1 billion in the quarter, in part because of low prices for shale gas in the United States as well as costly preparations for drilling in Alaska this summer. It is preparing “a small armada” of ships, including two drilling rigs, for this effort, Shell’s chief financial officer, Simon Henry, told reporters on Thursday.Shell said that refining profit margins were better in all regions.ConocoPhillips, the third-largest oil and gas producer in the United States, also reported earnings on Thursday, posting first-quarter net income of $272 million, a steep fall from $2.1 billion in the year-ago period.Advertisement
