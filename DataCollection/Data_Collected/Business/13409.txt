WASHINGTON — Orders for long-lasting goods manufactured in the United States rebounded far less than expected in March, according to a report released on Tuesday, as demand for vehicles, computers and electrical goods slumped. Consumer confidence ebbed in April, another report showed.The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, increased 0.8 percent last month; they declined 3.1 percent in February.Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, were unchanged, and such orders for February were revised down, to a decrease of 2.7 percent, from a decrease of 2.5 percent.

Shipments of core capital goods, used to calculate equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, rose 0.3 percent after slumping 1.8 percent in February.AdvertisementManufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the American economy, is struggling with the lingering effects of the dollar’s past surge and sluggish overseas demand. Factories also have been hurt by deep spending cuts on capital projects by oil field service firms like Schlumberger and Halliburton, as well as efforts by businesses to sell a stockpile of unwanted inventory.AdvertisementThese drags have rippled through the economy, undercutting export growth, business investment and profits.The durable goods report added to recent reports on retail sales, trade and industrial production in suggesting that economic growth slowed further in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 1.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, and the government will publish its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate on Thursday.

A second report on Tuesday, from the Conference Board, showed that its consumer confidence index fell 1.9 points to a reading of 94.2 in April. Consumers were a bit pessimistic on the economy’s short-term prospects, implying they did not expect a pickup in activity.Households’ views of the labor market were mixed this month. The share of consumers who believed jobs were “plentiful” slipped, while those who said employment was “hard to get” fell. Labor market strength has helped support the housing market, despite distress in the industrial sector.In a third report on Tuesday, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed that house prices increased a solid 5.4 percent in February from a year ago, down from a 5.7 percent increase in January. Denver, Seattle and Portland, Ore., had the highest year-over-year gains.The data came as Federal Reserve officials started a two-day policy meeting. The central bank’s policy-making committee is not expected to raise interest rates, and the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will not hold a news conference.“These disappointing reports will likely add to the caution at the Fed. Given the weak performance in these two key segments of the economy, we expect the rebound in growth momentum in the second quarter to be quite weak,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
