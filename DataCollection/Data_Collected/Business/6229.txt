The Fed told the committee in March that its own investigation found no evidence that sensitive information was deliberately leaked from the policy meeting.Any disclosure of information on Fed policy makers’ views appeared to have been “unintentional or careless” and did not contain details of policy proposals, the Fed said.The Fed inspector general, which is an independent watchdog, and the Justice Department have been investigating the matter.“We have provided the committee with information regarding a potential breach in 2012 of Federal Reserve policies protecting confidential information,” said David Skidmore, a spokesman for the Fed.Janet L. Yellen, the central bank’s chairwoman, said this month that she had had contact with Medley Global Advisors, a firm that sells analysis and reporting to investors. Medley issued a report in October 2012 containing detailed information about the previous meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, or F.O.M.C., in September.Ms. Yellen said, however, that her meeting took place in June and dealt with general economic matters. The meeting was months before the newsletter’s report that said the Fed policy makers had reached a consensus on starting an additional round of bond purchases to stimulate economic growth, she said.Details in the newsletter about the private Fed discussions were confirmed when the Fed released its minutes on Oct. 4.In a statement announcing the subpoena, Mr. Hensarling, a prominent critic of the Fed, said the central bank was acting in a way that “can only be characterized as resistant to accountability and oversight.” But the financial services committee’s ranking Democrat, Maxine Waters of California, said Mr. Hensarling was just politicizing the leak, adding that the subpoena would “likely have a chilling effect” on the Fed inspector general’s investigation.Advertisement
