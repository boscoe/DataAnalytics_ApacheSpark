Financial services firms also posted solid gains, but manufacturing employment barely rose.The figures point to an economy that is continuing to generate steady hiring, despite worries that growth slowed in the first three months of the year, held back by weak overseas economies and cautious consumers.The ADP report covers only private businesses, and such data often diverges from official figures, which the federal government will release on Friday.Economists surveyed by the data firm FactSet predict that American employers added 200,000 jobs in March, down from 242,000 in February, while unemployment stayed at 4.9 percent.Yet some other economic data has come in weaker than many analysts expected, setting off concerns about growth. Americans barely increased their spending in February, the government said this week, and spent much less in January than previously estimated.Those figures caused many economists to sharply reduce their forecasts for growth in the first quarter. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta now predicts the economy will expand at just a 0.6 percent annual rate.That would be sharply below the fourth quarter’s already-sluggish 1.4 percent growth rate.With the economy sputtering, analysts worry that slower hiring will soon follow. The ADP numbers, however, indicate that job gains remain solid."The resilience of the labor market suggests that the economy is not in any serious trouble,” said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, which compiles ADP figures, said that gross domestic produce was likely to be revised higher in the coming months."If you are trying to understand how this economy is doing, I wouldn’t pay attention to the G.D.P. numbers,” Mr. Zandi said in a conference call. “I would pay attention to the jobs numbers. We can count jobs."Advertisement
