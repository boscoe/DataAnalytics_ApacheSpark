Rosekind, said one of his family’s cars was being recalled to fix a faulty Takata airbag, but parts were not available to repair it. Mr. Rosekind, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said a car normally driven by his wife was recalled to replace an airbag inflater. Takata inflaters can explode with too much force and spew debris at drivers and passengers. They are responsible for at least 10 deaths worldwide and more than 100 injuries. Mr. Rosekind said he was fortunate to have another car for his wife to drive, but he said the experience had helped him know what people go through in the extensive recall. So far 14 automakers have recalled 24 million vehicles in the United States with Takata inflaters. About 7.1 million have been replaced.Advertisement
