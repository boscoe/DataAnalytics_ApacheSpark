AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressA stock market rally wilted in afternoon trading Friday after the F.B.I. notified Congress that it would investigate new emails linked to the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.The market had started out on a strong note after the government reported that the economy broke out of a slump in the third quarter and grew at the fastest pace in two years.The early climb was led by industrial, energy and technology companies, which would stand to benefit most from a pickup in economy. But the gains disappeared after the F.B.I. made its announcement. Mrs. Clinton has led in recent polls, and the surprise development added new uncertainty just a week and a half before the presidential election.“I think the betting has to be that there’s nothing too damning, but we don’t know,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 8.49 points, less than 0.1 percent, at 18,161.19. The index was 80 points higher shortly before the new inquiry was disclosed, then went down as much as 74 points in the minutes that followed.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dipped 6.63 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,126.41. The Nasdaq composite slid 25.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,190.10.Health care companies took the biggest losses by far. The prescription drug distributor McKesson plunged to a three-year low after its revenue fell about $1.5 billion short of estimates. The company slashed its annual outlook because of weaker drug prices, and investors worried that McKesson and its rivals would compete by making bigger cuts in prices.McKesson tumbled $36.39, or 22.7 percent, to $124.11. One of its competitors, AmerisourceBergen, lost $10.36, or 13 percent, to $69.14, while Cardinal Health shed $7.30, or 9.8 percent, to $67.50.Drug makers were pummeled on weak earnings. Amgen, the world’s largest biotech drug company, reported solid results for the third quarter and raised its guidance. However the company also disclosed flat sales of the anti-inflammatory medication Enbrel, its top-selling drug. Enbrel will soon face more competition, which could hurt sales.Amgen lost $15.39, or 9.6 percent, to $145.18. It was the stock’s worst one-day loss since October 2000. The drug maker AbbVie reported weak sales and lost $3.86, or 6.3 percent, to $57.60.Health care stocks are the worst-performing part of the market this year.Earlier, stocks rose after the economy grew faster than expected during the third quarter. The Commerce Department said exports grew and more businesses restocked their shelves. In total, gross domestic product grew 2.9 percent, which was better than economists expected. Growth had slowed down late last year, causing worry among investors.Mr. McMillan said he thought that the economy should keep growing at a similar pace for the next few quarters.“We’re already seeing business and consumer confidence come back,” he said.General Electric and the oil and gas drilling services company Baker Hughes rose as they discussed a possible deal. G.E. said the discussions concerned a partnership and that it did not intend to buy Baker Hughes outright. Baker Hughes tried to merge with a competitor, Halliburton, two years ago, but the companies walked away from the combination after the federal government sued to block it. G.E. added 59 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $29.22, and Baker Hughes gained $4.57, or 8.4 percent, to $59.12.Other industrial stocks including United Technologies, which makes products including jet engines and elevators, and the manufacturer Honeywell also traded higher, adding 1 percent to close at $109.83. United Technologies rose 1.8 percent to $101.84.Amazon sank after its profit came up short of analysts’ estimates. The company also released a weak outlook. The stock is trading at record highs and has surged more than 30 percent over the last 12 months. It fell $42.04, or 5.1 percent, to $776.32.AB InBev, the world’s largest beer maker, cut its annual revenue forecast after weak results from its business in Brazil. Its shares fell $4.62, or 3.8 percent, to $116.84.United States crude oil fell $1.02, or 2.1 percent, to $48.70 a barrel in New York. That was its lowest price this month.
