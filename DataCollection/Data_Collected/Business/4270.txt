The Ministry of Primary Industries also sought to reassure consumers, saying the chances of contamination were extremely low.“We are confident that New Zealand infant and other formula is just as safe today as it was before this threat was made,” said the ministry’s deputy director general, Scott Gallacher. “People should keep using it as they always have.”The announcement by the police pushed the New Zealand dollar to a six-week low over concerns about the possible effect on the country, which depends on dairy products for about a quarter of its export earnings.Trading in New Zealand’s dairy companies and futures was halted for a while after the incident, the second milk-safety scare to hit the country over a two-year period.Security of production facilities and the supply chain had been increased, the police said.“Whilst there is a possibility that this threat is a hoax, we must treat the threat seriously and a priority investigation is underway,” the police deputy commissioner, Mike Clement, said in a news release.Mr. Clement said that no further letters had been received after the initial batch and that the matter was being treated as blackmail, rather than terrorism.Fonterra — which controls nearly 90 percent of New Zealand’s milk supply and collected about four billion gallons of milk last year — said in-house tests conducted since January had not found any traces of the poison in its dairy products, including infant formula powder.“We can fully assure our customers and consumers that all of our milk and products are safe and of high quality, and our supply chain continues to be secure and world-class,” Fonterra’s chief executive, Theo Spierings, said in a news release. “We have taken immediate and decisive steps to give our customers and consumers added confidence — including increased testing and security measures.”The poison 1080 is extremely toxic and is used extensively in New Zealand. Among places it is used are national parks and around the Milford Sound, one of the country’s biggest tourism draws, to control pests such as stoats, rabbits, deer, rats and possums.While these nonnative species cause damage to native flora and fauna, conservation groups have long criticized the use of 1080 because of the unintended impact on native wildlife. Activists have protested against its use, but campaigns to have the poison banned have been unsuccessful.The latest threat to the country’s dairy industry, which exported $11 billion worth of milk products last year, follows a contamination scare in 2013, when a botulism-causing bacteria was believed to have been found in one of Fonterra’s products.The incident prompted a recall of infant formula, sports drinks and other products in China, its biggest buyer, and other countries before the report was found to be wrong.Dairy products make up more than 7 percent of New Zealand’s gross domestic product.The New Zealand dollar fell on Tuesday to as low as 73 cents, its weakest level since early February, following the announcement, and analysts were bracing for any economic fallout from the incident.“It’s just a threat, and at this stage it hasn’t been carried out,” said Con Williams, agricultural economist at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. “It’s really the reputational issue given the sensitivity about food safety issues, and those things are impossible to quantify.”Advertisement
