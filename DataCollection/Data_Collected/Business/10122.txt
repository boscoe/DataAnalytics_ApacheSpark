Buffett beats up on few industries with the regularity he reserves for American airlines.In a 2007 investor letter, Mr. Buffett, still smarting from an errant $358 million investment in USAir two decades earlier, called the industry a “bottomless pit” for capital. He quipped that investors would have been better served if the aviation pioneer Orville Wright had been shot down at Kitty Hawk.Now, his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is sinking more than $1.3 billion into the four largest American airlines. What gives? It is simple: Mr. Buffett’s love of competitive moats has overridden his fear of flying.Mr. Buffett inspired a generation of value investors to seek out companies with defensible advantages that could help protect profit — or “moats” in his investment argot. For years, airlines did not fit that definition. They were burdened by high fixed costs, yet prone to price warfare as established carriers and new entrants like Richard Branson and others, abetted by cheap credit from leasing companies, jockeyed for business from fickle fliers.That is no longer the case. America’s airlines have cut costs, slashed debt (mainly through the bankruptcy courts) and squelched rivals, mostly thanks to a string of mergers that turned a free-for-all into something like an oligopoly. The four companies Berkshire invested in — American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Continental and Southwest Airlines — control about two-thirds of the market and posted a $22 billion combined profit in 2015. As Mr. Buffett may now attest, the Wright brothers were not the problem — a competitive marketplace was.Advertisement
