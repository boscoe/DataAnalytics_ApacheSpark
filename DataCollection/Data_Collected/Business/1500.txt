Ackman has sharply increased his position in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, the embattled drug company that has come under scrutiny.Mr. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management has increased its stake in Valeant to 9.9 percent, from 5.7 percent, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. That means Mr. Ackman is now the second-largest shareholder in the company behind the Sequoia Fund, which is run by Ruane, Cuniff & Goldfarb.Shares of Valeant have come under pressure in recent months after it emerged that the company was facing a federal investigation into some of its pricing practices. Valeant came under further scrutiny after a report published by the prominent short-selling firm Citron Research accused Valeant of fraud.Mr. Ackman has been vocal in his support for Valeant, which he first invested in last year in a bid to persuade it to acquire Allergan, the Botox maker. The deal, which turned hostile, fell apart after Allergan agreed to be acquired by Actavis, another pharmaceutical company. On Oct. 30, Mr. Ackman held a three-hour conference call and webcast to defend his investment in Valeant and to answer investors’ questions.Pershing Square’s investment in Valeant has at times become a sore subject for Mr. Ackman. The hedge fund is down 24 percent so far this year, in large part as a result of its investment in Valeant. In a recent call with Pershing investors, Mr. Ackman lashed out at the news media and those he said relished “betting against” him.But as Mr. Ackman bought up shares in recent days, the stock has moved from a low of $70 a share last week to $87 a share on Monday.Advertisement
