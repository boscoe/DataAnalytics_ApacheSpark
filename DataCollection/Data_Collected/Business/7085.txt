The company said Thursday that Ms. Tesija, who also was executive vice president, will move temporarily to a strategic adviser role on July 6 and plans to leave the company in April 2016. Ms. Tesija, who joined the company in 1986, was promoted to chief merchandising officer in 2008. Mr. Cornell said that over the last several months, he and Ms. Tesija had “many discussions about the business, and together have decided that it is the right time for her to transition to an advisory role.” A Target spokeswoman, Dustee Jenkins, said that Target would be considering both internal and external candidates. Target has struggled with uneven sales growth. Under Mr. Cornell, who joined the company last August, the retailer is emphasizing areas like fashion, children’s products and home furnishings.
