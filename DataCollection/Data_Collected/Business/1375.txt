Goldman Sachs bankers are trying to crack the secret habits of a potentially lucrative species of retail shopper: millennial women.The millennial generation, born between the early 1980s and the early 2000s, has been a popular topic of the bank’s research reports over the last couple of years as it pieces together how companies are reacting to that group’s economic influence. About one-third of Goldman’s most recent class of managing directors are millennials.The bank, along with Condé Nast’s Teen Vogue magazine, has published its third-annual survey of millennial women’s fashion and beauty brand loyalties.The answers can predict the areas of greatest investment potential, said Lindsay Drucker Mann, Goldman’s head apparel and accessories equity analyst, who also published a research note on Monday. The survey results indicate where big publicly traded brands could benefit or be hurt by current trends, Ms. Mann wrote in her note.AdvertisementSo far this year, Goldman has advised on $5.9 billion of deals involving retail and apparel companies, according to Dealogic.Athletic apparel is in, and handbags are out this year.Forever 21, Victoria’s Secret and Nike top the list of consumer brands that impress. Cosmetics retailers Sephora and MAC also make the list as do H&M, Converse and Urban Outfitters.AdvertisementTop “rising brands,” which the survey says reflects the predictive power of “It Girls” to hint at possible big opportunities, include Brandy Melville as well as Topshop, Nasty Gal and Free People.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
