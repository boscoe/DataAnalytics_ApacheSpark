Including capital spending, its free cash flow was negative $486 million, compared with $615 million a year earlier, the company said.Still, Boeing executives reiterated that they expected to start making a profit on each Dreamliner delivery later this year. They also reaffirmed that they expected operating cash flow to top $9 billion for all of 2015, up from $8.86 billion in 2014.Dreamliners are the first commercial planes made substantially of lightweight carbon composites, and Boeing has invested heavily in them.Gregory D. Smith, Boeing’s chief financial officer, said the deferred production cost for the 787 program rose by $793 million in the first quarter, to $27 billion. He said the total would continue to rise by similar amounts for the next two quarters.Deferred production cost accounts for the gap between what it costs the company to build each plane and the average cost it has projected for the first 1,300 aircraft.Under an accounting method that Boeing has long used, it can book profits on aircraft sales now against that average projected cost. But it has to keep a running tally of the additional cost of each plane as the deferred cost total.Mr. Smith reiterated on Wednesday that after Boeing increases its production rate for the jets to 12 each month in 2016 from 10 now, the deferred cost total should begin to decline fairly rapidly.He said recent delays in receiving seats for the 787 from a French supplier, Zodiac Aerospace, had added to the costs of the program.Boeing also has an aggressive stock repurchasing program, spending $2.5 billion to buy back 17 million of its shares in the first quarter.The company said its core operating earnings, excluding pensions and other costs, increased by nearly 2 percent in the first quarter to $2.13 billion. The core earnings rose 12 percent on a per share basis, to $1.97. That topped the estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had expected $1.81 on average.Boeing’s quarterly revenue climbed 8 percent, to $22.15 billion, from a year earlier.With the demand for new planes remaining strong, Boeing said that it expected core earnings of $8.20 to $8.40 a share for all of 2015 on revenue of $94.5 billion to $96.5 billion.
