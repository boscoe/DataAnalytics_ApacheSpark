To retain them, banks increased their compensation, gave them more time off and even did away with some of their more menial work.But some millennials have still been having a hard time finding a sense of purpose underneath their pitch books and spreadsheets.So Goldman Sachs is trying to create one.The firm announced on Thursday that it had started a competition for young analysts to compete for donations to a charity of their choosing. As they would with a deal proposal, bankers and other employees at the firm can form teams and pitch their nonprofit. The winner, chosen by a committee, will receive a grant for their organization of $100,000; second place will receive $50,000, and third place, $25,000.The pitches will be judged on “the nonprofit’s leadership, reach and potential for impact,” according to an internal memo reviewed by The New York Times. The committee will also be looking at the “uniqueness” of the nonprofit, and how the team analyzes the organization’s goals and scalability, the memo said.The program, known as the Analyst Impact Fund, will sit within the firm’s donor-advised philanthropic fund, known as Goldman Sachs Gives. It is open to analysts who have been with the firm for at least a year.Each year, the firm reserves a portion of the partner compensation pool for Goldman Sachs Gives, which has recommended more than $1 billion in grants since 2010. The program has partnered with more than 4,000 nonprofit groups with the goal of reaching what the firm sees as the “underserved” communities.Expanding the firm’s philanthropy to younger workers is, in part, a reaction to priorities of the millennial generation. A recent Deloitte study found that employees who have a stronger sense of purpose tend to stay at their companies for a longer period — about 40 percent of those surveyed said they would stay more than five years. Almost nine in 10 believed that the success of business should be evaluated by more than financial performance.Making money — something has traditionally been the key selling point for banks during recruiting — is low on millennials’ list of priorities, the study showed.Advertisement
