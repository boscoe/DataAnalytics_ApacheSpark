Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is recalling about 10,000 Darth Vader and Disneyland 60th-anniversary infant onesies because the snaps can detach and pose a choking hazard. No injuries have been reported. The Darth Vader onesies show an infant Darth Vader holding a light saber, with the text: “If you only knew the power of THE DARK SIDE.” The others show Mickey Mouse, Goofy, Donald Duck and Pluto at the Disneyland Castle, and read, “60th Disneyland Resort, Diamond Celebration.” They were sold at Walt Disney World, Disneyland and the Treasure Ketch shops on three Disney cruise ships.A version of this brief appears in print on January 20, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Recalls 10,000 Infant Onesies .
