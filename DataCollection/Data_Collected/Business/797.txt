The collapse of the bank also led to the loss of thousands of jobs.The Dutch government announced plans in May to proceed with a sale of the bank’s shares after Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister, delayed a decision on the offering over a disagreement with lawmakers about executives’ salaries at the lender.A group of ABN Amro’s top managers eventually gave up a pay increase.The offering will consist of sales to retail and institutional investors in the Netherlands and a private placement to qualified institutional investors internationally.“We are proud that we are now ready for this next step in the process,” Gerrit Zalm, the chairman of ABN Amro’s managing board, said in a news release, “a next step that in the end will allow ABN Amro to continue to focus on its client-centric approach helping our customers to realize their financial ambitions.”Proceeds from the sale would go to the Dutch government, not to the company.The shares would be sold through a so-called stichting, a legal structure in the Netherlands intended to protect against hostile takeovers.ABN Amro’s prospects have improved in recent years, as the company has shed operations and reduced its provisions for bad loans.The bank’s underlying profit, which excludes certain special items, more than doubled in 2014, to €1.55 billion from €752 million in 2013.ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley are leading the offering.Lazard is acting as a financial adviser to ABN Amro, while Rothschild is advising NL Financial Investments.Advertisement
