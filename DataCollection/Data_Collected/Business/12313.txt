Hill II, said on Friday that it had raised 400 million pounds, or about $564 million, in a private sale of securities before going public next week.The bank said that it sold to new and existing shareholders at a price of £20 a share in what is known as a private placement. The lender plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange, with conditional trading of its shares beginning on Monday.Turbulence in the financial markets at the beginning of the year has weighed on the valuations of initial public offerings of stock, and a sharp decline in bank stocks last month caused Metro Bank to lower the value of its offering from £24 a share to £20 a share.“The capital raise we are completing will further support our growth plans, and we look forward to listing on the London Stock Exchange,” Mr. Hill, the chairman of Metro Bank, said in a news release. “Thank you to our customers – business and retail – who have embraced Metro Bank, and to our shareholders for their unwavering support.”Based on the offer price, Metro Bank said that it was valued at about £1.6 billion.Mr. Hill started Commerce Bancorp in the United States in the early 1970s, but he was forced out in 2007 as he faced scrutiny over his business dealings with family members and other company insiders.Soon after he left Commerce, it was sold to TD Bank Financial of Canada for $8.5 billion. The investigation by authorities in the United States ended without charges.Metro Bank, which opened its first branch in 2010, is one of several so-called challenger banks to the traditional financial powers that dominate lending in Britain.Several challenger banks have publicly listed their shares in the last two years, including OneSavings Bank, which was backed by the private equity firm J. C. Flowers & Company; Virgin Money, the British financial services company partly owned by the billionaire Richard Branson; and the Aldermore Group, an online bank.Metro Bank has yet to turn a profit, but it hopes to do so by the end of this year. It posted a loss of £49.2 million at the end of 2015.It has followed a model similar to Commerce Bank’s, opening seven days a week and providing water bowls for customers’ dogs.Metro Bank had 40 branches, which it calls stores, and £5.1 billion in deposits at the end of last year.Advertisement
