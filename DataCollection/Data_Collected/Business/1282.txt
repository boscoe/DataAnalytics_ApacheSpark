Campbell Soup is recalling 355,000 cans of SpaghettiOs Original in the United States because of a possible choking hazard. Pieces of red plastic, part of the can’s lining, were found in a small number of the 14.2-ounce cans. Campbell, which announced the recall after receiving complaints, said that the plastic was food grade and not harmful if swallowed. The cans included in the recall have a date of Feb. 22, 2017, stamped on the base. Cans should be returned to the store for an exchange or refund.A version of this brief appears in print on November 14, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Spaghettios Recall: Plastic Pieces Found in Some Cans.
