The first quarter was supposed to give investors a clear picture of Bank of America’s present and future, now that the bank has put most of its mortgage problems behind it.But that outlook appeared murky on Wednesday when the bank reported sales and trading results that lagged those of a rival, JPMorgan Chase, which reported strong results a day earlier.Bank of America reported net income of $3.4 billion, or 27 cents a share, which was a big improvement on the $276 million loss the bank announced in the period a year earlier, when it faced large costs related to mortgage litigation.Still, the bank failed to meet the 29 cents a share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Its revenue also fell, to $21.4 billion, down nearly 6 percent from a year ago.AdvertisementFor many quarters, investors have been patiently waiting for Bank of America to emerge from the fog of the financial crisis, when it had huge losses related to soured mortgages. Bank executives say they have been laying the groundwork for the bank’s turnaround by reducing expenses, building up its capital and taking in more deposits.Advertisement“We feel like we made good progress in the quarter,” Bruce R. Thompson, the bank’s chief financial officer, told reporters during a conference call.Mortgage lending, however, was a bright spot for Bank of America during the quarter. Mortgage origination increased about 53 percent from a year ago, though it is still at relatively low levels. Wells Fargo, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, which reported its results on Tuesday, also said that mortgage activity picked up during the first quarter, but its executives said it was too early to tell whether that signaled a sustained rebound.In another sign of just how fickle Wall Street’s investment banking business can be, Bank of America said its trading results, particularly in fixed income, slipped from a year ago.Much of Bank of America’s trading business focuses on credit spreads, which experienced a rocky quarter, while other Wall Street firms that focus on currency trading tended to perform better. JPMorgan, for example, said on Tuesday that its trading revenue improved in the quarter.The lackluster trading results highlighted the broader challenges facing large banks. Although the results of their Wall Street business tend to vary widely from quarter to quarter, the underlying consumer business remains under pressure while interest rates remain low.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Until then, banks have to look for ways to increase their fee revenue from businesses like wealth management or investment banking.As deals proliferated in the first quarter, Bank of America’s fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions reached their highest level since the bank merged with Merrill Lynch during financial crisis.Bank of America’s regulatory issues related to mortgages may be largely behind it, but the bank still faces issues with the Fed.Earlier this year, the Fed gave Bank of America conditional approval of its share repurchase and dividend plan after identifying deficiencies in the bank’s capital planning. On Wednesday, the bank said it was taking steps to fix the problems, including assigning a top executive, Terry Laughlin, who has been leading the bank’s efforts to pare down its troubled mortgage portfolio, to lead the effort.AdvertisementThe bank said it expected to spend $100 million this year to establish “best in class” processes and controls related to its capital planning.A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bank of America Results Miss Forecasts.
