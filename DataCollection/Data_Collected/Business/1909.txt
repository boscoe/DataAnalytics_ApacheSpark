Delta Air Lines says it is banning hoverboards — the motorized, two-wheel, skateboard-size scooters — because of the fire danger from the lithium-ion batteries that power the devices. Hoverboards have been a hot gift item this year. The ban will take effect Friday. Passengers won’t be allowed to pack a hoverboard in either checked luggage or a carry-on bag. Delta says some boards use batteries that exceed the wattage for batteries allowed on planes. JetBlue Airways has also banned the scooters. More than a dozen airlines around the world have stopped accepting bulk shipments of lithium-ion batteries. The Federal Aviation Administration says the batteries pose a safety risk.A version of this brief appears in print on December 11, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Delta Bans Hoverboards, Citing Batteries’ Safety Risk .
