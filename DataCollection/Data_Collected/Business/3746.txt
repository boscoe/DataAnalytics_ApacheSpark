A slide in shares of utility companies nudged the stock market lower Thursday.Utilities were the day’s biggest losers, falling 1 percent, and their losses resumed a trend that emerged in late January. Investors have dumped dividend-rich utility stocks as the yield of the U.S. 10-year note creeps higher. Energy stocks also weighed on the market Thursday.Over all, though, U.S. stocks have rebounded from a January slump. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has reached nominal highs in February, and is on track for its best monthly performance in more than three years. Company earnings are still growing and the economy is continuing to recover.“The U.S. markets are still in a goldilocks scenario,” neither too hot, or too cold, said Jeremy Zirin, chief U.S. equity strategist for UBS Wealth Management Research. “Growth is solid, but not spectacular, and most importantly, not stoking high levels of inflation.”The S.&P. 500 ended the day down 2.23 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,097.45. It is still within a fraction of its nominal high of 2,100.34 on Tuesday. The S.&P. has gained 5.1 percent in February. If it holds those gains through the end of the month, it would be the strongest performance since October 2011.

Businesses are also likely to increase investments in technology.Priceline was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500.
