The industry employs more than 405,000 people in the country.“We have now reached a watershed moment in Britain’s competitiveness as an international banking center,” Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, said in a news release. “The balance of push and pull factors, including tax and capital treatment, unilateral and extraterritorial regulation, and overall uncertainty, are weighing heavily in boardrooms across the industry. Many international banks have been moving jobs overseas or deciding not to invest in the U.K.”Like many financial centers in recent years, Britain has put in place a variety of measures intended to better regulate the industry after the financial crisis, including a new set of rules to hold senior managers at financial institutions accountable for misconduct.The financial industry has been critical of some of the changes.By 2019, British banks will be required to shield their retail operations from investment banking and other riskier businesses in a financial crisis, a process known as ring fencing. The regulatory changes are expected to be costly for the industry, as lenders redesign their systems and create new operating entities to comply with the new rules.The Bank of England said in October that British banks subject to ring fencing may be forced to increase the capital they hold by as much as 3.3 billion pounds, or about $5 billion, to meet the coming regulatory requirements.A divisive tax known as a bank levy has also hit financial companies here particularly hard. The tax was put in place in 2010 to help pay for government efforts to rescue the financial system, but it has also generated revenue for other programs.In April, HSBC announced that it would conduct a formal review of whether to keep its headquarters in Britain, citing concerns about the regulatory environment and the bank tax.In June, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, promised a “new settlement” in the government’s approach to the financial industry, reflecting somewhat of a change in tone after years of escalating fines and tough regulatory overhauls.He said “simply ratcheting up” fines was not a long-term answer to changing behavior in the industry and promised to seek to “right the balance” in future regulation to protect the British economy, while allowing firms to remain competitive.“Let me be clear — I want Britain to be the best place for European and global bank headquarters,” he said at the time. “It’s in our national interest to be so.”Mr. Osborne has also promised to reduce the bank levy beginning next year, and to change the way it is calculated in future years. Banks based in Britain have been taxed on their global balance sheets, while overseas competitors are taxed only on their British operations.In its report, the British Bankers’ Association said that British lawmakers must establish a “vision” for international banking to remain part of its future economic growth, through predictable policy and regulation.The association said the government should conduct a review of the recent regulations to identify “unintended consequences and areas where objectives are not effectively met.”It also said the government should ensure that the threshold for ring fencing is “inflation-proof,” so that smaller lenders are not stifled by having to comply with the new rules.The Bank of England requires British lenders with more than £25 billion in deposits to wall off their retail banking operations under those rules.The bankers association also called for the government to clearly state that the bank levy was a “transitional measure” that would be reduced in scope and magnitude over time, as future regulations reduce the need for government bailouts. It also said the government should review the time frame for the tax to be removed.Advertisement
