The Internal Revenue Service wants $3.2 billion to cover back taxes it says are owed by a prominent Texas businessman and his late brother who the agency says hid income by setting up overseas trust funds. The I.R.S. detailed its claim in documents filed Wednesday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Dallas. It seeks to recover more than $2 billion in unpaid income taxes, interest and penalties from Sam Wyly and more than $1.2 billion from the estate of his brother, Charles Wyly. A lawyer for the Wylys, Stewart Thomas, called the I.R.S. claims “unfair and absurd.” The brothers founded or bought controlling interest in software companies, a restaurant chain and Michaels crafts stores. Sam Wyly filed for bankruptcy last year. Charles Wyly died in a car crash in 2011.A version of this brief appears in print on April 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: I.R.S. Seeks $3.2. Billion in Dispute Over Back Taxes.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
