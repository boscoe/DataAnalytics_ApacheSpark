Powered by healthy spending from increasingly optimistic consumers, the American economy is emerging as an island of relative strength in the face of renewed torpor and turmoil elsewhere in much of the world.Just hours after Russia unexpectedly cut interest rates on Friday in response to a shrinking economy and worries over its banks, and European officials reported more signs of weakness on the Continent, new government data showed the American economy grew at a decent 2.6 percent rate in the final quarter of 2014.That pace represents a downshift from the blistering 5 percent growth rate recorded in the third quarter and was modestly below what economists had been expecting. Nonetheless, most economists viewed the report in a positive light and saw the robust consumer spending as pointing to an improving economy in 2015.The combination of plunging energy prices and a healthier job market in late 2014 helped consumer spending rise last quarter by 4.3 percent, the fastest rate of growth since early 2006. And in a separate report on Friday, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment in January rose to its highest level since January 2004.Advertisement“The windfall to consumption from lower energy prices is showing up,” said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. “And we all know that over the long term, where the consumer goes, the economy goes.”AdvertisementNot everything was rosy, though. While consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of economic output in the United States, there were weaknesses elsewhere that could drag on growth in the months ahead and which are likely to foster continuing turmoil in markets for stocks, bonds and currencies.The country’s trade balance deteriorated, shaving a full percentage point off the overall growth rate, as export gains slowed sharply from earlier in the year, while imports surged.Although any single quarter represents a snapshot of the economy, rather than a nuanced portrait, experts suggested the falloff in net exports reflected a stronger dollar, which makes imported goods more competitive domestically while increasing the price of American products abroad. It also reflected weakness in Europe and other overseas markets, which are becoming tougher for American companies.“Although cheaper imports are a boon for shoppers, import growth will subtract significantly from growth in G.D.P. in 2015 and 2016,” said Doug Handler, chief United States economist at IHS. He expects the economy to expand at a rate of 3.1 percent in 2015, as lower energy prices encourage shoppers to keep spending, overwhelming other headwinds.Friday’s estimate by the Commerce Department of economic output last quarter is the first of three the government will make; as more data is reported, upward or downward revisions are possible. One clue will come next week, when trade figures for December are released.For all of 2014, the economy grew at a rate of 2.4 percent, roughly in line with the underlying trend of the last five years.

Many economists expect business spending to be lackluster in the coming months, hurt by deep cuts among drillers and other energy companies because of plunging oil prices.AdvertisementMilitary spending, which tends to be volatile, plunged last quarter and was another major drag on the overall trend, subtracting about 0.4 percentage point from the growth rate.“The composition was what we thought: strong private consumption, modest growth in investment and drags from trade and government spending," Mr. Gapen added. “But I think the government spending drag is a one-off and there is tangible evidence that the consumer is in a much better place than in previous years."Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As was the case last quarter, he expects consumers to more than make up for whatever softness there is in spending by companies.In a separate but closely watched announcement also released Friday morning, the Labor Department reported that its employment cost index rose 0.6 percent in December, slightly better than the figures for hourly wages and about what was expected.This quarterly survey of compensation costs is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, as well as many private economists, to gauge overall wage growth for American workers.This week, the Fed signaled it would not raise short-term interest rates before June, at the earliest. Although Fed policy makers have been encouraged by stronger hiring, they remain concerned about very weak inflation along with paltry wage gains.The 0.6 percent rise in compensation costs was healthy, Mr. Berger said, but not big enough to persuade Fed policy makers to move up their expected rate increase, which he predicts will come in September.By contrast, the outlook in Europe seems to be getting grimmer.In Western Europe, officials said on Friday that prices in the eurozone fell for the second month in a row in January, underscoring weak demand there and highlighting the challenges facing the European Central Bank in getting inflation closer to its annual target of 2 percent, which would help encourage more spending by business and consumers.In Moscow, the Central Bank of Russia abruptly cut interest rates by two percentage points to 15 percent, in an effort to ease the strain on the country’s financial system but risking a further fall in the ruble. Russia, a major energy producer, is also reeling from falling crude prices as well as sanctions imposed as a result of the crisis in Ukraine.Advertisement“We’re leading the pack here in terms of economic growth,” Mr. Handler, crediting the Fed’s aggressive efforts in recent years to stimulate the economy, which the E.C.B. has only very recently begun to emulate after years of more timid steps. “We didn’t do the navel gazing we had in Europe.”Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.A version of this article appears in print on January 31, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Growth Rate Put at 2.6% as Economy Pulls Ahead.
