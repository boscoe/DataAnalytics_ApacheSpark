But in a report that will fuel both parties in their autumn clash over spending, the analysts warn that perilously high shortfalls will return unless lawmakers act. The Congressional Budget Office said it expected this year’s federal deficit to fall to $426 billion, $60 billion less than it expected in March, thanks to greater-than-expected individual and corporate income tax collections. Annual deficits should fall to $414 billion next year before an aging population and swelling health care costs ignite shortfalls that should sail past $1 trillion in 2025, the budget office said. That would push the government’s accumulated debt that year to $21 trillion, or 77 percent of the size of the country’s economy. The budget office director, Keith Hall, told reporters, “This is an unsustainable path here for federal debt.” The budget office lowered its projection for 2015 economic growth to a modest 2.3 percent, down from its 2.8 percent forecast in January and reflecting a weak first quarter.
