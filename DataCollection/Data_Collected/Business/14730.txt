The data was shared with other European countries, and UBS said it expected other countries to file similar requests.The lender said that it had expressed concerns to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration that the legal grounds for France’s request were “ambiguous at best.”“UBS has taken steps to inform affected clients about the administrative assistance proceeding and their procedural rights, including the right to appeal,” UBS said. “To ensure legal clarity, UBS also plans to take legal steps to have the admissibility of the administrative assistance request evaluated by the Swiss Federal Administrative Court.”In theory, a taxation treaty obligates Switzerland to cooperate with the investigation, but in reality France has been unable to force the sort of compliance that the Justice Department obtained from UBS in the United States.Eliane Houlette, the head of France’s national financial prosecutor’s office, has sharply criticized Swiss officials for dragging their feet, telling the French Senate in May that Switzerland “is not a country with which we easily cooperate.”UBS agreed in 2009 to disclose client names and to pay $780 million in a settlement with the United States Justice Department, in which it avoided criminal prosecution in a tax evasion inquiry.Because of Switzerland’s strict banking privacy laws, assets held in the country have been a target of the tax authorities, with several Swiss banks reaching deals with American authorities in recent years.In France, UBS has been caught up in various investigations since at least 2012 and is facing billions of dollars in possible fines. It was ordered in 2014 to put up bail of more than $1 billion over suspected money laundering and tax fraud.In February, judges in France concluded a 19-month investigation into whether the bank helped French clients hide funds from the country’s national tax administration from 2004 to 2012.Ms. Houlette’s office has recommended that UBS and its French affiliate face trial over having enabled tax evasion and for prospecting illegally for clients in France, after that investigation. French magistrates must now decide whether to formally send it to a tribunal for adjudication.Follow Chad Bray @Chadbray and David Jolly @davjolly on Twitter.Chad Bray reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris.Advertisement
