The prominent activist investment firm Starboard Value is still trying to push Staples into buying one of its best-known rivals in the office supplies world.The hedge fund plans to release a public letter urging the company to pursue a takeover of Office Depot, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. If Staples does not make a move to do so, Starboard will threaten to seek a fight for representation on the board.The forthcoming move by Starboard renews its efforts to goad the two retailers into merging, to help them better compete with even bigger competitors like Walmart and Amazon.com.“This merger makes too much sense to ignore,” the hedge fund writes in the forthcoming letter. “It is time for you to take action – engage advisers and work expeditiously with Office Depot to consummate a transaction.”The hedge fund, which successfully ousted the entire board of Darden Restaurants last year, has significant stakes in both companies: about 6.1 percent of Staples and nearly 10 percent of Office Depot.In the forthcoming letter, Starboard notes that shares of Staples have risen more than 50 percent since an analyst report about a potential tie-up of the two retailers last September spurred a new round of speculation among investors. (Shares of Staples have also risen roughly 17 percent since the emergence of news reports that Starboard had amassed a stake in the company.)That loftier stock price, Starboard will argue, provides Staples with a stronger currency to buy Office Depot.Several analysts have weighed in on the merits of a merger, with many supporting the move as a way to cut costs while increasing scale to do battle with its bigger rivals.At the same time, Starboard also plans to say it is disappointed in the company’s move last week to stop short of appointing an independent chairman as part of a plan to split that role from that of chief executive. In its letter, Starboard plans to call that move seemingly defensive.But if Staples does not move, Starboard will say that it is willing to wage a proxy fight and seek seats on the company’s board. Investors have until March 4 to submit nominees, with the entire board up for election this year.“If it becomes clear to us that you have no intention of seriously pursuing this unique and highly attractive opportunity, it would be a clear sign that significant leadership change is needed at Staples,” Starboard writes in the letter.A version of this article appears in print on 01/21/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Pushing for a Deal.
