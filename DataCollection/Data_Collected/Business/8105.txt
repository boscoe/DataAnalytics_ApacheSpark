AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWASHINGTON â€” New orders for factory goods in the United States rebounded strongly in June on robust demand for transportation equipment and other goods, a hopeful sign for the struggling manufacturing sector.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.8 percent after declining 1.1 percent in May.Factory activity has been stymied by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand also has weighed on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Those factors have eroded the profits of multinational companies like Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble and Whirlpool.Though there are signs that the energy spending drag is easing, the dollar's strength will probably remain a constraint. The dollar has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.Orders for transportation equipment surged 9.3 percent in June, reflecting a 65.4 percent jump in aircraft bookings. There also were increases in orders for machinery, furniture, fabricated metal products and electrical equipment, appliances and components.The department also said orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, increased 0.7 percent, lower than the 0.9 percent rise reported last month.Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3 percent in June. Shipments were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent.The upward revisions to core capital goods shipments, combined with a report on Monday showing stronger construction spending in May and April than previously reported, suggest second-quarter G.D.P. could be revised higher when the government publishes its second estimate later this year. The Commerce Department reported last week that the economy expanded at a 2.3 percent annual pace in the second quarter.A 0.6 percent increase in manufacturing inventories in June also pointed to an upward revision to second-quarter G.D.P. The rise in inventories followed a 0.1 percent gain in May.Unfilled orders at factories were unchanged in June after two straight months of decreases, potentially signaling stability in factory activity.Advertisement
