DETROIT — Tesla Motors said on Wednesday that it would equip all of its new vehicles with technology that enables fully autonomous driving, but would not activate the system until it undergoes further testing.In a blog post, the maker of electric cars said the new hardware included cameras, sensors and radars that allow the vehicles to operate without a human driver.The company said the technology would be installed in all of its models, including the much-anticipated Model 3 sedan, which is expected to reach the United States market next year.“We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory — including Model 3 — will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability,” the company said.AdvertisementTesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, had been hinting in recent weeks that the company was eager to improve upon its existing Autopilot feature, which assists drivers rather than controls the vehicle entirely.AdvertisementFederal regulators have been investigating the safety of the Autopilot system since the driver of a Model S sedan was killed on May 7 in Florida.The vehicle, operating in Autopilot mode, collided with a white tractor-trailer, which the system failed to recognize because of bright sunlight.Tesla recently announced improvements to the Autopilot feature that Mr. Musk has said would have prevented the Florida accident.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It is in France, not Monaco.A version of this article appears in print on October 21, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Tesla Will Give New Cars Tools for Self-Driving, but Leave the System Off for Now.
