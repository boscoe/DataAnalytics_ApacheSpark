Referring to PartnerRe’s stock ticker, PRE, it added, “That the terms of the Axis transaction have improved materially for PRE shareholders, but only after a competing bidder emerged, only underscores the questionability of PartnerRe’s unbroken string of assertions since January that the Axis transaction offers its shareholders the best alternative available.”I.S.S. also argued that many of PartnerRe’s critiques of the Exor bids, including questions about regulatory approval,were “small beer” and not enough to seriously derail that proposed transaction.PartnerRe said this week that it was willing to begin negotiating with Exor over a deal. But for now, the firm still has scheduled for Aug. 7 a vote by its shareholders on the Axis merger.Advertisement
