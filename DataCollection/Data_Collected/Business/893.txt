Revenue rose 8.5 percent to €10.3 billion.The profit figure was better than the roughly €1.7 billion analysts had been expecting, and the bank’s stock rose 3 percent in morning trading in Paris.Jean-Laurent Bonnafé, chief executive of BNP Paribas, called the results “a good overall performance.”One-time items, including a €487 million capital gain from the sale of a 7 percent stake in the retail mall operator Klépierre-Corio, bolstered the quarterly bottom line. But even after accounting for exceptional gains, the bank said net profit had grown 4.3 percent from the same period last year.The bank’s international financial business also contributed to the quarterly performance. The division — which includes BancWest in the United States and BNP Paribas’s operations elsewhere in Europe and the Mediterranean region, as well as asset management and insurance operations — posted a 9.5 percent increase in pretax profit, to €1.3 billion. The retail banking business posted a 4.5 percent increase in pretax profit, to €979 million, helped by a gradual recovery of loan demand in Europe.But the corporate and institutional banking division posted pretax income down 21.7 percent from the same quarter last year, at €624 million. The drop came as the energy and commodities businesses soured and as the unit paid more to comply with United States regulatory demands, including some incurred after the bank last year pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid $8.9 billion for doing business with countries on a federal blacklist.Advertisement
