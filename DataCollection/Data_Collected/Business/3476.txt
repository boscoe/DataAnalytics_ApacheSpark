PRIVATE EQUITY’S RECRUITING RACE  |  Some young bankers on Wall Street are the most sought-after financiers around, with lucrative pay packages dangling before them, DealBook’s William Alden and Sydney Ember write. Junior investment bankers, many of whom graduated from college only last year, are being madly courted by private equity firms like Apollo Global Management, the Blackstone Group, Bain Capital and the Carlyle Group in a scramble that kicked off last weekend. After back-to-back interviews, many are now fielding offers for jobs that won’t start until the summer of 2016.The process, an annual rite by private equity firms, started this year weeks earlier than many in the industry had expected. And it has grown only more frenzied since the financial crisis as financial firms increasingly believe they must work harder to attract ambitious graduates. Private equity’s recruiters, trying to secure the best workers for their clients, have helped accelerate the interview timeline so that it is now the norm to interview workers about 18 months before their jobs will actually start.  Many participants traced the beginning of this year’s process to a move by Golden Gate Capital, a midsize private equity firm in San Francisco, which extended a handful of offers to young consulting firm employees on Thursday, according to people briefed on the matter. Then on Friday, Advent International said in an email that it would begin interviewing candidates from investment banks. The biggest firms knew they could not afford to wait. Recruiters contacted young bankers Friday night, telling them to show up for interviews on Saturday and Sunday. 

HEDGE FUNDS TAKE AIM AT G.M.  |  Harry J. Wilson, who was once enlisted by the Obama administration to help overhaul General Motors as part of a taxpayer-financed bailout, has put himself up for a seat on the automaker’s board as part of a campaign to persuade the company to buy back at least $8 billion worth of shares by next year, Michael J. de la Merced and Bill Vlasic write in DealBook. The potential board fight is the latest corporate challenge for G.M. as it wrestles with the biggest safety crisis in its history and the recall of tens of millions of vehicles.
Backing Mr. Wilson are big hedge fund magnates like David A. Tepper of Appaloosa Management and J. Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital Management. All told, the investors own a stake of roughly 2 percent. As part of their arrangement, Mr. Wilson will receive a share of the profits that the investment generates. Shares of G.M. rose more than 4 percent on Tuesday. “We want to help the company go from where it is today to where it should be, a world-class performer on any metric,” Mr. Wilson said in an interview.
In a statement, G.M. said that it would evaluate Mr. Wilson’s proposals. But Mr. Wilson argued that the company had been too conservative in the handling of its finances and had failed to improve on other financial metrics, like operating margin. He said that he had publicly warned G.M. about the potential of an activist investor emerging as early as the fall of 2013.

 BATTLING FOSSIL FUELS WITH DIVESTMENT  |  Stanford and a handful of other colleges are trying to use 1980s-style anti-apartheid divestment strategies to battle fossil fuels, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. But at a time when universities are fighting for every dime, can other schools afford to follow them? Divestment “just isn’t what it used to be,” he adds.
In the campaign against South African apartheid, more than 180 universities, including Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the University of California, agreed to divest in whole or in part their investments in companies that did business in South Africa. The campaign is the “platinum standard for the fossil fuel, and indeed any other, divestment movement,” Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes, even if the movement may not have had much of an economic effect. Still, divestment could have a practical effect, pushing society as a whole to embrace it.
“But unfortunately for the fossil fuel divestment movement, times have changed. Endowments are the lifeblood of the elite universities,” he writes. “Universities simply don’t want to risk not earning the money they need. And it goes without saying that if the endowment return falls short, students will pay the cost in terms of higher tuition.” What is more, divestment could be a slippery slope. “It is easy to poke fun at a student council and the idealistic world students live in, but once an endowment starts divesting for noneconomic reasons, it could be a very steep hill indeed,” he adds.
