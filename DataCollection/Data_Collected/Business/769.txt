WASHINGTON — The Pentagon said on Tuesday that it had awarded a contract to build the next-generation long-range strike bomber, with an initial value of $21.4 billion, to Northrop Grumman, which already makes the B-2 bomber.Northrop beat out a team from Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The announcement is the biggest contract out of the Pentagon in more than 10 years, and could eventually be valued at $80 billion if the Air Force buys all 100 bombers, which are to have stealth capability, that are planned.The Air Force is replacing its B-1 and B-52 bombers, which date to the Cold War. B-1 bombers are on average 29 years old and B-52s are 51.“Our team has the resources in place to execute this important program, and we’re ready to get to work,” Wesley G. Bush, chairman and chief executive of Northrop Grumman, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on October 28, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Northrop Grumman Is Chosen by Pentagon to Build Bomber.
