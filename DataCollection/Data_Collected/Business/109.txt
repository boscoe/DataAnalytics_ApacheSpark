The agreement promises resolution of a bankruptcy proceeding that was filed in July, as the independent entertainment company struggled to meet payments on secured debt of about $675 million, along with other obligations. Mr. Kavanaugh was chief executive of Relativity when it sought protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, and will remain in charge, Relativity said. The company did not disclose how much Mr. Kavanaugh’s group would pay for assets, which include a film business and various sports and entertainment operations. In a separate transaction, Relativity’s television division will be sold to a bidder organized by some of its existing creditors for $125 million, the company said. Advertisement
