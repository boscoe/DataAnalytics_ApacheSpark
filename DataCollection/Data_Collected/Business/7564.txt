Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of $1.44 a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Shares of JPMorgan ended the day up 1.4 percent, at $69.06. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, said in a statement, “This quarter was another example of the power of our platform and risk discipline, and of being there for our clients — as we always are — in good times and in volatile markets.”In the mortgage division, originations were up, but revenue from servicing old mortgages was down, pushing down revenue in the overall division by 21 percent.JPMorgan cut costs most aggressively in its Wall Street division, reducing expenses to $5.1 billion for the quarter from $6.1 billion a year ago, a reduction of 15 percent.JPMorgan executives have been pushing to reduce costs in the investment bank as once-lucrative trading desks have struggled. In the latest quarter, revenue declined 10 percent at the large bond and fixed-income trading desks.Expenses in the investment bank were also down as a result of businesses that JPMorgan has sold, such as commodities.In past conference calls, Mr. Dimon has been a feisty presence at times, criticizing regulations and sparring with analysts. At the end of Tuesday’s call with analysts, however, Mr. Dimon suggested that he would bow out in the future, saying that the chief financial officer, Ms. Lake, had been doing a good job on the calls.“So don’t be surprised if one of these days I don’t show up,” Mr. Dimon said. “Don’t read anything into it.”Advertisement
