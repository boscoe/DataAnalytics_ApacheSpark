Stocks went nowhere fast in the first quarter, plunging into an abyss and rocketing right back out to end modestly above where they began. It’s as if traders concluded first that economic and corporate conditions were profoundly disappointing, and then, with equal certainty, that conditions were much better than they had come to expect.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished the quarter with a gain of 0.8 percent after falling more than 10 percent. The benchmark index ended March at 2,059.74.The quarter had two halves for other assets, too, often taking investors on even wilder rides. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks, down 16 percent at one point, ended down 1.7 percent; emerging-market stocks lost almost as much before ending up nearly 7 percent; crude oil fell about 30 percent, then recouped all of the deficit and more to finish up 3 percent.Investment advisers make persuasive cases that stocks will trade as they did in the first quarter — either the first part or the second, maybe both. Likewise they contend that oil, emerging markets and the other dead cats may have been given a second life or are just bouncing. It’s hard to know what to prepare for, because while sentiment clearly changed in February, economic indicators and prospects for corporate results remain murky.Advertisement“The market is trying to find its feet in terms of fundamentals,” said Mark Freeman, chief investment officer of Westwood Holdings Group. “That will continue to play out over the course of the year. The market is struggling with the earnings outlook. Until we get some clarity on that, we’re going to have periods where the market gets whipsawed.”AdvertisementWhat’s clear about the earnings outlook is that it has gotten steadily worse. At the end of 2014, the companies in the S.&P. 500 were expected by analysts to earn $140.87 per share collectively, according to FactSet, a firm that compiles corporate and market data. Estimates fell in each subsequent quarter, reaching $120.34 at the end of March.

Even when earnings have seemed to be good, they may not really be so great. James Wilhelm, manager of the Touchstone Focused fund, says that when companies have beaten forecasts, often it has been through accounting sleight of hand rather than improved business.“Earnings beats are being done through buybacks and lower tax rates,” he said. “That’s not a quality way to beat expectations.”Buying back stock increases earnings per share by dividing profits over a smaller number of shares. There may be no gain in real earnings.Yet as earnings expectations continue to be cut, stocks get more expensive, even with the market going nowhere. The S.&P. 500 ended the first quarter at roughly 17 times estimated 2016 earnings. With valuations high and profit growth hard to come by, Mr. Wilhelm said, “We’re pretty cautious on the market.”“There is no margin for safety for any kind of bad news,” he warned.“You have to have everything working positively” for the market to be worth its present valuation, he said, “but that’s not what’s happening. The economy is weak relative to history, and revenue growth is not there, as well, relative to expectations.”Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, is more hopeful. There was plenty of bad news for investors to ponder as the year began, he recalled, including further weakness in energy and industrial metals that depressed stocks and bonds of companies in those niches and stoked fears that a global recession might be brewing.AdvertisementThe move off the lows has been striking in assets that had the largest declines, including value stocks, emerging markets and commodities. That signals an attitude adjustment that persuades Mr. Turnill that the rally will persist.See how the largest, leading and lagging funds compare.Find funds by their type, performance, risk or expenses.For more fund information, search morningstar.com.“In the last six weeks, we’ve had a V-shaped rebound in risk assets accompanied by a change in market leadership,” he said. That indicates to him that the economy and markets have entered “a sweet spot where growth is good enough and fears of recession have diminished, but there’s still no material evidence of renewed inflation.”The sugar rush late in the first quarter helped domestic stock funds tracked by Morningstar to erase most of their earlier losses, but not all. They fell 0.1 percent on average, eroded by declines of 13.7 percent in portfolios that specialize in health care, 5.9 percent in financial sector funds, 4.1 percent in small-company growth and 2.9 percent in technology.Utility funds bucked the trend, rising 11.4 percent. Portfolios devoted to natural resources were up 6.1 percent, and specialists in precious-metals mining stocks rose 38.9 percent.Bond funds were uniformly solid. The average taxable one rose 2.1 percent. High-yield funds were up 2 percent and municipal funds 0.6 percent.If conditions have appeared to be idyllic all of a sudden, Mr. Turnill credits central banks for it. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates in December for the first time since before the financial crisis, declined to increase them again in March and has dropped hints that it is in no hurry to tighten policy.Central banks in Europe and Japan have been even more accommodating, keeping rates at historically low — even negative — levels and supporting markets through the asset purchases called quantitative easing.“Part of the reason that the risk of recession is lower is the coordinated policy response globally,” Mr. Turnill said. “That’s part of the story of why markets are in better shape.”He cautioned that they might drop out of their sweet spot if a deflationary threat emerged. Energy prices could reverse recent gains, for instance, or Chinese authorities could make a misstep in managing their currency. A danger in the opposite direction could occur, he said, if “inflation risk picks up and the Fed looks like it’s behind the curve.”AdvertisementThe exceptionally loose monetary policy of the European Central Bank has led Alex Crooke, manager of the Henderson Dividend & Income Builder fund, to maintain high exposure to Europe in his portfolio. The continental version of quantitative easing props up markets directly, by throwing money at stocks and bonds and also by providing liquidity to make it easier for companies to issue debt.“You can see the improvement,” he said. “Inflation is better,” meaning the risk of deflation is diminishing, “and unemployment is steadily falling.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Emerging-market bond funds were also strong, rising 5.9 percent.Mr. Crooke finds good investment opportunities in Britain, where stocks and the pound have suffered from worries about the outcome of a June 23 referendum on continued membership in the European Union. He expects that “people will vote for their jobs and to stay in the second-largest trading bloc in the world.”He likes “quality names listed in London that do business around the world” and also favors stocks of companies in core European countries such as France, the Netherlands and Switzerland that engage in activities in ordinarily stable sectors like health care and consumer staples.Mr. Crooke added that he was not buying into the rally in the most beaten-down market segments.“I’m not getting sucked into this commodity updraft” or the rally in emerging markets, he said. “There’s not a lot that’s telling us conditions are getting better.”Simon Hallett, chief investment officer of Harding Loevner, expressed more faith in the recovery in those assets and expects it to last. Like Mr. Crooke, he and his colleagues have focused on quality, but “in the last few months we’ve been adding semiprecious gems in the market,” he said.“Commodities have recovered, emerging markets have outperformed the developed world for the first time” in quite a while, “and value has outperformed growth,” Mr. Hallett said. “It looks to us that there’s at least a possibility that more cyclicality is coming back into favor. Whether it lasts the whole year remains to be seen, but it seems to be a little more than a dead-cat bounce.”AdvertisementIn his view, oil prices, which ended the first quarter above $35 a barrel, should stabilize between $40 and $60 rather than “crash back down.” As for emerging markets, he anticipates strong returns, especially for banks and industrial companies, as stock prices rise and local currencies, which also have been hit hard, revive.Mr. Turnill agrees that the rebound in commodities and emerging markets has further to run.“In a world where there are very few cheap assets, these are areas where there’s real value,” he said. He also finds good value in Europe and in stocks generally over bonds.Mr. Wilhelm is emphasizing large businesses with low debt and low fixed costs in Touchstone Focused. He tends to find them in traditionally defensive sectors like health and consumer staples and in industrial companies that sell large amounts of services with their products.It can take some time for a market to reach its peak, he said. “It takes a while for people to wake up and realize that things are a little tougher than they thought. With each retest of the highs, more people become aware that we might have a problem.”It’s one that central banks might not be able to solve, he warned.“The Fed often creates excitement through monetary policy, but at some point the fundamentals have to be there,” Mr. Wilhelm said.Mr. Freeman at Westwood has a similar affinity for high-quality companies in the same sectors and industries, and for the same reasons. But he also recommends energy stocks for anyone with a large appetite for risk and lots of patience. Echoing Mr. Wilhelm’s misgivings, he suggested that his own patience with the Fed might be running low.“When we’re in this extremely low-nominal-growth and earnings-challenged environment, investors are looking for someone else to provide support,” he said. “The only game in town is central banks, but that’s not something we can hang our hat on. We need to get some stability in the earnings outlook.”A version of this article appears in print on April 10, 2016, on Page BU11 of the New York edition with the headline: Looking for Solid Footing.
