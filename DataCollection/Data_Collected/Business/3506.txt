NO AGREEMENT ON GREEK BAILOUT  |  Eurozone finance ministers failed to settle their differences with Greece on Wednesday over how to keep the country from running out of money as it tries to revise the terms of its bailout, James Kanter reports in The New York Times. After holding more than five hours of talks with Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister from the newly elected anti-austerity government in Athens, the ministers said they would need to meet again on Monday.The ministers were meeting in an emergency session to consider the Greek government’s push for relief from tough austerity measures. Those restrictions were a condition of Greece’s being granted a total of 240 billion euros, or about $271 billion, in loans from its European neighbors and the International Monetary Fund since 2010. Greece still needs to receive its next loan installment, €7.2 billion, or otherwise bridge the financial gap, to keep from defaulting on its international debt payments. But the new government has vowed not to abide by the terms of the bailout program.Though numbed by the Greek situation, stock markets in Europe responded favorably on Thursday morning to news that Sweden’s central bank was cutting interest rates below zero and buying government bonds. Markets extended their gains after President Vladimir V. Putin said Russia and Ukraine had agreed to a cease-fire, which will take effect on Sunday. The International Monetary Fund also approved a new $17.5 billion bailout package for Ukraine. 

 CREDIT SUISSE SWINGS TO PROFIT  |  Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it had returned to making a profit in the fourth quarter after reporting a loss in the same period last year because of a variety of legal costs, DealBook’s Chad Bray reports. The bank reported a profit of 921 million Swiss francs, or about $993 million, compared with a loss of 476 million francs in the period a year earlier, which had reflected an $885 million settlement and additional legal provisions. For the full year, Credit Suisse said its profit declined 10 percent, to 2.1 billion francs.
The bank said it planned to undertake several measures this year to offset the impact of low interest rates, as well as the appreciation of the franc after Switzerland in January abandoned measures that held down the value of its currency in relation to the euro. That includes about 200 million francs in expected cost reductions this year.



 PETROBRAS SCANDAL THREATENS BRAZIL’S BOND MARKET  |  Accusations of corruption at Brazil’s state-controlled petroleum giant Petrobras are threatening other Brazilian companies and may tip the country into recession, Dan Horch writes in DealBook. Petrobras produces more than 90 percent of the country’s petroleum, owns all of the nation’s refineries, operates more than 21,000 miles of pipelines, dominates wholesale gas and diesel distribution, and owns the biggest chain of service stations. One economist estimated that Petrobras was responsible for about a tenth of Brazil’s economic output.
But after a police investigation, called Operation Car Wash, that indicated that Petrobras’s suppliers and subcontractors had bribed executives in return for inflated contracts, the company has halted payments on many projects. It has also prohibited new contracts with some of the country’s biggest engineering and oil services firms. The drop in the company’s spending could cut 0.75 percent off growth of the nation’s economy this year, enough to plunge the economy into a mild recession. The company’s moves are also threatening the bottom lines of subcontractors.
Petrobras’s problems are also spreading to Brazil’s capital markets. Petrobras’s auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has refused to sign its quarterly earnings release, Mr. Horch writes. Without an audited earnings release, Petrobras, with net debt of $110 billion, cannot tap the global bond market. Petrobras bonds traditionally served as a benchmark for all Brazilian companies, and in their absence, other companies in Brazil are not even trying to use the bond market. Since November, when Petrobras failed to produce an audited earnings release, not a single Brazilian corporate bond issue has come to market.

DISCLOSURE AS REGULATORY CRUTCH  |  In the last century, disclosure and transparency “have become the answer to every vexing problem,” Jesse Eisinger writes in his column, The Trade, but all this  sunlight is blinding. The value of all this information is unproved, he writes, “and paradoxically, disclosure can be useless ‒ and sometimes actually harmful or counterproductive.”
Mr. Eisinger adds: “The disclosure bonanza is easy to explain. Nobody is against it. It’s politically expedient. Companies prefer such rules, especially in lieu of actual regulations that would curtail bad products or behavior. The opacity lobby ‒ the remora fish class of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants in New York and Washington ‒ knows that disclosure requirements are no bar to dodgy practices. You just have to explain what you’re doing in sufficiently incomprehensible language, a task that earns those lawyers a hefty fee.” 
What to do instead? “Hard and fast rules,” Mr. Eisinger writes. “If lawmakers want to end a bad practice, ban it. Having them admit it is not enough.”
