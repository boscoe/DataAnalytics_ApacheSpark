HACKERS FOR HIRE  |  The business of hacking, once thought to be the domain of intelligence agencies and international criminal gangs, is an increasingly personal enterprise, Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. While big attacks on companies like Sony and JPMorgan Chase grab headlines, less noticed is a growing cottage industry of ordinary people hiring hackers for smaller acts of espionage.One new website, Hacker’s List, shows just how commonplace low-profile hacking has become and the challenge facing law enforcement. The site seeks to match hackers with people looking to gain access to email accounts, take down unflattering photos from a website or gain access to a company’s database. More than 500 hacking jobs have been put out to bid on the site in just three months of operation.


CURRENCY TRADERS RATTLED BY SWISS MOVE  |  Currency traders around the world are reeling from the sharp appreciation in the Swiss franc on Thursday after the Swiss central bank’s surprise decision to drop a three-year-old cap on its currency. One big online currency trading service listed in New York, FXCM, said late Thursday that it might have violated regulatory capital requirements after its clients suffered losses of $225 million, Neil Gough reports in DealBook. Separately, an online foreign exchange broker in New Zealand, Global Brokers NZ, said the market turmoil was forcing it to shut down.
“I would be astonished if we did not see more casualties,” Nick Parsons, the head of research for Britain and Europe at National Australia Bank, told Bloomberg News. “This was a 180-degree about turn” by the Swiss National Bank. “People feel hurt and betrayed,” he added.
The central bank reversed course after concluding that its strategy had become too risky and too costly given the forces pushing the franc in the other direction, including a steep decline in the euro. The franc rose as much as 41 percent against the euro after the move on Thursday, the largest gain on record, according to Bloomberg. The move “offers interesting lessons about the oddly precarious state of the global economy,” Neil Irwin writes on The Upshot, and it gives a scary lesson on the limits of central banks, Swaha Pattanaik of Reuters Breakingviews writes. 
For shoppers looking to spend euros, however, now may be a good time to go hunting for bargains, James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column in The Times.




QUESTIONING WALL STREET’S TRADING MACHINE  |  A steep trading slowdown dented Citigroup’s fourth-quarter earnings and raised a fresh round of questions about the future of the Wall Street trading machine, Michael Corkery reports in DealBook. Citigroup, which said revenue from trading in fixed-income markets fell 16 percent from a year ago, was not the only large bank to report disappointing results for the quarter. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase also reported weaker earnings than analysts expected.
The uneven trading results show how much of Wall Street’s success now rests on events that are hard to predict, like the movement of interest rates, Mr. Corkery writes. Investors will keep a close eye on Goldman Sachs, which is scheduled to report its own results at 7:30 this morning.

CAESARS IN BANKRUPTCY STANDOFF  |  The casino operator Caesars Entertainment was locked in a bitter standoff with some creditors on Thursday after it put its largest unit into bankruptcy. Caesars — which has labored under a mountain of debt since it was acquired by two private equity firms for about $30 billion in 2008 — filed to put the unit into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Chicago on Thursday morning, a move that forged ahead with a planned restructuring over the creditors’ forceful objections.
But before it could begin in earnest, the Chicago bankruptcy process was halted by a judge in Wilmington, Del., who is overseeing a rival attempt by the creditors to force the Caesars unit into a separate bankruptcy on their terms. The dueling plans for the unit, the Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, set the stage for an unusual fight that will be waged in the weeds of the bankruptcy code.
