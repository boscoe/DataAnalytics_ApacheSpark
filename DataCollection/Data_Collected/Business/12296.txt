SAN FRANCISCO — Elliott Management, the hedge fund that has become a specialist in shaking up technology companies, has found its new target.Shares in Qlik Technologies, a business analytics provider, were up nearly 5 percent in midday trading on Thursday after the hedge fund disclosed owning a nearly 8.9 percent stake in the company.In a regulatory filing, Elliott said that it had begun discussions with Qlik’s management about moves that could strengthen value for shareholders, including a potential sale of the company or other strategic moves.In practice, however, Elliott is likely to agitate for a sale, as it has with several other technology companies. Elliott, a $27 billion hedge fund, has successfully pushed primarily older tech providers — including Novell, Riverbed Technology and BMC Software — into selling themselves.Qlik, which is based in Radnor, Pa., bears some resemblance to those other companies. Shares in the company had fallen 25 percent over the last 12 months before Elliott’s investment was disclosed on Thursday.AdvertisementIn the regulatory filing, Elliott described the services provider as “significantly undervalued.” Its market value is about $2.4 billion.AdvertisementThe company specializes in so-called business intelligence, helping companies analyze their data. Elliott is likely to argue that it could fetch takeover interest from a number of bigger technology providers, like IBM and SAP.Last year, Qlik lost $36.5 million — its third consecutive annual loss — while reporting $612.7 million in sales.A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment, while a representative for Qlik did not immediately respond to a request for comment.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
