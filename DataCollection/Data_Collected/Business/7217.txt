The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said that its manufacturing index rose to 53.5 last month from 52.8 in May. Manufacturing activity matched January’s level for the highest this year. Any reading above 50 signals expansion. Manufacturing growth has accelerated for the last two months, evidence that American factories are beginning to adapt and overcome the drags caused by a rise in the dollar’s value and cheaper oil prices, two trends that date to last fall. The gauge of new orders rose slightly to 56 from 55.8. But manufacturers are responding to the increased demand by hiring more workers, as the employment measure increased to 55.5 from 51.7, a sign that many companies expect additional orders in the coming months. Not every element of the index reflected growth. The index’s measure of production slipped to 54 from 54.5. Advertisement
