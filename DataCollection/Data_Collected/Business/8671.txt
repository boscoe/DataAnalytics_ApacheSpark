The ruling by the court in Assen could result in billions of euros of claims against the venture, known as NAM. The Netherlands has twice this year reduced production from the field after the Dutch Safety Board, a government-financed but independent organization, said gas companies and regulators had failed to take the danger from gas-production-linked earthquakes seriously enough.
