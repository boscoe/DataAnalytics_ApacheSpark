R.B.S. said that it would receive about $500 million in cash from the sale, and that the sale would result in a loss of about $30 million.“Final cash consideration and loss will depend upon settlement date portfolio balances,” the bank said in a news release.It added that the transaction was expected to be “substantially complete” by the end of the third quarter.In February, R.B.S., which is based in Edinburgh, agreed to sell a portfolio of $36.5 billion in corporate loan commitments in the United States and Canada, of which $3.2 billion had already been drawn.After the latest sale, the bank will have disposed of about two-thirds of its North American corporate loan portfolio, which it had identified as a potential target for divestment.In the past few years, R.B.S., which once aspired to be a leader in global investment banking, has sold or spun off several businesses as part of an extensive reorganization. During the financial crisis, the bank had to take a bailout of 45 billion pounds, or about $68 billion, from the British government, which now owns 80 percent of the company.Advertisement
