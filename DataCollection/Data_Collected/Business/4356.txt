PARIS — HSBC’s Swiss unit, the source of so much recent trouble for the British bank, has further problems.France’s financial prosecutor’s office said on Friday that it had recommended to French magistrates that HSBC’s Swiss operation be criminally charged with encouraging tax evasion.The Swiss unit, HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), now has a month to respond to judicial authorities, after which magistrates will determine whether the case would go to trial.HSBC Private Bank is facing a number of investigations around the world, including charges in Belgium on grounds similar to those in France. Even Switzerland, hardly known for taking a hard line against banks that abet tax evasion, has opened an investigation of HSBC Private Bank for suspected money laundering.AdvertisementThe Swiss unit has also been a source of embarrassment lately for Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of the parent bank, after revelations that he had used an HSBC Private Bank account to park 5 million pounds, or about $7.5 million, through a Panamanian vehicle. Mr. Gulliver has explained that he did so to hide his bonus from co-workers.AdvertisementThe parent company, HSBC, which is based in London and is Europe’s largest bank by stock-market value, in a statement on Friday sought to play down the importance of the French prosecutor’s move.“This is a normal step in the judicial procedure, and the outcome of the matter is not determined as of today,” the bank said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Those same files ultimately served as the source of the data behind a report last month in which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and other news outlets published files that appeared to show HSBC Private Bank working aggressively to enable tax evasion in the period 2005 to 2007.Two French investigating judges, Guillaume Daïeff and Charlotte Bilger, in November placed the Swiss unit under formal investigation. The prosecutor’s recommendation that the case go to trial was made on Tuesday, and was first reported on Friday by the French news organization Le Monde.Le Monde, without naming its source, said that HSBC had been trying to negotiate a guilty plea with prosecutors but had backed out when it learned that such a deal would include a fine of 1.4 billion euros, or about $1.5 billion.HSBC declined to comment on Friday beyond the statement. The bank has said that it is cooperating with French investigators.The prosecutor’s office declined to comment on the size of any fine or other details of the case.HSBC acquired the Swiss business in its 1999 takeover of Republic New York and Safra Republic Holdings.In November, the Swiss unit agreed to settle a case in the United States by paying a fine of $12.5 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The government said HSBC Private Bank had solicited clients in the United States without registering with the S.E.C.HSBC’s run-ins with the American government have included its agreement in 2013 to pay $1.9 billion to settle charges that it had enabled Latin American drug cartels to launder billions of dollars. In December, American and British regulators fined HSBC $618 million for failing to prevent manipulation of foreign-exchange markets.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
