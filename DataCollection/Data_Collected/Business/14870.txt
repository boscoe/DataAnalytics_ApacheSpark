WASHINGTON — Retail sales in the United States rose strongly in June as Americans bought more vehicles and a variety of other goods, the Commerce Department said Friday. And other new economic data further reinforced views that economic growth picked up in the second quarter.Industrial production last month recorded its biggest increase in 11 months on strong manufacturing and utilities output. With domestic demand strengthening, inflation is also rising steadily.The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6 percent last month after gaining 0.2 percent in May. It was the third consecutive month of increases, and it lifted sales 2.7 percent from a year ago.Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales gained 0.5 percent after a similar increase in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component in the gross domestic product report.

In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial output increased 0.6 percent last month, reversing May’s 0.3 percent drop. Manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent at a time of broad increases in production, including a 5.9 percent surge in auto assembly. Utilities output increased 2.4 percent and mining rose 0.2 percent.AdvertisementStrong domestic demand is being reflected in steady increases in consumer prices. In a third report, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in May. In the 12 months through June, the index advanced 1 percent, matching May’s increase.AdvertisementThe so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, also rose 0.2 percent in June, increasing by the same margin for three consecutive months. That lifted the year-on-year core C.P.I. gain to 2.3 percent, from 2.2 percent in May.This increase is higher than the average annual rate of 1.9 percent over the last 10 years. The Federal Reserve has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure that is currently at 1.6 percent.The reports on Friday came after a surge in job growth in June and an acceleration in manufacturing and services sectors activity. The strong rise in core retail sales in June could prompt economists to raise their growth estimates for gross domestic product in the second quarter.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting second-quarter G.D.P. growth at a 2.3 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 1.1 percent pace in the first three months of the year.Retail sales will most likely remain supported after a rally on the stock market, rising wages and higher savings.Retail sales in June were buoyed by purchases of building materials and garden equipment, which rose 3.9 percent, the largest increase since April 2010.Online retail sales rose 1.1 percent, while receipts at sporting goods and hobby stores increased 0.8 percent.There was also an increase in furniture sales, which rose 0.5 percent. Auto sales edged up 0.1 percent after declining 0.5 percent in May. Americans also spent more on grooming and paid more for gasoline, but they cut back on apparel purchases and spending at restaurants and bars.A version of this list appears in print on July 16, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Retail Sales and Factory Production Rose in June.
