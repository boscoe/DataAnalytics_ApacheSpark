An agreement to pursue the restructuring plan was set to expire on Thursday, but the parties renewed it that evening, as they have done a number of times previously.Prepa is one of 13 governmental entities in Puerto Rico that have bond payments due on Jan. 1. The continuing talks make it likelier that Prepa, at least, will pass that date uneventfully, though it does not change anything for the other 12. Nor does it lower a series of dauntingly high hurdles that still stand in the way of closing the deal.The negotiations to restructure Prepa’s debt have been going on for more than a year, and a preliminary agreement last September was hailed by the head of the island’s powerful Government Development Bank, Melba Acosta Febo, as “an example of the promising results that can be achieved when the commonwealth and its creditors work together.”If an agreement on the restructuring plan is reached, it would be the largest such deal to date in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, and perhaps serve as a model for other branches of the Puerto Rican government.But the climate for debtors and creditors working together has turned harsh in recent weeks. Puerto Rico’s cash has dwindled, debate has flared in Washington over whether and how to help the island, and the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla, warned that the island was likely to default, either in January or May.In addition, the United States Supreme Court unexpectedly said it would consider Puerto Rico’s case for enacting its own restructuring law, because it is ineligible for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, which cities like Detroit and Stockton, Calif., have used recently to shed debt.Puerto Rico enacted its own quasi-bankruptcy law in 2014, but creditors sued, saying the law was unconstitutional; a federal district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit agreed. Persuading the Supreme Court to reconsider has been widely seen as a surprise victory for the struggling island, and a setback for creditors, even though any ruling is still months off.The prospect of a Supreme Court ruling has raised hopes that the island will eventually get the legal framework that it needs to restructure all of its debts, not just Prepa’s bonds, with the benefit of the automatic stay that keeps creditors from pursuing claims against debtors who take shelter in bankruptcy court.The Treasury Department has been pressing Congress to give Puerto Rico access to bankruptcy reorganization, or something similar, so that it can reduce its debts in an orderly fashion.Although no such provision was included in the omnibus budget bill, the Treasury secretary, Jacob J. Lew, issued a statement late Thursday acknowledging that the House speaker, Paul Ryan, had promised to direct the relevant House committees to draft a “responsible solution” for Puerto Rico by the end of March.“Any solution must include both independent oversight and an orderly process to restructure the commonwealth’s debt,” Mr. Lew said.As an alternative to Chapter 9, which explicitly excludes Puerto Rico, some lawmakers think that Congress could use its broad powers under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution to give Puerto Rico access to some other form of bankruptcy protection.Any such power “should sunset within a short period of time after the restructuring is accomplished,” Richard Ravitch, the former lieutenant governor of New York State, said in written responses to questions from Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, which has been working on a possible restructuring framework.“This would ensure that no future government would borrow as promiscuously and then be able to take advantage of the bankruptcy laws,” said Mr. Ravitch, who has been advising the government of Puerto Rico.If some type of bankruptcy law is enacted for Puerto Rico in the coming months, Prepa’s creditors would presumably fare better if they already had a restructuring deal than if they were caught holding defaulted revenue bonds.“I think the deal will be executed,” Lisa J. Donahue, the AlixPartners managing director who is Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said in an interview earlier this week. “Everybody does want a deal. We’re all motivated to get a consensual deal and to fix this utility.”Advertisement
