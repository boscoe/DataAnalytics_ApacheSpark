It could also sell an overallotment of 17.25 million shares.If the overallotment is fully exercised, R.B.S. would hold a 46.1 percent stake in the American bank after the sale. R.B.S. currently has a 70.3 percent stake in the bank.In September, Citizens raised $3 billion in its initial public offering in New York. It was the second-largest I.P.O. in the United States last year, behind the $25 billion debut of the Alibaba Group, the Chinese Internet juggernaut.R.B.S., based in Edinburgh, has sold or spun off several businesses in recent years as it substantially reduces its global ambitions and focuses on being a British-focused retail and corporate bank and on repaying a bailout.R.B.S. received 45 billion pounds, or about $67 billion, during the financial crisis from the British government, which owns 81 percent of the company.As part of R.B.S.â€™s reorganization, the bank intends to sell down its stake in Citizens over time and to fully exit by the end of 2016.The bank is also looking to spin off its Williams & Glyn network of 314 branches in Britain by the end of 2016. European regulators have ordered R.B.S. to dispose of Citizens and of Williams & Glyn as a condition of the bailout.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are serving as global coordinators on the Citizens offering.Advertisement
