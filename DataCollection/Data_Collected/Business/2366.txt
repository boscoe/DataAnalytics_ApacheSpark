Penney said same-store sales rose 3.7 percent in November and December, lifting its shares and offering a glimpse of what was expected to be a strong holiday season for retailers. Shares of J. C. Penney, the first major retailer to report results for the period, surged almost 20 percent in after-hours trading, erasing a trend in which it lost 18 percent since the end of November. The company said it expected fourth-quarter comparable-store sales growth at the upper end of its forecast of 2 to 4 percent. Brian Sozzi, chief of Belus Capital Advisors, said everything pointed to consumers having spent “more aggressively than some of the doom-and-gloomers had been predicting,” adding that the retailer’s results would very likely be followed by a solid holiday report from Macy’s.
