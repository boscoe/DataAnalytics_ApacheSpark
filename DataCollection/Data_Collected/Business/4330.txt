A New York judge at the center of a multiyear battle between Argentina and a group a hedge funds has dug in his heels once again.On Thursday, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected an appeal by Citigroup to lift an injunction that prevents the bank from making interest payments to investors holding $2.3 billion of Argentine bonds.Judge Griesa’s decision — the latest in a legal battle that has played out in the New York courts — is a stinging defeat for Citigroup, its clients and Argentina.For Citigroup, the decision pits the bank against Argentina once again, placing it in a situation that it has compared to having a gun held to its head. The bank’s lawyers have argued that it faces “grave sanctions” from Argentina and could lose its banking license if it is not allowed to make the interest payments.AdvertisementFor Argentina, the decision dashes any hope the debt-ridden country has of finding a new source of funding in the international markets.AdvertisementThe most recent ruling stems from a decision by Judge Griesa to block all interest payments on Argentine debt, a move that caused the country to default last summer and has locked Argentina out of the international debt markets ever since.The dispute traces its roots to 2001, when Argentina defaulted on nearly $100 billion of its bonds. Most of the investors holding government bonds exchanged them later for new, discounted ones. But a small group of hedge funds, led by Paul E. Singer’s NML Capital, held on to their old bonds and instead took Argentina to court seeking full repayment.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

This ruling had raised hopes that it could pave the way for more leniency from the court.Until his ruling on Thursday, Judge Griesa had blocked Argentina from making payments on all government bonds issued under New York and English law, but he had yet to rule conclusively on the bonds issued under Argentine law.“The court’s ruling makes clear that any third-party that attempts to help Argentina in the payment process is in violation of the court’s injunction,” a spokesman for NML Capital said.Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, said, “Citi will pursue all legal measures available to comply both with this decision and Argentine legislation. In that regard, Citi will appeal the court’s decision and has already requested the suspension of the injunction pending such appeal.”The chief press aide to Axel Kicillof, Argentina’s economy minister, did not respond to an email asking for comment on the ruling. But speaking on Thursday in a northern Argentine province before news of the ruling broke, Mr Kicillof said, referring to the holdouts as vultures, “We have beaten the vulture funds, showing Argentines and the world that speculative investors — which seem omnipotent and which attack a nation’s people — are not invincible.”Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Buenos Aires.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
