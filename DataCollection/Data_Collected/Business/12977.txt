More Americans also quit their jobs. Both figures point to a healthier, more dynamic labor market as raw hiring numbers have returned to prerecession levels. Employers are adding jobs at a steady clip even as the economy has shown some signs of slowing. For instance, Americans barely increased their spending in February for the third month in a row. Many analysts now expect the economy will expand at an annual rate of just 1 percent or less in the first three months of this year, after a tepid 1.4 percent increase in last year’s fourth quarter. Tuesday’s figures, known as Jolts or the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, track total hiring and are closely watched by the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen. The monthly jobs report released last week calculates job gains after subtracting people who quit, retired or were laid off.Advertisement
