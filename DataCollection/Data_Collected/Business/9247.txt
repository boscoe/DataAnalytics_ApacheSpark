The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, seeks unspecified damages for the defects that Ms. Walker’s lawyers say kept the actor trapped inside the car when it crashed and burst into flames. The lawsuit says the car lacked an electronic stability control system, and had side reinforcement bars that were weaker, for instance, than those on mass-market cars like the Honda Civic. Porsche representatives did not immediately respond to queries. Mr. Walker died while on a break in the filming of “Furious 7,” the latest in the Universal Pictures franchise. Advertisement
