That is up from an earlier offer of £42.15 a share in cash and would represent a 48 percent premium to SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was first announced.The latest offer is also conditioned on SABMiller’s two largest shareholders accepting an alternative plan in which they would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at £38.88 a share, a discount to the cash price. Under that proposal, they would receive 0.483969 restricted shares and £3.56 a share in cash for each share they hold in SABMiller.As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay £67.4 billion, or about $103 billion.Shares of SABMiller ended little changed, at £36.68, trading Monday in London.The latest approach came as Anheuser-Busch InBev, the brewer of Budweiser and Stella Artois, is facing a Wednesday deadline to make what is considered a formal offer for SABMiller. If it does not, Anheuser-Busch InBev must not make another approach for as long as six months, under British takeover rules. The company’s previous proposals have not been considered formal offers.The prospect of any deal happening may come down to SABMiller’s two big shareholders — the American tobacco giant Altria Group and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. Combined, they own about 41 percent of SABMiller’s outstanding shares.By accepting shares and remaining invested in the combined company, Altria and the Santo Domingo family’s BevCo would avoid large tax bills if they had sold their entire holdings.So far, SABMiller has stood firm, rejecting three previous proposals. The most recent rejection came last week.The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.The brewer of Miller Lite and Peroni Nastro Azzurro has said that the earlier offers by Anheuser-Busch InBev substantially undervalued the company, “its unique and unmatched footprint, and its stand-alone prospects.”The rhetoric between the two companies has become increasingly confrontational.Last week, Anheuser-Busch said it was “surprised” that SABMiller’s board still believed the latest takeover offer undervalued the company and said that the claim “lacks credibility.”“Notwithstanding our good-faith efforts, the board of SABMiller has refused to meaningfully engage with us,” Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s chief executive, said at the time.Mr. Brito sent out a video to investors last week, promoting the combination of the two companies, saying it would create the “first truly global beer company.”Buying SABMiller would give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure to faster-growing emerging markets, particularly in Latin American and in Africa.On Friday, SABMiller, which has called Anheuser-Busch InBev’s proposals “opportunistic and highly conditional,” highlighted its stand-alone prospects and increased its cost saving targets to at least $1.05 billion by March 2020. SABMiller originally set a target of cutting costs by $500 million by March 2018.To break the standoff, Anheuser-Busch InBev has tailored its takeover bid in hopes of winning the support of SABMiller’s two big shareholders.Altria, which owns about 27 percent of SABMiller, has said it is willing to support a deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev, but the Santo Domingo family has been more elusive. Anheuser-Busch InBev said last week that it “does not currently have the support” of the family, whose BevCo owns 14 percent.SABMiller’s board, excluding directors nominated by Altria, voted to reject Anheuser-Busch InBev’s proposal last week. That included two directors nominated by BevCo.Several other shareholders also came out against the deal last week, saying the offer still undervalued SABMiller. They included Aberdeen Asset Management and Kulczyk Investments of Poland.The deal, if it were to be completed, would create a combined company with $64 billion in annual revenue that commands 30 percent of global beer sales. Any deal between the brewing giants would most likely face significant regulatory scrutiny.Advertisement
