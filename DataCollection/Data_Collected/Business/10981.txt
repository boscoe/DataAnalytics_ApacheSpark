More of the same is what the Digital Entertainment Group reported in its year-end summary of home entertainment sales in the United States. Total sales of films and television shows in home entertainment formats are still treading water, having risen less than 1 percent for the year, to about $18.1 billion in 2015 from about $17.9 billion in 2014, according to the organization’s preliminary numbers released on Wednesday.Revenue from the sale and rental of discs is still dropping, extending patterns that have been in place for about a decade. Disc sales, for example, fell 12 percent, to $6.1 billion from $6.9 billion a year earlier. Rentals from kiosks were down 2.9 percent, to about $1.78 billion from about $1.84 billion in 2014.Digital streaming was up nearly 25 percent, to about $5.1 billion from about $4.1 billion a year earlier. But video-on-demand revenue dropped slightly, to $1.93 billion from $1.98 billion a year ago.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
