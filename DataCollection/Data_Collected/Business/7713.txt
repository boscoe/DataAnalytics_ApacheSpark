In response to the financial crisis in 2008, the United States government undertook the largest bailout and economic stimulus measures in its history to rescue its economy. Greece got its first lifeline from its eurozone partners five years ago — and still needs more support for its struggling economy.

The amount of money pledged to rescue America’s financial institutions under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, in the 2008 economic crisis was more than one and a half times Greece’s bailout so far. (These amounts do not include some other types of assistance like fiscal stimulus programs and some short-term liquidity lending.) Negotiations are underway to extend Greece an additional lifeline of 86 billion euros to recapitalize its struggling banks, make payments that are in arrears and other financing needs.

The American bailout was made easier because only one government was involved. For Greece, the political process was protracted because of the number of European countries involved in the decision-making. While TARP was larger, it was still just a small fraction of the entire American economy. Greece’s bailout was a bit bigger than the country’s economic output the year the bailouts began.

Since getting help, Greece’s economy has continued to shrink, which made its debt payments untenable. The United States started to recover the next year, and it actually made money on pieces of its bailout.

The bailouts for Citigroup and Bank of America were as large as the rescue package for Ireland approved in 2010.
