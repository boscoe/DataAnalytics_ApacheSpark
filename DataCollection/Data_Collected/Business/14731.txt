AdvertisementSupported byBy Landon Thomas Jr.As one British mutual fund after another bars its doors to fleeing investors, traders and regulators alike are asking the same question: What does it mean for nervous global markets?This week, six asset management firms in Britain decided to refuse, for the moment, cash demands from those seeking to escape funds that invest in commercial real estate in the country. The rush for the exits followed the unexpected decision by British voters to leave the European Union.So far, the numbers are small enough. Of the 35 billion pounds, or $45 billion, invested in these funds, just under £20 billion has been affected.Yet to see, in real time, fund companies turning away investors because they cannot quickly unload assets that are hard to sell brings to life a nightmare situation that has long kept central bankers and large investment managers awake at night.“The market has gotten crowded,” said Ken Monaghan, an investor in high-yield bonds for Amundi Smith Breeden, a global investment company that manages $1 trillion. “At some point you have to wonder what happens if all these investors decide to go home.”The move by the British funds served as an eerie echo of last December, when Third Avenue Management said that it needed to block investors who wanted to bail on its risky credit fund, shocking regulators and rattling investors.And more recently, the Bank of England, in its financial stability report released this week, expressed concern about the surge in open-ended funds, which have more than tripled since 2008 to almost £16 trillion, or $20 trillion.Perhaps the purest principle of investing in such funds is the understanding that an investor who wants to get out of the fund, or redeem shares, will immediately receive his or her money back.For that to happen, the portfolio manager must either have sufficient cash on hand or be able to sell enough stocks or bonds quickly enough to satisfy investors on the run.What the recent developments in Britain clearly show, however, is that British fund companies are less beholden to this principle than their American counterparts.A close reading of their prospectuses reveals blunt language that gives the investment manager every right to halt redemptions under “extraordinary circumstances” to protect the interests of investors with a longer-term investment horizon.British fund companies, more so than their American counterparts, are also ready to take drastic steps, beyond just blocking the door, to prevent investors from leaving their funds.Aberdeen Asset Management, one of the largest fund managers in Britain, has marked down the value of the assets in its property fund (as well as its related feeder fund) by 17 percent, a bold move that in effect tells investors: Go ahead and take your money out if you want, but you will pay a price to do so at this time.The hope is that investors in Aberdeen funds will choose to ride out the storm and that the investment climate for the British property market will soon improve. Those investors have until Monday to decide.Hedge funds routinely have rules that lock up investors’ money for a period of time. But American mutual funds are granted such restrictions by the Securities and Exchange Commission only in the most extreme circumstances — as was the case with Third Avenue.What the moves by these British fund managers have also highlighted is the extent to which fund companies around the world are willing to take risks to satisfy rising investor demand for high-yielding returns when interest rates hover near zero.The yields on these funds can approach 4 percent — quite attractive when compared with the miserly returns that banks and government securities were offering.In Britain, this push for yield has played out in the booming market for commercial real estate in London and beyond. The Bank of England, in its report, said that property funds issued by British investment companies had exploded to £35 billion from £5 billion since 2009.When it comes to “longer dated and potentially illiquid assets,” as the Bank of England describes these investments, few fit the bill more precisely than the commercial properties to which British fund companies like Aberdeen, Henderson and Columbia Threadneedle offer maximum exposure through their mutual funds.These could range from a row of retail shops in Slough, a town west of London, where the British version of “The Office” was set, to a prime office development in London. Because skyscrapers and office parks do not trade as securities on an exchange, they are hard to value and sell.And that, experts say, is what makes them a risky proposition for open-ended funds that promise to deliver cash to investors when they ask for it.The contrast with real estate mutual funds in the United States is stark.While large fund companies like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity have open-ended real estate funds that are of a similar size to their British counterparts, they invest a majority of their assets in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which in most cases trade on public exchanges, making them easier to value and sell.Take for example the £4 billion British property fund managed by Henderson, which was one of the funds that prevented investors from pulling out this week. In its annual report for last year, the company said 76 percent of its portfolio was invested in 128 commercial properties, with the rest in cash or real estate investments sold on exchanges.Aberdeen had a similarly constructed portfolio for its £4 billion property fund.By any measure, these are very large portfolio allocations to investments that do not trade on an exchange.For now, investors in London and abroad seem to have taken the British fund moves in stride. While they reflect broader uncertainty about the British real estate market and economy after the referendum, there has not yet been a broad wave of investors looking to exit high-risk, high-return mutual funds around the globe.The words of caution from the Bank of England were jarring nonetheless.“These funds offer short-term redemptions to investors while in some cases investing in longer-dated and potentially illiquid assets,” the report concluded, warning that a frantic selling spree by investors in the funds could overwhelm securities markets.Advertisement
