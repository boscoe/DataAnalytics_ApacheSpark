Unemployment fell in 29 states in August and held steady in 11 as hiring remained solid nationwide, but falling oil and coal prices continued to take a toll on energy-producing states. The Labor Department said on Friday that employers added jobs in 32 states and shed them in 18. Oil prices that are sharply lower than a year ago contributed to job losses and higher unemployment in several states, including Alaska, North Dakota and Texas. And falling demand for coal has devastated West Virginia, which has the nation’s highest unemployment rate at 7.6 percent. Nebraska has the lowest jobless rate, though it rose to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent the previous month.A version of this brief appears in print on September 19, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Labor Market Steadies as Jobless Rate Falls in 29 States.
