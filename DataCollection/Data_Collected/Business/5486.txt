Jenkins, the Barclays chief, said the lender remained focused on addressing the behavior at the center of several investigations into conduct by its employees, including inquiries into the potential manipulation of foreign currency trading markets.He said the behavior that regulators were investigating was “wholly incompatible” with the bank’s values.“I share your frustration as shareholders, and the frustration felt by my colleagues, that legacy matters like these continue to cast a shadow over our business,” Mr. Jenkins said.“Resolving these issues is an important part of our plan for Barclays, and I expect that we will make significant, though sometimes difficult, progress in this area in 2015.”Changing the bank’s culture has been a cornerstone of Mr. Jenkins efforts to reshape Barclays since taking the helm in 2012, shortly after it became the first lender to settle an investigation into manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor.The bank agreed to pay a penalty of $450 million to resolve the Libor investigations, but its reputation at home was damaged and its then-top executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., was forced to resign in the resulting firestorm.In hindsight, the fine looks to have been a bargain as litigation costs – and the size of fines demanded by regulators for misconduct – have grown drastically in recent years.On Tuesday, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay a $2.5 billion penalty to authorities in the United States and Britain to resolve accusations that its employees conspired to rig Libor and other rates. A unit of the bank based in London also agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge in the United States.The rising costs of conduct issues has been a drag on Barclays results in recent years, sending it to an annual loss in 2014.Last year, Barclays set aside 2.8 billion pounds, or about $4.2 billion, in litigation and conduct charges, including £1.25 billion related to the foreign currency trading investigations.The bank opted not to settle in November when a group of the world’s biggest banks agreed to pay a combined $4.25 billion to end investigations by British, Swiss and United States authorities, who accused them of conspiring to manipulate currency markets.Prosecutors in the United States are pursuing for guilty pleas from several banks suspected of manipulating currency prices and have negotiated with several banks in recent weeks about potential guilty pleas, including Barclays.Advertisement
