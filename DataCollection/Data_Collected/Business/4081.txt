Mr. Schäuble announced last fall that Germany would earmark €10 billion through 2018 for public investment, saying that the money was Germany’s contribution to a plan announced by the European Union in Brussels for an extra €300 billion in investment across the bloc.Melissa Eddy contributed reporting.Advertisement
