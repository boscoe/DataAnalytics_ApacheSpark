The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday proposed a record $1.9 million fine against an aerial photography company, SkyPan International, for flying drones in crowded New York and Chicago airspace without permission. SkyPan, which is based in Chicago, operated 65 unauthorized flights between March 2012 and December 2014 in some of the nation’s most congested airspace, the agency said in a statement. The drones also lacked the two-way radio, transponder and altitude-reporting equipment required of manned aircraft. Flying drones in violation of federal regulations “is illegal and can be dangerous,” said Michael Huerta, F.A.A. administrator. Karl Brewick, a SkyPan production coordinator, said the company had not had a chance to review the fine proposal.
