LONDON —  Six former brokers — some with colorful nicknames, like Lord Libor and Big Nose — were “willing and enthusiastic” in helping a former trader at UBS and Citigroup manipulate an important global benchmark interest rate known as Libor, British prosecutors said on Tuesday as a criminal trial of the brokers got underway.The trial — the second this year in Britain to focus on the Libor scandal — came after a half-decade investigation that has led to billions of dollars in fines and has rocked the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks, including Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank.The brokers on trial worked at the British financial firms ICAP, RP Martin and Tullett Prebon Group and have been accused of conspiring to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor.Prosecutors said on Tuesday that the six men assisted Tom Hayes, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, and others to profit by rigging Libor, which helps determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans.AdvertisementAt a separate trial this summer, Mr. Hayes was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to 14 years in prison. He is appealing his conviction.Advertisement“This case, members of the jury, is about the dishonest and widespread manipulation of bank rates for profit,” Mukul Chawla, a prosecutor for the Serious Fraud Office of Britain, said in his opening statement.The brokers are Darrell P. Read, Danny M. Wilkinson and Colin J. Goodman, all formerly of ICAP; Terry J. Farr and James A. Gilmour, formerly of RP Martin; and Noel Cryan, formerly of Tullett Prebon.They have all denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to the charges.The trial is taking place at Southwark Crown Court, a nondescript courthouse along the Thames south of the City of London, the traditional financial center here, and just steps from the Shard, the tallest building in London.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            The prosecution’s opening statement is expected to take five days and continue into next week. The case itself is expected to last 12 to 14 weeks, with jurors most likely beginning their deliberations after the new year.Prosecutors are expected to spend much of the trial educating the 12 jurors on how Libor is set, as well as the intricacies of the financial industry. The first two witnesses to give testimony are expected to be experts on Libor.“Don’t panic,” Mr. Chawla said, as he tried to reassure jurors about the amount of financial jargon that would come up at trial.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Chawla said that Mr. Goodman “improperly and dishonestly” skewed his daily predictions about where yen Libor would be fixed in order to manipulate the interest rate.Mr. Read, who had the nickname Big Nose, was Mr. Hayes’s main contact at ICAP and served as a link to Mr. Goodman and Mr. Wilkinson, prosecutors said. Mr. Wilkinson, who had the nickname Sarge, was head of the desk where Mr. Read worked.The brokers were “rewarded in various ways to corrupt a process that should not have been corrupted,” Mr. Chawla said.A version of this article appears in print on October 7, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Trial Begins in London for Six Charged With Rigging Libor.
