The separate deals with two real estate investment trusts, or REITs, the Simon Property Group in the United States and the RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust in Canada, sent Hudson’s Bay’s shares soaring over 20 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The REITs will invest in the new ventures in return for equity stakes. Hudson’s Bay valued the United States deal at $1.8 billion, and the Canadian venture at 2 billion Canadian dollars. Advertisement
