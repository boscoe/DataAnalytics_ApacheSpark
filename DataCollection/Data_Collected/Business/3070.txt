Nissan is recalling almost 640,000 vehicles in two actions for a fire hazard and because the hood could open while the vehicle is moving, the automaker has informed federal regulators.The largest action – for the fire hazard – covers almost 469,000 of the 2008-13 Rogue models, a small sport utility vehicle, according to a report from the automaker posted Wednesday on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.The automaker said “a mixture of snow and water and salt” might be carried into the vehicle on the driver’s shoes and could seep into the carpet. That could reach an electrical connection, causing a short and potentially “a thermal incident.” Nissan is not aware of any fires, a spokesman, Steve Yaeger, wrote in an email.The second action covers almost 171,000 sport utility vehicles and deals with a problem — a malfunctioning hood latch — for which Nissan recalled about 238,000 Altima sedans last October.AdvertisementThe newly recalled models are the 2013-14 Nissan Pathfinder; 2014 Pathfinder Hybrid; 2013 Infiniti JX35; 2014 Infiniti QX60 and QX60 Hybrid.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That means the hood could open while the vehicle is moving if the driver accidentally pulls the release for the primary hood latch.AdvertisementTypically, the secondary hood latch must be released by reaching under the hood after the primary latch is released. The automaker said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries.In other actions Wednesday, Toyota said it was recalling about 52,000 2011-12 Avalon sedans because a wire in the trunk for the stereo system could short circuit and cause a fire. In a news release the automaker said it wasn’t aware of any fires or accidents related to the problem.Ford announced it is recalling about 205,000 2010–13 Ford Taurus, Lincoln MKS and Ford Police Interceptor models because a problem with door latch means the door might open in a crash. About 195,000 of those vehicles are in the United States. The company said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on January 29, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: New Recalls by Nissan, for Rogue and Other S.U.V.s.
