Farmers set new corn and soybean records last year as a cool summer allowed plants to mature under mostly favorable conditions. The abundance has kept commodity prices low, meaning many farmers will struggle to make a profit this year. Farmers harvested a record 14.2 billion bushels of corn, 3 percent more than the 2013 crop, which set the previous record. The record crop came although farmers harvested about 5 percent fewer acres than in 2013. Record yields were estimated in 21 states. Soybean production also set a record at 3.97 billion bushels, up 18 percent from 2013. Farmers harvested a record 83.1 million acres in 2014.A version of this brief appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Corn and Soybean Crops Set Records in 2014.
