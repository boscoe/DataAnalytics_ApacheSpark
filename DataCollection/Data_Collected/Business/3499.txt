Private investigators may be the newest front for federal prosecutors in cracking down on the hacker-for-hire business.In the coming weeks, a private investigator in New York is expected to plead guilty to charges of paying a so-called hacker-for-hire firm to steal email passwords and credentials, said three people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no charges had been filed yet. The guilty plea would wrap up a nearly yearlong investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors in New York.Separately, federal prosecutors in San Francisco on Wednesday announced the indictment of two private investigators and two computer hackers on charges that they illegally entered email and Skype accounts to gather information for matters they were working on for clients. Some of the illegally gathered information was intended to support a lawsuit, authorities said.The identity of the private investigator in New York, who works for a small firm, could not be determined.Law enforcement authorities focused on the investigator because of the clients he has worked for, including some lawyers, the people briefed on the matter said. The investigation is loosely related to another one that led to a New York City police officer’s guilty plea in federal court in 2013 to charges that he paid a company to hack into the email accounts of some colleagues.In that case, Edwin Vargas, who was a detective at the time, was accused of paying $4,000 to an unidentified firm to hack into the email accounts of 43 people, including current and former New York police officers. Mr. Vargas, who was sentenced last year to four months in prison, said he had been motivated by jealousy and wanted to determine whether any of his colleagues were dating a former girlfriend who is the mother of his son.The investigation into Mr. Vargas was prompted by information developed by the federal authorities in Los Angeles during a two-year investigation into the hacker-for-hire business. That inquiry led to the filing of charges against more than a dozen people nationwide involved in either breaking into email accounts or soliciting hackers for the job.The investigation in Los Angeles, called Operation Firehacker by the F.B.I., uncovered a cottage industry of firms that claimed they could gain access to email accounts in exchange for fees of $50 to $250, depending on the complexity of the job. These firms, several of which were shut down by the F.B.I., typically are paid through PayPal or another online payment processor.It is thought that the private investigator in New York used one of these firms, those briefed on the matter said.It is not clear whether the private investigator has cooperated with the federal authorities or intends to plead guilty simply to avoid a potential trial.The investigation, however, has the potential to shed light on a less-than-savory activity that has been the subject of speculation in the legal community: the hiring of private investigators by lawyers to hack into email accounts to learn more about potential witnesses and gather evidence for trial strategies.The notion that lawyers would countenance the hacking of emails appears to flout the legal profession’s most basic ethical standards. But security experts and former prosecutors said that investigations over the years had unearthed evidence that some lawyers hire private investigators to obtain information for cases without delving too deeply into how it is gathered.By MATTHEW GOLDSTEINNo longer just the domain of intelligence agencies, “hacktivists” or criminal gangs, there is a growing cottage industry of ordinary people hiring hackers for much smaller acts of espionage.In effect, these lawyers are seeking to hire a private investigator who is willing to skirt the law but do so in a way that gives them plausible deniability of any potentially illegal activity.“Any firm operating with ethics, governance and integrity that is concerned about breaking the law will not do that kind of work, as it could be illegal without authorization from the email account owner,” said Rocco Grillo, a managing director and leader of the global incident response and forensics investigation practice for Protiviti, a global risk consulting firm. “But does it go on? Sure, in some cases.”Daniel B. Garrie, executive managing partner with Law and Forensics, a computer security consulting firm that specializes in working with law firms, said that because some private investigation firms are known to sometimes engage hackers, lawyers needed to be careful about hiring outside investigators.“A law firm is well advised to create a written record with the private investigator so there is no misunderstanding later on,” said Mr. Garrie, who is a lawyer. “A lawyer should never hire an individual to hack except in a very narrow and limited circumstance where the side being hacked has consented to the action or there is a court order permitting the hacking.”In London, a private investigator played a chief role in the criminal prosecution of Andy Coulson, the former editor of the tabloid News of the World, which had a practice of hacking into voice mail messages left on mobile phones. The investigation found that some editors of the tabloid, which is now defunct, had paid an investigator to hack into voice mail messages as a source of leads for articles.In the United States, the hacking that some private investigators are involved with is far different from the recent prominent online attacks on companies like Anthem, Target, Sony and JPMorgan Chase. In those cases, cybercriminals or hackers, often working with the blessing of foreign governments, initiated large-scale assaults to obtain the internal emails of executives or sensitive personal information about customers or employees.Much of the hacking by private investigators is narrower in scope, usually limited to obtaining email login credentials or unearthing information from social media accounts, security experts said. It is similar to many of the dubiously legal jobs now being advertised on Hacker’s List, a four-month-old online forum where hackers can bid anonymously for a job posted by person looking to conduct some espionage.A representative for Hacker’s List, which warns customers not to post jobs that involve breaking the law, said 181 of the 1,942 active projects posted on the website had been completed by a hacker.A version of this article appears in print on 02/13/2015, on page B1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Private Eye Said to Face Prosecution In a Hacking .
