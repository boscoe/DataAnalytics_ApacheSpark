Richard B. Handler, the head of the investment bank Jefferies, turned down a $2.2 million bonus after the bank suffered a difficult final quarter in 2014. The compensation committee at Jefferies’s parent, the Leucadia National Corporation, where Mr. Handler is also chief executive, was prepared to offer Mr. Handler and the president, Brian P. Friedman, $2.2 million cash bonuses, according to a regulatory filing made on Wednesday. The filing said that both Mr. Handler and Mr. Friedman chose to receive no bonus for the year. Their long-term stock compensation was also cut by 67,000 shares, which is worth about $1.5 million at the current share value. That reduction was because Jefferies failed to meet its performance targets. Leucadia’s stock price fell 20 percent during 2014. Mr. Handler’s reduced pay package stands in stark contrast to his compensation two years ago, when he received $19 million, more than the pay of chief executives at some of the biggest banks, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Since then, after facing questions about its holdings of European bonds, Jefferies gained stability by merging with the corporate conglomerate Leucadia.  In his first year running both Leucadia and Jefferies, Mr. Handler’s pay package fell to $3.1 million, including a $1.8 million bonus. In the final quarter of 2014, Jefferies suffered a loss of $92.4 million after revenue from its bond trading desks fell 73 percent. Jefferies is one of the last firms trying to succeed with the traditional Wall Street model of trading, underwriting and advisory work.
