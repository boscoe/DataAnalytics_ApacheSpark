KramerMOSCOW — Kazakhstan’s currency, the tenge, plunged by about a quarter on Thursday after the central bank stopped managing the exchange rate, prompting fears that a wider emerging market currency rout could be coming.The surprise move in Kazakhstan was in response to falling prices of oil, the country’s main export, and earlier devaluations by its two main trading partners, Russia and China.Also on Thursday, Vietnam devalued the dong, and currencies as far afield as the Brazilian real and the South African rand started to skid.The next to drop, financial analysts say, will most likely be the currencies of Kazakhstan’s neighbors in Central Asia, a poor region with a population of about 50 million people: the Kyrgyz som, the Turkmen manat and the Tajik somoni.The Kazak government had spent about $28 billion propping up the tenge over the last two years, President Nursultan Nazarbayev said in a televised meeting with the directors of major Kazakh companies. Continuing support for the tenge after China’s devaluation, he said, risked spending down hard currency and gold reserves, and hurting domestic producers.“The price of this policy would have been shrinking output in the country, a loss of jobs and burning hard currency, that is, our reserves,” he said. “The state would have moved toward ruin.”Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Karim Massimov had announced that the central bank would pursue inflation targeting rather than an exchange-rate-targeting policy, in essence withdrawing support for the currency, prompting a run on banks and automated teller machines, which quickly ran out of dollars.Led by China, emerging market economies are slowing, and Kazakhstan, the most commercially dynamic and wealthy of the former Soviet Central Asian states, is no exception. Growth averaged about 6 percent from 2011 until 2014, but the oil-dependent economy is expected to grow only 1.8 percent this year.The currency devaluation was inevitable, Mr. Nazarbayev told the company directors. He asked the executives to buy tenge with hard currency earnings from exports to help ease the decline, mirroring a policy Russia used to soften a plunge in the ruble last winter.“In a bad and unclear situation on our foreign markets,” he said, “this was a necessary measure and we had no alternatives. You know, we planned our programs differently, but a crisis always brings changes.” Advertisement
