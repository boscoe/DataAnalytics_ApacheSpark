A group led by GO Scale Capital, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners, agreed in March to acquire an 80.1 percent stake in the Philips unit, called Lumileds, for as much as $2.9 billion. Philips combined the lighting and LED components operations into a stand-alone company in 2014. Philips said in October that the closing of the deal was “uncertain” after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body that includes representatives from the Treasury and Justice Departments, raised “unforeseen concerns” about the deal. GO Scale Capital has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and California. It has said that its goal is to “scale up its investments in China for global markets.” Advertisement
