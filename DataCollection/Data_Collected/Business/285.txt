Gold, the BioMed Realty chairman, president and chief executive, said in a news release.“However, we believe that the public markets are not adequately valuing our assets and proven business model,” he added. “Entering into this transaction with Blackstone fulfills our board of directors’ mission to maximize stockholder value.”The transaction has been unanimously approved by BioMed Realty’s board of directors and is expected to close in the first quarter.Morgan Stanley and Raymond James and the law firm Latham & Watkins advised BioMed Realty, while Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett advised Blackstone.Advertisement
