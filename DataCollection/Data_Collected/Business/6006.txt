LONDON — The Italian investment company Exor raised the ante on Tuesday in its competing bid for the reinsurer PartnerRe, saying it was willing to pay $6.8 billion in cash.Earlier this month, PartnerRe’s board rejected Exor’s prior offer and said it was committed to its merger with Axis Capital Holdings.On Tuesday, Exor, which is controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, said that it had delivered an “irrevocable and binding offer” to PartnerRe’s board in which it would offer $137.50 a share in cash for PartnerRe, valuing the company at $6.8 billion. It wants PartnerRe’s directors to recommend that shareholders accept the deal.“Exor’s binding offer clearly delivers superior and certain value for PartnerRe shareholders, and provides a more attractive outcome for the company’s employees and clients,” John Elkann, the Exor chairman and chief executive, said in a news release.Advertisement“We hope the PartnerRe Board agrees and does the right thing. In any event, we believe PartnerRe shareholders deserve the opportunity to choose our offer and, in order to do so, we urge them to vote against the inferior Axis transaction.”AdvertisementAfter the market closed on Tuesday, PartnerRe said it would review the revised Exor offer. “PartnerRe will have no further comment on Exor’s proposal until the board has completed its review,” it said in a statement.Exor also said on Tuesday that it was PartnerRe’s largest shareholder with a 9.32 percent stake in the reinsurer.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
