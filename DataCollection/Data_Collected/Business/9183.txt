The head of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, told The Associated Press that the recent decision by the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates gave breathing room to developing countries. He said the World Bank would use this extra time to encourage those countries to make necessary reforms to ensure that “when the rate does go up, you won’t see this mass exodus of investors.” Mr. Kim also said that China’s shift to a service- and consumption-driven economy, though resulting in “bumpiness” in its growth rate, would lead to “much more sustainable and higher-quality growth.”A version of this brief appears in print on September 25, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Developing Nations Said to Gain From Fed’s Decision on Rates.
