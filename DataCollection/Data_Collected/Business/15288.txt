AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicola ClarkBritain’s top anticorruption watchdog confirmed on Monday that it had opened a formal investigation against Airbus Group after finding “irregularities” in some of the European aerospace group’s dealings.The inquiry by the Serious Fraud Office, which investigates complex instances of corruption, relates to the company’s dealings with third-party agents to sell passenger jets overseas. The European plane maker admitted in April that it had failed to accurately report the involvement of independent consultants in deals in which Airbus had sought loans on behalf of customers from Britain’s export credit agency.The anticorruption agency declined to provide further details, citing the confidentiality of the inquiry, which, based on past such investigations, could take years to conclude.Airbus has not revealed the extent of the irregularities, which it said it had discovered while conducting an audit of the company’s business practices that began early this year. It is also not clear which countries or customers may be involved, or for how long the practices occurred before they were reported. In a footnote to its half-yearly financial results published July 27, Airbus referred only to “misstatements and omissions” in its reporting on certain transactions that were brokered by a third-party intermediary.The opening of the investigation nevertheless casts a shadow over the company at a time when a recent boom in global aircraft sales had been showing signs of slowing.Uncertainty over whether Airbus properly vetted its dealings with outside consultants had already prompted UK Export Finance, a British agency, to suspend all Airbus financing deals this spring. French and German agencies have taken similar steps.Airbus says the impact of the export credit freeze has so far been minimal. Just 6 percent of new plane deliveries are currently dependent on state-guaranteed loans, according to the company. That is well below the levels seen at the height of the global financial crisis, when up to one-third of jet sales by Airbus and its American rival, Boeing, relied on export credit. The two companies each control roughly half of the global market for passenger jets with more than 150 seats.Airbus has nevertheless said that restoring access to export credit remains a priority. The company is negotiating with the British, French and German agencies over a process for doing so before the end of the year, Martin Aguera, an Airbus spokesman, said.In a statement, the company said that it was cooperating with the Serious Fraud Office investigation.The case is not the first time that Airbus has run afoul of Britain’s strict anticorruption laws.In 2011, the Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into allegations that one of the group’s military subsidiaries bribed Saudi Arabian officials to win a multibillion dollar contract for a satellite communications system. That inquiry is still continuing.Follow Nicola Clark on Twitter @_nicolaclark.Advertisement
