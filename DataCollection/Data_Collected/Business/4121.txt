In Debt By                     
STEPHEN J. LUBBEN

MARCH 4, 2015
In a world of negative interest rates, it certainly pays to be a borrower, Shakespeare’s concerns notwithstanding.But such a world is a strange place, especially for a restructuring lawyer. Up is down, and lenders might benefit from defaults.This is something of a theoretical exercise at this point.European sovereign nations have issued debt with negative returns, with Austria being the most recent. Some European corporations have gone negative in the market, but the issuer does not benefit from that.And the sovereign nations in question are core members of the European Union who are not apt to be put through the default wringer to the same extent that Greece was.AdvertisementNonetheless, the advent of negative interest rates in low-risk sovereign nations does suggest that Europe is entering a world where default is almost impossible, one all too familiar to bankruptcy professionals in the United States.AdvertisementEven issuers of distressed debt are going to be able to refinance at an interest rate lower than the one on their current outstanding debt if the risk-free rate is negative.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They can only hope that the push to raise interest rates here will result in more work to come.The European restructuring community may be just about enter that same phase, where demand for their services falls off a cliff.The rise of negative interest rates in the European Union also has implications for the many American distressed debt investors who decamped for Europe (mostly London) in the past few years.In a world without default, it may be time for them to come home.Stephen J.
