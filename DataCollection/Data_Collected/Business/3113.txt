It was the biggest weekly decline since November 2012. The drop exceeded economists’ expectations for a fall to 300,000, and it reversed increases from preceding weeks. Economists had largely dismissed that rise as “noise,” given the difficulties of adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations at the start of the year.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell by 8,250 last week to 298,500.The reports bolster views that the labor market is tightening; on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised its assessment of the labor market and the overall economy.While the United States appears to be bucking a weakening global economy, housing remains a soft spot.The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that signed contracts to buy previously owned homes tumbled to an eight-month low in December. And separately, the Commerce Department said the homeownership rate dropped to a 20-year low in the fourth quarter as more Americans opted to rent rather than buy homes.But with the labor market improving and the government moving to ease credit conditions, housing should regain some speed.“We retain an optimistic outlook on housing, even as we caution that momentum is likely to remain choppy over the near term,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.The employment report for January, to be released next week, is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 230,000 positions after rising 252,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the 12th consecutive month of jobs gains above 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994.The new-claims report on Thursday showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell by 71,000 to 2.39 million in the week that ended Jan. 17. The so-called continuing claims covered the period during which the government surveyed households for the unemployment rate.Continuing claims fell by 22,000 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting another drop in the jobless rate, which stands at 5.6 percent, a six-and-a-half-year low.Advertisement
