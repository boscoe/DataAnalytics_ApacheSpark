The changes would make listings much easier, potentially reducing the need for backdoor listings, in which a company enters the stock market by taking over an already-listed company, he added.Investors also drew little solace from government figures for November, released on Sunday. They showed a sixth consecutive month of decline in industrial companies’ profit. Sentiment was also soured by a slump in so-called B shares — stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen but denominated in hard currencies.The China Securities Regulatory Commission began speaking in early 2014 of moving away from its current approval-based system — seen as distorting the I.P.O. market and encouraging official corruption — to a registration system, in which the market decides who gets to list and for how much.Advertisement
