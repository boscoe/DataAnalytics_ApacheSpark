“The central bank came out all guns blazing,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency trader OANDA.AdvertisementBut the bank’s efforts also underlined the weakness of the 19-country eurozone.

Europe is really struggling.”Thursday was the seven-year anniversary of the current bull market, the third longest in history. Investors in mutual funds that track the broad U.S. market have more than tripled their money since a 6 percent jump seven years ago. But it is also a bull market that has been mistrusted and unloved from the start.Now, worries are high that the market has already topped out, and that a recession may be coming to knock the S.&P. 500 index down again.
