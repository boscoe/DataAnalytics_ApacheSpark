After China shocked investors on Tuesday by devaluing the country’s currency, a wave of selling swept the globe. The price of oil plunged, the currencies of other countries tumbled and stock markets skidded on every continent.For once, the markets may not have overreacted.Investors have been able to live with the problems brewing in China’s economy for years. The country’s authorities always seemed to have the financial firepower and the will to rev up China’s $10 trillion economy when it sputtered.But the devaluation, along with the authorities’ aggressive efforts earlier in the summer to shore up the country’s stock market, has rekindled long-running concerns that China’s economy is substantially weaker than official figures suggest — and that its leadership is running out of ways to bolster growth.James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said investors’ perceptions of China dimmed after the authorities intervened to stem the selling of Chinese stocks. “Now, this devaluation has just made it worse,” he said. “It’s almost an admission that they’ve been unable to arrest the slowdown.”AdvertisementThe devaluation of the renminbi, nearly 2 percent against the dollar, may help revive the economy. When a country devalues, its goods cost less in other currencies, like the dollar, which can lead to an increase in demand for those goods around the world.AdvertisementStill, investors can view devaluations warily.Some analysts had recently speculated that China would adjust its exchange rate. But the change, when it came, was far greater than expected, prompting analysts to ask whether the Chinese authorities were acting from a position of weakness.“This is the second time in two or three months that they surprised us with what seemed like abrupt policy changes,” said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS. “They were almost panicky measures — that is the concern.”Mr. Mariscal added that investors might have expected the adjustment to be a 2 percent decline in a year, not 2 percent in a day.
                China’s devaluation of the renminbi was the latest in a series of moves over the past two months to help boost the slowing Chinese economy.            The move rippled through the markets on Tuesday.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 212.33 points, or 1.21 percent, to close at 17,402.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500, a broader index favored by investors, declined by 0.96 percent to close at 2,084.07.Oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, declined by 3.75 percent to $43.35 a barrel. The 10-year Treasury note, a safe haven on troubled days in the market, rose in price, pushing its yield down to 2.137 percent. The currencies of Asian countries, including South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, declined on Tuesday.As investors grope for explanations for the devaluation, they point to the need for stemming capital outflows from the country, which have picked up in recent months. It is an indication, at least somewhat, that Chinese investors — fearing their currency was overvalued and a devaluation was coming — are looking for better opportunities elsewhere.“All this hot money outflow was people in China realizing they had an overvalued currency — and spending when they could,” said Atul Lele, chief investment officer at Deltec International, an investment firm. But there is a danger that the capital outflows may now speed up, if the Chinese investors believe the renminbi could be devalued again.AdvertisementThe sharp reaction among investors also reflects the mistrust toward economic data coming out of China. While the country’s goal is to grow 7 percent this year, a report last week from Bank of America Merrill Lynch caused a particular stir in the markets. It cited data that suggested China’s economy may already be in a ditch, including figures showing that power generation was flattening, cement production contracting and steel output slowing.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If more signs of slowing emerge, investors might expect a further devaluation.That, in turn, could prompt other countries to devalue, to prevent Chinese exporters from gaining an outsize advantage in world markets. If that happens, fears of a full-on currency war would soon grip the markets.In a sign of how fears about China can have negative consequences far afield, stock markets and currencies fell in Latin America on Tuesday. Countries in the region are big exporters to China and in recent years they have also received substantial investments from the country. Seeing trouble in China might cause other investors in Latin America to pull back.“Everyone has to back up and at least put their projects on pause when China has to tweak more than the stock market to get its economy growing as quickly as it did in the past,” said Jim Vogel, a strategist at FTN Financial.Russia, too, is watching closely. Any further slowdown in China — its largest trading partner — could weigh on Russia, at a time when it is already dealing with the dual headwinds of Western sanctions and low oil prices. On Tuesday, the Russian ruble was off roughly 2 percent.The United States economy would most likely get hit if China and many other countries continued to devalue. American companies would find it harder to export, depressing their earnings. “We thought we were at the end of the stronger dollar cycle — and clearly this could extend it,” Mr. Mariscal said.Still, some analysts say the fretting has gone too far. In devaluing, China’s authorities, they assert, acted mostly out of a long-term desire to allow the market to have a greater role in setting the level of its currency.“We take China policy makers at their word that this is meant to introduce greater market forces into determining the exchange rate,” Brown Brothers Harriman said in a research note on Tuesday, adding that any further declines are likely to be restrained. The country also has billions of dollars in reserves that it can use to influence the exchange rate and put out financial fires.AdvertisementOthers said that the devaluation was sensible because the currency was becoming quite overvalued, and was merely a catch-up move that would have benefits for the economy. “China’s wages haven’t increased and their cost base hasn’t gone up,” Mr. Lele said, “but they have been slowly becoming less competitive.” And by loosening the way it manages its currency, China in effect will gain more flexibility in conducting its domestic monetary policy, leeway it will need as it tries to stimulate the economy, Mr. Lele contended.Even so, China will most likely remain a big worry among investors until it posts strong and convincing growth figures. Some investors are wondering whether China is just another emerging market, vulnerable to global money flows.As the Federal Reserve now prepares to raise interest rates, the supply of dollars around the world has slowed, causing financial havoc in many developing countries. That tightening could make life harder for China — and the authorities there may already have seen that.“The growth scare is what is affecting the markets right now,” Mr. Mariscal said. “They are worried that Chinese growth is much, much weaker than people expected.”Andrew E.
