On Tuesday a person with knowledge of the plan, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss still-private aspects of a deal, said the company in question was STX Entertainment.The news landed in Hollywood with a wait-and-see shrug. That is because Chinese investors, in particular Huayi Brothers, now have a track record in the movie capital of arriving with a splash and then vanishing. A much-promoted deal between Huayi Brothers and Legendary Entertainment, a company behind hits like “Godzilla” and “300,” collapsed in 2013.Last year, Huayi Brothers said it would invest upward of $120 million in a film venture lead by Jeffrey Robinov, an ousted Warner executive; that deal also fizzled.An STX spokesman, Steve Elzer, said in an email, “We don’t comment on rumors.” Huayi Brothers did not respond to a query.STX is a fledgling movie company backed by TPG Growth, Hony Capital and, among others, Gigi Pritzker, an heiress turned movie producer. Leading STX is a Robert Simonds, a producer of films like “Furry Vengeance” and “Cheaper by the Dozen,” and a group of executives who were pushed out of senior jobs at legacy studios like 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures.STX is expected to release its first film next year.Advertisement
