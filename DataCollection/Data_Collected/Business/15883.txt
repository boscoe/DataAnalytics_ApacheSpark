Prosecutors in North Carolina are also investigating, one of the people said.Wells Fargo, one of the nation’s largest banks, with headquarters in San Francisco, recently settled civil charges with regulators and the city and county of Los Angeles last week. The settlement, in which the bank did not admit or deny wrongdoing, included $185 million in fines and a requirement that the bank hire an independent consultant to review its sales practices.Wells is famous for its practice of selling new accounts to existing customers, and it is the pressure to meet sales quotas and earn bonuses that is seen as the motive for bank employees who set up credit-card and deposit accounts without customers’ permission. So far, 5,300 employees have been fired for their involvement.The subpoenas from federal prosecutors raise the prospect that the investigation, while in its early stages, could lead to criminal charges for the bank or its employees.Another option is for prosecutors to handle the investigation as a civil fraud matter, which would require a lower burden of proof. At least one of the subpoenas indicated that prosecutors were considering that route, one of the people briefed on the matter said.Ultimately, only one of the three offices will most likely lead the investigation. When multiple United States attorneys offices vie for a case — and cannot resolve it among themselves — they will either team up or let the deputy attorney general in Washington make the final call.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Wells Fargo was facing an investigation from prosecutors in Manhattan and San Francisco.A spokesman for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for the United States attorneys in the Western District of North Carolina and San Francisco also did not respond.Wells Fargo declined to comment.The multiple subpoenas are the latest fallout from the unfolding scandal surrounding the sham accounts. Last week, banking regulators revealed that Wells Fargo employees may have set up as many as 1.5 million unauthorized accounts and applied for 565,000 credit cards without their customers’ consent.In public statements since the settlement was announced, bank executives have acknowledged that the accounts were created improperly. But they deny regulators’ assertions that the bank’s internal culture and incentive system encouraged the misdeeds.Wells Fargo’s chief executive, John Stumpf, is scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.Democrats on the banking committee have said they want to know whether top executives condoned the behavior. Among the 5,300 bank employees fired because of the scandal were bank branch managers and some of their direct supervisors. Wells, however, has declined to specify who among the bank’s senior management has been terminated.In July, the bank announced the retirement of its head of community banking, Carrie Tolstedt, a longtime Wells executive who oversaw all of the bank’s branches. A spokeswoman said Ms. Tolstedt had planned on retiring and that her departure was unrelated to the settlement with regulators.The bank has refunded about $2.5 million to customers who were charged fees as a result of the unwanted accounts.Since the financial crisis, Wells Fargo has largely managed to stay out of the regulatory spotlight. The company’s share price has dropped more than 6 percent since the announcement of the settlement last Thursday.Advertisement
