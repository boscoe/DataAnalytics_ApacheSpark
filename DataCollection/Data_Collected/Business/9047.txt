BEIJING — Home prices in China rose for a fourth consecutive month in August, offering hope that the ailing property sector is becoming less of a drag on the slowing economy.Average new home prices inched up 0.3 percent in August from the previous month, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Statistics Bureau on Friday, the same pace as in July.Price gains were recorded in 35 of the 70 cities the bureau surveyed, up from 31 in the previous month.The property sector accounts for 15 percent of China’s gross domestic product, so even modest signs of improvement would relieve some pressure on the economy, which is expected to expand at its slowest pace in a quarter of a century this year.AdvertisementBut analysts do not expect a full-blown turnaround any time soon, as a huge overhang of unsold homes discourages new construction and investment in all but the biggest cities.AdvertisementEconomists at Standard Chartered say sentiment in the property market is still fragile and believe housing remains one of the biggest challenges for the economy, especially as growth in other areas slows.A Standard Chartered survey in July of 30 non-listed developers in medium-size cities such as Hangzhou found that inventories were being worked off slowly, construction activity remained weak and access to financing was becoming more difficult despite lower funding costs.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Days earlier, China loosened rules for foreigners to buy real estate.While home sales have picked up, growth in China’s property investment in the first eight months of the year slowed to 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the lowest level since early 2009, while new construction starts plunged by nearly 17 percent.A breakdown of the data also highlighted uneven trends across the country, with prices in smaller cities such as the northeastern city of Dandong continuing to weaken, albeit at a slower pace.Since economists believe much of the inventory overhang is in second- and third-tier cities, that weakness is expected to persist.The biggest “first-tier” cities fared better, with Shenzhen being the top performer with a rise of 5.1 percent from July and an increase of 31.3 percent from a year earlier.Prices in Beijing rose 1.1 percent from July and 3 percent from a year earlier, while Shanghai prices rose 1.3 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
