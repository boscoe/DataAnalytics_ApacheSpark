Home building across the nation accelerated in April, far exceeding expectations and suggesting that the economy was getting back on track after overall growth ground to a halt during the first quarter of the year.Home construction last month rose 20.2 percent over March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.135 million, the highest number since 2007 and the biggest percentage jump in almost 24 years, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.The sunny report wiped out a particularly dismal showing in March and offered a measure of optimism for a housing market that has been slow to recover since the recession.But most economists were cautious in their reading of the month’s data, seeing it as a sign that the housing market was simply returning to a more normal state after the cold and snowy start to the year that kept many builders from breaking new ground.Advertisement“It’s a hell of a rebound in housing, there’s no denying it,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. But “you have to keep it in perspective,” he added.Advertisement“It brings us back to about a million units, which is where it should be,” he said.Housing data is always volatile, subject to weather and labor supplies. But numbers from the past year echo the trends of the overall economy, which has maintained a slow upward trajectory, interrupted by relatively brief hiccups.“And I emphasize the word slow,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc. “I don’t think second-quarter G.D.P. numbers will be any great shakes.”Some analysts, however, were more upbeat about what the housing rebound may portend about the broader economic outlook.“This report demolishes the idea that the economy — outside the oil sector — suffered some sort of real seizure in the first quarter,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. “It didn’t; it was just battered badly by a winter nearly as grim as last year.”

But trade and other data released since then suggest the economy may actually have shrunk over the winter.Meanwhile, the Labor Department last week reported that the producer price index for final demand, which measures inflation at the wholesale level, fell by 0.4 percent in April.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One reason for the slow pace is that food costs are little changed.AdvertisementGiven the current economic climate, April’s positive housing numbers were not expected to change the Fed’s thinking on when to raise interest rates. Most analysts now do not expect the Fed to act until September at the earliest.“The Fed will look at this as a normalization rather than the beginning of a trend that suggests a housing bubble,” said Blerina Uruci, United States economist at Barclays. “We’ve seen very strong changes in many regions but we have to think what was the basis we started from. It was very weak in February and now is returning to normal.”Tuesday’s report showed single-family housing starts in April were at a rate of 733,000, which is 16.7 percent above the revised March figure. Starts for apartments and condominiums rose to 389,000.Permits for new housing in April — considered a predictor of construction in months to come — were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,143,000, an increase of 10.1 percent over March.Housing data was strong across many regions of the country but especially in the Northeast, which is where the winter storms were concentrated.In the South, however, growth was not quite as strong as some economists had expected. “That is important to note because it indicates that the winter did not mask or limit a near-term acceleration in starts in the South,” David Nice, an economist at Mesirow Financial, said in a note to clients.The South, he said, makes up about half of single-family housing starts.“In order to see any substantial acceleration in starts in the months to come,” Mr. Nice said, “we’ll need to see further strengthening in the South.”A version of this article appears in print on May 20, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Rise in Home Building Suggests Economy Is Regaining Momentum .
