LONDON —  The Irish drug maker Shire said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire the American biotechnology company Dyax Corporation in a deal that could be worth as much as $6.5 billion.The deal would be the latest in an acquisition spree by Shire since its tentative deal to be bought by the drug maker AbbVie was terminated.AbbVie, which is based in Illinois, walked away from the $54 billion deal after the Treasury Department announced new rules aimed at reining in so-called inversion deals, in which United States companies acquire a foreign company and reincorporate overseas to pay lower taxes.Dyax, which is based in Burlington, Mass., develops treatments for the rare genetic condition known as hereditary angioedema, or HAE.AdvertisementUnder the Shire offer, Dyax shareholders would receive an upfront payment of $37.30 a share in cash, representing a 35 percent premium to Dyax’s closing price on Friday. That would value Dyax around $5.9 billion.AdvertisementShareholders would also receive an additional payment of $4 a share in cash, or about $646 million in total, if the company’s leading treatment in development, DX-2930, were to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration before the end of 2019, Shire said.“This highly complementary transaction aligns with and accelerates our strategy to build a global leading biotechnology company focused on rare diseases and specialty conditions,” Flemming Ornskov, the Shire chief executive, said in a news release.The deal has been approved unanimously by the boards of both companies. The transaction, subject to the approval of Dyax’s shareholders and regulators, is expected to close in the first half of next year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
