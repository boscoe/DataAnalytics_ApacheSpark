Earnings were $1.8 billion in the same period a year earlier.“We faced a number of headwinds,” Lakshmi Mittal, the company’s chief executive, said in a news release.The company, which is based in Luxembourg, cut the lower end of its guidance range for that pretax measure of earnings to $6 billion from $6.5 billion. The company said it still might reach $7 billion in earnings for the year.Revenue for the first quarter was $17.1 billion, compared with $19.8 billion in the same period a year earlier.Although it is the largest player in the steel industry, ArcelorMittal controls less than 10 percent of the world’s steel market. In recent years, when steel demand has been weak, Mr. Mittal invested heavily in mining. Now those businesses are weighing on the company because of low prices for coal and iron ore. The company reported an operating loss of $36 million in mining for the quarter.Yet years of cutting costs seem to be paying off for ArcelorMittal in Europe, its largest market, where earnings reached $616 million, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier.Steel is often regarded as a proxy for economic activity because it is used in projects as varied as construction and automaking. ArcelorMittal’s report of a 10.9 percent increase in steel shipments in the region, compared with the fourth quarter of 2014, could be a sign of unexpected economic strength in Europe.But the company’s North American operations, which have been strong in recent years, were only marginally profitable because of weak demand and a 5.3 percent fall in prices to $796 a ton. An increase in steel imports to the United States from countries like Brazil, China and Russia also hurt profit.Analysts say that Chinese steel exports flooded world markets in the latter part of 2015, leading to large inventory buildups that weakened demand in the United States in recent months.ArcelorMittal also said that effects of currency fluctuations, mainly the strengthening dollar, trimmed about $500 million from its earnings.“It shows how difficult it is to make a profit in steel making,” said Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie in London.Advertisement
