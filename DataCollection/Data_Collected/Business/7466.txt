Mendelsohn, the chief of Goldman’s Americas restructuring team, as a top banker for its own practice.For Perella Weinberg, hiring Mr. Mendelsohn was a crucial step in rebuilding its own corporate bankruptcy advisory practice after the firm fired several members of that group this year.Mr. Shah was most recently the chief of the restructuring practice for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He joined Goldman in 2006 from the boutique firm Miller Buckfire, having previously worked at Wasserstein Perella and the Fieldstone Private Capital Group.He moved to London in 2012 and became the co-chief of the Europe, Middle East and Africa restructuring team in 2013. He became the sole chief last year.Mr. Shah will move back to New York from London for his new position.Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman, confirmed the contents of the memo.Advertisement
