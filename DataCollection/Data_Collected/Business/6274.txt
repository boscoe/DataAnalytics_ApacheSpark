But it marks a significant development, giving international asset managers their most direct access yet to mainland investors.The mutual recognition initiative “is a major breakthrough in the opening up of the mainland’s funds market to offshore funds,” Carlson Tong, the chairman of the Hong Kong securities regulator, said Friday in a news release. “It will also open up a new frontier for the mainland and Hong Kong asset management industries, and make available a wider selection of fund products to investors in both markets.”Hong Kong and Beijing have talked for years about opening their respective markets for investment funds, but the program was put on the back burner in favor of a link between the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock markets, which kicked off in November. It has since helped fuel a strong rally in shares on both sides of the border.Mainland China has a massive pool of domestic savings, most of it sitting in bank accounts. The domestic fund industry is young but growing fast. The mainland had more than 2,000 registered funds of all types as of May, with total net assets of about 5.7 trillion renminbi, according to figures from Wind Info, a financial data provider.Hong Kong has long been a popular market for the sale and distribution of fund products to investors. The mutual recognition of funds program aims to encourage foreign asset managers to go a step further by setting up funds based in the city, expanding the local finance industry and creating new white-collar jobs.In the initial stage, the regulators said Friday, the linkage will only apply to general equity and bond funds, as well as to certain exchange-traded funds that track benchmark stock indexes by purchasing the underlying shares.That appears to exclude other types of investments, like money market funds, which have recently grown popular in the mainland. They are heavily marketed by Internet companies, including Alibaba’s financial-services affiliate, Ant Financial.Funds seeking to participate in the program will first need regulatory approval, with the Beijing and Hong Kong agencies saying they would work toward standard rules.Under the rules released on Friday, mainland funds aimed at Hong Kong must have been established for one year and have a minimum size of 200 million renminbi, or its equivalent in a different currency. The people running the funds can only sell a maximum of 50 percent of the fund’s shares or units by value in Hong Kong.The Beijing and Hong Kong securities regulators said that in the coming months they would conduct briefing sessions to explain the details of the program. In their statement, they said they agreed on the July start date “to ensure that mainland and Hong Kong market participants have sufficient time to prepare; to understand the differences in laws and regulations, business requirements and operations of the two markets; and to prudently assess and manage the risks.”Advertisement
