Both companies delivered disappointing quarterly results or outlooks on Tuesday, setting the stage for the sell-off.“Apple is the biggest publicly traded company in the world, so it’s going to have a big impact on the indices,” said Erik Davidson, chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank.The slide wasn’t that broad, however.

Yahoo posted a nearly $22 million loss, driven by soaring commissions paid to its partners and flat sales. The stock slipped 49 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $39.24.Microsoft’s slide was more pronounced at 3.7 percent. The company reported a hefty quarterly loss stemming from an expense of $8.4 billion related to its purchase of the Nokia phone business over a year ago. The stock dropped $1.74, to $45.54.Apple fared the worst, shedding 4.2 percent after management gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter and did not provide much detail on how the company’s new smartwatch was doing. Apple’s latest results also stirred investor concerns about a slowdown in the growth of iPhone sales. The stock fell $5.53, to $125.22.Despite its size, Apple’s latest results don’t necessarily speak to the overall health of the economy or corporate America, Mr. Davidson said.“Do iPhone sales tell us a lot about the broader economy and the markets, or does it tell us more about Apple? It probably tells us more about Apple,” he said.
