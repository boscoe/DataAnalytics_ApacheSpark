WASHINGTON — Factory orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell in February. A main category that tracks business investment dropped by the largest amount since December.Orders for durable goods fell 2.8 percent in February, after a 4.2 percent increase in January, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Commercial aircraft, a volatile category, fell 27.1 percent after surging 48.6 percent in January.The large drop in demand for commercial aircraft reflected weakness in orders at the airplane giant Boeing. Demand for military aircraft and parts fell 29.2 percent in February after a 97 percent surge in January.Economists viewed the big decline in durable goods orders as evidence that manufacturing companies remain under pressure.AdvertisementSal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the drop in orders for business investment suggested that capital investment would be a drag on overall economic growth in the first quarter. He said if next week’s consumer spending report also came in weaker than expected, he would have to trim his current 2.3 percent forecast for first-quarter growth.

The weakness reflects in part trouble in the energy industry, which has suffered cutbacks and layoffs because of the plunge in oil prices over the last year.For February, orders for machinery fell 2.6 percent while demand for appliances and other electrical equipment dropped 2.8 percent. Demand for computers rose 1.3 percent, while orders for communication equipment fell 2.3 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The four-week average, a less volatile figure, increased just 250, to 259,750.Applications are a proxy for layoffs, so the data indicates that businesses are holding on tightly to their staffs, despite overseas economic turmoil and modest growth in the country. Applications have been below 300,000, a historically low level, for 55 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.A version of this list appears in print on March 25, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Orders for Durable Goods Dropped 2.8% in February.
