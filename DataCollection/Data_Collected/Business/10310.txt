The veteran deal maker James C. Woolery has left Hudson Executive Capital, the activist hedge fund he co-founded, the firm said on Monday.In a statement, the firm said that Mr. Woolery had resigned “due to personal reasons.” It added, “We are grateful for the help that Jim provided in the successful launch of the firm, and wish him well in all his future endeavors.”The move signals the latest changeup in the career of Mr. Woolery, 47, a longtime adviser on big transactions. He began his career at the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore before decamping to JPMorgan Chase in 2011 to become a co-head of the bank’s North American mergers practice.Mr. Woolery left JPMorgan two years later to rejoin the practice of law at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, where he was set to become that firm’s chairman. But in 2015, he departed to found Hudson Executive with Douglas L. Braunstein, formerly a top banker at JPMorgan.AdvertisementWhile classifying itself as an activist hedge fund, Hudson Executive argued that it was different from traditional examples of the form like Elliott Management or Daniel S. Loeb’s Third Point. Hudson Executive said that it would not run proxy contests, instead urging companies to pursue transactions or other strategic changes on a friendly basis.Among the company’s successful investments were WhiteWave Foods, which sold itself to Danone, and the CIT Group, which sold its aircraft leasing business to Avolon Holdings last month.AdvertisementNews of Mr. Woolery’s departure was reported earlier by Reuters.A version of this article appears in print on November 29, 2016, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Deal Maker Steps Down From Fund He Launched.
