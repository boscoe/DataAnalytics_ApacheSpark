The lawyer, Jeffrey L. Chase, joined hundreds of other lawyers at a hearing in federal court in New Orleans to look at consolidating more than 460 lawsuits against the German carmaker. At the hearing, in front of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, the lawyers made their cases for consolidating the lawsuits in federal districts of their liking. The panel, which happened to be meeting in New Orleans, did not rule on Thursday on where the lawsuits should be consolidated. Mr. Chase asked the panel to choose Michigan, where Volkswagen is working with the Environmental Protection Agency. Advertisement
