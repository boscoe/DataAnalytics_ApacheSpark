The United States government slashed its forecast for crude oil production in 2017 on Tuesday, the latest sign that a 19-month price rout is taking a deeper toll on drillers. In its short-term energy outlook, the United States Energy Information Administration said that 2017 oil production would fall by 480,000 barrels a day to 8.19 million barrels, a big jump from last month’s forecast of a decline of 230,000 barrels a day. The decline forecast for 2016 also increased, but not by much: a decline of 760,000 barrels a day from 740,000 barrels. Since mid-2014, global oil benchmark prices have dropped more than 70 percent. The agency also said that growth in demand was dropping, too.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
