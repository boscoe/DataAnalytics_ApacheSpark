Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of the Swiss bank, vowed to raise billions of dollars in new capital, reduce the size of the investment bank and slash costs.LONDON —  Credit Suisse reported a multibillion-dollar loss in the fourth quarter on Thursday — far more than analysts had expected and its largest in seven years — as turbulent markets and a substantial charge associated with its restructuring weighed on its results.Shares of Credit Suisse declined as much as 12 percent in Zurich trading on Thursday as the bank posted a loss of 5.83 billion Swiss francs, or about $5.75 billion, in contrast to a profit of 691 million francs in the same quarter a year earlier.The loss was largely because of a write-down of 3.8 billion francs after Credit Suisse reassessed the value of its investment bank as part of a continuing overhaul.It was also the first annual loss for Credit Suisse since the bank reported a record loss of 8.2 billion francs in 2008. The Swiss lender’s results in 2008 were dragged down by a hefty trading loss in the fourth quarter and restructuring charges as it moved to cut about 11 percent of its work force.AdvertisementThe bank has been reshaping itself by shrinking its investment bank and placing greater emphasis on its wealth management business, particularly in Asia and other emerging markets.AdvertisementCredit Suisse, which is based in Zurich and has large operations in New York and London, also vowed to accelerate its plans to cut costs by billions of dollars by the end of 2018, saying it would eliminate 4,000 positions held by employees and contractors. The lender employs about 48,000 people worldwide.The quarterly loss is the latest challenge for its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, who was brought in last year to turn around the bank’s fortunes.Since joining the bank in July, Mr. Thiam, the former chief executive of the British insurer Prudential, has announced that Credit Suisse would raise billions of dollars in new capital, reduce the size of its investment bank and slash costs.“The environment has deteriorated materially during the fourth quarter of 2015,” Mr. Thiam said in a conference call with analysts. “A combination of uncertainties on Chinese growth, the abrupt drop in oil prices, large industry mutual fund redemptions of financial assets, asynchronous policies by leading central banks, lower liquidity have all contributed to making the fourth quarter of 2015 challenging with lower levels of client activity, lower levels of issuance and material shifts in the prices of some asset classes.”Credit Suisse said on Thursday that the good-will impairment charge of 3.8 billion francs related to its global markets, Asia-Pacific and investment banking and capital market businesses was a result of reassessing the value of its investment bank as part of its overhaul.The most significant component of the write-down was associated with its acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which Credit Suisse bought for $11.5 billion in 2000 as it looked to bolster its presence in investment banking and financial markets. The bank had warned investors that it might take such a charge in the fourth quarter as part of its reshaping.Credit Suisse, like its Swiss rival UBS, was hoping that a greater emphasis on wealth management would make its results less volatile going forward.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            Both banks saw billions of dollars in client withdrawals in the final three months of last year as jittery investors pulled back.AdvertisementRevenue at Credit Suisse declined 34 percent to 4.21 billion francs in the fourth quarter, from 6.37 billion francs in the period a year earlier.Operating expenses, which included the good-will charge, rose to 10.5 billion francs in the period, from 5.4 billion francs in the final quarter of 2014.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In October, Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse announced an agreement that would allow Wells Fargo to recruit clients and brokers from the business and possibly shift them to Wells Fargo this year.The report briefly sent Credit Suisse’s shares higher on Wednesday before Wells Fargo denied that any talks were taking place.Advertisement“Wells Fargo beat us to it and denied it before we did. We were about to deny it, too,” Mr. Thiam told journalists on Thursday. “I’ve actually never met, never had the pleasure or the honor to meet” John G. Stumpf, the Wells Fargo chief executive, Mr. Thiam added.Mr. Thiam said that the investment bank, in a smaller form, remained a crucial part of Credit Suisse’s strategy going forward.“We’re not going to throw the baby out with the bath water,” Mr. Thiam said.Credit Suisse’s international wealth management business reported a pretax loss of 20 million francs in the fourth quarter, from a pretax profit of 423 million francs in the period a year earlier. Its private banking business within the international wealth management segment reported net outflows of 4.2 billion francs during the quarter.Its so-called universal bank in Switzerland reported a pretax profit of 367 million francs in the fourth quarter, from 707 million francs in the prior-year period. The business remains on track for a partial initial public offering in the second half of the year, Credit Suisse said.A version of this article appears in print on February 5, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Credit Suisse Swings to a Loss After a Large Write-Down.
