It added that it had hired advisers to assist in its efforts.The announcement, tucked into Samson’s annual report, has taken few on Wall Street by surprise. What was once considered a proud achievement has since become a symbol of the troubles straining the oil industry as the price of petroleum hovers at its lowest levels in years.As of Tuesday evening, the price of West Texas intermediate crude oil was $47.69 a barrel, less than half of what it was at the time of the transaction. The price of natural gas also tumbled, further squeezing the company’s profits.Samson’s troubles are readily apparent from its 2014 results. Cash flow from operations fell 29 percent from the year before, to $488 million. And its net debt load grew to $3.9 billion.Samson’s troubles have been so deep that its falling value has weighed heavily on K.K.R., whose fourth-quarter results fell 89 percent in part because of the value of its energy holdings. The company has since taken a number of steps to shore up its financial position, including stopping drilling, selling assets and laying off employees.In March, the credit rating agency Moody’s said in a research note that Samson faced “a high risk of default.”Other private equity investments in energy have soured as well, notably EP Holdings, which was acquired for $7.2 billion by a group led by Apollo Global Management. That deal, too, dragged down its biggest owner’s financial results.Advertisement
