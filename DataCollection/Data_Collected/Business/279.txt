Shares in Mitel were up 16 percent, valuing the company at about $1.1 billion.It is the latest campaign by Elliott, which has gained a reputation as a one of the most successful activist investors in Silicon Valley. Over the years, the firm has helped push a number of technology companies, like  BMC and Riverbed Technology , to sell themselves.And Elliott has been a gadfly at EMC, the data storage provider that is now in advanced talks to sell itself to Dell Inc.Now it has set its sights on Polycom and Mitel, whose core products include the speakerphone devices found in scores of corporate conference rooms. In a publicly disclosed letter to Polycom’s board, the hedge fund argued that Polycom in particular has underperformed its peers and the broader markets, despite trying a number of other financial efforts meant to bolster its stock price.Moreover, Polycom faces competitive pressure in the videoconferencing business from bigger rivals, including Cisco Systems and the Chinese companies ZTE and Huawei, as well as nimbler start-ups.The most attractive situation in Elliott’s eyes is a combination of Polycom and Mitel, which Elliott estimated would bolster’s the acquirer’s stock price considerably. If, say, Polycom were the buyer and used shares as its deal currency, the company’s stock could rise more than 30 percent by the end of next year and 85 percent by the end of 2017, by the Elliott’s calculations.(The hedge fund also mused on a number of ways to structure a potential merger, including having Mitel be the acquirer. Mitel is based in Canada, while Polycom is based in San Jose, Calif., and it could use its headquarters to lower the tax rate of the combined company.)Putting the two together would create a stronger company able to acquire other telecom service providers, Elliott added.“We do not view this as being the end but rather the beginning of a platform strategy for Polycom,” Jesse Cohn, Elliott’s head of equity activism in the United States and the architect of its tech activism practice, wrote in the letter.Advertisement
