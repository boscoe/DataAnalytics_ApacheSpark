Investors were encouraged by the latest corporate deal news, that General Electric would be selling its long-struggling lending business.The good feelings in the market are unlikely to last. The focus next week turns to corporate earnings, and so far the outlook is discouraging. With economic sluggishness in the United States and Europe, as well as the rapid appreciation of the dollar, analysts expect first-quarter results to be down 4.6 percent.“Earnings are not going to be down because the U.S. economy is struggling,” said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. “It’s going to be because of what has happened in energy and the dollar.”Next week, the nation’s biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs, will report their results..

The Dow and S.&P. 500 each rose 1.7 percent, while the Nasdaq rose 2.2 percent. The United States stock market has not had two consecutive weeks of gains since mid-February.Most of the gains this week can be attributed to the Federal Reserve. After the disappointing March jobs report released this month, traders now say they believe that the nation’s central bank is not going to raise interest rates until September instead of the originally anticipated June time frame.William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Monday that the Fed’s rate increases would be “shallow” when he cited the recent weak economic data including the jobs report.“I think we are still looking at two rate hikes this year, but they will likely be later this year,” Mr. Liu of JPMorgan Funds said.Bond prices rose.
