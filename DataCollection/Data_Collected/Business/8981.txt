Oracle’s revenue declined 1.7 percent to $8.45 billion in the first quarter, which ended Aug. 31. However, that was less than the 5.4 percent decline in the previous quarter. Analysts on average expected revenue of $8.53 billion in the latest quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of Oracle’s cloud-computing software and platform service rose 34 percent to $451 million in the quarter. Sales of traditional software licenses fell 16 percent to $1.51 billion. Oracle’s net income fell to $1.75 billion, or 40 cents a share, from $2.18 billion, or 48 cents a share. Advertisement
