It is expected to close by the first quarter of 2016.If the transaction doesn’t receive certain approvals within 12 months, Exor said it would reimburse PartnerRe for $225 million of the termination fee to Axis Capital.Under the terms of the deal, PartnerRe shareholders will receive $140.50 a share in cash, including a special preclosing dividend of $3 a share.The agreement also includes a “go-shop” period that allows PartnerRe’s board of directors to actively solicit competing offers and enter negotiations for proposals received prior to Sept. 14.“Since Exor made its initial offer to acquire the company in April, 2015, the PartnerRe board has been focused on maximizing value for our shareholders while positioning PartnerRe for long-term success,” Jean-Paul L. Montupet, the PartnerRe chairman, said in a news release.“We have carefully and thoroughly evaluated each development over the past several months, and believe that this thoughtful and deliberate approach was critical to delivering a transaction that represents a significant improvement in the price and terms of Exor’s original proposal,” Mr. Montupet said. “Importantly, Exor is committed to ensuring that the unique culture, brand and business that our dedicated employees have successfully built over the past 20 years remain intact.”In July, PartnerRe, which had previously favored a deal with Axis Capital, said it was willing to negotiate with Exor following its most recent sweetened proposal.PartnerRe shareholders were expected to vote Friday on whether to accept the Axis Capital deal, but that meeting has been canceled as a result of the new agreement with Exor.The Axis Capital deal suffered a setback in recent weeks after the influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis both recommended that shareholders vote against the deal.“Prior to PartnerRe reaching out to us last December to discuss a combination of our companies, we were confident in continuing with our strategy as a stand-alone company, building our three strong businesses incrementally,” Michael A. Butt, the Axis Capital chairman, said in a news release.“We will now proceed with that strategy, with strengthened resolve,” Mr. Butt said. “We have been very conscious of our responsibilities to our shareholders throughout these negotiations and believe we have demonstrated prudence and financial discipline in our approach.”Advertisement
