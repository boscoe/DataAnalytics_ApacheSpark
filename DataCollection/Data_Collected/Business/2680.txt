WASHINGTON —  Consumer prices in the United States are rising at the slowest pace during a period of economic growth in the last half-century, a trend that could delay the Federal Reserve’s retreat from its stimulus campaign.An index of the prices Americans pay for goods and services rose just 0.8 percent during the 12 months ending in December as the collapse of oil prices offset the higher cost of food and health care, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Friday.The slow pace of inflation means Americans are experiencing less erosion in the value of their paychecks at a time when wages, too, are rising unusually slowly. But it is also evidence that the recovery from the Great Recession remains incomplete. And sluggish inflation itself can impede debt repayment and other economic adjustments.The Fed has said it plans to start raising its benchmark interest rate around the middle of the year. Job growth has outstripped its expectations and other economic indicators are improving. The University of Michigan’s consumer survey reported on Friday that consumer confidence in January hit the highest level in a decade.AdvertisementSome Fed officials reiterated on Friday that they saw sluggish inflation as a temporary problem. They said that lower oil prices would actually help reverse the trend by contributing to stronger economic growth and, in time, increased inflation.Advertisement“We’ve all been expecting this given what oil prices are doing,” Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, said in an interview on Friday. “The bigger question is what happens in the next four to six months. Will inflation begin to drift back up toward our target? I think that it will.”
            Prices usually rise when the economy is growing, but inflation at the end of last year was running at the lowest pace in more than half a century. In contrast to the 1970s and early 1980s, when inflation wreaked economic havoc by accelerating to double-digit rates, the biggest challenge facing the Federal Reserve in recent years is that inflation is too low, reflecting weak growth and making it harder for needed economic adjustments to take place.        +16%Inflation+12Year-over-year change in the monthlyConsumer Price index, seasonally adjusted+8+40Gross domestic product–4Annual rate of change in G.D.P., based onquarterly figures, inflation and seasonally adjusted–81960s1970s1980s1990s2000s2010s+16%InflationYear-over-year change in the monthly Consumer Price index, seasonally adjusted+12+8+40–4Gross domesticproduct–81970s1980s2010sAnnual rate of change in G.D.P.,based on quarterly figures,inflation and seasonally adjustedBut Fed officials also have underscored in recent weeks that their policy decisions will be determined by the course of events, not by their predictions. And some analysts said on Friday that it seemed increasingly likely the Fed would once again decide to wait a little longer before finally raising interest rates.“In light of the downward pressure on inflation, we expect the F.O.M.C. will be ‘patient’ this year as far as monetary policy is concerned,” Ryan Wang, United States economist at HSBC, wrote in a note to clients on Friday, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy. “We believe the committee will hold off any increase in the federal funds rate until September, waiting for evidence that both total and core inflation have bottomed out and are beginning to rise again.”The Fed aims to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, and Friday’s report is worse than it looks because the Fed prefers a different government measure that tends to show somewhat less inflation. That measure, the index of personal consumption expenditures, will be updated later this month.Separately, the Fed reported that industrial production fell by 0.1 percent in December, driven mostly by a sharp drop in utility output caused mostly by a swing from an unusually cold November to an unusually warm December. A 0.3 percent increase in manufacturing and a 2.2 gain jump in mining, which showed that crude oil production was continuing to advance despite the drop in prices, offset most of the drop in utility output.The sharp decline of oil prices is a crucial factor in the low inflation figures. The government said the price of gasoline fell 21 percent over the last year, and analysts said cheap gas also appeared to be holding down the cost of some other goods and services. But oil prices cannot continue to fall at the same pace, and surveys of economists and consumers show a widespread expectation that inflation will rebound.The University of Michigan’s consumer survey reported on Friday that expectations for inflation over the next year declined substantially to 2.4 percent in January from 2.8 percent in December. Crucially, however, the survey reported no change in consumer expectations for annual inflation five years from now.

The Fed has not hit its 2 percent target in more than two years. And the data suggests other factors, including a strengthening dollar, are restraining inflation. The prices of imported goods like clothing and cars also have fallen in recent months.Notably, a version of the consumer index that excludes oil and food did not rise in December. The Fed and many independent economists regard this measure, known as core inflation, as a more accurate indicator of future inflation because oil and food prices are volatile, obscuring the underlying trend.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, said last month that it would be sufficient for officials to feel “reasonably confident” that inflation was going to rebound.James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said on Friday that the Fed was being pulled in opposite directions by the growing strength of the economy and the weakness of inflation. He noted that the Fed had underestimated job growth and overestimated inflation in each of the last two years.But Mr. Bullard, speaking in Chicago, said that on balance, based on current economic conditions, he was inclined to think that the time had come to raise rates. “The level of inflation is not so low that it can alone justify a policy rate of zero,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on January 17, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Slow Rise in Prices May Stymie the Fed.
