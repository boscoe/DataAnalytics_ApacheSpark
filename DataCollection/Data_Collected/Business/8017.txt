Liberty Global, the international telecommunications operator controlled by the billionaire John C. Malone, said on Friday that it had increased its stake in the British broadcaster ITV to almost 10 percent.The move comes just over a year after Liberty Global, which owns the British broadband operator Virgin Media, bought its initial 6.4 percent stake in ITV.It also continues a new round of consolidation in Europe’s telecom industry, as cellphone, cable and media companies jockey for position to meet customers’ increasingly online habits.No financial details about the deal were provided. But at current market prices, Liberty Global’s additional stake in the British broadcaster is valued at almost $600 million.Michael T. Fries, Liberty Global’s chief executive, said the company did not plan to make a takeover offer for ITV, which produces popular television programs like “Downton Abbey.”“This investment remains an opportunistic one for us in our largest market,” he said in a statement.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
