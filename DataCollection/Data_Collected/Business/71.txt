The chain expects to sell 65.3 million shares in the offering, pricing its stock at $23 to $26 a share, the company said in a filing on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering, announced in July, paves the way for Albertsons to end years of ownership by a consortium led by the investment firm Cerberus Capital Management. Its owners completed a deal to acquire rival Safeway just months ago. The companyâ€™s stock is expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ABS. Albertsons said that it intended to use the proceeds from the offering to repay debt. The company operates more than 2,200 stores in 33 states under a variety of names, including Albertsons, Jewel-Osco, Safeway, Tom Thumb and Vons. It employs about 265,000 people. Advertisement
