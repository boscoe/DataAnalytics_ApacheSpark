The group forecast that trade growth should pick up to 3.6 percent in 2017 — though risks like China’s economic slowdown, financial market instability and the impact of exchange-rate swings on high-debt countries could weigh on that. The W.T.O.’s director-general, Roberto Azevêdo, said in a statement on Thursday that trade was nonetheless positive, and noted that a slump in commodity prices and exchange-rate shifts had reduced the overall value of trade. It fell 13 percent to $16.5 trillion in 2015. Mr. Azevêdo warned about “the threat of creeping protectionism” from increasing trade restrictions by governments.Advertisement
