A government ban on foreign investors has scuttled Australia’s biggest land sale, an official said on Friday. Officials said foreigners were barred from buying S. Kidman & Company, which owns 10 cattle ranches, a bull breeding stud farm and a feedlot covering 39,155 square miles (101,411 square kilometers). That is an area bigger than South Korea and almost as big as the state of Virginia.

Kidman owns the world’s biggest cattle ranch, which covers 9,142 square miles.A version of this brief appears in print on November 20, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Foreign Ownership Ban Prevents Australia Land Sale .
