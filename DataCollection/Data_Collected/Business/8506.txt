Starting in Australia on the morning of Sept. 3 and unfolding over 18 hours in 15 cities and 12 countries, Maker stars will, one by one, open various “Star Wars” products. The entire event will be streamed live on YouTube and on web and mobile platforms operated by Disney-owned ABC News.The activity is known online as “unboxing,” and entire channels are devoted to nothing else. The genre, which has been described as part Consumer Reports and part Christmas morning, accounts for 18 of the 100 most-viewed YouTube channels worldwide. Those 18 channels accounted for 8.1 billion views in the first quarter of 2015.Disney is trying to accomplish three goals: sell a ton of “Star Wars” merchandise, especially overseas, where Lucasfilm’s consumer products business has historically been weaker; promote the new movie to younger consumers; and promote its Maker Studios unit, which has lately been suffering growing pains.The tech-news site Re/code recently reported that Maker executives were frustrated with Disney, which bought the video network for $500 million last year (plus a potential $450 million more if aggressive growth targets are met, although that now appears unlikely to happen, at least in full).On Monday, Maker pushed out its chief content officer, Erin McPherson. Maker’s marketing chief, Jeremy Welt, also left the company.Advertisement
