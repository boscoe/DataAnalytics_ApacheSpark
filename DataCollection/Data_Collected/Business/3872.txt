The Nasdaq also built on its gains for the year, finishing higher for the 10th day in a row.The latest milestones came as investors liked what they heard from the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, who told Congress that the central bank would be patient about raising interest rates as the economy improves.“Markets had been very focused on the Yellen testimony and wanted to see if there was going to be any change in the outlook for the first Fed rate hike,” said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist for UBS Wealth Management Research. “The short answer to that is, not really. The Fed is, at a minimum, not going to do anything imminently.”Progress in Greece’s efforts to secure an extension of its rescue program, and strong earnings from the home-improvement retailer Home Depot also encouraged traders. The company was the best performer in the 30-company Dow, rising 4.4 percent.The Dow ended up 92.35 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,209.19.

The index is now within 81 points of its March 2000 peak, in the heart of the dot-com era.The three main U.S. stock indexes are all up for the year. The S.&P. 500 has closed at a new high four times this month. The Dow has done it twice.The bull market, now in its sixth year, has been powered by strong corporate earnings growth and low interest rates, which make stocks more attractive relative to bonds.Ms. Yellen’s remarks to Congress on Tuesday suggest that the interest rate part of that dynamic isn’t likely to change right away.In the first part of her two-day testimony, Ms. Yellen noted that the U.S. economy is making steady progress, but that for now the Fed will remain patient about raising interest rates because the job market is still healing and inflation is too low. “It’s a little bit uncertain on when exactly they’ll raise rates, but it’s not going to happen sooner than expected,” Mr. Lefkowitz said.The major stock indexes spent much of the morning drifting between small gains and losses as traders awaited Ms. Yellen’s remarks and kept tabs on developments in Greece.Athens and its bailout creditors reached a tentative agreement last week to continue a rescue loan program by four months to avoid the risk of a Greek default and exit from the euro currency.
