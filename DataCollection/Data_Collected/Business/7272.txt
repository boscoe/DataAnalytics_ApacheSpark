AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks ended a tumultuous trading week with slight losses Thursday as investors sought safety ahead of an extended holiday weekend.Investors bought at the opening of trading after a Labor Department report on job creation suggested the economy was improving, though not fast enough to raise the specter of inflation and higher interest rates. But the gains vanished after a downbeat report from the International Monetary Fund on Greece’s finances as the country heads to a vote this weekend on its financial bailout.It was a quiet end to an eventful week. The markets plunged worldwide on Monday over worries that a Greek default could spread losses throughout the global financial system. A continued drop in Chinese stocks added to the fears, as did a statement from Puerto Rico’s governor that the commonwealth would not be able to pay back its large public debt.Stocks rose a bit over the next two days, but by Thursday’s close the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was still down 1.2 percent for the week, its biggest weekly loss in three months.United States markets will be closed Friday in observance of the Independence Day holiday.The S.&P. 500 slipped Thursday by 0.64 point, less than 0.1 percent, to 2,076.78. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.8 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,730.11. The Nasdaq fell 3.91 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 5,009.21.“We’ve got Greece, we’ve got China and Puerto Rico,” said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “Investors want to take some risk off the table.”In other data, orders to United States factories fell in May by 1 percent from April, the largest amount in three months, the Commerce Department reported. Much of the weakness reflected a big 35.3 percent fall in demand for commercial aircraft. But even outside the volatile transportation category, orders were up only 0.1 percent. The lackluster showing suggests that manufacturing is still struggling with challenges like lower energy prices and a strong dollar, which dampen exports.Investors bought bonds in anticipation that inflation and interest rates will remain low. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose, pushing down its yield to 2.39 percent from 2.43 percent just before the jobs report came out.“There is no wage pressure and therefore no inflationary pressure. The Fed should just let the economy run,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities. “Maybe instead of hiking rates in September, maybe it’ll be in December, maybe March.”Six of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 fell Thursday. Utilities stocks, considered a conservative investment because of their big dividends, rose 1.4 percent.Among stocks making big moves, Health Net rose $6.51, or 10 percent, to $71.57 after Medicaid coverage provider Centene said it will pay about $6.3 billion to buy the company.
