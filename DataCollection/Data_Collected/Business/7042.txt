Lions Gate is home to movies like “The Hunger Games” and series like “Orange Is the New Black.”Although increasingly trendy at big companies — Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest advertiser, last year renamed its marketing divisions “brand management” — studios do not typically have brand chiefs.Instead, movies are usually marketed as stand-alone entities, with consumer products and theme park extensions handled by disparate divisions that don’t always communicate with one another.But studios, operating more and more like consumer products companies, have become more focused on brand building as they seek to compete for consumer time and attention. The Walt Disney Company, which has centered its movie business on brands like Pixar and Marvel, is in many ways the model.Lions Gate, for instance, sees the potential for tens and maybe hundreds of millions of dollars in incremental profit by pushing into areas like location-based entertainment: theme parks, theatrical productions or touring shows with costumes and props. A “Hunger Games”-related exhibition opens in Times Square in Manhattan on July 1.In addition to the “Hunger Games” series, Lions Gate controls the “Divergent” and “Twilight” films, and the studio is working on potential new franchises tied to the Power Rangers toys and Homer’s “The Odyssey.” Lions Gate’s TV shows include “The Royals” and “Mad Men,” which recently finished its AMC run.In a statement attributed to the studio’s top two movie executives, Rob Friedman and Patrick Wachsberger, Mr. Palen was called “truly best in class, one of the most creative and strategic marketing executives in the business.”Advertisement
