The market showed signs of profound unease on Wednesday, notching losses for the fourth consecutive day amid signs that the sell-off in crude oil was on the verge of turning into a broader rout in commodities.The global flight to safe haven assets at one point pushed the yield on the United States 30-year Treasury bond to below 2.4 percent for the first time.Copper took the brunt of the sell-off on Wednesday, falling more than 5 percent. Lead and nickel also declined.“We haven’t seen volatility like this for years,” said John Canally, investment strategist for LPL Financial. “People are more worried.”AdvertisementThe slide in commodities came after Kaushik Basu, the World Bank’s chief economist, cut his forecast for global growth this year by 0.4 points, to 3 percent, citing weakness in Japan and Europe. “Risks to this slow-moving global recovery are significant and tilted to the downside,” he said.Mr. Basu also said that there was a possibility that the “managed slowdown” underway in China, the destination for a substantial portion of the world’s commodities, could destabilize the global economy.AdvertisementSigns of spreading bearishness on commodities weighed heavily on mining shares, driving companies like Glencore and Anglo American down as much as 10 percent in London and sending the FTSE 100 index 2.1 percent lower. The eurozone benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 fell a more modest 0.7 percent.The Dow Jones industrial average was down as much as 348.78 points in the early afternoon, before gaining back much of its losses. It closed down 186.59 points, or 1.06 percent, to 17,427.09.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 11.76 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,011.27. And the Nasdaq declined 22.18 points, or 0.48 percent, to 4,639.32.JPMorgan announced results Wednesday morning that missed some analyst forecasts, adding to the gloomy sentiment.

Market indicators, including financial derivatives based on that rate, now suggest investors do not expect a tightening until later in the year.“A lot of this has to do with the market not knowing where to go,” said Philippe Gijsels, chief strategist at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels. “Volatility has doubled since the start of the year.”Mr. Gijsels said the decline in oil prices was hurting other commodities, but that the broader story was one of concern about the world economy.“You need global growth of about 4 percent to lift commodity prices,” Mr. Gijsels said. “If we’re one percentage point below that, then prices may go lower.”The dollar was mixed on Wednesday, though near its recent highs. It fell 1 percent against the Japanese currency, to 117.33 yen.The euro gained 0.3 percent, to $1.1789, up modestly after reaching a nine-year low. The currency rose after Europe’s highest appeals court broadly supported the European Central Bank on a proposed, but never used, emergency bond-buying measure.Investors saw the court ruling as paving the way for an announcement next week of a major new bond-buying program by the central bank. Such a move could further drive down the euro by increasing the amount of currency in circulation.Investors buying up 10-year Treasury notes sent its yield, a benchmark for home loans and corporate borrowing, to 1.85 percent, its lowest since May 2013. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped below 2.4 percent for the first time. Yields on Dutch, French and German bonds fell to lows.AdvertisementCopper, which was relatively resilient in 2014 when other commodities like oil and iron ore took big hits, fell 14 cents to close at $2.51 a pound. It has fallen about 11 percent this year.David Wilson, an analyst at Citigroup in London, said that hedge funds and other investors were selling copper over fears that global growth was slowing and that the world was “entering a deflationary spiral” that would slash the prices of all commodities. “The down trend in oil has sucked commodities lower,” he said in an interview.Unlike oil and iron ore, where high prices have led to surges in production, the copper market is not yet drastically oversupplied, Mr. Wilson said. Manufacturers of devices like air-conditioners and electronics, which rely heavily on the metal, have seen “significant growth,” he wrote in a report to clients on Monday.At the same time, supply from mines is “underwhelming,” he said.Investors are worried, though, about slowing economic activity, particularly in China, which accounts for close to half of global demand for copper, Mr. Wilson said.Oil remained near its lows on Wednesday. Benchmark U.S. crude rose $2.59 to close at $48.48 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a global benchmark, rose $2.10 to close at $48.69 in London. Both have given up about half their value over the past 12 months.“There is still a lot of debate about what Saudi Arabia is really trying to achieve,” Olivier Jakob, an oil market analyst at Petromatrix in Zug, Switzerland, wrote in a note, referring to the kingdom’s decision to keep oil production steady despite a global glut.“And the consequence of that is that it brings back an element of uncertainty to global financial markets just when the conditions were starting to stabilize.”AdvertisementThe drop in commodities pushed mining giant Freeport-McMoRan down $2.30, or 11 percent, to $18.74.JPMorgan Chase fell $2.03, or 3.5 percent, to $56.81 after reporting a 7 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings. The bank was hit by more legal costs and a decline in trading revenue.GameStop jumped nearly 11 percent, the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500, after its chief reported strong sales in gaming software sales during the holiday shopping season. The stock rose $3.44 to $36.21.In other futures trading on the NYMEX, wholesale gasoline rose 8.2 cents to close at $1.351 a gallon; heating oil rose 2.2 cents to close at $1.655 a gallon; and natural gas rose 29 cents to close at $3.233 per 1,000 cubic feet.Gold edged up 10 cents to $1,234.50 an ounce and silver fell 17 cents to $16.99 a pound.A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Losses Mount on Fear Oil Sell-Off Will Drag Down Other Commodities.
