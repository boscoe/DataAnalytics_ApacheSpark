Retail sales fell less than expected nationwide in February, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, but a sharp downward revision to January’s data could reignite concerns about the economy’s growth prospects.

The weak report bucked the trend of recent labor market data that had suggested the economy remained on solid ground despite some fears of a looming recession.The data could give the Federal Reserve more reason to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, when it will release its latest policy statement.“Based on today’s lackluster sales report, policy makers will be in no hurry to raise interest rates,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.AdvertisementRetail sales dipped 0.1 percent last month as automobile purchases fell and cheaper gasoline undercut receipts at service stations. January’s retail sales were revised down to show a 0.4 percent drop instead of the 0.2 percent gain previously reported.AdvertisementUnderscoring the report’s weakness, retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent increase in January.These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have risen 0.6 percent in January. Economists had forecast retail sales slipping 0.2 percent and core retail sales advancing 0.2 percent in February.

Last month’s weak core retail sales reading, together with January’s modest gain, suggest that consumer spending will probably remain tepid in the first quarter after growing at a 2.0 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter.Economic growth prospects were further dented by another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories edging up 0.1 percent in January as sales continued to decline.That pushed the inventory-to-sales ratio to its highest level since May 2009, suggesting inventories could remain a drag on growth in the near term.In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index dropped 0.2 percent last month on lower energy and food costs, after edging up 0.1 percent in January.In the 12 months through February, the index was unchanged after falling 0.2 percent in January.An important measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.1 percent last month after advancing 0.2 percent in January. The so-called core producer price index was up 0.9 percent in the 12 months through February, the largest gain since last July.

“These increases argue against the idea that deflation risks are spilling over into the U.S. economy,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2016, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Weak Retail Sales Renew Concerns About Growth.
