LONDON — The French conglomerate Vivendi is trying to revamp the fortunes of Dailymotion, a video-sharing website that has long struggled to live up to its early promise as the next YouTube.Vivendi, which also owns the Universal Music Group, on Tuesday entered exclusive talks to buy an 80 percent stake in Dailymotion for about 217 million euros, or about $235 million, from the French telecommunications giant Orange.The companies confirmed those talks in a joint statement after Orange’s board met Tuesday afternoon in Paris to discuss Vivendi’s offer.The negotiations come after a series of interventions by the French government, which owns a 25 percent stake in Orange. Paris has long pushed for Dailymotion, which was founded in 2005, to emerge a viable alternative to YouTube, which is owned by Google.AdvertisementBut while the French government was an early venture capital investor in Dailymotion, and officials have tried to keep it a French-owned entity — President François Hollande discouraged a  2013 takeover attempt by Yahoo — the company has failed to keep pace with YouTube, its far larger American rival.AdvertisementNot only are YouTube’s nearly 800 million monthly unique visitors more than six times what Dailymotion attracts, analysts say that Google has been more successful at attracting advertisers and finding other forms of revenue compared with Dailymotion under French ownership. In the United States, for example, about 60 percent of Internet users routinely visit YouTube, compared with just 7 percent who regularly use Dailymotion, according to the data provider eMarketer.Orange, which would retain a minority holding in the video-sharing company, acquired a 49 percent stake in Dailymotion in 2011 at the urging of the French government and bought the remaining stake in 2013. But analysts say Dailymotion has never been a good fit for Orange’s telecommunications business.Stephane Richard, Orange’s chief executive, said his company would use the proceeds of a Vivendi deal to invest in its other digital businesses.Dailymotion was recently put into play again after a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, PCCW, showed interest in buying a stake in the company. PCCW broke off acquisition talks on Monday after the French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, voiced doubts over a non-European company’s buying a stake in Dailymotion.“The French government’s preferred search for a European solution discourages international companies’ participation,” PCCW said in a statement.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Schoenfeld Asset Management, known as PSAM, has called on Vivendi to hand shareholders €9 billion of proceeds from divestments, raise its dividend and sell Universal Music.Some investors are also challenging the company’s plan to grant double voting rights for long-term shareholders. Vivendi’s management, which has bet the company’s future on its existing strategy, has rejected those demands.To head off the revolt, Vincent Bolloré, Vivendi’s biggest shareholder and one of France’s richest men, has been increasing his personal stake in the company, and now holds just more than 12 percent, up from 8.15 percent before the challenge. Shareholders are expected to discuss these issues at the company’s shareholders’ meeting on April 17.Mark Scott reported from London, and David Jolly from Paris.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
