To the Editor:Re “Groped in Public by a Colleague” (The Workologist, Rob Walker, Oct. 30), in which a woman described an incident that took place several years ago in a bar after a company holiday party:I am distressed not to read of male colleagues stepping up in these situations, nor of Mr. Walker addressing himself to men.I’m retired now, but when I was witness to inappropriate sexual innuendo I spoke up to say I found it offensive. At least when I was present, it didn’t recur. Inappropriate touching would, of course, demand similar — and stronger — intervention.This is not mere gallantry. Gallantry might be nice, but women need to feel both equal and safe. And it’s not something gentlemen accord them; it’s the law.Warren Bierwirth New York, Nov. 1Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Letters for Sunday Business may be written to sunbiz@nytimes.com.A version of this article appears in print on November 13, 2016, on Page BU4 of the New York edition with the headline: Letters.
