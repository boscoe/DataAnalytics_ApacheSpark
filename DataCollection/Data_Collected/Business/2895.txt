The workers said in a federal complaint filed on Thursday that about 15 African-American employees of some southern Virginia restaurants run by Soweva were fired last May after several white employees were hired. A statement from McDonald’s said the company had not seen the lawsuit and couldn’t comment. Representatives of Soweva did not return calls. Franchisees operate most McDonald’s outlets, and the case reflects a growing point of contention. The National Labor Relations Board has designated McDonald’s as a “joint employer” with franchisees. But Paul Millus, a New York lawyer who handles civil rights issues, said the company that ran the restaurant was seen as the actual employer in these cases “almost as a matter of law.” Advertisement
