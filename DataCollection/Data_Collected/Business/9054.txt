CreditMatt Roth for The New York Times        More than a month before Pope Francis was scheduled to arrive in Philadelphia for two days of speeches, celebrations and communion, Scott Mirkin, a local concert producer, was staring at a grassy patch in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, trying to ensure that the papal visit also would be a decent piece of entertainment.At least one million people are expected to descend on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway next weekend, taking over the leafy boulevard that extends from downtown into the city’s cultural district. Saturday night, the pope will oversee a concert featuring Andrea Bocelli and other pop stars, and on Sunday, there will be a papal Mass. These are the crowning events on a schedule packed with visits to Independence Hall as well as the city’s largest cathedral and its largest jail.But on that day in August, Mr. Mirkin, wearing a sharkskin John Varvatos suit and a Louis Vuitton belt, was focused on the obstacles presented by the ground in front of him, where dozens of tents would have to be erected behind the main stage.How would the vendors building the tents — for the media, catering, control center and the pope himself — cope with the hilly areas of the parkway? Which trees needed pruning to provide a higher canopy? And a question with some urgency: How tall is the popemobile? There will have to be an opening in the backstage tent complex tall enough to accommodate it.AdvertisementSome of the quandaries fell into the realm of the routine for Mr. Mirkin, 45, and his company ESM Productions (as in Events by Scott Mirkin), which usually puts together concerts for corporate clients like Microsoft and big-name acts like Beyoncé, Jay Z and the Roots. But in 20 years of producing large-scale events, Mr. Mirkin had never considered the requirements of a papal Mass.AdvertisementSeating the concelebrating bishops, for example, was an issue. They had to be able to see the altar, but needed to be positioned to the side so that their miters — the tall ceremonial hats — didn’t block the view for other congregants.Mr. Mirkin is just one player in the whirlwind preparations for the papal visit to Philadelphia — the first to that city since 1979. Fred Stein, one of Mr. Mirkin’s mentors who runs a rival firm, is assisting with other events. (“Two Jews are doing the pope event,” is how Mr. Mirkin likes to put it.) Pope Francis is also visiting New York and Washington, where similarly enormous efforts are underway.ESM Productions has a critical role in the arrangements, coordinating more than 100 vendors. This is the biggest extravaganza Mr. Mirkin has ever orchestrated (a free Roots show for a half-million or so people was his previous record), and the specifics of Mr. Mirkin’s work provides a window into the frenetic problem-solving that ensues when the holiest man in the Roman Catholic Church comes to town.“There’s always some fire to put out,” Mr. Mirkin said.Later that August day, Mr. Mirkin was at his office, adjacent to city hall, meeting with a company hired to transform a large city park not far from the art museum into a vast campsite for up to 30,000 visitors who couldn’t secure, or afford, hotel rooms. But that endeavor, called Francis Fields, introduced its own set of complications, such as whether to install showers and whether the Secret Service would screen RVs.News and features on Pope Francis’ visit to Washington, New York and Philadelphia in September, his first visit ever.

(“Those pallets get placed once, then they don’t move,” Mr. Mirkin said.)And all this had to come together as Mr. Mirkin was helping organize another event on the same grounds. Just weeks before the pope was to arrive, the parkway was the scene of the Budweiser Made in America Festival, a Labor Day concert featuring Modest Mouse, the Weeknd and, yes, Beyoncé.“One day I’m on a call with the bishops, the next I’m on with Nicki Minaj,” Mr. Mirkin said.Problems were cropping up everywhere. The Barnes Foundation, a fine-arts museum on the parkway, was planning to erect a fence around its property to protect its grounds from the feet of pilgrims. But “we need every inch of grass for the crowds,” Mr. Mirkin said, anticipating a fight, “and optically it’s awful.”AdvertisementWorse, the lighting design for the giant parkway stage that the pope will occupy on Saturday and Sunday was behind schedule. The source of the delay: A dispute over where exactly His Holiness should sit.Mr. Mirkin maintained that the papal chair should be off to the side, leaving center stage for the performers, who will include Mr. Bocelli and the Colombian rock star Juanes. But Bishop John J. McIntyre of the Philadelphia archdiocese kept insisting that the pope be front and center. Hence the delay.“You can’t do the lighting until you know where the pope sits,” Mr. Mirkin said, while walking along the parkway. “Everything has a ripple effect.”Mr. Mirkin didn’t conceal his frustration. “The bishops,” he said, “they aren’t showbiz guys.”Later in August, Mr. Mirkin attended a news conference at city hall, and looked on with trepidation as Mayor Michael A. Nutter unveiled Philadelphia’s plan to manage traffic and security during the pope’s visit.Much of downtown would be closed off for the entire weekend. Major mass transit hubs would be shut down. Security would be tight. Getting millions of people around would be difficult. Nonetheless, Mr. Nutter declared, “We are prepared for the papal pilgrims.”The local media was skeptical. Residents and business owners were frustrated by the onerous restrictions. Gridlock was practically guaranteed. The hashtag #popepocalypse spread on Twitter.The papal visit was set in motion years ago, when Pope Benedict XVI was head of the Roman Catholic Church. In 2012, the Vatican selected Philadelphia as the site of the next World Meeting of Families, a triennial gathering of Catholics. A papal visit is always a huge draw, but the popular appeal of Pope Francis is expected to swell the crowds.Advertisement“It had a different vibe when it was Benedict,” Mr. Mirkin said. “Now we have a rock star on our hands.”Inside city hall, a group of senior Philadelphia officials known as the Pope Five is overseeing the citywide preparations for the pope’s visit and coordinating — and often squabbling — with event planners like Mr. Mirkin. “The level of complications that goes with something like this is enormous,” Mr. Nutter said in an interview.It is also a deeply personal moment for Mr. Nutter, a Roman Catholic born and raised in Philadelphia.“To get my head around the idea that the pope is coming to Philadelphia during the time that I’m the mayor,” he said, “it’s an incredible feeling.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Forty percent of the United States population is within a day’s drive of Philadelphia, he said, and the enormous area closed to traffic included some of the densest neighborhoods in the city. He looked at the city’s plan and wondered: How, with all those security checkpoints, would the company he was counting on to pick up trash get its hundreds of garbage collectors to the parkway?The walls of ESM Productions’ office are lined with mementos from Mr. Mirkin’s backstage exploits. There are framed tickets from the Phillies World Series-winning game in 2008, V.I.P. passes to Jay Z shows, a signed letter from Bill Clinton and a set list from a particularly beloved client, Ms. Minaj.From this perch, Mr. Mirkin carries out his role as a professional micromanager. He is constantly on the phone, often instructing even those who hired him how to do their jobs. He is fueled alternately by shots of yerba maté and tequila, a combination that seems to keep him in an even balance.
                Far more say the church is in touch with the needs of Catholics today than at the end of the papacy of his predecessor.            “He is calm as a cucumber,” said Donna Crilley Farrell, executive director of the World Meeting of Families, which hired Mr. Mirkin.The World Meeting of Families has raised more than $30 million from donors, corporate sponsors and foundations to put on the event. ESM’s fee is $450,000. That’s less than half of what Mr. Mirkin initially hoped he would make. But he said he was willing to sacrifice pay to be part of a historic event. “We’re appropriately underpaid,” he said.AdvertisementFor that fee, Mr. Mirkin is orchestrating the vendors providing everything needed for a million-person Mass. NEP Group has the 25 miles of multistrand fiber optic cable, 35 broadcast television cameras and four mobile production facilities. Liberty Uplink is providing the satellite trucks. Light Action is bringing 320 lights, 20 risers and 5,000 feet of rafters.Plans call for 10,000 folding chairs, 10,000 feet of fencing, about 3,300 portable toilets and 27 golf carts to shuttle around V.I.P.s. To put it all together, 1,000 unionized stagehands are set to be on the clock.Of all the tasks Mr. Mirkin was responsible for, the one that got him most animated was booking the entertainment for the Festival of Families, a mix of pop music festival and religious celebration, on Saturday.It was something the archdiocese knew it needed help with. “We have liturgical experts, but finding legendary musical entertainment was not an obvious strength of ours,” Ms. Farrell said. “Scott has guided us through this world.”Knowing which groups were touring and which might be available, Mr. Mirkin compiled a list of suggested acts for Ms. Farrell and her team to peruse. He then reached out to the artists’ managers to ask if they would play for the pope.A few acts fell into place easily. Mr. Bocelli, Juanes and the Fray, a family-friendly rock band, all signed on early. (“It’s like a variety show,” Mr. Mirkin said.) But even a few weeks before the Festival of Families, Mr. Mirkin was working to augment the star wattage.Finally, after months of back and forth, Aretha Franklin signed on at the top of the bill. Mark Wahlberg was flying in to be the M.C. And Sister Sledge would perform its popular 1979 song “We Are Family.” Jay Z’s new music service, Tidal, will stream the event free.Consumed as he was with the entertainment, the religious elements of the evening seemed of secondary importance to Mr. Mirkin, who sometimes referred to the pope as “the talent.”Advertisement“The Festival of Families will talk about whatever they’ll talk about,” Mr. Mirkin said, describing the lineup. “The pope should speak for 15 minutes. And with all the music, it’s tight.”Over the weeks, Mr. Mirkin’s headaches were resolved, one by one.After he made some phone calls to friends in city hall, it was agreed that the Barnes Foundation would not erect fences around its land. (Helping Mr. Mirkin’s case was a message that the pope did not want to see too many fences, believing they disrupted his connection to the people.)Mr. Mirkin also prevailed in his campaign to get the pope’s chair placed to the side during the Festival of Families, leaving center stage for the musical stars.Two weeks before the event, Francis Fields was called off. Demand was tepid for the camping spots, and hotels in the city weren’t yet sold out. The cancellation became a minor news story, and Mr. Mirkin got calls from the local news and others involved in the preparations.Talking on the phone to Kenneth A. Gavin, director of communications for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Mr. Mirkin lamented how city officials were handling the camping brouhaha.“City hall, you know them, man, they’re the Politburo,” he said. “The best thing that could have happened is that the mayor would have gotten up there and said, ‘This camping was the dumbest thing ever.’ But they didn’t want to do that.”The company that was going to run the camping logistics was angry about losing a lucrative job, everyone was calling Mr. Mirkin to figure out what was happening, and he didn’t have time to deal with any of it.“It’s like a hot potato,” Mr. Mirkin said. “But I’m not going to let this take up a lot of my time.”No sooner were the Barnes, the chair and the camping situations resolved, however, than a new wrinkle arose. It had rained hard just before the ground cover began going down on the parkway. Mr. Mirkin knew from experience that wet grass covered with plastic pallets often rotted, emitting a pungent odor.Advertisement“It could smell awful,” he said.If a putrid aroma did arise, the union labor would have to pull up some of the ground cover to air out the soil. Construction of the tent city could be disrupted. And then Mr. Mirkin would once again be fielding dozens of phone calls from people wanting him to explain what, exactly, was going on.A version of this article appears in print on September 20, 2015, on Page BU1 of the New York edition with the headline: Putting On a Show for a Holy Headliner.
