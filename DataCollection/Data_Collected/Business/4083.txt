KesslerAfter the frigid winter last year, when many buyers stayed home, analysts expected the auto industry to post robust sales gains in February since higher percentages would be easier to achieve.But record cold spells struck again last month, once again hurting sales in the United States.General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, Nissan and Honda all missed analysts’ forecasts, though they did post modest February sales gains over the same period last year.Nationally, car companies sold 1.26 million vehicles last month, up only about 5 percent, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.23 million vehicles sold, according to the Autodata Corporation.Faring poorest among major automakers, Ford Motor reported that its sales fell 2 percent year over year.“We need to watch what’s happening at Ford,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at AutoTrader.com. The company largely got a pass for its lackluster performance last year because of its transition to the new, mostly aluminum-body F-150 pickup truck, she said, but that will not be the case this year.“Ford will come under increasing scrutiny if sales don’t pick up soon,” she said.In February, Ford’s F-Series sales fell 1 percent compared with last year. Based in Dearborn, Mich., Ford is still increasing production of the F-150, with a second assembly plant near Kansas City, Mo., set to begin making the trucks this month.Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president for United States marketing, sales and service, noted that retail sales, as opposed to fleet or business sales, of the pickup rose in February, even as overall sales fell, and said the trucks were “the hottest vehicles on dealer lots.”But it was not just the pickup: Most of Ford’s lineup took a hit, as the Fiesta, Focus and Taurus fell by double digits compared with a year ago. Ford’s sport utility vehicles were not immune either, with Escape sales down 9.6 percent and Edge sales falling 40 percent. The Explorer was a bright spot, with sales up 33.7 percent.On the Lincoln side, every vehicle in the luxury brand’s lineup was down by double digits, with the exception of its large sport utility vehicle, the Navigator.Another company struggling last month was Honda, whose 5 percent sales gain fell far short of the 11 percent analysts had expected.Last week, Honda announced that Takanobu Ito would step down as chief executive, as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from wide-ranging recalls tied to its longtime airbag supplier Takata.Honda has acknowledged it is reducing its global sales forecast for the year by at least 150,000 vehicles. The company has similarly lowered its earnings forecast, and its most recent quarterly profits fell 15 percent because of recall expenses.Other automakers escaped with gains in February, though not as stout as they would have liked.General Motors reported that overall sales rose 4 percent over the same period last year. Its trucks, particularly large S.U.V.s and its Silverado pickup, had robust sales once again. But its Buick division, a bright spot for the company last year, struggled, falling 9.2 percent as sales of sedans declined. Cadillac, which has a new chief and is moving its headquarters to New York, dropped 12.6 percent over the same period last year.Fiat Chrysler posted one of the better February results with a 5.6 percent increase, lifted once again by strong sales from its Jeeps (up 21 percent) and Ram trucks (up 6.8 percent). The company had been expected to gain nearly 9 percent.Nissan sales in North America were up 3 percent.An exception to the disappointing results last month was Toyota, which reported a gain of 13 percent for February. Volkswagen, which has struggled mightily, posted a sales drop of 5 percent, but was down 2 percent including its other brands.Ms. Krebs said that “weather may have been the biggest culprit” in the lackluster February sales, and it was possible that consumers would bounce back once spring arrived. She said lost sales could probably be made up in March or April, mirroring a similar trend last year.Advertisement
