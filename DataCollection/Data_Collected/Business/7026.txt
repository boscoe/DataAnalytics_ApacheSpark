Such sentiment was buoyed in part by the initial public offering of the peer-to-peer lender Lending Club last year.Credit Karma faces competitors, including Credit Sesame, which last month said it raised $16 million in financing, giving it a total of slightly more than $35 million, and Credit.com.In the financial technology market, Credit Karma is among the early players, founded in 2007. Its product was introduced in 2008. Earlier investors include Google Capital, which, with Tiger Global, led the company’s last financing round in 2014. Other earlier backers are Ribbit Capital, Susquehanna Growth Equity, Felicis Ventures and Dave McClure.The company said that it had raised a total of $368.5 million in its history. Some of that resulted from secondary transactions, however, and the company did not specify how much was primary capital.Credit Karma, which claims to have more than 40 million members, said in a statement on Tuesday that the new financing would go toward adding platforms and expanding services.It wants to allow users to consolidate student loans and compare insurance rates, for example. Credit Karma began as a site that merely provided credit scores to consumers.The statement also said that, “Credit Karma will continue to find new ways to leverage its data for the benefit of consumers and deliver tools and information to help them achieve their financial goals.”Advertisement
