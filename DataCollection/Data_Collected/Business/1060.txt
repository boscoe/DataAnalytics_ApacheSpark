Bond is unlike any other Hollywood franchise. The series — the first to go after a global audience — has generated billions in worldwide ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games. The latest installment, “Spectre,” is now making its debut.When the Bond name is first mentioned, one might conjure an image of the beach in “Dr. No” or perhaps the card-playing scenes in “Casino Royale.”But when you adjust for inflation, “Thunderball” — a film perhaps most recognized for having a villain with an eye patch — is the title that pulled in the most money from box offices around the world. Below is a ranking of the most popular films in the franchise, based off box-office receipts.
