Only 49.9 percent of its flights arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, which is the government’s definition of being on time. It was the worst on-time performance by a major airline in 10 years. Spirit declined to make an executive available for an interview. In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, a spokesman for the airline, Paul Berry, blamed bad weather for the canceled flights. He said weather had an outsize impact on Spirit “because of where these storms hit, our fleet size, and our network.” Advertisement
