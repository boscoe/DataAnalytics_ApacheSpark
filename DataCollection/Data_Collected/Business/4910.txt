Italian farm associations on Friday accused France of starting a trade war by announcing a ban on imports of vegetables from the southern Puglia region because of an outbreak of the bacteria xylella fastidiosa that has infected thousands of olive trees. The French agriculture minister, Stéphane Le Foll, announced the blockade on Friday ahead of a decision by the full European Union on a proposal to cull about 10 percent of the estimated 10 million trees in the hard-hit Lecce area of Puglia. Farmers in Italy say uprooting trees will not halt the bacteria’s spread because the trees can be infected without showing symptoms. “If we cut down 1 million trees this year, we’ll find another million infected a year later,” said Giovanni Melcarne, a Puglian olive producer. Experts from the 28 euro nations meet again April 21 to discuss a unified position. The outbreak has become critical in recent years. Last year, Italy had a poor harvest because of bad weather and attacks by the olive fly.A version of this brief appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Italian Farm Groups Accuse France of Trade War.
