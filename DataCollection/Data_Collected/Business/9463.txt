AdvertisementSupported byBy Reed Abelson and Katie BennerTheranos, the beleaguered Silicon Valley blood-testing company, is being accused of securities fraud by a major investor who has sued contending “myriad deceptions, falsehoods and fraudulent conduct.”Partner Fund Management, a San Francisco hedge fund, filed the lawsuit on Monday in the Delaware Court of Chancery, according to a letter sent to its investors.The suit is under seal, but the fund confirmed in a statement that it was taking legal action against Theranos.To get Partner Fund to invest in the company, Theranos engaged in “a series of lies, material misstatements and omissions,” according the letter, which has been reviewed by The New York Times. The letter also indicates that the suit names two of the company’s principals, Elizabeth Holmes, its founder and chief executive, and Sunny Balwani, its former president, as defendants.Theranos said it would fight the lawsuit, adding in a statement that Partner Fund: “is engaging in revisionist history, making claims that are not rooted in facts. The company remains committed to its mission and is appreciative of its strong investor base that understands and continues to support those efforts.”In the investor letter, Partner Fund said that it had “meticulously documented its due diligence” and that it could show “myriad deceptions, falsehoods and fraudulent conduct by Theranos, Holmes and Balwani in connection with PFM’s investment.”The lawsuit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Once a darling of Silicon Valley, Theranos has become a cautionary tale of investor overenthusiasm and faces intense regulatory and legal scrutiny over its assertions to have upended traditional blood testing through new technology.The company attracted a who’s who of venture capitalists and board members, earning it a valuation of about $9 billion.But after a series of Wall Street Journal stories raised doubts about whether its proprietary technology worked, the company was eventually sanctioned by federal officials over its testing methods. The company announced last week that it was closing its lab operations to focus on the development of a miniature medical testing machines it called the miniLab.Regulatory scrutiny facing the company includes an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over whether Theranos, which is privately held, violated securities laws. The company declined to comment on the status of those investigations.Advertisement
