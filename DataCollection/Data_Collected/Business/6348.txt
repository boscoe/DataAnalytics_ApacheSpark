PARIS — The Irish government agreed late on Tuesday to accept a takeover proposal for its 25 percent stake in the country’s flag carrier, Aer Lingus, from the parent company of British Airways, removing one of the last hurdles to the airline’s full privatization after three-quarters of a century of state ownership.The decision followed a marathon meeting in Dublin of the cabinet of Prime Minister Enda Kenny, where ministers of the governing coalition debated the findings of an expert group’s report presented this month. The report had concluded that an informal offer from the British Airways parent — International Consolidated Airlines Group, or I.A.G. — valuing Aer Lingus at close to $1.5 billion was fair.In a brief statement, the Irish transport minister, Paschal Donohoe, said the government had decided to support I.A.G.’s bid following “detailed consideration” of “all of the issues surrounding a potential disposal of the state’s shareholding.”The cabinet’s recommendation of the sale — still subject to a vote of the Irish Parliament — was expected to remove a major stumbling block to a formal bid, which I.A.G. has said would be conditional on the support of the government, as well as the Irish budget airline Ryanair, which is Aer Lingus’s largest shareholder with a stake of 29.8 percent.AdvertisementRyanair, which has itself made three unsuccessful attempts to acquire Aer Lingus, has yet to weigh in publicly on I.A.G.’s proposed offer. Robin Kiely, a Ryanair spokesman, said late on Tuesday that the airline was still awaiting a formal offer for its Aer Lingus shares from I.A.G., which he said would be considered “on its merits.”AdvertisementI.A.G. — which also owns Iberia, a Spanish full-service airline, and Vueling Airlines, a low-cost carrier — made an informal offer in February for Aer Lingus, after two previous bids were rejected late last year.I.A.G.’s sweetened offer for Aer Lingus stands at 2.55 euros a share, including a dividend. The deal, if completed, would value Aer Lingus at about €1.36 billion, or $1.48 billion.Given its proximity to Britain, the Irish airline market is appealing to I.A.G., which with its partners in the Oneworld airline alliance already controls roughly one-fourth of the air travel market between the European Union and North America. Acquiring Aer Lingus would further consolidate the group’s position with flights crossing the Atlantic.Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, discusses on CNBC factors that led to a 66 percent increase in net profit, including more customers turning from legacy airlines to discount carriers.Aer Lingus, which began scheduled service in 1936, was first privatized in 2006, but the government retained a 25 percent stake. Since emerging from a painful restructuring several years ago, the carrier has quietly pressed for an end to state ownership, as it has sought to reinvent itself as a leaner, nimbler competitor against the likes of larger European rivals — including British Airways.In recent years, Aer Lingus has focused increasingly on trans-Atlantic services, a strategy that has brought the Irish carrier into greater competition with British Airways.Analysts expect Ryanair would ultimately be amenable to a sale, which would value its stake at just over €400 million — roughly the amount the carrier spent acquiring its Aer Lingus shares from 2006 to 2008.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ryanair has threatened to take the case against a forced sale to Britain’s Supreme Court on human rights grounds.Separately, Ryanair reported a record full-year profit on Tuesday, but warned of an intensifying fare war across Europe in the coming months as lower oil prices help to reduce operating costs for many of its full-service rivals.AdvertisementRyanair, Europe’s largest airline by number of passengers, said its net profit jumped 66 percent in the year to March 31, to €867 million, or about $952 million, from €523 million a year earlier. Sales increased 12 percent to nearly €5.7 billion as annual passenger traffic climbed to nearly 91 million, up from 82 million a year earlier.Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, said the airline was on course to carry more than 100 million passengers this year as it reaps the benefits of a series of initiatives aimed at helping it to shed a reputation for gruff and inflexible service.But Mr. O’Leary conceded that competition with rival airlines remained intense. He cautioned that while passenger traffic was expected to increase roughly 10 percent this year, Ryanair’s revenue per passenger could slip around 2 percentage points because of “some irrational pricing response from competitors.”A version of this article appears in print on May 27, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Irish Government Accepts Bid for Stake in Aer Lingus.
