The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit released its ruling on Friday. BP was majority owner of the well where the leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded. BP and its minority partner, Anadarko Petroleum, had argued that they should not face federal Clean Water Act penalties. A trial is set for later this month to determine those penalties. United States District Court Judge Carl J. Barbier already has found that the oil giant acted with “gross negligence” in the tragedy, a ruling that could mean some $18 billion in penalties.
