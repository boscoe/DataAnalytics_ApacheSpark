Mattel posted a surprise increase in quarterly net sales, its first rise in more than two years, as sales of its Barbie dolls recovered and demand rose for its Hot Wheels toys. The company’s shares jumped nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading on Monday. Last year, Mattel released its traditionally blonde Barbie doll in a variety of skin tones, hairstyles and outfits to appeal to a larger demographic. Sales of Barbie dolls, which had fallen for the past two years, rose 0.5 percent to $327.6 million in the fourth quarter. Last week, Mattel continued the doll’s makeover, introducing Barbies in three new body shapes: tall, curvy and petite. Sales in the toymaker’s Wheels category, which includes Hot Wheels toys, rose 17 percent to $271.8 million, driven by Star Wars-licensed products like a Jedi Starfighter starship and the popular Millennium Falcon starship. Net sales increased 0.3 percent to $2 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 31. Mattel’s net income rose 43.6 percent to $215.2 million, or 63 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 61 cents.A version of this brief appears in print on February 2, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mattel’s Quarterly Sales Grow as Barbie Doll Choices Expand .
