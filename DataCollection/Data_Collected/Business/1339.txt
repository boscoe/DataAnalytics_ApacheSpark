A proposal to create the first new American stock exchange in five years has set off a fierce debate over how to solve problems created by increasingly complex and high-speed stock markets.The proposal comes from the Investors Exchange, or IEX, a company that became a symbol of the fight against high-frequency trading detailed in Michael Lewis’s book “Flash Boys.”Simply put, the application submitted by IEX to regulators in September explains that as an exchange it intends to use a 350-microsecond “speed bump” to stand in the way of traders that place and cancel orders more frequently than that.The speed bump concept, which has already been tested on IEX’s private trading venue, has won the company support from many large investors who have filed letters in support of the IEX application.AdvertisementBut the proposal has also drawn criticism from the other large stock exchange companies, a coalition of high-speed-trading firms and, perhaps most troublesome for IEX, one of the largest companies handling retail stock trades from ordinary investors, Citadel, the huge Chicago-based investment firm founded by Kenneth C. Griffin. Those companies have all said that IEX will introduce one more complex wrinkle that will end up benefiting one set of market participants over another, rather than leveling the playing field.AdvertisementIEX responded in a letter on Monday that its methods were the best way to protect investors who do not depend on placing and canceling orders quickly.“Is there room in the national market system for an exchange to adopt any means, however narrowly drawn, to counteract the more pernicious aspects of speed-based trading?” IEX’s general counsel, Sophia Lee, wrote in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission that was posted on Monday.The debate raises larger questions about the best way to improve a stock market that has grown remarkably fragmented and complicated over the last decade.There are already 11 officially sanctioned public stock exchanges in the United States and dozens more dark pools, or private forums, where traders can interact without posting their prices publicly. This complexity has been blamed for some of the technical errors that have brought down trading for hours at a time at several points in recent years.The fragmentation has also allowed high-speed traders to dart back and forth between exchanges and take advantage of investors on exchanges where prices are not updated as quickly.Some critics of the stock markets have said that lawmakers should change the rules that gave rise to all of this complexity, particularly a 2007 set of rules known as the Regulation National Market System, or NMS, which was intended to bring fairness to the automated markets.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

IEX has raised more than $100 million from investors, most of them mutual fund managers. Since it opened as an alternative trading venue in early 2013, IEX has attracted more market share each quarter and now handles about 1.5 percent of all daily stock trades in the United States.AdvertisementIn a letter to the S.E.C., Capital Group, a large mutual fund manager and an investor in IEX, wrote that the automation of the financial markets in recent years had largely worked to the advantage of investors of all stripes. But Capital Group’s chairman, Timothy D. Armour, said that the current markets allowed for some new problems such as “predatory high-frequency trading” that IEX could help deter.Investors like the Capital Group have blamed several practices at existing stock exchanges for opening the door to predatory trading strategies.Most exchanges currently offer so-called rebates to certain traders, which can encourage high-speed firms to rapidly flip shares to collect the rebates. IEX is doing away with rebates. IEX is also doing away with the lengthy list of order types that most other exchanges use and that play to the advantage of investors who understand the details of each order type.But the biggest change introduced by IEX is its 350-microsecond speed bump — the length of time it takes data to travel 38 miles of fiber optic cable.IEX’s proposal notes that other exchanges already introduce similar delays for their investors — some because of their location, in Chicago, say, rather than in New York, and some because they offer shorter delays for high-speed-trading firms that pay to have computers located directly in an exchange’s data center. IEX aims to eliminate these differences by imposing the same delay on every user.That proposal faced strong criticism from the other exchanges and from Citadel, which handles a significant volume of stock trades from retail brokerages like TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab.In a 12-page letter packed with objections, Citadel’s managing director, John C. Nagel, wrote that IEX’s method might help large mutual funds but could end up hurting smaller investors who want to trade immediately at the best price.In its letter on Monday, IEX contested Citadel’s suggestion that the 350-microsecond delay would prove a disadvantage to any group in particular, other than those traders that rely primarily on speed.An article on Tuesday about the Investors Exchange and its application to create a stock exchange misstated the length of the “speed bump” that it would use to slow down high-speed trading. It is 350 microseconds, not 350 milliseconds.A version of this article appears in print on November 17, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Exchange That Would Counter High-Speed Trade Stirs Debate .
