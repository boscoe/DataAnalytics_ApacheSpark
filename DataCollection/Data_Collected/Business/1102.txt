BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — Bob and Harvey Weinstein have renewed their contracts as co-chief executives of the Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein said in an interview here on Friday.“We renewed awhile ago,” he said. They received an extension that will leave the Weinstein brothers in place at their namesake film and television company for at least the next three years.The brothers’ contracts had been set to expire on Dec. 31, and the renewal was complicated by a board debate in which their own extension became coupled with a plan to give a new contract to David Glasser, the company’s chief operating officer.Mr. Glasser earlier disclosed plans to leave Weinstein, then decided to say. Both the brothers and Mr. Glasser will operate under deals with the same three-year term, Harvey Weinstein said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
