It also said it would give its remaining 1 percent stake to eligible Royal Mail employees, completing its exit from the company two years after Royal Mail went public.Royal Mail employees received 10 percent of the company’s shares when it had its initial public offering in October 2013 and would own 12 percent of the company after the latest share award by the government.Including the latest sale, the government has raised about £3.3 billion from taking the postal operator public.Shares of Royal Mail were trading down 5 percent at 448.6 pence in midmorning in London. That is about 36 percent above the initial public offering price of 330 pence.“This is a truly historic day for Royal Mail, with the workers gaining a share of this history,” Sajid Javid, the British business secretary, said in a news release.“We have delivered on our promise to sell the government’s entire remaining stake, which means that for the very first time the company is now wholly owned by its employees and private investors,” he added. “This is the right step for the Royal Mail, its customers and the taxpayer.”The government is expected to use money from the sale to help reduce the country’s debt by £4.5 billion.“By fully leaving state ownership, we have a win all-round — for customers, the work force and the taxpayer,” George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in the news release. “Every penny will be used to pay down our national debt, as we continue to bring our public finances under control.”The government raised £1.98 billion in the initial public offering, which was 24 times oversubscribed.But it was criticized last year by a public spending watchdog and by a Parliament committee for its cautious approach in taking the business public, and for not achieving a higher initial price. Shares jumped 38 percent on the first day of trading.The government previously raised an additional £750 million through a sale of a 15 percent stake in June.Advertisement
