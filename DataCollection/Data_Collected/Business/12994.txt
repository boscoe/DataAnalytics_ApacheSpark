The new guidance also revises and completes rules the Treasury had previously proposed in 2014 and 2015.The proposed regulations are more aggressive and expansive than the Treasury’s earlier volleys, venturing into at least two areas where its legal authority seems likely to be challenged.The first area relates to what the Treasury refers to as multistep acquisitions.In Section 7874 of the tax code, Congress has set out statutory hurdles that companies must clear to achieve the tax benefits. Simplifying somewhat, if the shareholders of a foreign acquirer own less than 20 percent of the combined entity after the acquisition, then the tax code simply disregards the acquisition for purposes of determining the residency of the combined entity. The purported inversion fails.If the shareholders of a foreign acquirer own more than 20 percent but less than 40 percent of the combined entity, and the foreign acquirer conducts substantial business activities in the foreign jurisdiction, then the inversion technically works.The rules subject the expatriating United States corporations to a tax on appreciated assets, among other unappealing consequences, but many companies are willing to stomach the short-term pain for long-term gain.If the shareholders of the foreign acquirer own more than 40 percent of the combined entity, the inversion works and most of the negative consequences are avoided. Similarly, inbound foreign acquisitions (where the foreign acquirer is larger than the domestic target) avoid the reach of Section 7874.These numerical guideposts are in the tax code and are thought to constrain the Treasury’s legal authority. In the guidance issued in 2014 and 2015, the Treasury nibbled around the edges, shutting down the ability of companies to “skinny down” the United States entity or “fatten up” the foreign acquirer to clear the statutory hurdles.The guidance issued Monday goes further, effectively counting domestic acquisitions by an inverted acquirer within the last three years as an impermissible fattening-up. If the value of those previous acquisitions is disregarded, the foreign acquirer becomes smaller and subject to more stringent inversion rules.The guidance on multistep acquisition relates to a new trend that was hard to predict in advance: Many inverted companies have proved to be recidivists. After an inversion, the inverted corporation then becomes the acquirer of American companies in new inversion transactions.I’m not sure if the new guidance will survive a legal challenge. It is hardly unusual for tax rules to disregard the form of a transaction in favor of its economic substance. Multistep transactions are often “stepped together” and treated as a single transaction for tax purposes.But it would be unusual to step together transactions that occur over a period of years, each of which had independent legal and economic substance and significance, in the absence of evidence of a plan to complete the series of transactions. The Treasury’s legal authority is broad, and the policy defensible, but it’s not a layup.A second area of controversy relates to earnings-stripping, a common technique where multinational corporations use interest payments or other transfers to shift income out of the high-tax United States into a low-tax jurisdiction like Ireland or the Cayman Islands.The guidance takes a swipe at earnings-stripping, employing legal authority that has lain dormant for nearly 50 years. In 1969, Congress authorized the Treasury to issue regulations distinguishing between debt and equity, under Section 385 of the tax code.Some tax experts consider Section 385 to be dead letter, superseded by more recent, specific limits on interest deductions.When Stephen Shay, a professor at Harvard Law School, proposed that the Treasury use its authority under Section 385 to curb earnings-stripping in the context of inversions, some lobbyists responded by questioning whether any attempt to do so would survive a legal challenge.The earnings-stripping guidance is not limited to inversions. Rather, it finally tackles a problem that has plagued international tax policy for years and accounts for a great deal of the erosion of the corporate tax base. In my view, this strengthens the Treasury’s case against a legal challenge.It could be years before a court decides whether the Treasury has the legal authority it claims, but thousands of large corporations will have to review complex multinational structures to sort out how the rules apply to them.Tax lawyers can expect a busy summer.Victor Fleischer is a professor of law at the University of San Diego.Advertisement
