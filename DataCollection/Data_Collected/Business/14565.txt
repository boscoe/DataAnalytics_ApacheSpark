Volkswagen has agreed to pay almost $15 billion to settle claims in the United States over its diesel emissions scandal, affecting nearly half a million cars. This is what that could mean for vehicle owners:Owners of about 475,000 model year 2009-15 Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars.Eligible models:2009-15 Volkswagen Jetta TDI2009-14 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen TDI2012-15 Volkswagen Beetle TDI2012-15 Volkswagen Beetle Convertible TDI2010-15 Audi A3 TDI2010-15 Volkswagen Golf TDI2015 Volkswagen Golf SportWagen TDI2012-15 Volkswagen Passat TDIOwners can either sell their vehicles back to Volkswagen for a price reflecting the value of the vehicles before the diesel cheating became known, or have their cars repaired without incurring any cost.

Those owners, however, would also risk getting a lesser settlement or none at all if their separate lawsuits are unsuccessful.The settlement still is subject to review by a federal judge and a public comment period, which might take until fall.AdvertisementBut if the deal is approved, it will require Volkswagen to begin acting as soon as possible. All repairs and payments are to be made no later than December 2018.A version of this article appears in print on June 28, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: How Settlement May Affect Car Owners.
