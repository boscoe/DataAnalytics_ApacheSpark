The net proceeds would be about £3.4 billion after transaction costs of £653 million, the company said.The consortium of investors also includes the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board of Canada and Temasek Holdings, a Singaporean investment company.“This sale realizes material value for shareholders and allows us to make significant progress on our strategic priority of protecting and strengthening our balance sheet,” Dave Lewis, the Tesco chief executive, said in a news release.The sale is subject to approval by shareholders and by regulators and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.Homeplus, which started in 1999, operates more than 1,000 stores in South Korea, including supermarkets, convenience stores and so-called hypermarkets, which sell both groceries and a broader array of retail goods traditionally found in department stores.The business posted revenue of £5.4 billion during the 53 weeks ended Feb. 28 and employs more than 26,000 people. It serves more than six million shoppers a week.The deal is expected to help Tesco reduce its debt as Mr. Lewis seeks to reverse the retailer’s losses.Mr. Lewis, a former Unilever executive who joined Tesco in September, has made broad changes, closing more than 40 stores, cutting thousands of jobs and selling noncore assets. He has also put his top executives on the floor at certain stores to help understand and improve the customer experience.Tesco has steadily lost market share in recent years to discount retailers like the German grocers Aldi and Lidl, and it has faced pricing wars with its British rivals. It has also been mired in investigations concerning a £263 million overstatement of profit.The retailer recorded a loss of £6.4 billion last year, its worst ever.The Homeplus deal would reduce Tesco’s debt by £4.2 billion, but still leave it with about £17.5 billion in debt.The transaction also represents the latest global retrenchment by Tesco in recent years.The company divested its Japanese operations in 2011 and sold most of its United States business in 2013 to an affiliate of Yucaipa, the private equity firm owned by the billionaire Ronald W. Burkle.Tesco said it would continue to have “strong businesses” in Southeast Asia, along with its operations in Britain, Ireland and other parts of Europe.HSBC and Barclays are advising Tesco on the transaction.Advertisement
