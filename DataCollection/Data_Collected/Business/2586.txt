When it comes to the taxes closest to home, the less you earn, the harder you’re hit.That is the conclusion of an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that evaluates the local tax burden in every state, from Washington, labeled the most regressive, to Delaware, ranked as the fairest of them all.According to the study, in 2015 the poorest fifth of Americans will pay on average 10.9 percent of their income in state and local taxes, the middle fifth will pay 9.4 percent and the top 1 percent will average 5.4 percent.“Virtually every state’s tax system is fundamentally unfair,” the report concludes. “Unfair tax systems not only exacerbate widening income inequality in the short term, but they also will leave states struggling to raise enough revenue to meet their basic needs in the long term.”The trend is growing worse, said Meg Wiehe, state policy director at the institute, a nonpartisan research organization based in the nation’s capital. Several states have adopted or are considering policy changes that further lighten the tax load on their wealthiest residents, she said.AdvertisementStates and localities have regressive systems because they tend to rely more on sales and excise taxes (fees tacked onto items like gas, liquor and cigarettes), which are the same rate for rich and poor alike. Even property taxes, which account for much of local tax revenue, hit working- and middle-class families harder than the wealthy because their homes often represent their largest asset.AdvertisementThe federal income tax system, by contrast, primarily taxes individuals at a graduated rate, and those who earn more pay a larger share. (The federal system also uses payroll taxes to raise large sums for Social Security and Medicare, dipping into the pockets of many low- and moderate-income Americans who pay little, if any, income tax.)In the institute’s “Terrible 10” states, the bottom 20 percent of earners pay up to seven times as much of their income in taxes as the top 1 percenters, the report says. These include Washington, where the poorest residents pay 16.8 percent of their income in taxes while the wealthiest sliver pays just 2.4 percent, followed by Florida, Texas, South Dakota, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Kansas and Indiana.Judgments about what makes a tax system fair, of course, vary widely. For the institute, fairness is equated with progressivity. Some conservatives dispute that definition, however, and argue that lowering tax rates on business and the wealthy promotes economic growth, which in the long run lifts everyone’s fortunes. That was the idea behind the tax revolution in Kansas ushered in by the Republican governor, Sam Brownback, in 2012. He reduced personal income tax rates while eliminating income taxes altogether for 190,000 businesses.Despite a crippling budget shortfall, Governor Brownback has continued to defend his approach. “It takes time for it to work,” he said last month.The institute rejects such arguments, saying that these sorts of “trickle-down economic theories” have long been discredited. It also dismissed boasts by some states like Washington and Texas that taxes were low for everyone because they lacked an income tax. “These states’ disproportionate reliance on sales and excise taxes make their taxes among the highest in the entire nation on low-income families,” the report said.Others have come to similar conclusions.Rather than relying on experts’ opinions, WalletHub, a consumer finance information and social networking site, surveyed taxpayers for a definition of fairness when it did its own analysis of state tax systems last fall.
            In virtually every state, the lowest fifth of earners pay a greater share of their incomes toward state and local taxes than the next three-fifths and considerably more than the top 1 percent.

On all three, Washington came in last and Montana, which does not rely much on sales and excise taxes, ranked at the top.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

On a scale of how much each state’s tax system contributes to income inequality, New York is 39th and New Jersey is 41st.The higher-ranked states generally have progressive income taxes or supplement the federal earned-income tax credit program for low- and moderate-income households with their own refundable credits that can help offset sales and property taxes, reducing the overall tax bill for those eligible. By contrast, breaks that tend to favor richer residents, like being able to deduct for home mortgage interest and reduce the cost of capital gains taxes, shift more of the tax burden to lower wage earners.Still, “even these least regressive states fail to meet what most people would consider minimal standards of tax fairness,” the report concluded, because “at least some low- or middle-income groups pay more of their income in state and local taxes than wealthy families.”A growing number of mainstream economists have been warning about the links among inequality, tax policy and slower economic growth. In September, the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s issued a report that noted regressive state taxes and income inequality seemed to go hand in hand and served as a drag on the economy.“Through a progressive tax structure, it’s possible to counteract much of the depressing effect inequality has on tax revenue growth rates,” the S.&P. report said.Progressive income taxes, which require the rich to pay a higher proportion of their income than the poor, have come under attack from conservative advocates and policy makers.David Burton, a senior fellow in economic policy at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington, argued a flat tax was not only better for the economy but, in his view, fairer across the board. “Rich people pay substantially more,” he said, “but not a greater share.”Some states have moved away from a progressive system. North Carolina, for example, replaced its graduated income tax with a flat tax and increased the sales tax on electricity in 2013. That same year, Ohio reduced personal income tax rates across the board and raised the sales tax. And Kansas, in addition to reducing its income tax, increased its sales tax.AdvertisementNew Republican governors as well as Republican majorities in several statehouses across the country have promised to continue the trend and cut personal income tax rates in addition to corporate rates.A version of this article appears in print on January 14, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Study Finds Local Taxes Hit Lower Wage Earners Harder.
