That agreement with Apple will last three months and applies only to other digital outlets — not the traditional cable, satellite and telecom companies that sell HBO as part of television bundles. Through Apple, HBO Now will cost $15 a month.Some traditional distributors have been receptive to the new service but others have resisted, HBO executives said last week. The service represents a broader transformation in the television business, as it is intended to attract the rising number of people who watch television via streaming.Cablevision executives said they were providing more choice to their Internet customers. “We are enabling Optimum Online customers to enjoy content in any way they choose to receive it,” Kristin Dolan, Cablevision’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. “Cablevision will continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers.”Advertisement
