Pearson, the British education company, said on Saturday that it was in discussions to sell its 50 percent stake in the Economist Group, the publisher of The Economist.“Pearson confirms it is in discussions with the Economist Group board and trustees regarding the potential sale of our 50 percent share in the group,” it said in a statement. “There is no certainty that this process will lead to a transaction.”Pearson also owns the Financial Times, but announced late last week, after releasing a similar statement, that it had reached a deal to sell the newspaper to the Japanese company Nikkei for $1.3 billion. It said that it wanted to focus on its core education business.The discussions involving The Economist, The Financial Times reported, are focused on other shareholders of the group, including wealthy families like the Schroders, the Cadburys and the Agnellis. Exor, the Agnelli family’s Italian holding company and a major shareholder in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, is in talks with Pearson to raise its 4.72 percent stake in The Economist Group, according to several news reports.AdvertisementThe German media company Axel Springer and the financial information company Bloomberg, which came close to buying The Financial Times, were also approached, the newspaper reported.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
