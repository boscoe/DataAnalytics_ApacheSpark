ATHENS —  Investors issued a vote of no confidence in Greece’s economy on Monday, dumping stocks as trading on the Athens exchange resumed for the first time in five weeks.A plunge of more than 16 percent for the main Greek index and a 30 percent sell-off for bank stocks were the latest signs of Greece’s shattered economy. But the resumption of trading was a necessary step as Greece tries to emerge from controls on financial activity that the government, confronted with a bank run, imposed at the end of June.Analysts said stock prices could begin to recover in the weeks to come, bringing much-needed capital into the country, as investors with an appetite for risk look for bargains.In yet another sign of trouble, though, new survey data on Monday showed a fall in Greek manufacturing activity since the government imposed controls in late June on the flow of money out of Greece.AdvertisementMuch depends on the outcome of negotiations between government officials and representatives of the country’s international creditors on a multibillion-euro bailout, Greece’s third in five years. The talks entered a second week on Monday.Advertisement“If the new deal with creditors is struck and ratified, Greek stocks could rebound nicely,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said in an email. “And if the deal then actually holds, with Greece implementing the structural reforms demanded by creditors, Greece could recover strongly.”He added: “That is a big if.”After initial talks with foreign envoys on Friday that focused on Greece’s finances, privatization of public assets and bank recapitalization, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said that “there was convergence on some points, less on others.”The stock exchange had been closed since the end of June, when the government also shut banks in an effort to prevent more money from leaving the country after talks with creditors collapsed. Banks reopened on July 20, but restrictions on money transfers and withdrawals remain in force.The resumption of trading in Athens was intended to be another step toward normalcy, but instead, investors used the opportunity to flee exposure to the Greek economy.
                European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.            Shares on the exchange initially dropped nearly 23 percent as trading began on Monday, with bank stocks leading the rout. While the main index recovered somewhat by the end of trading, bank shares did not. They might have fallen even more on Monday, but selling was halted after the declines reached 30 percent, in accordance with Athens stock exchange rules.Banking has been among the hardest-hit sectors of the Greek economy, and lenders are dependent on emergency cash from the European Central Bank to stay afloat.Greek shares recovered slightly by closing and were down 16 percent, but the initial price declines showed that most investors were not yet willing to bet on the country again.Bank stocks “will fall quite a bit more and will take a while to rebound,” said Nikos Pantelakis, chief executive of Pantelakis Securities, an Athens brokerage firm.AdvertisementMr. Pantelakis said that shares of companies outside the financial industry, like the telecom company OTE, Aegean Airlines or the betting firm OPAP “will recover faster.”Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.A version of this article appears in print on August 4, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Stocks, Especially of Banks, Sink in Greece as Athens Market Reopens.
