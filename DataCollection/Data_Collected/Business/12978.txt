The approval of the drug, Inflectra, is only the second time that the Food and Drug Administration has cleared a quasi generic biotech drug for the United States market. Biotech drugs are powerful, injected medicines produced in living cells. They typically cost more than traditional chemical-based drugs. In 2014, the latest year data is available, six of the 10 best-selling medicines globally were biologics, with about $49 billion in combined sales. Remicade, first approved in 1998, is Johnson & Johnson’s top-selling medicine with sales of $6.56 billion last year. Inflectra, made by Celltrion and Pfizer, is approved for a half-dozen uses, including psoriasis. For decades, biotech drugs lacked generic competition because the F.D.A. had no system to approve cheaper versions. That changed in 2012, and the agency last year approved its first such drug, Neupogen, which is made by Amgen.Advertisement
