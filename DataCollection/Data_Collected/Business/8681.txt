But Disney — which has altered its movie strategy considerably since 2009 — has decided not to extend the DreamWorks partnership beyond next summer, and Mr. Spielberg is now in talks to strike a similar distribution deal with other studios.Mr. Spielberg’s amicable departure from Disney will probably occur after the July release of “The BFG,” according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comply with the wishes of DreamWorks and Disney, which both declined to comment. Multiple studios have approached DreamWorks, these people said. A return to Universal, where DreamWorks was based until 2005, is one option.Universal declined to comment. Representatives of 20th Century Fox, where the former DreamWorks executive Stacey Snider is now co-chairwoman, and Paramount Pictures, which has a long history with DreamWorks, had no comment.A new home base for DreamWorks would probably come with hundreds of millions in fresh financing from Jeff Skoll’s Participant Media and others, allowing Mr. Spielberg and his lieutenants to control their own film budgets. Participant declined to comment.Participant is an issues-oriented media company that was started by Mr. Skoll in 2004. As the activist studio expanded and searched for hits, it fell into a loose alliance with DreamWorks, which often needed funds to back its projects. (The publicly traded DreamWorks Animation is operated as a separate company.)Together, DreamWorks and Participant had a major hit in “The Help,” which took in more than $216 million worldwide, on a modest production budget of about $25 million, after Disney released it in 2011. Mr. Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” released by Disney the next year, had about $275 million in worldwide ticket sales, and won an Oscar for its star, Daniel Day-Lewis, while joining a national debate on effectiveness in government.If other films have done less well — “The Fifth Estate,” another DreamWorks-Participant collaboration, about Julian Assange, was a monumental flop — the two companies have clearly found a comfort zone in both political and fiscal terms.The partnership between DreamWorks and Disney was never prickly, but it never exactly worked, either.The initial deal called for DreamWorks to supply about six movies annually. It ended up being more like two to four a year, as DreamWorks struggled with financing challenges and Mr. Spielberg’s commitments to outside studios. Disney in 2009 called Mr. Spielberg’s grown-up dramas “the perfect complement” to its own slate of films. But soon after that Disney spent about $8 billion to acquire Marvel and Lucasfilm and shifted its movie strategy toward four brands: Marvel, Lucasfilm, Disney and Pixar.The expected split was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.Advertisement
