The charges were filed with the National Labor Relations Board on Monday. On Dec. 4, more than 70 percent of the 161 skilled trades workers at the VW plant voted to join the U.A.W. There are about 1,450 auto assembly workers at the plant. The outcome was seen as important for the union because it was the first time workers at an auto assembly plant in the southern United States and owned by a foreign automaker voted to join the union.
