The company said that the charge would cut fourth-quarter net income by $700 million, after deferred tax benefits, but that it still expected a full-year pretax profit of $6 billion when it reports 2014 earnings Thursday. Ford said in a regulatory filing that it could no longer exchange bolívars to dollars because of Venezuelan currency exchange controls. The company said the controls also had limited the availability of auto parts and had cut into normal production. But Ford said it would keep operating there for the foreseeable future. Advertisement
