SÃO PAULO, Brazil —  Investors in mutual funds in New York and London may complain about the fees they pay, but they are getting no sympathy in Brazil.Money-market funds with no minimum investment charge an average annual fee of 3.14 percent, according to the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association. Stock market mutual funds sold to retail investors charge an average of 2.13 percent.That is more than triple the 0.7 percent average fee that stock market mutual funds charge in the United States, according to the Investment Company Institute.Financial professionals in Brazil say that customers are accustomed to working through their banks and that the three biggest banks have a stranglehold on the largest part of the asset-management business. The banks contend that regulation adds to the cost of doing business.Advertisement“Brazilians are in the habit of doing everything, whether credit cards or insurance or investments, through their bank,” said Marzo Bernardi, global head of client services for Western Asset, a subsidiary of Legg Mason that in Brazil sells its funds through the big banks’ distribution networks. “If you want assets, you have to work with the banks.”AdvertisementThree local giants, Banco do Brasil, Banco Itaú and Banco Bradesco, continue year after year to manage between them nearly half of the mutual fund sector’s 2.7 trillion reais, or $870 billion, in assets.A glance at the funds on offer at the big banks shows expenses that would shock many American investors.Some short-term bond funds, which are 100 percent invested in government debt, charge investors a 4.5 percent annual fee. Many index funds — which do no research or stock picking but merely emulate part or all of the stock market — charge 3.5 percent. Funds that do try to pick the best stocks often charge either a 4 percent annual fee or a hedge fund “2 and 20” model, in which investors pay an annual management fee of 2 percent of assets under management and 20 percent of returns.Big investors can find cheaper options, but even including institutional investors, the average stock market mutual fund fee is still 1.8 percent and money-market funds charge 0.69 percent. Money-market funds in the United States charge on average 0.13 percent, or less than one-fifth the Brazilian rate.Brazilian fees are especially surprising because money managers should have an easier job than their United States or European counterparts.The shortest-term government debt in Brazil traditionally pays interest rates in the double digits — it now pays 13.75 percent — so money-market and short-term bond funds usually put most or all of their money in the Brazilian equivalent of Treasury bills.And the entire stock market has only 448 companies, of which only about 80 have enough shares in circulation to interest mutual funds.AdvertisementStock pickers in the United States must choose from more than 5,000 companies, and with basic interest rates close to zero, many money-market and bond funds must scramble just to break even.It is an axiom among economists that if a business is lucrative, new companies will enter, and the increased competition will bring down prices for consumers and profits for business.That has not been the case in Brazil’s investment industry.“The banks’ fund divisions have small staffs and fantastic revenues,” said William Eid Jr., a finance professor at the Fundação Getulio Vargas School of Business Administration in São Paulo. “It’s the best business in the world.”Excluding Luxembourg and Ireland, which mostly sell to offshore investors, Brazil has the world’s fifth-largest mutual fund industry, bigger than Japan’s and more than double Germany’s.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Global banks with long-established retail operations in the country, like Santander and HSBC, are significant players but still lag far behind the big three. No pure-play asset manager cracks the top 10 list of assets under management.The biggest is Western Asset, and its Brazilian mutual funds have only about $10 billion in assets, 1.1 percent of the industry total.The chief executive of another independent asset manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his firm, like Western Asset, also depends on the big banks for distribution, highlighted that they keep costs high.“They take for distribution at least 70 percent of the revenue. If we charge 3 percent on a fund, at least 2.1 percent is going to the banks,” he said. “They won’t let us lower costs.”Reinaldo Le Grazie, chief executive of Bradesco Asset Management, declined to say what his firm charged, but he said that standard distribution costs in the industry were lower: 50 percent of the management fee for new funds and 30 to 40 percent for established ones.AdvertisementIt is impossible to verify the number independently because these costs are not public in Brazil, though that is supposed to change next year.In the United States, “fund supermarkets” like Fidelity or Charles Schwab charge either a set fee — usually $50 — or an annual fee of less than 0.25 percent of assets for selling other firms’ funds on their websites.“Distribution here is expensive because almost no sales are over the Internet,” Mr. Le Grazie said. “They’re done person-to-person through advisers in our branch offices.”Many American banks and full-service brokers sell funds in a similar manner. They often charge a 5 percent sales commission or 1 percent of fund assets each year for distribution, but the market share for these “load” funds is only 20 percent in the United States and is falling rapidly.Carlos Massaru Takahashi, the chief executive of BB DTVM, a division of Banco do Brasil and the country’s largest asset manager, attributed the higher costs to regulations.Even for money-market funds, the manager must send, by mail, an account summary every month and summon investors for an assembly at least once a year, he said. The manager must also compute holdings on a daily basis and present them to any investor on demand.“These rules make the industry transparent and safe, but they increase costs,” Mr. Takahashi said.Several independent Brazilian brokers have started fund supermarkets, where investors can choose from many mutual fund families and often pay lower fees. But even the biggest, XP Investimentos, is tiny. Its distribution platform has doubled in size since last January, but it still has less than 1 percent of the mutual fund market.“The problem is cultural,” Guilherme Benchimol, the chief executive of XP Investimentos, said. “We have to prove to clients that it is as safe to invest with a brokerage as with a big bank.”AdvertisementProfessor Eid echoed his opinion.“It’s a mixture you see throughout the Brazilian economy that keeps costs high: too much bureaucracy, not enough competition, and consumers who accept high prices.”A version of this article appears in print on June 12, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: In Brazil, Investors Pay Banks a Premium for Tradition.
