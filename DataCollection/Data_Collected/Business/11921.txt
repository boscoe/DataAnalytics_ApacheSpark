The site will begin producing an email newsletter in mid-March.Mr. Simmons left ESPN and the website he founded, Grantland, last year under bitter circumstances. In the months since his departure, Mr. Simmons has resurrected a podcast he once did for Grantland. He has not been shy about saying that ESPN let him go rather than renewing his contract because he criticized the National Football League and its commissioner, Roger Goodell. ESPN has denied that.Months after Mr. Simmons’s departure, ESPN shut Grantland.The Ringer looks as if it will be similar to Grantland, which covered a mix of sports and pop culture. Mr. Simmons has announced about a dozen hires for the Ringer, the majority of whom worked with him at Grantland. When the site does debut, it will end what will have effectively been a yearlong hiatus from writing for Mr. Simmons, who has developed a loyal and substantial following for his columns written in the voice of the rabid, and often frustrated, fan that he is.In addition to the Ringer, Mr. Simmons will also have an HBO show that will have its premiere this year. Last week, HBO announced that Stuart Miller, the former co-executive producer of “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” would serve as executive producer of the show. Jason Ross, another “Daily Show” veteran, was named head writer.On Wednesday, when a person asked Mr. Simmons on Twitter what lessons he learned from his experience of running a business like Grantland, Mr. Simmons replied: “Don’t do it with ESPN.”Advertisement
