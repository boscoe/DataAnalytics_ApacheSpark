The proceedings had been thrown into turmoil on Tuesday when a female juror accused a male juror of trying to poison her and of tampering with an avocado on her sandwich.The lawyer, Kevin Marino, said his client wanted the jury to reach a verdict, one that he obviously hoped would find him not guilty of stealing some of the source code for Goldman’s high-frequency trading platform.The jury returned to its work, minus the jurors involved in the unusual conflict, after Mr. Marino and prosecutors with the Manhattan district attorney’s office agreed to allow 10 jurors — eight women and two men — to decide the case. The jury completed its fourth full day of deliberations on Wednesday.Justice Daniel Conviser of State Supreme Court in Manhattan urged both sides to avoid a mistrial after talking to the remaining jurors and determining the dispute would not affect their deliberations.The judge said the juror’s accusation that another juror was trying to poison her was not credible and warranted her removal. He said the second juror was removed because the incident had unnerved him and could influence his deliberations.Justice Conviser said he would consider a request from the news media to release a redacted transcript of the closed-door session with the two jurors who were excused from the trial.The deliberations are expected to continue on Thursday.Advertisement
