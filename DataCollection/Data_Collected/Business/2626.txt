WASHINGTON —  The House on Wednesday easily passed legislation to ease some of the banking regulations adopted after the financial crisis, with 29 Democrats shrugging off President Obama’s veto threat to join united House Republicans.The bill, which passed 271 to 154, follows two other measures approved in the last month that made changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, but this one would be the broadest effort to shift course.It would delay by two years a Dodd-Frank mandate that financial firms sell off bundled debt, known as collateralized loan obligations; exempt some private equity firms from registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission; loosen regulations on derivatives; and allow some small, publicly traded companies to omit historical financial data from their financial filings.Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called those changes “modest clarifications of the Dodd-Frank Act,” noting that almost all of the provisions had previously passed the House with bipartisan majorities over the last two years, if not by unanimous agreement.AdvertisementHe said the recent Democratic “change of heart” against the proposals was “because the left hand doesn’t know what the far left hand is doing.”Democrats, led by Mr. Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said they intended to draw the line against legislation that further erodes Dodd-Frank.Advertisement“The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is helping prevent the kinds of excessive financial risk-taking that caused the worst recession in more than 70 years, left millions of Americans unemployed, and resulted in trillions of dollars in lost wealth,” the White House’s official statement of policy said, charging that the House bill would raise risks while “benefiting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.”For Wall Street lobbyists, Wednesday’s vote followed a pattern they have helped develop: Pass legislation in the House with some Democratic support, then come back on major must-pass bills like spending measures and attach the financial legislation as a noncontroversial rider.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bush administration, who is a consultant with the financial industry. “Most of these minor reforms and technical fixes even had significant Democratic support as recently as four months ago.”The Senate has yet to take up the bill, and with Senator Warren leading the charge, it may not be able to muster the 60 votes needed to reach the president.A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: House Passes Legislation to Ease Some Dodd-Frank Financial Rules.
