And while the European Central Bank on Thursday reiterated that its extensive stimulus program was producing benefits, it acknowledged that the economy continues to operate well below its potential and said that growth would most likely remain weak for some time.The central bank seeks to keep prices in the eurozone rising at a rate just under 2 percent, but it has not hit that target in more than two years. Many economists argue that even the very low inflation that the bloc was experiencing before prices turned negative was undermining growth.To confront the slide, the central bank last year cut its main interest rate target to 0.05 percent and its deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent, in effect charging banks to hold excess reserves.According to preliminary figures from Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, consumer prices in the 19-nation euro currency area were flat in April, compared with a year ago. They were up just slightly from the minus 0.1 percent recorded in March and better than the nadir reached in January of minus 0.6 percent.The core rate of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, was unchanged in April at 0.6 percent.The jobless rate stayed at 11.3 percent in March, Eurostat said in a separate release. In the overall European Union, made up of 28 nations, unemployment stood at 9.8 percent, also flat compared with February. Almost 24 million people remain without work across the region.The numbers were in line with economists’ expectations.“The bad news is that the core inflation rate still stands at 0.6 percent,” Mr. Spiro said, “and that is woefully low.” He added: “And it’s not because of oil prices, it’s because of the underlying weakness in the eurozone economy.”In March, the central bank announced a policy of quantitative easing, under which it pledged to buy up to 60 billion euros, or about $66 billion, of government bonds and other assets each month through September 2016. That policy has pushed down interest rates across Europe and driven the euro lower against the dollar, a boon to the Continent’s exporters.The stimulus, and a fall in energy prices, appear to be giving momentum to a recovery in the region. On Wednesday, the central bank reported that private-sector lending grew in March for the first time in three years, another sign that momentum is picking up.Howard Archer, chief European and British economist for IHS Economics, said that the eurozone’s gross domestic product appeared to have expanded by as much as 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2015 from the previous three months. That would put the annualized rate around 2 percent, substantially better than the 0.2 percent rate of growth in the United States in the first quarter.That apparent reversal of fortunes has unsettled investors who had been complacent in betting that America’s strength would lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as this spring.On Thursday, the euro rose 0.6 percent in afternoon trading, to $1.1198, continuing to regain ground lost since late last year. The yield on German 10-year bond yields, a reflection of government borrowing costs, rose to 0.32 percent, the highest in weeks.Despite growing hopes of a eurozone turnaround, the weak labor market continues to keep a lid on demand. Eurostat reported on Thursday that per capita household income and consumption both increased by just 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014 from the previous three months.The bloc’s member states are experiencing vastly different conditions. Germany, the eurozone’s biggest economy and by many measures its strongest, posted a jobless rate of just 4.7 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, Greece, which is locked in tense negotiations to avoid default, remains stuck at a depression-level 25.7 percent.The recovery has done little to galvanize the labor market in Spain. The Spanish economy grew 0.9 percent in the first quarter, the national statistics agency said on Thursday, close to a 3.6 percent annualized rate. But the jobless rate remains at 23 percent.France’s unemployment rate is at 10.6 percent, while Italy’s is at 13 percent.The European Central Bank said on Thursday, in its monthly economic report, that its policy actions were having the desired effect. While price pressures will likely continue to be “very low in the months ahead,” it said, “measures of longer-term inflation expectations have recovered from low levels,” with the market currently pricing in an annual rate of inflation in 2019 of 1.8 percent.Despite the flurry of reports, Mr. Spiro said, it was “wide of the mark to talk about a genuine and meaningful recovery.”Advertisement
