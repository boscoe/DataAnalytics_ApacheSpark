The diplomatic advance helps open the way for American airlines to begin flying to Cuba in what would be the biggest business deal struck as the countries try to normalize relations. Officials on each side said they hoped to reach a formal deal soon. American and Cuban travelers must now fly on charter flights that can be complicated to book. They often must arrive at the airport four hours early and comply with strict baggage limits. American officials and aviation executives have speculated that Cuba could allow more than 12 flights from the United States daily. It is unclear if those flights would completely replace charters, but they appear certain to create a surge in travel that would further strain Cubaâ€™s already overburdened tourist infrastructure. Authorized American travel to Cuba is up 50 percent this year, according to the United States Embassy in Havana. Advertisement
