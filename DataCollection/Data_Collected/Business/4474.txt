Target said on Wednesday that it would increase the pay of its workers to at least $9 an hour, joining retailers like Walmart and TJX in raising its hourly wage in a more competitive job market and facing pressure from labor groups.Target, a retailer with about 347,000 workers in the United States, has begun telling them that they will start to receive higher wages this spring, according to a person with knowledge of the company’s plans. The retailer has said it already pays all of its employees more than the federal minimum wage, $7.25 an hour.Brian Cornell, Target’s chief executive, told financial analysts this month that the company would make sure that it remained “very competitive from a wage standpoint.” Target said that it did not expect those efforts to affect its earnings.Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said the company did not disclose pay, but that it was continuously evaluating pay levels.AdvertisementTarget, which is making a turnaround after years of lackluster sales, said last week that it was laying off 1,700 corporate employees in a cost-cutting drive at its Minneapolis headquarters. Target aims for a cost savings of $2 billion in two years to reinvest in areas like food, e-commerce and supply-chain technology.Walmart last month took the lead in announcing a raise for its hourly workers, saying they would earn at least $9 an hour by April and at least $10 by next February. Since then, TJX, which operates TJ Maxx, Marshalls and Home Goods stores, said it would increase wages this year.AdvertisementPay is rising in the retail industry as an improved job outlook has increased competition for low-wage, hourly workers. The economy is adding jobs rapidly, the jobless rate is at its lowest level since 2008 and wages are climbing slowly, government figures showed last week.A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Target Plans to Raise Pay to at Least $9 an Hour.
