Earnings fell, too, to $533 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with $2 billion, or $1.32 a share, in the same period last year.Despite the drop, the results beat analysts’ expectations, and PepsiCo shares were up in premarket trading.The company, like many others, has had to change the accounting method it uses for its Venezuelan operations, and it said that adjustment erased $1.4 billion from its bottom line.Additionally, the company said that the stronger dollar, which makes sales internationally look weaker than they are, knocked about 12 percent off its reported revenue.“We are pleased with our performance for the third quarter of 2015,” Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, said in a statement. Ms. Nooyi said that revenue grew in spite of weakness in PepsiCo’s international markets, which account for roughly half of its business, and that profit margins increased.In particular, PepsiCo has benefited from strong sales in its North American beverage business, which no longer includes Latin America. While sugary soda continues to struggle to win over consumers, Gatorade, the company’s workhorse sports drink brand, has done well, and executives have said Mountain Dew Kickstart, a new, less caffeinated twist on the popular soft drink that incorporates fruit juices, is doing well.PepsiCo also has quietly raised prices on products, including reducing the size of bags of chips it sells but not lowering the price. It also has cut more than $1 billion in costs out of its operations so far this year.Advertisement
