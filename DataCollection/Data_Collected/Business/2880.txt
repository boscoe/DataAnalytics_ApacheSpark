Expedia agreed on Friday to buy its fellow travel booking site Travelocity for $280 million in cash, nearly two years after the two forged a marketing and technology partnership.Expedia will acquire Travelocity from the company’s current parent, the Sabre Corporation.The acquisition will furnish Expedia with another well-known name in the travel industry. Expedia already operates Hotels.com, Hotwire and CarRentals.com. Travelocity claims to service some 20 million travelers each month.The tie-up is the logical follow-up to a 2013 agreement between the two travel sites, in which Travelocity used Expedia’s technology for its American and Canadian websites, as well as its competitor’s supply and customer service program.“The strategic marketing agreement we’ve had in place has been a marriage of Travelocity’s strong brand with our best-in-class booking platform, supply base, and customer service,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Expedia’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Evolving this relationship strengthens the Expedia Inc. family’s ability to continue to innovate and deliver the very best travel experiences to the widest set of travelers, all over the world.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/24/2015, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Expedia Agrees to Pay $280 Million for Travelocity.
