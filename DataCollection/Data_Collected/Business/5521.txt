With three branches of government assiduously protecting the rich, any policy that would restore economic equilibrium is not really up for discussion.May I suggest a future article titled “Why Americans Are Soaked by the Rich”?Marita PettitCincinnati, April 19To the Editor:I don’t know where Neil Irwin gets his information. Semantics matters. How a question is worded matters. People do not want to “soak” anyone. The term “redistribution” does not belong in the conversation. It is about the wealthy paying their fair share. According to any poll I have read, a notable majority of Americans feel that the wealthy do not pay their fair share. They pay substantially lower rates than a few decades ago. With this country now more of a plutocracy than a democracy, fairness matters.Paula CroninHooksett, N.H., April 20To the Editor:Neil Irwin’s “Why Americans Don’t Want to Soak the Rich” is a well-crafted and moderate insight into an issue that the media has convinced most is not up for question; the rich are hated, don’t pay their “fair share” and deserve, therefore, to be crushed.What was not noted was the idea that many Americans aspire to wealth and don’t want to be targeted when they get there, so they prefer lenient taxation. In addition, many feel that what government does with the $3 trillion it confiscates from us is so poorly managed and so wasteful that to trust Washington with more money, from the rich or others, would only make matters worse.Richard KlitzbergBoca Raton, Fla., April 19Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
