The Labor Department said on Tuesday that rates rose in just four states and were unchanged in four others. Job gains remained healthy in states with large oil and gas industries, suggesting that plunging oil prices have yet to cause significant layoffs. Texas gained 45,700 jobs in December, the most in the nation. Over all, 41 states gained jobs, while nine said they had lost jobs. Nationwide, nearly three million more Americans are earning paychecks now compared with 12 months ago. Advertisement
