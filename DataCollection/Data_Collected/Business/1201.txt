Lingonberries, Swedish meatballs and the frustrations of furniture assembly manuals are coming to central Indiana: Ikea, the Swedish home furnishings retailer, announced plans on Tuesday to open a new store outside Indianapolis.When the store opens in Fishers, Ind., in the fall of 2017, it will join 41 Ikea outlets built in the United States since the company burst on the American scene in 1985.As the world’s largest seller of furniture, the company has expanded in the United States while also adapting its business model: Executives said this year that they should have shifted to online marketing sooner.But Ikea is still banking on the attractions and community offered by brick-and-mortar stores. At a news conference broadcast live by Indiana television stations, Ikea officials said the Fishers site would offer decorated showrooms, supervised child play areas, a 300-seat cafeteria and a bistro. The retailer is also evaluating ways to generate its own electricity on site.AdvertisementThe store will have 296,000 square feet with 1,000 parking spaces on 35 acres of land adjacent to Interstate 69. Officials said the company prefers to plant its flag next to major highways so the Ikea sign in blue and yellow (the national colors of Sweden) is visible from afar.AdvertisementIkea officials are filing their paperwork with city authorities for final approval of the store. They hope to break ground in the fall of 2016 and open the next year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Five hundred jobs would be needed for the construction phase, a news release said.The closest Ikea stores to the proposed site are in the Cincinnati and Chicago areas.On its Facebook page, The Indianapolis Star recently polled its readers to find the top five franchises they would most like to see in their city. Of the 1,199 replies, Ikea was the only retailer and got the most votes: 688. The others were all restaurant chains like In-N-Out and Shake Shack.While not all of Ikea’s products require assembly, customers of the retailer have a love-hate relationship with the do-it-yourself element of the big box furniture store. Users poke fun at it on social media, and as Tuesday’s news emerged, the region’s potential customers were bracing for the impact of buying new bookshelves and entertainment centers.
