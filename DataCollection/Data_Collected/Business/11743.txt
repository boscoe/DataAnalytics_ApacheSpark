LOS ANGELES — “This year, we all know there’s an elephant in the room,” said Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as she officially opened the annual Oscar nominees luncheon on Monday.“I have asked the elephant to leave,” Ms. Isaacs added.And with that, the academy’s diversity controversy — which began last month when its actors branch nominated only white performers for the second year in a row, and continued when Ms. Isaacs and her fellow governors announced steps to broaden the group’s membership and choices — was taken off the table for the afternoon.“There’s your story,” Charlie Kaufman, co-director of “Anomalisa,” said with a laugh. Minutes before, Mr. Kaufman, at Table 19, had been puzzling over the problem of reporting news from an event that, by design, generates so little.Ms. Isaacs’s message, firmly and briefly delivered, was simply that the Oscar rituals — including its awards ceremony, set for broadcast on Feb. 28 — will proceed as planned, no matter the debate about their validity or racial balance.AdvertisementWhat was on the table? Chilled beet salad with wild arugula, cedar-planked arctic char, and something called chocolate royaltine crunch. With berries. And Chantilly cream. And mango coulis. Plus assorted truffles.AdvertisementThese nominees, most of them, are show business troupers, and most have learned to make the most of their Chantilly cream-covered ride.

“I’m trying to enjoy it, because it is pretty wonderful,” said the best supporting actress nominee Alicia Vikander, swathed in bright red, as she answered questions in the luncheon’s preshow interview room.She had learned that lesson, Ms. Vikander said, from Eddie Redmayne, her co-star in “The Danish Girl,” and another of this year’s nominees, for best actor. Mr. Redmayne was on hand, looking dapper in a sharp gray suit.By Ms. Isaacs’s count, about 150 nominees showed up. Whether or not viewers tune into the show on ABC in 20 days, those honored clearly intend to be there.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Maybe it’s that intense face. Or maybe it was the tangle of embroidered vines and flowers creeping up the left side of her white dress.Dawn Hudson, the academy’s chief executive, stopped by to tell Mr. Kaufman she was a fan. Ms. Hudson was seated at the next table over with Reginald Hudlin and Dave Hill, producers of this year’s Oscar show, and a couple of ABC executives.If they were looking for signs that the Oscars are intact, the nominees luncheon provided plenty.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
