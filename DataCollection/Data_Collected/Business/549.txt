Morgan Stanley faced tough questions from analysts after announcing unexpectedly bad financial results on Monday.The firm, the last of the big American banks to release its quarterly results, said both revenue and profit declined more than expected. The biggest hits came from the bank’s bond and fixed-income trading desks and from its hedge fund and private equity business in Asia.“The quarter was very challenging,” the bank’s chief financial officer, Jonathan Pruzan, said at the beginning of a call with analysts Monday morning.The rocky quarter is problematic for Morgan Stanley because it has tried, since the financial crisis, to become a more stable company that is less reliant on the risky activities that fueled it and other Wall Street firms in the past.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            “You said a goal for Morgan Stanley is to show better consistency,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Americas, said to Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James Gorman, who was also on the Monday morning conference call. “And this quarter did not share that consistency. So, how should investors think about this quarter in context of your goal?” he asked.AdvertisementMr. Gorman told Mr. Mayo that he hoped investors did not focus too much on the bad quarter. “I would hope that they would think of it in context of 23 quarters that this management team has presided over,” he said. “It was a very unusual macro environment, the volatility in China was almost historic.”AdvertisementAfter the call, though, investors sent Morgan Stanley’s stock down by around 6 percent in morning trading. The firm’s overall revenue dropped 13 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, and 20 percent from the previous quarter; the drop was even sharper after accounting for certain customary adjustments for debt valuations.That pushed down the profit in the quarter to $740 million, or 34 cents a share, after those adjustments — a stark 55 percent decline from a year earlier.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the bank to announce profit of 62 cents a share.The bank faced the toughest questions about its fixed-income trading desks, which experienced their worst quarter since the financial crisis, according to Mr. Gorman. Revenue from the division dropped 20 percent from a year earlier.Morgan Stanley has cut back its fixed-income operation significantly since the crisis, unlike some of its rivals, but the latest results are a reminder of how the division can still weigh on the overall company.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But analysts asked the bank’s executives if they were considering making further changes to the fixed-income unit, given the recent difficulties. The bank’s executives insisted that they did not want to overreact to the results from a single quarter.“It’s a continuing focus of us, but I’m not taking everything from one single quarter,” Mr. Gorman said. “On the other hand, we want to make sure that if this is a long-term trend, then clearly, we will take whatever steps we need to take.”Morgan Stanley was also hit by a big decline from the business that invests on behalf of clients in Asia. The market volatility there hurt the bank’s investments and forced it to lower the expected fees it had attributed to the business.A version of this article appears in print on October 20, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Profit at Morgan Stanley Falls Below Expectations.
