The American solar energy company SunEdison, whose aggressive acquisition strategy has saddled it with almost $12 billion of debt, is at “substantial risk” of bankruptcy, one of its two publicly listed units warned on Tuesday. A bankruptcy would rank among the largest involving a nonfinancial company in the last 10 years, according to bankruptcydata.com. SunEdison declined to comment. SunEdison’s shares fell as much as 60 percent to a record low of 50 cents on Tuesday. The SunEdison unit, TerraForm Global, said in a regulatory filing that it would join its parent and fellow subsidiary TerraForm Power in delaying its annual report for the year ended Dec. 31. However, the company said that it did not rely substantially on SunEdison for funding or liquidity and that it would have sufficient liquidity to support its operations even if its parent sought bankruptcy protection. SunEdison has problems of its own. The company, which has delayed filing its annual report twice, said this month that it had identified material weaknesses in its financial reporting controls. It had debt of $11.67 billion as of Sept. 30.A version of this article appears in print on March 30, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: SunEdison at ‘Substantial Risk’ of Bankruptcy, a Unit Warns.
