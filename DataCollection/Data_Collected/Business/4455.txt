WASHINGTON —  Construction of homes plummeted in February, as fierce winter weather slowed housing starts in the Northeast and Midwest.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that builders began construction at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 897,000 homes in February, a steep 17 percent plunge from January. Housing starts slid 56.5 percent in the Northeast and 37 percent in the Midwest; they fell 18.2 percent in the West, and 2.5 percent in the South.The brutal cold spell across the Northeast and Midwest most likely caused construction activity to slow last month. Fewer would-be buyers are touring open houses, and consumers seem intent on using their savings at the gasoline pump to pay down debt instead of on expensive items like housing.The impact of the cold weather on construction is likely to subdue overall economic growth in the first three months of 2015.Advertisement“A weak first quarter is now a virtual guarantee as yet another cold winter is dampening activity,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at the brokerage BTIG.
