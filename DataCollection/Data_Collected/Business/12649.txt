But on Friday, Origin — which is linked to Centrillion Technology Holdings, a newer genetics analysis provider — proposed paying $16.10 a share in cash.Financing for the Origin bid, according to the shell company’s executives, would come from debt provided by SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm. The intention of the interlopers is to eventually merge Affymetrix and Centrillion.By declaring that the Origin bid was not likely to lead to a superior proposal, Affymetrix’s board has laid out its argument for sticking with the Thermo Fisher deal. But Affymetrix’s shareholders are scheduled to vote on that transaction this week, and shares in the target company jumped on Friday to $15.99 — suggesting that its shareholders believe that a bidding war may be brewing.Affymetrix’s chief executive, Frank Witney, said in the statement that his company held preliminary conversations with the Origin executives last fall and invited them to submit a written proposal.“We heard nothing further from them for over four months until they announced their unsolicited proposal on March 18,” Mr. Witney said. “The board of directors of Affymetrix is firmly committed to carrying out its fiduciary duties and maximizing value for our stockholders, while at the same time complying with the customary provisions of our merger agreement with Thermo Fisher.”Thermo Fisher put out its own response, raising questions about Origin’s financing and playing up concerns about whether the federal government would approve the new offer. In particular, Thermo Fisher noted the possibility that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government panel that weighs in on foreign takeovers with potential national security implications, could take action.Thermo Fisher pointed to the work that Affymetrix did for the United States government as one reason the government panel, commonly known as Cfius, would conduct a lengthy review of the Origin proposal and delay any closing of that transaction.“The proposal put forth to Affymetrix by Origin Technologies, a newly created shell entity relying on a vague and insufficient financing package from a Chinese firm, is highly uncertain and speculative,” Marc N. Casper, Thermo Fisher’s chief executive, said in a statement.Origin has argued that Centrillion is an American company and that any government inquiries would take place after Affymetrix shareholders are paid.A representative for Origin did not have an immediate comment.Advertisement
