Buffett, said quarterly profit doubled to a record, reflecting a large gain on its stake in Kraft Heinz, while operating profit declined. Third-quarter net income rose to $9.43 billion, or $5,737 per Class A share, from $4.62 billion, or $2,811, a year earlier. Operating profit fell 4 percent to $4.55 billion, or $2,769 a share, from $4.72 billion, or $2,876. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $2,720.60 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Over all, quite decent operating earnings,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the Ram Partners L.P. hedge fund and the author of “Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett’s Omaha.” “Nothing wrong with that given the weakness in the industrial side of the economy.” Results reflected a roughly $4.4 billion after-tax gain on Kraft Heinz. In July, Berkshire helped finance the merger that created Kraft Heinz, which makes Oscar Mayer sandwich meats, Jell-O and Heinz ketchup, and is its largest shareholder. Kraft Heinz helped Berkshire offset recent struggles with other large investments such as IBM and Walmart, and in some operating businesses including the auto insurer Geico. Advertisement
