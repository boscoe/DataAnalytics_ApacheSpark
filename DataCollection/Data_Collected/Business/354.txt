During a meeting a week ago about fiercely contested job cuts at the money-losing airline, union activists assaulted the managers, including the airline’s head of human resources, ripping their shirts from their bodies and prompting them to flee over a fence. The local prosecutor’s office confirmed that five people were arrested early on Monday, saying that charges of aggravated assault carry a maximum of five years in prison. A sixth was detained later in the day. Air France blames the violence on “isolated individuals” and negotiations have resumed. It is proposing a plan that involves 2,900 more job losses and longer hours. Advertisement
