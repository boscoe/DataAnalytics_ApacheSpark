Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.A Barclays employee told a New York Fed official that “we know that we’re not posting um, an honest rate.” The employee indicated that other big banks made similarly bogus reports, saying that the British institution wanted to “fit in with the rest of the crowd.”Although the New York Fed conferred with Britain and American regulators about the problems and recommended reforms, it failed to stop the illegal activity, which persisted through 2009.Big banks set major benchmarks like the London interbank offered rate, known as Libor. Regulators were reluctant to play a public role in reforming the banks’ efforts. “They will obviously have to remove the references to us and Fed,” a Bank of England official said in an e-mail, referring to a draft of a trade group’s proposal to change the rate-setting process.At the height of the financial crisis, regulators say, the big British bank reported bogus figures that in some cases had influenced a benchmark for student loans, credit cards and mortgages. Traders seeking favorable rates received a welcome reception from bank employees who set the benchmark. “Always happy to help,” one employee said in an e-mail.The Justice Department filed criminal charges against two former UBS traders and secured a guilty plea from the Swiss banking giant’s Japanese subsidiary. The UBS subsidiary, which agreed to plead to a single count of felony wire fraud, is the first unit of a big bank to agree to criminal charges in more than a decade.“I need you to keep it as low as possible,” one UBS trader said to an employee at another brokerage firm in 2008, according to the complaint. The trader promised to pay “whatever you want. I’m a man of my word.”The Justice Department forces the bank’s Japanese unit to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing.Authorities said that the British financial firm’s employees had altered the reported figures from which Libor is compiled, in exchange for promises of curry meals, steaks, a Ferrari and financial payments.One trader resorted to begging, invoking a plea of “pretty please.” Another trader, after pressuring a colleague to submit a certain rate, offered a reward of sorts: “I would come over there and make love to you.”The Dutch lender admitted to criminal wrongdoing by its employees and agreed to criminal and civil penalties to settle investigations by United States, British and other authorities. Its chief executive stepped down immediately and the bank entered into a so-called deferred prosecution agreement.When one trader requested a specific rate and then expressed concern that the submitter might encounter resistance, the submitter replied: “Don’t worry mate — there’s bigger crooks in the market than us guys!”The European Union levied the largest combined penalty ever by the European competition authorities. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Société Générale were found to have improperly influenced the Libor and Euribor.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain said that the fine could have been more, but that the small British brokerage firm’s Martin Brokers unit demonstrated it could not pay a penalty of that amount.The British lender — partly owned by the British government as a result of a bailout during the financial crisis — also entered into a so-called deferred prosecution agreement as part of its deal with the United States Justice Department.In one case, the European Commission fined JPMorgan Chase 61.7 million euros for manipulating the Swiss franc Libor benchmark interest rate in an “illegal bilateral cartel” with the Royal Bank of Scotland. R.B.S., however, was granted immunity and avoided a fine of €110 million after it revealed the existence of the cartel to the commission.As part of the settlement with United States and British authorities, one of the German bank’s British subsidiaries will plead guilty to fraud, and the company will install an independent monitor who will ensure that the bank complies with New York State laws. The authorities also ordered the bank to fire seven managers suspected of involvement in the wrongdoing.“I’m begging u, don’t forget me,” one Deutsche Bank trader wrote in an online chat to an employee at a rival bank, seeking to influence rates.“Pleassssssssssssssseeeeeeeeee … I’m on my knees …”Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland pled guilty to a series of federal crimes over a scheme to manipulate the value of the world’s currencies. The Justice Department accused the banks of collusion, noting that at one bank one trader remarked “the less competition the better.” A fifth bank, UBS, was also accused of foreign currency manipulation.Tom Hayes, the first person to go to trial in Britain on criminal charges related to Libor manipulation, was convicted on eight counts of conspiring to manipulate the global benchmark interest rate. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison, later reduced to 11.A jury in Manhattan found two former London traders guilty of rigging the Libor. The verdict against the two, Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, after less than a day and a half of deliberation, was a surprisingly quick victory for the Justice Department.In a major setback for British prosecutors, a jury acquitted six former brokers of charges that they helped a onetime trader at UBS and Citigroup manipulate the Libor.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced $425 million in penalties, covering two overlapping cases.And yet Citigroup faces no criminal charges. In an unexpected move, the Justice Department closed its investigation into Citigroup and some of the other banks suspected of manipulating an interest rate benchmark commonly known as the Isdafix.Advertisement
