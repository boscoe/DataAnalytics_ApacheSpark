Staley.The changes, a person with knowledge of the plans said on Thursday, would include cutting as many as 1,200 jobs across the global investment banking operations of Barclays, which has a major presence in New York as well in its home, London.About two-thirds of the cuts would be in Asia, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.The moves continue a strategy announced less than two years ago by Antony P. Jenkins, the chief executive at the time, who was ousted in July. Mr. Jenkins said in May 2014 that the bank would cut 19,000 jobs by the end of 2016, including about 7,000 in its investment banking division. Barclays had about 132,000 employees worldwide at the end of 2014.Barclays plans to focus on its home markets in Britain and the United States. The bank said it would build its global franchise around business lines where it has a “competitive advantage,” while closing some product lines.“With these actions, we are accelerating the investment bank strategy outlined in 2014, focusing on its core strengths and running the business for returns,” Mr. Staley said on Thursday in a news release.The bank is committed to having a “strong presence” in Asia and in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, he said.Shares of Barclays ended up nearly 1.8 percent in London trading.Mr. Staley, a former top JPMorgan Chase executive who joined the bank as its chief in December, is expected to update investors on the lender’s strategy when its full-year results are announced in March.Barclays said on Thursday it expected to report that the investment bank’s income, similar to what American banks count as revenue, was “broadly flat” in 2015.As part of its latest moves, Barclays plans to shut its cash equity sales and trading and convertible bond operations in Asia. Clients in Asia were notified on Thursday morning about the closing of the cash equities desk, which trades stocks for customers.The bank also said that it would close offices in countries including Brazil, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan.“We are sharpening our focus on the geographies and products where we have a clear competitive advantage” in Asia, Thomas King, the head of Barclays’ investment banking business, said in an internal memo sent to employees on Thursday.In Asia, Barclays said, it would only maintain offices in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan and Singapore.The bank would continue to provide debt financing, risk management and cross-board mergers and acquisitions services in Asia, as well as certain services to clients with cross-border requirements, particularly those with connections to the United States and Europe.The bank would also cut back on the number of products it offers through its business in the Americas and is considering getting out of the precious-metals business.In recent years, Barclays has sold or withdrawn from several underperforming businesses, and it says it is focusing on what it calls its core operations.John McFarlane, who became chairman of Barclays last year, has pledged to accelerate the bank’s overhaul and to curtail activity “which is marginal, or which will not deliver the return on equity we require.”The bank announced the sale of its retail banking operations in Italy, Portugal and Spain last year.On Monday, Barclays completed the sale of a controlling stake in its trust business to an independent investor group, but it said that it would keep a 19.9 percent stake in the business for a minimum of three years.Advertisement
