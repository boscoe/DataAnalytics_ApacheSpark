The systems often did not allow information to be shared easily among departments, nor provide top management with a coherent overview of bank operations.“Many banking systems resemble baroque castles that have been changed for decades and nobody knows the exact plan,” said Jost Hoppermann, a vice president at Forrester Research who follows the banking industry from Frankfurt.Mr. Hoppermann said that Deutsche Bank was hiring Hewlett-Packard to remake its information technology infrastructure — in effect the castle’s plumbing.Poor information technology may have even contributed to the financial crisis. In its aftermath, banks often had trouble untangling the complex derivatives they had bought and sold, to determine the underlying values.Under pressure from regulators as well as customers, the vast majority of banks are overhauling their computer and software systems or planning to, despite the immense cost, Mr. Hoppermann said. “It’s certainly an overarching trend,” he said.Henry Ritchotte, the chief operating officer of Deutsche Bank, said on Tuesday in a statement, “Having a more modern and agile technology platform will further improve the bank’s ability to launch new products and services and lay the foundation for the next phase of its digital strategy,”Deutsche Bank declined to comment on which companies competed for the contract. The bank already uses I.B.M. to manage the technology used by retail customers to do online banking.Advertisement
