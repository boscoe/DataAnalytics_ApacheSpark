Investors sent stocks slightly lower Monday ahead of a busy week for company earnings.With little news to move the market either way, major indexes spent the day wavering between slim gains and losses.Stocks started higher in the morning, turned lower shortly after midday, then drifted downward until the closing bell.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 17,977.04. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slipped 9.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,092.43. The Nasdaq lost 7.73 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,988.25.JetBlue Airways surged after the airline reported a 9 percent increase in passengers last month compared with the same period a year ago. The company’s stock gained 80 cents, or 4 percent, to $19.85.AdvertisementJPMorgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson, and Wells Fargo are among the big names turning in quarterly results Tuesday as earnings season gets underway.AdvertisementInvestors are braced for bad news over all, a result of the stronger dollar and low oil prices squeezing revenues. Analysts forecast that first-quarter earnings shrank 3 percent compared with the same quarter of last year, according to S&P Capital IQ. If that winds up happening, it would be the first drop in quarterly profits since 2009.As the price of crude oil fluctuates, why some countries are faring much better than others.Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said those numbers shouldn’t raise too many worries.“Usually when earnings go down it means the economy is going in the tank, because most earnings come from domestic sales,” he said. “This time is different. The big hit to earnings is from energy companies just getting hammered by oil prices. And a big chunk of the rest is from the stronger dollar.”Profits at the nation’s six largest banks are expected to be around $22 billion for the first quarter of 2015, a jump from $17.71 billion in the same period a year ago, according to FactSet. Part of the reason for the sharp increase is because Bank of America took a $6 billion charge last year for legal expenses.Market volatility may make average investors nervous, but it can be good for investment banks. As trading volume rises, banks earn more in commissions. It also allows traders to take advantage of swings in markets to make a profit.“The investment banks need volatility and volume to really profit. They got both,” said Nancy Bush, an independent banking industry financial analyst with NAB Research.Two of the places where volatility has been most noticeable last quarter have been in the currency and commodities markets.The dollar has gained more than 10 percent against the euro just this year, a significant move. Other currencies have also been volatile. The European Central Bank started its own bond-buying program this year, which has pushed the euro lower against other major currencies. The Swiss franc had its biggest one-day move in history in January after the Swiss National Bank announced it would allow the franc to appreciate against the euro. Niche indexes that track volatility in currency markets, like the Deutsche Bank Currency Volatility index, are up 40 percent year-over-year.AdvertisementCommodities markets have been just as volatile. The price of oil has plunged by 50 percent over the past year and has had many days of huge swings.Not all banks are expected to benefit equally. Banks with sizable trading desks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Citigroup, have more exposure to these markets. The “custodial” banks, which hold large amounts of assets in trust for other investors, like State Street and Bank of New York Mellon, are also likely beneficiaries, analysts say.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
