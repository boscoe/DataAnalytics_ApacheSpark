LONDON — The Potash Corporation said on Friday that it was still interested in acquiring K&S, the German potash and salt mining company that owns Morton Salt, despite a rejection of its unsolicited takeover bid.Potash, a Canadian company, said on June 25 that it had made a “private proposal” to negotiate a potential takeover of K&S.On Thursday, K&S said its board of directors had rejected the offer because the bid did “not reflect the fundamental value” of the company and was not in its best interest. The takeover approach valued K&S at 7.8 billion euros, or about $8.6 billion.Potash said on Friday that it believed K&S’s concerns could be addressed through “collaborative discussion” and that its offer was not “predicated on closing mines, curtailing production, selling the salt business or cutting jobs.”AdvertisementJochen Tilk, the Potash chief executive, said in a news release, “We believe that the combination of our two companies would create a well-capitalized, more diversified company across products, geographies, production, distribution and customers.”Advertisement“We are seeking to meet with K&S management at the earliest possible opportunity,” he said, “so that we can jointly discuss our commitments and further specify the details that would form the basis of a successful combination.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
