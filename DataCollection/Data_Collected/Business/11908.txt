The measures are meant to help shore up the nation’s finances as dropping oil prices and a collapsing state-led economic model have left the country with a severe recession, high inflation and product shortages. The price of premium gasoline will rise to 6 bolívars from 0.097 bolívars a liter, but fuel is so heavily subsidized that filling up a small car will still cost about 23 cents, based on the black market exchange rate.Advertisement
