SAN FRANCISCO — When GoDaddy kicks off life as a publicly traded company for the first time in its 18-year history, the Internet services provider will do so on the New York Stock Exchange.The company disclosed in an amended prospectus on Tuesday that it had picked the Big Board for its forthcoming initial public offering, reserving the ticker symbol “GDDY.”Picking a stock exchange is the latest step taken by GoDaddy as it marches toward a public listing, nearly four years after it was taken over by the investment firms Silver Lake and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.Since that leveraged buyout, the company has labored to demonstrate to potential investors that it is more than just an Internet domain registrar with a history of risqué advertising featuring scantily clad women.AdvertisementInstead, the company argues that more and more of its revenue comes from newer offerings, like Web hosting products, and business services, like managing a company’s social networking presence. The simple business of reserving a dotcom domain, meanwhile, has become commoditized, with slower growth.In its amended prospectus, GoDaddy disclosed that its campaign to redefine itself is showing results. Revenue rose 27 percent last year, to nearly $1.4 billion — or a little less than double what the company earned in its last year before its leveraged buyout — while its net loss narrowed, to $143 million.AdvertisementLeft undisclosed in the document were several important details, including how much money GoDaddy expects to raise in its I.P.O. and a price range for its shares, as well as how much stock Silver Lake and K.K.R. expect to sell.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
