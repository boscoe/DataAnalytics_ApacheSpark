To the Editor:Re “It’s (Still) Their Party” (May 17), about Equilar’s ranking of the 200 highest-paid chief executives:The original creators of a business are entitled to outsize earnings. Managers who are in at the early stages at setting up management systems should get generous rewards. However, once a company is set up and running and in many cases growing at a snail’s pace, annual payments in the range of $150 million and up are obscene.The directors should conduct a search. They will discover a lot of talented managers who will jump at the chance of earning $10 million per annum and perhaps even less. The difference can then be divided in some fair proportion between the stockholders and the employees who do the real work.Leonard CohenTarrytown, N.Y., May 18To the Editor:The statistics in “C.E.O. Pay: The Rankings” that accompanied “It’s (Still) Their Party” were disturbing. No one could possibly deserve compensation of $156 million a year.Of interest would be how much state, city and federal taxes were paid in 2014 by the 200 executives listed. If their compensation is a matter of public record, their taxes should also be.Deyan Ranko BrashichNew York, May 17Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.A version of this letter appears in print on May 24, 2015, on Page BU6 of the New York edition with the headline: C.E.O.
