The business of managing companies’ information technology systems has become more complex as corporations have adopted so-called cloud systems that rely on outside servers.But ScienceLogic, a 12-year-old company, has found success helping companies manage those systems — and drawn in new investors. ScienceLogic said on Thursday that it had raised $43 million in a new financing round led by Goldman Sachs. Existing investors NEA and Intel Capital also took part. The new round exceeded the $41 million that the company raised in three previous rounds.As use of the cloud within companies has exploded — ScienceLogic estimates that nearly 80 percent of big companies use systems like Amazon Web Services — the company has positioned itself as a way to manage those disparate services. The company’s products automatically detect which cloud services are being used and then determines how to monitor them, along with more traditional technological systems.Kellogg, the food manufacturer, said in a statement that using ScienceLogic allowed it to reduce its information technology costs by more than $2 million over five years.“We are very excited to partner with ScienceLogic, which is disrupting the multibillion-dollar I.T. management market with products uniquely suited to meeting hybrid I.T. monitoring demand,” David Campbell, a managing director of Goldman’s merchant banking division, said in a statement.
