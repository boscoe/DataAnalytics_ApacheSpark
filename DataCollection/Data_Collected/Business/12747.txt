Membership in the United Automobile Workers rose by nearly 5,200 workers in 2015, to 408,639, the sixth straight year of small gains. The Detroit-based union said in a filing with the Labor Department that membership rose 1.3 percent last year. That remains down from the more than 700,000 members it had in 2002, and from its peak of nearly 1.5 million in 1979. Since hitting a low of 355,191 in 2009, membership has risen 15 percent. A U.A.W. spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said in January that there were 14.8 million workers in unions in 2015 in the United States, up from 14.6 million in 2014.A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Autoworkers Union Grew for 6th Consecutive Year.
