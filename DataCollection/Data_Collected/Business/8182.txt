The takeover approach valued K&S at 7.8 billion euros, or about $8.5 billion.Potash, a Canadian company, said on June 25 that it had made a private proposal to negotiate a potential takeover of K&S, which the German company’s board rejected in July.K&S said at the time that the bid did “not reflect the fundamental value” of the company and was not in its best interest.Last month, Potash said it was still interested in K&S and tried to reassure K&S and its investors. The Canadian company said at the time that any concerns could be addressed through “collaborative discussion” and that its offer was not “predicated on closing mines, curtailing production, selling the salt business or cutting jobs.”On Friday, K&S said that it continued to have concerns following the latest proposal that “the transaction proposed by PotashCorp puts jobs at risk and that sites and raw material production in Germany might not be maintained.”Potash had offered to pay €41 a share for K&S.Shares of K&S rose 2.2 percent to €37.36 in afternoon trading in Frankfurt on Friday.Potash, based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, is one of the world’s largest producers of nutrients used in fertilizer, including potash, a form of potassium. The company posted sales of $7.1 billion and had more than 5,100 employees in 2014.A deal for K&S would further strengthen the company’s position in the potash market, where it says it is responsible for about 20 percent of worldwide capacity.K&S, based in Kassel, Germany, mines potash, salt and other raw materials used in the agriculture, food and road safety industries. It is the largest producer of potash in Western Europe. K&S acquired Morton Salt from Dow Chemical in 2009 in a deal valuing Morton, a former unit of Rohm & Haas, at $1.67 billion.K&S posted revenue of €3.8 billion in 2014 and had more than 14,000 employees at the end of the year.Advertisement
