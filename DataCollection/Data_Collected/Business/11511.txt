That amounts to about 9 billion Australian dollars.The consortium made a nonbinding proposal in November, after Asciano agreed in August to be acquired by Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, a Toronto-based investment firm, for $6.6 billion. Asciano said then that its board unanimously recommended Brookfield’s bid, although it was not clear whether regulators would approve that deal.The board said on Thursday that it was considering the latest bid from Qube, but it added that it continued to unanimously favor Brookfield’s offer.Under the terms of the latest bid, Qube would buy all of Asciano’s Patrick container terminals business and half of the ports operations business. Patrick operates container terminals in the four largest container ports in Australia, and shareholders would have to vote on whether to divide the business after completion of the deal. The consortium would own the rest of Asciano.“We know Asciano’s Ports businesses better than any other potential owner,” Maurice James, Qube’s managing director, said in a news release. “The ports are a core element for Qube to provide customers seamless coverage through Australia’s international trade supply chain.”Qube said it expected the deal to provide between 30 million dollars and 50 million dollars in savings over the next two to three years.Asked about the involvement of CIC Capital, a subsidiary of China’s sovereign wealth fund, Mr. James said in a conference call: “All three are long-term infrastructure investors and we’re very encouraged by their involvement and commitment to that project. It should be noted that they won’t have any involvement in the port business. They will remain on the rail side.”In December, Australia defended its decision to lease part of a port to a Chinese company.In 2015, there were 1,328 deals in Australia worth about $118 billion, according to data from Dealogic. About $27 billion of that went into deals involving transport and logistics.Shares in Asciano closed 4 percent higher after the news, while Qube stocks initially dropped but ended the day up 3.81 percent.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.Advertisement
