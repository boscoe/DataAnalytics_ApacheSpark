The erroneous orders led others to submit orders to Goldman for stock option trades representing 150 million of underlying shares.The S.E.C. said Goldman could have lost up to $500 million if the orders and trades were not later canceled by the exchanges, which treated most of them as erroneous orders.Soon after the incident, Goldman put several employee associated with the trading on leave. A person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly said those employees have either left the firm or remain on leave.The S.E.C. order notes that a circuit breaker system Goldman had in place to stop the bank from sending out erroneous trades initially limited the potential damage. But employees of Goldman made things worse by “repeatedly” lifting the circuit breakers and allowing more erroneous orders to flood the market. The S.E.C. said Goldman had done a poor job educating its employees about when and how to remove the circuit breakers.“Goldman’s control environment was deficient in several way,” said Andrew Ceresney, the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement, in a prepared statement.In settling with the S.E.C., Goldman neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing. The bank issued a statement, noting that since the incident, “we have reviewed and further strengthened our controls and procedures.”Advertisement
