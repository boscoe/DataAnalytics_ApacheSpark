Oil prices may be depressed, but they have not stopped the longtime commodities trader Phibro from being resurrected.Simon Greenshields, the former co-head of Morgan Stanley’s commodities business, acquired the Phibro name and assets related to its now defunct trading business, said his firm, Energy Arbitrage Partners, in a statement on Tuesday. Mr. Greenshields plans to start a new Phibro business that focuses on acquiring and developing commodity assets, as well as trading. He will become the chief executive and president.Phibro, which began in 1901 as Philipp Brothers, had its share of ups and downs before it shuttered trading operations in the United States a year ago. The firm was a commodities trading powerhouse in the 1980s, acquiring Salomon Brothers, which later merged with what is now Citigroup.Phibro came under fire when its head trader, Andrew J. Hall, was said to have sought a $100 million bonus in 2009, after Citigroup was bailed out by the federal government. Shortly thereafter, Occidental Petroleum acquired Phibro.AdvertisementMr. Greenshields said Phibro’s commodity investment strategies would be different from other firms’ because Phibro would not make directional bets about commodities prices.“It is based on a proven track record of relative value arbitrage combined with disciplined risk management and strong client relationships,” Mr. Greenshields said in the statement.AdvertisementEnergy Arbitrage Partners is also bringing in Nick Elliot and Thomas Funk, his former colleagues in Morgan Stanley’s commodities business.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
