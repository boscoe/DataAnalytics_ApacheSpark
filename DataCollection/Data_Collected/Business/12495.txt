To the Editor:Your article on negative interest rates (“An Inverted World Where Saving Will Cost You,” Strategies, March 6) was very interesting and important.My view is that in the financial crisis, it was clearly appropriate to lower interest rates. It was also appropriate to keep them low to try to stimulate economic activity. However I think there is an argument that savers are being hurt by low interest rates, and helping savers would prove to be more stimulating than any restrictive effects on housing and economic activity it would have.John LevinNew York, March 7The writer is chairman and chief executive at Levin Capital Strategies.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2016, on Page BU8 of the National edition.
