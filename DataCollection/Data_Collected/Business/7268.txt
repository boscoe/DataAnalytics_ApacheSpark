Boire.Mr. Boire, who is the chief executive and president of Sears Canada, will start on Sept. 8. He will succeed Michael P. Huseby, who will become the executive chairman of Barnes & Noble Education.The reshuffling comes as the company prepares to spin off its college education business from its mainstay retail operations by the end of August. Barnes & Noble will retain its bookstores and its Nook unit, while its college stores and education and textbook business will become a separate, publicly traded concern.Mr. Huseby, who was appointed chief executive in January 2014, has had a short tenure during an uncertain time for the company, which has struggled to compete against Amazon in the digital book and device marketplace while wrestling with an unstable market for print books.Last month, the company’s earnings report for its fiscal  fourth quarter showed that sales were down 10 percent compared with a year ago.In a statement, Barnes & Noble’s chairman, Leonard Riggio, cited Mr. Boire’s executive experience at retail companies like Brookstone, Toys “R” Us and Sears as part of the reason he was brought in.Mr. Riggio also praised Mr. Huseby for steering the company. “Under his leadership, we have improved the performance of all of our business segments,” Mr. Riggio said.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement
