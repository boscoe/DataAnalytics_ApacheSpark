The pharmaceutical company had set the requirement for victory at 50 percent, down from an initial 80 percent.“As we have said all along, Mylan viewed Perrigo as a unique and exciting opportunity, but not one that was required for the future success of our company,” Robert J. Coury, Mylan’s chairman, said in a statement.The move ends one of the more protracted hostile acquisition efforts of the last year. Mylan first made its takeover bid in April, saying that a merger would create a drug maker with strengths in both generic treatments, its specialty, and branded products, which is Perrigo’s focus.Yet analysts on Wall Street speculated that the move took place because Mylan was under pressure from an even bigger pharmaceutical rival, Teva. However, Teva walked away and instead chose to buy a division of the Botox maker Allergan.That left Mylan free to pursue its acquisition target, backed by several of its own shareholders like the hedge fund Paulson & Company and the drug maker Abbott Laboratories.Yet Perrigo steadfastly argued that it was better off independent. On its own, the company could pursue acquisitions that it contended would create more value than a sale to Mylan could generate.In a statement after the vote, Joseph C. Papa, the chief executive of Perrigo, said, “We have said all along that this offer from Mylan was a bad deal for our shareholders, as it significantly undervalued our durable business model and industry-leading future growth prospects.”“I am delighted that Perrigo shareholders voiced their clear support for this management team and our long-term strategy,” he said.Several analysts on Wall Street had argued that the bid, most recently composed of $75 in cash and 2.3 new Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, was overvalued. As of Thursday’s market close, the offer was worth $174.36 a share, 11 percent more than the trading price of Perrigo’s stock.In trading on Friday, shares of Perrigo fell 6 percent, to $146.90, while those of Mylan were up 13 percent, at $48.78.Advertisement
