The software giant’s June bid already looked pricey, but the fate of an erstwhile LinkedIn competitor offers a cautionary tale of how bad things could get.Monster Worldwide, the job-listing board, was once worth some $8 billion — until LinkedIn crushed it. On Tuesday it was sold to a Dutch rival for $429 million, and that includes debt. A similar chimera could be lurking in Redmond, Wash.Founded in 1994, the same year as Yahoo, Monster.com quickly changed the way people searched for jobs. In the process, the ease of hunting on a computer rather than combing through the help-wanted sections of dailies, highlighter in hand, drained the newspaper industry of a vital source of revenue. In 2000, newspapers accounted for about $9 billion in recruitment advertising spending. By 2011 that had dwindled to less than $1 billion.During two boom cycles, in 2000 and again in 2006, Monster hit its zenith in market value. It was known for its attention-grabbing Super Bowl ads showcasing children discussing their job aspirations: “I want to claw my way up to middle management.” It bought a rival, HotJobs, from Yahoo for $225 million in 2010.LinkedIn eventually deflated the fortunes of Monster. The buyer, Randstad Holding, a Dutch human resources consulting company, pegs Monster’s current value at $300 million.Microsoft offered a 50 percent premium for LinkedIn, but little explanation of how the company’s business would fit with its wide array of enterprise software. Silicon Valley pundits have been chatting up the deal as a smart move for Microsoft, saying LinkedIn has a trove of data. That may be, but LinkedIn has given some warnings of issues such as slowing growth.Microsoft also had a history of botching acquisitions under its previous chief executive, Steve Ballmer, as shown by its write-downs for Nokia’s mobile phone business and the digital advertising agency aQuantive. The Monster tale may be a sign that Mr. Ballmer’s successor, Satya Nadella, is following in his footsteps.Jennifer Saba is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.
