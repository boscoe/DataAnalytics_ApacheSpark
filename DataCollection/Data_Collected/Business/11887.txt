Buffett, said it would stream its annual meeting online this year for the first time, enabling what is already the largest American shareholder gathering to reach a global audience. The meeting on April 30 will be streamed on Yahoo Finance, a minor victory in what has been an otherwise downbeat year for the Internet company. The webcast may help Yahoo attract advertisers enticed by the large number of potential online viewers. Last year’s meeting drew roughly 40,000 people to Omaha, many from abroad, to celebrate Buffett’s 50th anniversary leading the company. At the core of the gathering is a lively question-and-answer session with Mr. Buffett and Berkshire’s vice chairman, Charlie Munger, that typically lasts several hours. The webcast will begin in the morning with coverage of attendant events, like a trade fair featuring Berkshire subsidiaries.Advertisement
