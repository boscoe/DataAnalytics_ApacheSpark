Seeso will also have scripted series, such as a half-hour comedy about real estate agents called “Bajillion Dollar Propertie$” and “HarmonQuest,” about fantasy role-playing and starring Dan Harmon, the creator of “Community.”The service will also offer NBC classics, including “30 Rock” and “The Office,” and a themed selection of two to five films each month.Here are some prominent services offering live TV, à la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.Seeso will have to battle for attention, because the number of options for streaming television has increased exponentially. At the same time that the streaming services Netflix, Amazon and Hulu pour resources into building out their offerings, traditional media companies like HBO, Showtime and CBS have introduced digital offerings.Rather than protecting its traditional business, NBCUniversal is viewing Seeso as a bid to stay relevant to a generation for whom “streaming is the new normal,” said Evan Shapiro, executive vice president of NBCUniversal Digital Enterprises.“This is not a trend,” he added.The companies are all trying to appeal to a wave of viewers, especially younger ones, who are dropping cable and satellite packages in favor of streaming services that often are cheaper and offer more flexibility than the traditional cable bundle. It is unclear how large the demand is for these new offerings and whether people have the appetite to sign up for multiple services.Seeso represents a careful balancing act for NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator. Comcast is battling to keep subscribers.Mr. Shapiro declined to say how much NBCUniversal was spending on content for the service, other than that it was in the range of millions of dollars. He added that Seeso was sharing the rights for content with other streaming services and that NBCUniversal would not remove content from other digital outlets where it is also available, such as YouTube, Netflix and Hulu.Advertisement
