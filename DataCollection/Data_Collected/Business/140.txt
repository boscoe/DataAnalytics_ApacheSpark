AdvertisementSupported byBy Ravi SomaiyaTribune Publishing announced a long-anticipated staff reduction plan to employees on Monday, amid a falling stock price and questions from analysts about the ability of the company’s management to turn around its media properties, which include The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune.“Today we are announcing a voluntary separation program for our employees,” the company’s chief executive, Jack Griffin, said in an email to staff members Monday morning. “We are doing so now to allow employees to make decisions about their own personal and professional situations at a time when the company must continue to execute on its strategic plan, which includes reducing costs.”Mr. Griffin did not say how many buyouts the company was seeking.In a separate email to the staff, Cindy Ballard, a human resources executive, wrote that, following the buyouts, “the company and the individual business units will evaluate the results of the program and assess next steps as there may or may not be a need for additional involuntary reductions.” The deadline for the voluntary plan, Ms. Ballard wrote, is Oct. 23.People familiar with the finances of The Los Angeles Times said last month that the reductions at that newspaper would be on the order of $10 million in savings, or about 80 jobs, coming mostly from a newsroom of about 500. It was not clear Monday whether those numbers had changed.Since Mr. Griffin fired Austin Beutner as the publisher of The Los Angeles Times last month, the company’s strategy has been scrutinized, and its stock price has dropped precipitously.“We have slowly begun to doubt the capabilities of management to circumvent the declining investor sentiment and their ability to profitably manage a newspaper company for the long haul,” Hamed Khorsand, an analyst with BWS Financial, said in a report late last month.Advertisement
