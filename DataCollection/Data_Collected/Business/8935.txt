Woodside is searching for high quality oil and gas assets after abandoning plans last year to buy part of a large natural gas discovery offshore from Israel after a year of talks.That Woodside is currently paying out 80 percent of its underlying profit in dividends to shareholders “is a signal that material growth could be some way off,” said Nik Burns, an analyst with UBS in Melbourne.Oil Search has a 29 percent stake in a liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, operated by ExxonMobil, as well as stakes in other proposed LNG projects in the country that was once a colony of Australia until independence in 1975.Woodside offered one of its shares for every four Oil Search shares, the equivalent of 7.65 Australian dollars a share, according to UBS. Some bankers said that if Woodside made another bid for Oil Search it would offer a cash alternative of as much as 9 Australian dollars a share.“It’s not surprising the Woodside bid has been rejected in the first instance as it’s now a typical value dance,” said Alex Cartel, a managing director and head of Australian energy investment banking at Deutsche Bank. “In the current oil and gas environment, attempting to use stock is logical given that the oil price assumptions that would need to underpin a cash bid are inherently risky at present.”For its part, Oil Search is not for sale, said a person who is advising the company but wished to remain anonymous as they were not authorized to speak on the record.Woodside is being advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, the Australian boutique advisory firm Gresham and the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills. Oil Search is being advised by Morgan Stanley and the boutique advisory firm Luminis Partners, an Evercore affiliate, as well as the law firm Allens.Advertisement
