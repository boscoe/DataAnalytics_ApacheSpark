The editors Greg Veis and Rachel Morris, and a writer, Jonathan Cohn, will oversee a push by The Huffington Post into longer articles and investigations. In a memo sent on Sunday, the site’s founder, Arianna Huffington, said the three would help “bring long-form journalism to a new audience.” Mr. Veis, Ms. Morris and Mr. Cohn left The New Republic in early December after the resignations of its editor, Franklin Foer, and its longtime literary editor, Leon Wieseltier. They resigned after news emerged that its owner, Chris Hughes, a founder of Facebook who bought the magazine in 2012, was in talks to replace Mr. Foer. Shortly afterward, several of the magazine’s alumni, including Sidney Blumenthal and Hendrik Hertzberg, issued a statement lamenting the “destruction” of the magazine.The next issue of The New Republic was canceled, but the magazine will return to newsstands on Feb. 2 under its new editor, Gabriel Snyder, a former editor of The Atlantic Wire and Gawker. Mr. Wieseltier said last week that he was joining The Atlantic as a contributing editor and critic. Mr. Foer has not announced his next move. The Huffington Post, which turns 10 this year, will continue to hire for its new initiative, which has been described by some involved as a new version of The New Republic. The site has said it has general plans to expand its own reporting capacity, as a contract it has with The Associated Press wire service to provide it with articles ends this year.It has previously had some success with long investigative articles. In 2012, the Huffington Post’s David Wood won a Pulitzer Prize in national reporting for a 10-part series on the lives of severely wounded veterans and their families. Advertisement
