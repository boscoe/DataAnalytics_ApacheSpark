LONDON — Shareholders of Portugal Telecom agreed on Monday to postpone a vote on whether to sell assets valued at $8.7 billion to Altice, the European cable and mobile service provider.The decision to postpone the vote until Jan. 22 comes amid questions about whether the deal, which would allow Altice to buy the Portuguese assets of the former national telecom monopoly, would scuttle the proposed merger between Portugal Telecom and the Brazilian carrier Oi.The deal between Portugal Telecom and Oi was first proposed in 2013, though the Portuguese carrier later disclosed that it held short-term debt that was defaulted by Rioforte Investments, a unit of the struggling Banco Espírito Santo of Portugal.The revelations forced Portugal Telecom to reduce its stake in the proposed merger with Oi to 25 percent from 38 percent, and led to the Portuguese company’s share price to fall almost 80 percent in the last 12 months.The decision to postpone the vote also comes after Portuguese authorities suspended Portugal Telecom’s shares on Friday and called on the company to provide greater clarification on how the potential asset sale to Altice would affect Portugal Telecom’s investors.Altice, which is controlled by the billionaire Patrick Drahi, operates a number of telecom businesses across European and the Caribbean, including the Portuguese cable operators Cabovisão and Oni.
