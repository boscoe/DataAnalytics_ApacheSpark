The S.E.C. had accused it of misrepresenting how often it reviewed its outstanding ratings of some residential mortgage-backed securities and other complex bonds from 2009 to 2011. In a statement on Monday, a spokesman said the firm had remedied all the issues the regulator raised.The S.E.C. said the firm did not do the monthly monitoring of each of its outstanding ratings for United States residential mortgage-backed securities and other securities that it said it would. The regulator found DBRS to have inadequate staffing and technology resources at the time to conduct that level of surveillance.“Lack of resources is no excuse for failing to conduct surveillance promised in various S.E.C. filings and other public documents,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, the director of the agency’s division of enforcement.An investor group led by two prominent private equity firms, the Carlyle Group and Warburg Pincus, recently acquired DBRS, with plans to expand its presence and market share in the United States as well as globally.DBRS, the former Dominion Bond Rating Service, which says it has about 2.5 percent of the global market for ratings services, is dwarfed by the “big three,” Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch.It entered the United States market in 2004 and became a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization in 2007. DBRS is naming an independent consultant to audit certain ratings methodologies and models and to review some of its internal controls.“DBRS is pleased to have concluded this matter,” the company said in a statement.Advertisement
