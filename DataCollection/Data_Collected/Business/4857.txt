Goldman has not yet released the full details of Mr. Blankfein’s pay package for 2014. Mr. Dimon is set to receive $20 million for 2014.Mr. Gorman’s pay is broken down into a $1.5 million base salary, a $4.7 million cash bonus, $5.4 million in deferred cash, $4.4 million in deferred stock awards and $6.5 million in stock awards that he will receive if the company meets certain performance targets.The total pay package compares with the $18 million he received last year and is more than double the $9.8 million he received in 2012.Advertisement
