The cable news network said on Thursday that it was canceling its 1 p.m. broadcast hosted by Ronan Farrow, as well as its 2 p.m. broadcast hosted by Joy-Ann Reid. In their place will be a two-hour block of news with Thomas Roberts, host of MSNBC’s “Way Too Early” at 5:30 a.m. Ms. Reid will work as a national correspondent, and Mr. Farrow, the 27-year-old son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, will work on a series of prime time specials and interviews. The change is a strategy shift at MSNBC, which long has filled its schedule with left-leaning political commentary and now is moving toward straight news from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m. Advertisement
