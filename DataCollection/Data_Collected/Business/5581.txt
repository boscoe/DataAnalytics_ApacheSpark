Diamond Jr., the former Barclays chief executive, said on Monday that it was in talks for another banking deal in Africa.Atlas Mara said it was in exclusive discussions to invest about $22.5 million in Banque Populaire du Rwanda, which would give it a 45 percent stake in the lender. If it is successful in acquiring the stake, Atlas Mara said, it intended to merge Banque Populaire du Rwanda with BRD Commercial Bank, a Rwandan lender it gained control of in 2014.The combined entity would be Rwanda’s second-largest bank by assets, after the National Bank of Rwanda, with about $305 million, Atlas Mara said.“Combining B.P.R. and BRD Commercial is a significant step for the development of Atlas Mara and consistent with our strategy of being a leading player in the markets in which we operate,” John F. Vitalo, the Atlas Mara chief executive, said in a news release.The transaction, if completed, is expected to close in the third quarter.Banque Populaire du Rwanda had about $155 million in loans and $181 million in deposits as of Dec. 31. It has 191 branches and about 1,370 employees.Atlas Mara was formed in 2013 by Mr. Diamond and Ashish J. Thakkar, an entrepreneur whose Mara Group conglomerate has technology, manufacturing and real estate interests in 19 African countries.Advertisement
