AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSteven A. Cohen, the billionaire hedge-fund manager, has agreed in a settlement to refrain from engaging in any activities overseen by federal commodities regulators until at least Dec. 31, 2017.The settlement, announced Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, follows an action brought against Mr. Cohen by the Securities and Exchange Commission over insider trading at his firm, SAC Capital Advisors.Federal prosecutors accused SAC Capital, one of the biggest and most successful hedge funds, of illegal insider trading, and said Mr. Cohen, its founder and owner, had enabled the misconduct. SAC Capital agreed in 2013 to plead guilty to criminal fraud charges and to pay $1.8 billion, at the time the largest financial penalty for insider trading, according to prosecutors.In an agreement with the S.E.C. in January, Mr. Cohen was barred for two years from managing other people’s money, but he was not fined and did not admit to wrongdoing. He never faced criminal charges; the investigation by the S.E.C. focused on his supervision of subordinates.The deal with the commodities regulator prevents Mr. Cohen from working as an officer or employee in any firm registered with the agency.Mr. Cohen, who lives on a sprawling estate in Greenwich, Conn., is an influential player in American finance and one of the country’s richest men. He founded SAC in 1992, naming it with his initials, and built a reputation as a shrewd investment manager, making about $1 billion a year in compensation.As part of its plea deal, SAC Capital stopped taking money from outside investors, becoming a so-called family office and investing mainly Mr. Cohen’s money. The firm was renamed Point72 Asset Management.Advertisement
