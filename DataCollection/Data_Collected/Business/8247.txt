The company, based in Brenham, Tex., used Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday to announce its trucks were “on the road again” and filled with ice cream. The messages did not say when and where Blue Bell products would be sold. Blue Bell in April voluntarily recalled all products after its treats were linked to 10 listeria illnesses in four states, including three deaths in Kansas. Advertisement
