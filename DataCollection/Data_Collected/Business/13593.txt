A survey by the payroll processor ADP showed American companies had hired workers at the slowest pace in three years last month. ADP said private companies hired 156,000 workers in April, down from 194,000 in March and significantly worse than expected.AdvertisementThe weak reading bodes poorly for the broader job market survey due Friday from the Labor Department, one of the most closely watched reports on the economic calendar. Economists expect the government to report that employers created 200,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent.AdvertisementEconomic indicators out of Europe were disappointing on Wednesday.

Investors had expected a more modest decline of 0.1 percent.The financial information company Markit said its purchasing managers’ index for the region, a gauge of business activity, slipped to 53 in April from 53.1 the previous month. Though still above the 50 threshold indicating expansion, the reading has fallen from the start of the year.
