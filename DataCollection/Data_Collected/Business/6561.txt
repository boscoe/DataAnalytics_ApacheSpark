The new figures from the agency also showed that labor costs rose more quickly in the first quarter. A reduction in unemployment claims indicate that job cuts remain low as employers are confident enough in the business outlook to retain workers. The Labor Department said applications for unemployment aid dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 276,000. The four-week average, a less volatile figure, rose 2,750 to 274,750. The number of Americans receiving unemployment aid fell to just below 2.2 million, the fewest since November 2000. An estimated 8.5 million are unemployed. Worker productivity fell 3.1 percent in the first quarter, a bigger drop than the 1.9 percent decline estimated a month ago, the Labor Department said. Labor costs rose at a 6.7 percent rate in the first quarter, faster than the 5 percent increase first estimated. Advertisement
