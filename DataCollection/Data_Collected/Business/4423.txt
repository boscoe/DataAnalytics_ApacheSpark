Bush for Homeland Security and counterterrorism.“We are extremely pleased with the caliber of these advisers and look forward to having the benefit of their vast and varied experience in global payments, law enforcement, security and intelligence,” John W. Peace, the Standard Chartered chairman, said in a news release. “Their appointments are a clear signal of how important financial crime compliance is to Standard Chartered and how serious we are about getting it right.”They will serve two-year terms on the committee, and additional advisers may be announced at a later date, the bank said.The bank recently announced plans to shake up its leadership, which included the departures of Mr. Peace; Peter Sands, who had been chief executive since 2006; and several long-serving directors.The lender has brought on William T. Winters, the former head of JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank, as its new chief executive. He is expected to take over in June.Standard Chartered has been hurt in recent years by a slowdown in its core Asian markets and investigations by American regulators.In August, Standard Chartered agreed to pay a $300 million fine as part of a settlement with the New York State Department of Financial Services after its computer systems failed to flag wire transfers from areas of the world considered vulnerable to money laundering.And it agreed in December to extend a nonprosecution agreement with United States authorities for three years after prosecutors reopened an investigation into accusations that it had transferred billions of dollars for Iran and other countries affected by United States sanctions.The bank paid a $667 million penalty imposed by state and federal authorities related to that inquiry in 2012.Advertisement
