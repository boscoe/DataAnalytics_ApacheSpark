One big reason for the decline, Gartner said, was that businesses were buying fewer desktop computers. PC sales may get a lift later this year when Microsoft releases its next version of Windows, analysts said, but they are still expecting an overall decline in sales for this year. Gartner estimates that PC makers shipped 71.7 million computers in the first quarter, down 5.2 percent from a year earlier. Advertisement
