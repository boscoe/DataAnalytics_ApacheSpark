LONDON — The French media group Vivendi said on Wednesday that Altice had offered to buy its 20 percent stake in Numericable-SFR.The offer of 3.9 billion euros, or about $4.4 billion, comes nearly three months after Vivendi completed the sale of its former mobile telephone unit, SFR, to Altice’s Numericable in a deal worth up to €17 billion. As part of the agreement, Vivendi received a 20 percent stake in the combined company and had the option to exit at a later date.The new offer “would cancel out any previous agreements and any discussions on price adjustments,” Vivendi said on Wednesday in a news release.Altice was offering €40 a share, for the 20 percent stake.Shares of Numericable-SFR jumped 4.2 percent to €51.41 in Paris on Wednesday morning.Half the Vivendi stake would be acquired by Numericable-SFR as part of a share buyback program. The other half would be acquired by Altice France, with a payment no later than April 7, 2016.Vivendi said the acquisition would take effect in the days after Numericable-SFR’s shareholders meeting on April 30.Vivendi said that its management board would examine the offer in the coming days, and that its supervisory board would meet on Feb. 27 to decide on the matter.Last spring, the fight for SFR, one of the biggest mobile providers in France, pitted two French billionaires against each other: Martin Bouygues, who runs the diversified industrial group that bears his name; and the entrepreneur Patrick Drahi, who since 2002 has built Altice into an international operation with cable and mobile phone assets in Europe and the Caribbean.The battle drew objections from French lawmakers and escalating, but unsuccessful counteroffers by Bouygues after Vivendi entered exclusive negotiations with Altice in March last year.A version of this article appears in print on 02/19/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Offer for Cable Stake.
