LOS ANGELES — Relativity Media, emerging from bankruptcy, is adding some star power to its executive ranks. On Thursday, the company said the actor Kevin Spacey would become chairman of its Relativity Studios unit and Mr. Spacey’s business partner, Dana Brunetti, would become president.The appointments occur as Relativity acquires Trigger Street Productions, a film and television production company operated by Mr. Spacey and Mr. Brunetti. Trigger Street has been known for its involvement with the “Fifty Shades of Grey” film and the “House of Cards” series on Netflix.Before Relativity’s bankruptcy filing last year, Trigger Street’s dealings with the company included the development of a film based on the Benghazi terror attacks, a project that Mr. Brunetti later said was sidelined by the studio’s financial woes. (Paramount Pictures will release a different Benghazi film, “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” on Jan. 15.)The star-executive alignment is not without precedent in Hollywood. Tom Cruise, for instance, for a time joined his producing partner, Paula Wagner, in running the United Artists studio. Relativity did not disclose financial terms of the Trigger Street deal.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
