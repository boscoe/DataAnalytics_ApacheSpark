With Champagne toasts on a rooftop overlooking the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, John D. Wren and Maurice Lévy celebrated the $35 billion merger between their two advertising companies, Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe. The trans-Atlantic deal was the largest ever in the industry, uniting the world’s second- and third-largest advertising groups to create a new global leader that would dethrone their archrival, Martin Sorrell’s WPP.About nine months later, the “merger of equals” was called off over irreconcilable differences between Mr. Wren and Mr. Lévy and clashes regarding who would ultimately be in charge.The implosion of the deal showed that “Don Draper’s not dead,” Mr. Sorrell told a Bloomberg News reporter at the time, a reference to the arrogant, self-aggrandizing protagonist of AMC’s “Mad Men.” “Ego and power is still important in our industry.”The year was 2014, but the drama was straight out of “Mad Men,” which chronicles the New York advertising world in the 1960s. The program — which begins the last half of its seventh and final season on Sunday — captures the industry during a pivotal period of transformation. It was an era marked by the dominance of the creative executive, embodied by Draper; the formation of advertising conglomerates; the rise of television; the slow beginnings of increased opportunities for women and minorities; and the advent of innovative technologies, like the copy machine and the computer.
                A look at some of the pop culture touchstones featured in “Mad Men,” and how The New York Times originally covered them.            Fifty years later, several of those themes continue to resonate on Madison Avenue. And while Don Draper wouldn’t recognize much of today’s advertising business — which is increasingly driven by technology and data and a new generation of so-called Math Men — big personalities at the very top continue to reign.Advertisement“It is something they could write up until the current day,” Mr. Sorrell said about “Mad Men,” of which he, like many in advertising, is a fan. “It is a shame they are going to finish it.”AdvertisementThere was much trepidation in the advertising industry when “Mad Men” made its debut in 2007, with people working in the business worried about how an outsider would depict an era known for larger-than-life executives, three-martini lunches and routine womanizing.Matthew Weiner, the series creator, said that he had long been fascinated by the forces driving the giants of American business and found that Madison Avenue in the 1960s provided a window into broader stories of wealth and power, ego, racism and sexism in the country.To understand the inner workings of agency life, he studied David Ogilvy’s advertising bible, “Confessions of an Advertising Man,” and read newspaper stories from the era, including the advertising column in The New York Times. He also consulted friends who had worked in the industry.Mr. Weiner said that he was a student of ad campaigns from the period and was particularly interested in the influence that TV commercials had. Mr. Weiner pointed to a 1961 Pepsi campaign that introduced the slogan “For those who think young.” It exemplified advertising’s influence in creating the phenomenon of youth-obsessed consumerism that remains so prevalent, he said. It also provided the framework for the first episode of the second season, during which executives at the fictional Sterling Cooper advertising agency argue about how best to cater to clients trying to appeal to the members of “the Pepsi generation,” who don’t drink coffee like their parents.The more research Mr. Weiner did, he said, the more fascinated he became with not only with the ad campaigns but also with the business operations and the personalities driving them.“There are egos battling it out, and it has nothing to do with the business,” Mr. Weiner said. “It is not just a factory that makes advertising.”Mr. Weiner said that his understanding of the inner workings of the business became clear when he learned more about the government’s crackdown on the tobacco industry’s claims about the health benefits of its product. Regulatory scrutiny led to the rise of the Marlboro Man, who linked tobacco to manliness and bypassed any need to give medical testimonials. That provided a backdrop for the pilot, which follows Don Draper on his quest to keep Sterling Cooper’s most important account, Lucky Strike cigarettes, with the agency.Advertisement“That was my crisis point in the series,” Mr. Weiner said. “The idea, very simply, is: What would happen to the business?”What followed, both in the fictional land of “Mad Men” and also on 1960s Madison Avenue, was a period of change during which boutique agencies transformed into much larger groups, which then merged, went public and formed the basis of the major advertising conglomerates that exist today.“It’s a fascinating business because the clients leave and you’ve got to close up shop,” Mr. Weiner said.He noted that the entire journey — the clashes that resulted after the mergers, conflicts between clients, the need to make balance sheets look successful — made for great storytelling. At the same time, the business of not only creating the ads but also buying advertising time emerged as a powerful and profitable sector.“You started to see the rise of the media guy,” Mr. Sorrell said, pointing to the character of Harry Crane, who plays a pivotal role in starting the television department at Sterling Cooper but is often sidelined from the executive ranks. “It underlined the change in attitude that has now come. Media is now very much front and center of the operation.”Along with the rise of media buying came new research and technologies to help agencies determine the most efficient strategies for buying commercial time. That shift provided the story line for an episode in the seventh season, in which a giant computer is installed in the agency’s office. In a complaint that continues to echo through some quarters of Madison Avenue, Don Draper grumbles that the computer is replacing humans and creativity.“Don has said” that advertising “is not a science, but no one believes that,” Mr. Weiner said.And while the overt sexism and racism of the period have faded, characters like Peggy Olson, the striving female copywriter who must outwork her male colleagues to gain respect, persist.AdvertisementJosh Weltman, a business consultant and co-producer of “Mad Men,” said that a version of Peggy Olson could still be found in every ad agency. She’s the junior employee, working hard, wanting her ideas to be taken seriously and trying to work her way up in a culture of meritocracy. “If you stay later than everybody, if you work harder than everybody, there is opportunity,” Mr. Weltman said.A hallmark of the era that has all but disappeared is the three-martini lunch. Mr. Weltman recalled working at an ad agency in 1989, when the company sent out a memo that it no longer would expense liquor at lunch. A veteran copywriter marched into his office, shook his head and asked who would buy the work sober. “He didn’t mean that you had to be out of your mind to buy advertising — he meant that the courage to do risky marketing and outrageous advertising came along with people getting loosened up,” Mr. Weltman said. “It does not work the same way that it used to.”Still, Mr. Sorrell said, despite many changes and the nostalgia engendered by “Mad Men” for its era, there is still plenty of drama in the advertising world, particularly with global and digital expansion. “I think the changes that we have seen are far more dramatic and far more fast-paced and far more interesting than what was the case then,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Changing Course on Madison Ave.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
