LONDON — In the latest sign of industry damage from the plummeting price of oil, Royal Dutch Shell said on Wednesday that it expected its profit for the fourth quarter of 2015 to be about half of what it was in the comparable period a year earlier.As if to highlight Shell’s gloomy earnings preview, oil prices continued their seemingly inexorable decline on Wednesday. In New York, oil prices were down 6.7 percent to settle at $26.55 a barrel.Shell issued the preliminary estimates before a much-anticipated vote by the company’s shareholders next week on the proposed acquisition of the BG Group, an oil and gas producer. Investors have been skeptical about the BG deal, which was announced in April, when oil and gas prices were much higher.Still, many analysts expect Shell shareholders to approve the deal at the meeting next week. And on Wednesday, one large investor in Shell, Norway’s $790 billion sovereign wealth fund, said that it would vote in favor of the deal.AdvertisementBG also released preliminary results on Wednesday, predicting that its full-year earnings for 2015 would come in more than 57 percent below the previous year’s profits.AdvertisementShell’s shares were more than 5.6 percent lower in afternoon trading in New York, and BG shares were down nearly 3 percent.Shell estimated that its profit for the quarter, excluding inventory changes and one-time charges, would fall between 42 percent and 51 percent, to between $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion. The company posted profit of about $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The company said it would earn at least $1.4 billion from its liquefied natural gas business.Shell said it was taking write-offs in the range of $7 billion, although the bulk of the markdowns were accounted for earlier in 2015. Lower oil and gas prices are leading companies to reduce the value at which they carry assets on their books.The company plans to release its official results on Feb. 4, the same week that some other big oil companies, including ExxonMobil and BP, plan to report their numbers.Shell’s cash and share deal for BG was originally priced at $70 billion, but its value has since slipped below $50 billion.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He has argued that the BG deal makes sense for long-term competitive reasons, and that oil prices will eventually rise substantially above current levels.AdvertisementShell has estimated that it would break even on the acquisition with oil prices at $60 a barrel. But industry analysts say the price of oil could fall to about $20 a barrel this year, as markets respond to a global glut, with international production exceeding demand by about a million barrels a day. On Tuesday, the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based research organization, wrote in a report that “unless something changes, the oil market could drown in oversupply.”But Mr. van Beurden is still pushing to acquire BG, a major player in liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., for which demand is expected to grow in coming years as a cleaner alternative to coal and oil.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            “Bold, strategic moves shape our industry,” he said in a statement on Wednesday. He said the BG deal would “mark the start of a new chapter in Shell, to rejuvenate the company and improve shareholder returns.”Acquiring BG would make Shell the clear leader in L.N.G. among publicly traded oil companies, and it would give it more flexibility to choose where it extracts and delivers, analysts say.Unlike unprocessed natural gas, which can be transported only where pipelines run, liquefied gas can be carried anywhere in the world by special container ships.An enhanced ability to deal in L.N.G. could be worth as much as $1 billion a year in profit for Shell, analysts say.The deal would “bring scale and optionality, and that can only be a positive thing as the L.N.G. market becomes more open,” Claire Scott of Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh said this month. BG would also bring Shell an impressive portfolio of oil and gas properties in Brazil, she added.Indicating how important L.N.G. already is for Shell, a unit called Integrated Gas, which includes L.N.G. and a related business, earned $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, equivalent to nearly all of Shell’s profit. The rest of Shell’s oil and gas exploration and production business appears to have lost more than $1 billion.Shell also says that by acquiring BG, it would be able to substantially reduce costs and the size of the work force at both companies.AdvertisementBut some investors remain unconvinced.“We have concluded that the proposed terms of the acquisition of BG are value destructive for Shell shareholders,” David Cumming, the head of equities at Standard Life Investments in London, said. He added that his assessment was based on oil prices moving lower than Shell was expecting and took into account risks in Brazil.A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Shell Expects Its Profit to Plunge, as Oil Falls Steadily.
