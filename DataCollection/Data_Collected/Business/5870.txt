ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel maker, on Thursday lowered profit expectations for the year and said it had lost $700 million in the first quarter as a recovery in Europe failed to offset a sharp drop in prices for iron ore and steel. The company also said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is a more closely watched metric than net income in the industry, had fallen to $1.4 billion for the quarter. Earnings were $1.8 billion in the same period a year earlier. “We faced a number of headwinds,” Lakshmi Mittal, the company’s chief executive, said. The company, based in Luxembourg, cut the lower end of its guidance range for that pretax measure of earnings to $6 billion from $6.5 billion. Revenue for the first quarter was $17.1 billion, compared with $19.8 billion in the same period a year earlier.A version of this brief appears in print on May 8, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: World’s Largest Steel Maker Loses $700 Million in Quarter.
