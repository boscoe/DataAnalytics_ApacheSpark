LONDON – The founder of Weavering Capital was sentenced to 13 years in prison on Friday after he was convicted of fraud and other criminal charges this week related to the collapse of the hedge fund in 2009.The hedge fund, which was based in London and at one point had more than $600 million under management, imploded after it was discovered that a multimillion-dollar trade in the firm’s flagship fund was linked to an offshore company controlled by Magnus Peterson, the fund’s founder.Mr. Peterson, 51, was convicted of eight counts, including fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading, on Monday after a three-month trial on charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office of Britain.“The length of sentence handed down reflects the damaging and extended nature of Mr Peterson’s crime,” Jane de Lozey, the Serious Fraud Office’s joint head of fraud, said in a statement. “The loss to investors was vast and was compounded by the defendant’s continued deception as to the true health of their investments.”A lawyer for Mr. Peterson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.A Swedish national who lives in Kent, in southern England, Mr. Peterson is the founding director of Weavering Capital and former investment manager of the firm’s flagship fund, the Weavering Macro Fund.He has remained in custody since his conviction on Monday.The Serious Fraud Office, which prosecutes financial crimes, accused Mr. Peterson of misleading investors over a six-year period and using swap trades to artificially inflate the performance of the Weavering Macro Fund.Mr. Peterson rewarded himself handsomely from funds received from investors, the fraud office said, receiving 5.8 million pounds, or about $8.8 million, from 2005 to 2009.The fund collapsed during the financial crisis in March 2009, and investors lost about $536 million, the fraud office said.
