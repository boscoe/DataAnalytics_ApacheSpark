Straehle, the chief executive of EFG, said in a news release.Founded in 1873, BSI, whose initials stand for Banca della Svizzera Italiana, is based in Ticino, an Italian-speaking canton of Switzerland, and it has traditionally had many clients in Italy.The Swiss bank had 88 billion francs in assets under management as of the end of last year, and has offices in Europe, Latin America, Hong Kong and Singapore.Under the terms of the deal, EFG will pay 975 million francs in cash and issue 52.6 million shares to BTG. That would value the deal at 1.33 billion francs.BTG would then hold a stake of about 20 percent of EFG and have a presence on EFG’s board.The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, and is expected to be completed at the end of the year.EFG provides private banking and asset management services at about 30 locations worldwide and employs about 2,100 people. It had assets under management of 83.3 billion francs at the end of 2015.The transaction is the second sale in months by BTG, which has sought to reassure investors and to maintain liquidity after the arrest of its former chief executive, André Santos Esteves, in a corruption scandal last year.Mr. Esteves, who has denied wrongdoing and remains under house arrest awaiting trial, has since resigned from the company.In December, BTG agreed to sell its distressed debt unit, Recovery do Brasil Consultoria, to Itaú Unibanco, the largest private banking group in Brazil, for about 1.2 billion reais, or $300 million.Lazard and the law firms Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Lenz & Staehelin advised BTG on the BSI sale. Rothschild and the law firm Schellenberg Wittmer represented EFG.Advertisement
