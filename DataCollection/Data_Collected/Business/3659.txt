SYDNEY, Australia — An Australian company has recalled its frozen berry products after a hepatitis A outbreak linked to poor hygiene and water supplies in a Chinese packaging plant.The Australian authorities were investigating on Monday after five people became sick after eating Patties Foods berries, which were grown in Chile and China and packaged at the Chinese factory.There has long been concern about food safety in China, where pollution from rapid industrialization has exacted a heavy toll on soil and water. Poor hygiene in production and packaging plants has also been a problem.Contamination scandals that led to deaths and serious illnesses have increased the popularity in China of imports of European infant formula, New Zealand milk and Japanese rice.AdvertisementMore than 11,000 schoolchildren in Germany were stricken in October 2012 with diarrhea and vomiting that the authorities linked to frozen strawberries imported from China. The Chinese Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine disputed that analysis, saying tests showed no sign of contamination.AdvertisementThe Department of Health in Australia’s Victoria State confirmed that the contamination in the latest case had been traced to China.”The particular risk that we’ve identified here is that a country that has endemic hepatitis A, that is China, has been involved with packing these berries,” Finn Romanes, the department’s senior medical adviser, told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio. “Clearly there’s strong evidence that there may have been a contamination during the packing process, as they are fully sealed and then transported to Australia.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The disease is passed through contact with material that has been contaminated with feces from an infected person.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
