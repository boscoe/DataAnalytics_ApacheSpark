DETROIT —  Leaders of the United Automobile Workers approved a tentative four-year deal with General Motors that includes a more lucrative signing bonus than what Fiat Chrysler workers were given, and $1.9 billion in new investments that will retain or create 3,300 jobs at a dozen G.M. sites.Wages will be the same as in the Fiat Chrysler contract, which was ratified last week. Entry-level G.M. workers would, over as many as eight years, achieve wage parity with their veteran counterparts. Senior workers would get raises increasing their hourly pay to about $29 an hour.It is unclear when hourly workers will begin voting on the contract, which covers more than 52,000 employees. The union said it wanted employees to have enough time to familiarize themselves with the agreement.“The biggest challenge for your bargaining committee was to balance the competing demand of higher wages and job security,” the union’s president, Dennis Williams, said in a statement.AdvertisementUpon ratification, entry-level workers would shift immediately to the health care plan that senior hourly workers receive, including full dental and vision coverage.
                Prodded by its union, the auto industry served as the 20th-century trailblazer in spreading prosperity. But the model of a “social contract” has begun to unravel.            Veteran and entry-level employees would receive $8,000 signing bonuses. The bonus is double the amount received by Fiat Chrysler workers in their contract, and $3,000 more than the amount G.M. workers got in the 2011 contract.AdvertisementIn addition, some temporary workers would get a lump-sum payment of $2,000. The agreement also calls for a $60,000 bonus for up to 4,000 eligible production employees who agree to retire next year. Mr. Williams said there would be no increase in the number of temporary workers.Some workers will get $500 tied to quality goals to be paid annually through the end of the contract.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

G.M. recently said it earned a pretax profit of $8.3 billion in North America in the first nine months of this year.If the contract is approved, the U.A.W. will turn to Ford Motor to round out negotiations with Detroit’s automakers.Mr. Williams said he would meet Thursday with the U.A.W.-Ford president, James Settles Jr., to discuss looming negotiations at Ford. Bargaining with all three manufacturers began in July.A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: U.A.W.
