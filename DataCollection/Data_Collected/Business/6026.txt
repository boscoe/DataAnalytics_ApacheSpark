Two days earlier, the government said that Frontier had the highest complaint rate and the worst on-time performance of the nation’s 14 leading airlines in March. Frontier, based in Denver, said that its chairman, Bill Franke, would manage strategy and finances and its president, Barry Biffle, would handle daily operations. Mr. Siegel had led Frontier, which is privately held, since January 2012. Frontier has been shifting to a so-called ultra-low-cost carrier that offers low base fares but adds fees for many services. Customer complaints have soared. Frontier cited a new reservations system that left callers on hold for up to 45 minutes. It said it had hired additional workers. Advertisement
