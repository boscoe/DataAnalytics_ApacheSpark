After the transaction, the family of the company’s founder, Dr. Jorge Moll, will own 68.2 percent and remain the controlling shareholder, while the private equity arm of the Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual will have a 23.5 percent stake.The deal gives Rede d’Or, founded in 1977 in Rio de Janeiro, a valuation of 19.6 billion reais, or $6.8 billion, according to one of the two people briefed on the deal.The investment came from Carlyle Partners VI, the Carlyle South America buyout fund, and its second local Brazilian fund, Carlyle said. The transaction would be the first from that new local fund, which DealBook reported in December totaled 700 million reais.Carlyle’s last private equity investment in Brazil dates back almost three years, when it acquired a furniture retailer, Tok & Stok, according to two people close to the firm.Its latest investment underscores the potential of Brazil’s growing health care sector, which has received a boost from the government’s decision this year to allow foreign investors to own hospitals. Health care is also one of Brazil’s shortcomings, with opportunity for expansion.A Carlyle statement released Monday said that Rede d’Or would use the new capital for expansion, “including the construction of new hospitals, expansion of existing facilities and the financing of new acquisitions.”Carlyle was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase and by the law firms Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and Mattos Filho, Veiga Filho, Marrey Jr. & Quiroga Advogados. Rede D’Or was advised by Banco BTG Pactual and the law firms Barbosa Müssnich Aragão and Kirkland & Ellis.Advertisement
