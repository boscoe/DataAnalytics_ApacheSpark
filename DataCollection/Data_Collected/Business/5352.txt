Blue Bell’s chief executive, Paul Kruse, said in a statement Monday night that the company “can’t say with certainty” how the bacteria was introduced to the manufacturing line. The company last month issued its first recall after ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was linked to three deaths at a Kansas hospital. Five other people in Kansas and Texas were sickened with the disease. The disease was tracked to a production line in Brenham, Tex., and later to a line in Broken Arrow, Okla. The recall extends globally, including retail outlets in 23 states. Listeriosis can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children or elderly people. Advertisement
