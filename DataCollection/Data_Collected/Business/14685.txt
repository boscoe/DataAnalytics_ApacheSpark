A British mutual fund with large investments in London commercial real estate said on Monday that it had suspended requests from investors wanting to exit the $3 billion fund.The decree from Standard Life Investments, the asset management unit of the large British insurance company, was a response to panicked investors looking to pull their assets following the vote by Britons last month to sever ties with the European Union.Standard Life’s U.K. Real Estate Fund invests in high-end commercial properties in London, which over the years have soared in value. But the decision by a majority of British voters to leave the European Union has raised questions about London’s future as a financial and commercial hub and the worth and stability of its booming real estate market.The move is also causing jitters among traders who have long worried about mutual funds that invest in assets that are hard to buy and sell, such as commercial real estate and junk bonds, but that also promise to return cash to investors on demand.AdvertisementMutual funds in Britain that invest in London property markets have been popular, especially in recent years when aggressive central bank policies pushed interest rates to zero, creating a reach for yield mentality among investors large and small.AdvertisementAlthough described as British investment funds, many of them are in effect big bets on the London malls, office towers and elite residential developments with total allocations in some cases approaching 40 percent of the fund. In a booming market, buying such properties is easily done. But they are much harder to sell, especially in a down market, because they do not trade on an exchange and are thus difficult to value.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Even though the fund company had hundreds of millions of dollars of cash on hand, panic redemption requests from investors could not be satisfied because the mutual fund’s securities were almost impossible to unload.The decision spooked regulators, in particular the Securities and Exchange Commission, which have long worried about the ability of mutual funds to meet investor demands in a time of broad market panic.A version of this article appears in print on July 5, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Standard Life Fund Halts Withdrawals by Panicked Investors After ‘Brexit’.
