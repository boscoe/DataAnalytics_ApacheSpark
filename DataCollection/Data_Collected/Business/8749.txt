The communiqué’s wording defied pressure from emerging markets to brand such a move as a risk to growth.“We heard different opinions on the possible Fed decision,” Deputy Prime Minister Cevdet Yilmaz of Turkey said at a news conference. “Some think the Fed needs to make a decision sooner rather than later, while others think it should delay.”To limit the volatility of capital flows from emerging economies into dollars — the reason for concern about a Federal Reserve rate increase — Group of 20 financial leaders said they would avoid any surprise or excessive moves.“We will carefully calibrate and clearly communicate our actions, especially against the backdrop of major monetary and other policy decisions, to minimize negative spillovers, mitigate uncertainty and promote transparency,” they said.Concern about the turbulence that might be caused by a rate increase by the Federal Reserve was amplified by investor worries over an economic slowdown in China.Group of 20 officials said they had discussed China’s decision in August to devalue its currency, a move some may see as a realignment to market rates rather than as a move to help exports.“Many supported the measures that China took,” Russia’s deputy finance minister, Sergei Storchak, said at a news briefing. “The ministers were very tolerant.”The devaluation and a plunge in Chinese stock prices are part of a difficult path to a more liberal economy, said officials including Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.“It’s an unbelievably difficult transformation, and it’s not surprising that there are bumps, that it’s not a perfectly smooth process,” she said after the meeting, which was held Friday and Saturday. “I think we had plenty of explanations, opportunity to ask questions, and it was a dialogue, and a very open one.”But some were less impressed.“Their explanations weren’t very good,” Finance Minister Taro Aso of Japan said of the Chinese. “They should have been much clearer.”Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew noted that officials worldwide were eager to see China, which has the largest economy after that of the United States, move to a currency exchange rate that reflected market fundamentals.“When the world has called on China to move toward a more market-determined exchange rate, it’s in the context of doing so in an orderly way with clearly articulated policies that can be understood and that reinforce themselves in a positive way,” he said in a statement.While not a topic of the agenda, officials informally discussed on the sidelines China’s ambitions for its currency to become part of the Special Drawing Rights, a virtual currency used only by the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Lew voiced an openness to that, so long as China carried out its promises.“If they make the kinds of reforms that they have committed to and indicated they are prepared to make, there’s an openness to a positive outcome of the review,” he said.Group of 20 officials welcomed strengthening activity in some economies but said growth fell short of expectations because reforms were not being implemented quickly enough.Last year, Group of 20 leaders agreed to use coordinated reforms and investment to try to lift global output over the next five years by 2 percent above what was already expected at the time. But they are behind schedule, the Group of 20 communiqué indicated. “We are making progress towards our commitments,” it said. “More effort is needed for implementation.”Ms. Lagarde was even more explicit, making it clear that governments had for too long relied on the supply of cheap cash from central banks that have been running ultra-loose monetary policy.“Monetary policy alone will not cut it,” she said. “It is necessary, it is recommended from our perspective, particularly in Europe and in Japan still, but it will not cut it on its own.“Clearly in the fiscal sphere as well as in the structural reforms sphere, more needs to be done, and it needs to accompany and eventually take the baton from the central bank governors.”But weaker global growth made it more difficult to implement the structural reforms, Finance Minister Joe Oliver of Canada told reporters.“We’re making progress, but the base that we hoped we would have, we haven’t arrived at, because the growth has been disappointing and the projections have been downgraded,” Mr. Oliver said, adding that one-third of the Group of 20’s extra growth commitments had been implemented.Improving investment is vital, the financial leaders agreed. Governments will prepare their final investment strategies by November, when Group of 20 leaders are to meet to discuss them in Antalya, Turkey.videoAdvertisement
