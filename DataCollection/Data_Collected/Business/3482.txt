The move is a departure for Yelp, whose main business has been selling advertising bought by local businesses with those reviews. But Yelp’s growth is starting to slow, and it reported a decrease in regular visitors in its most recent quarter. In a statement, Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s chief executive, said the purchase would help Yelp customers more easily do business with companies online. Yelp will have plenty of competitors. GrubHub, an online food ordering company and a longtime competitor of Eat24, recently acquired DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run, two delivery services that take food directly to customers who order it through the company. Yelp also faces start-ups like Postmates, which enables customers to order food from almost any restaurant for delivery, and Square, which recently bought the food delivery start-up Caviar. Bigger competitors may be coming, too. Amazon and Google have experimented with on-demand delivery services, and Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, has signaled its own ambitions of becoming a way to deliver anything to anyone. Advertisement
