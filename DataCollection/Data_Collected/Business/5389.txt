The division has added websites like Mywedding and expanded titles like Allrecipes, which began as a cooking website but is now also a magazine. It also recently acquired the popular women’s magazine Shape and took over the business operations of Martha Stewart Living and Martha Stewart Weddings.The magazine industry has been confronting difficult times as advertisers look beyond print media and readers turn to digital content. Several magazines have recently introduced new websites and rebranded their print products to attract more advertising dollars and appeal to a wider range of readers.Meredith will report its quarterly earnings on Thursday.A version of this article appears in print on April 22, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: 100 Layoffs as Publisher of Magazines Reorganizes.
