Crew, Sears, TJX and seven other retailers.“If the employee is told that his or her services are not needed, the employee will receive no pay for that day,” the letters said. “For many workers, that is too little time to make arrangements for family needs, let alone to find an alternative source of income to compensate for the lost pay.”The letters give the 13 retailers until May 4 to provide information on how they schedule employee shifts.Relying on sophisticated software that can track the flow of customers, retailers have increasingly pushed to assign just enough employees to handle anticipated demand, resulting in far less predictable and less stable work hours for much of their part-time work force.Employers in New York, however, are bound by labor laws that require them to pay workers who report for scheduled shifts at least four hours of pay, even if managers send them home.The retailers could not immediately be reached for comment. News of the investigation was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Advertisement
