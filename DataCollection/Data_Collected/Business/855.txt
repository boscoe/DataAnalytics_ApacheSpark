Starbucks reported another quarter of strong sales and profit growth, but its shares fell more than 3 percent after its 2016 forecast offered little upside to Wall Street’s target. Starbucks said on Thursday that global sales at cafes open at least 13 months were up 8 percent in the fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 27. Analysts polled by the research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a 6.9 percent rise. Starbucks also forecast earnings for the 2016 fiscal year, excluding items, of $1.87 to $1.89 a share, in line with analysts’ average call for $1.88 a share.A version of this brief appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Forecast Disappoints Investors, and Starbucks Shares Drop .
