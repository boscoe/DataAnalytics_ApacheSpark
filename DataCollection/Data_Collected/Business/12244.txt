LONDON — Glencore, the mining and energy giant whose fortunes over the last year have been hit particularly hard by the global price slump in raw materials, said on Tuesday that it lost $5 billion in 2015.Buffeted by the same headwinds facing other mining and oil companies, Glencore was forced to reduce the book values of its oil fields in Chad, a nickel mine in New Caledonia and other facilities.The company, based in Switzerland, had a $2.3 billion profit in 2014.Because the company’s results reflect the economic slowdown in China and other countries that were once driving global growth, Glencore’s struggles underscore a broader industry challenge.In recent weeks, other major mining companies including the London-based Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton of Australia and Vale of Brazil have reported sharply lower operating results and net losses after writing down the value of assets because of depressed prices.AdvertisementVale reported a staggering loss for 2015, $12.1 billion, on a combination of the diminishing value of its assets and a sharp decline in the Brazilian currency against the dollar.Advertisement“We are now well and truly advanced in one of the worst bear cycles the mining industry has ever seen,” said Paul Gait, an analyst in London at Bernstein Investment Research and Management.Mining executives have been cheered by the recent modest rise in most commodity prices, including oil, after lows at the beginning of the year. But they remain on guard.Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore’s chief executive, told analysts on Tuesday that it was sometimes preferable to leave minerals in the ground rather than to try to feed them into an oversupplied market.Glencore differs from other mining companies in that, besides extracting raw materials, it also has large operations in trading and marketing oil, metals and other commodities. Though not a complete buffer, these businesses held up much better than the mines in last year’s difficult market.Glencore reported profit of $778 million from energy trading in 2015, a 48 percent increase from a year earlier, as volatile oil prices created what the company said was “an attractive, opportunity-rich market environment.”The company also said it had reduced its net debt, which had been a major concern for investors, to $25.9 billion at the end of 2015, down from $30.5 billion a year earlier. Glencore said it planned to cut net debt to about $18 billion by the end of this year, with the help of as much as $5 billion in asset sales.Rio Tinto, which lost $866 million in 2015, and BHP Billiton, which reported a $5.7 billion loss for the six months that ended on Dec. 31, reacted by trimming large investments in new mines and other operations, and by adopting policies that will most likely reduce their rich dividends to shareholders.AdvertisementGlencore, spurred by a near panic among investors over its debt levels last year, has had to scramble more than other big mining companies to sell assets and reduce spending.The company has already brought in $1.4 billion from deals to sell silver and gold byproducts from copper mines. On Tuesday, it said it would consider other such deals, and it added that it had put copper mines in Chile and Australia up for sale. It has also curtailed production of copper and zinc at mines in Australia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The shares have since made up that lost ground. But the stock price, which rose 1 percent on Tuesday, is still nearly 60 percent below its level in May.Glencore, whose origins were in trading, bought much of its mining assets in its $30 billion takeover of Xstrata in 2013. That deal brought debt and an ill-timed exposure to mines, whose fortunes are largely determined by commodity prices.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            Still, some analysts question whether any of the mining companies have adjusted to sharply lower prices for products like iron ore, copper and coal.Consider iron ore, a crucial business for companies like Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. With additional production coming on the market from investments in new and bigger mines, especially in Australia and Brazil, supplies are growing — despite prices being down around 70 percent from the peak of about $190 a metric ton in 2011. Richard Knights, a mining analyst at Liberum in London, estimates that iron ore exports will grow about 6 percent this year.High prices for metals like iron ore encouraged companies like Rio Tinto to invest in bigger and more-productive mines, some of them engineering marvels.The heart of Rio Tinto’s operations, for instance, is the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where the company has built an empire of 15 iron ore mines, with their own airports, railroads and ports. The main aim was to feed huge quantities of iron ore to China, whose share of world steel production rose to about half, from about a quarter, in the decade through 2014, as the country invested heavily in infrastructure and manufacturing.AdvertisementIn the past two years, though, a slowing, shifting economy has reduced China’s domestic demand for steel.With prices down, Rio Tinto and other companies have reduced their investments. And yet, as a result of additional mines coming into production, Rio Tinto and the two other major iron ore producers, BHP Billiton and Vale, are expected to increase output this year. Glencore, able to lean on its trading operations, is more likely to leave resources in the ground for now.“We will continue looking to cut production at any one of our operations if we believe we are not getting the right return,” Mr. Glasenberg, the chief executive, said on Tuesday.With the cost of extracting and shipping iron ore in the range of $20 a metric ton, and prices now around $50 a ton, companies like Rio do not see much reason to cut back. They are still making money from their mines — but much less than before.Copper, a mainstay at BHP Billiton, is also profitable, Mr. Knights said.Probably the best hope for the mining companies is that the modest rise in most commodity prices in recent weeks signals that a modicum of stability has been reached. Copper, for example, was trading on Tuesday at $2.13 a pound, compared with a low of $1.94 in January.“Perhaps we have come to some sort of plateau,” Mr. Gait, the Bernstein analyst, said. “That interpretation is certainly possible.”A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Glencore Loss Reflects Hard Times in Mining.
