ATHENS —  Over the last six months, Greece has provided both highs and lows for foreign investors.A few brave hedge funds have cashed in because of the stellar returns they have earned from Greek government bonds, which since Greece signed its bailout deal in August have been among the world’s best performing investments.But those who bet heavily on Greek banks — like John Paulson, David Einhorn and Wilbur Ross — have had their investments evaporate after the recent recapitalization of the Greek financial sector.In recent years, investing in Greece has always been a bit of an all-or-nothing affair as the lure of sky-high returns has always been tempered by the very real prospect that you might lose your shirt.And so it was last week when a group of prominent investors came here to gauge whether, in the wake of Greece’s close brush with leaving the euro last summer, it was safe to invest in Greek assets again.AdvertisementBut at an investor conference here, the main concern was less about what technical reform the government was passing or what was going on with Greece’s debt, but whether Greece, and Europe for that matter, could regain the trust of global financial community.Advertisement“We have become too obsessed with structural reforms and debt in Greece,” said Chetan Gulati, who oversees European investments out of London for Perry Capital.An $8 billion hedge fund based in New York, Perry, along with funds like Japonica Partners, Greylock Capital and the French funds H20 and Carmignac, have made a mint from their Greek bond investments as yields have fallen to 8 percent from 14 percent since August. (Bond yields move in the opposite direction from their prices.)While many of these investors may be happy with such a payoff, they know how fleeting such gains can be if another political crisis engulfs Greece.“What investors are looking for today is a return of the stability, confidence and trust that has been destroyed over the past six months,” Mr. Gulati said, his voice rising as he addressed the conference participants.That means the government has to make clear that the last six months have been a mistake, he said; the Greek opposition must support the government if it does the right thing; and finally, he, concluded, Europe has to let it be known that Greece is part of the club — because right now it is not.Mr. Gulati’s cri de coeur struck a chord, prompting robust applause from an audience that, for most of this two-day investor conference, had been unresponsive.And it summed up the conflicted feelings of foreign investors in terms of how they should approach Greece these days.AdvertisementEnticing prospects of high-yielding government bonds and hugely discounted Greek bank stocks have lured a procession of investors to Athens in recent months.At the same time, however, the looming risks of jittery politics and a mountain of nonperforming loans have kept most investors on the sidelines.Perhaps the most powerful sign that investors may be willing to give Greece the benefit of the doubt, at least for a while longer, is that just about all the funds that took big losses in Greek bank stocks have not washed their hands of Greece, as one might expect.Instead, Greek bankers here say that these investors chose to participate in the latest fund offering, enticed no doubt by discounts of as much as 70 percent of the company’s total value. (The previous recapitalization in 2012 offered investors a 30 percent discount.)
                European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.            Such giveaway prices, however, were not enough to attract more conservative long-term investors. Of the foreigners that did participate, most were hedge funds with a high tolerance for risk, bankers said.Greece’s two largest banks, for example, Piraeus and National Bank of Greece, were not able to attract enough interest from overseas, and as a result they had to scramble at the last minute to tap domestic sources. They also were forced to accept cash from Greece’s semiofficial bank oversight fund, the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund.At the forefront of investor worries is the willingness of the nation’s left-leaning prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to deliver on the painful reforms he promised creditors in the summer. And while the government has pushed through a slate of tough measures, the most politically explosive of them all, cutting pensions, remains unresolved.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The vast majority of these funds, economists here say, is stuffed in bureau drawers, under mattresses or locked away in personal safes.If this vast trove of liquidity returns to the banking system, the banks will then be able to wean themselves off expensive short-term loans from the European Central Bank and return to their core business of making loans.AdvertisementIt will not be easy. With two scares in three years over leaving the euro, Greek depositors are understandably gun shy about keeping their hard-earned savings in their banks.And with capital controls limiting the amount of cash they can withdraw, there is little incentive for nervous savers to return to the Greek banking system.For the moment then, for everyday Greeks as well as foreign investors, more needs to be done before they can put their full faith in Greek institutions.“For all this money to return from under the mattresses there needs to be a new climate of trust,” said Aristides Xenofos, the chief executive of the fund overseeing the Greek banking sector. “This is what is critical.”A version of this article appears in print on December 11, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Foreign Investors Seek Signs That Greece Has Found Solid Footing.
