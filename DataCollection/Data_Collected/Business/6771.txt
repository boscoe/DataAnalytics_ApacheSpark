LONDON — The British government said on Thursday that it had raised 750 million pounds, or about $1.16 billion, in a sale of half of its remaining stake in Royal Mail, the operator of Britain’s postal service.The government sold a 15 percent stake at 500 pence a share to institutional investors overnight as it looked to sell down its remaining interest nearly two years after Royal Mail went public. The government still holds a 15 percent interest after the latest sale.George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, announced on Wednesday that the government planned to award up to an additional 1 percent of Royal Mail’s shares to its employees, who received 10 percent of the company’s shares when it went public.Shares of Royal Mail closed at 516.5 pence in London on Wednesday, about 57 percent above the initial public offering price of 330 pence.AdvertisementThe government raised £1.98 billion in the I.P.O. in October 2013, which was 24 times oversubscribed.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
