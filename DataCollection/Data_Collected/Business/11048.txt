The disco ball was spinning like a glitter moon and a pair of go-go dancers grooved in neon wigs at a Brooklyn nightclub during the recent 20th-anniversary party of Ultra Music, one of the record labels behind the explosive growth of dance music in the United States.As a D.J.’s mix boomed, Patrick Moxey, Ultra’s silver-haired founder and president, received guests with hugs and a wide smile. But the party, he said, was not all celebration. It was also an acknowledgment of the struggle — one might say hustle — over the years to bring electronic dance music, or E.D.M., from its underground origins into the commercial mainstream.If Ultra and the larger dance world face a struggle these days, it is simply to maintain the genre’s momentum. Once viewed by the music industry as a minor subculture, E.D.M. is now a vital part of the pop world, fueling an expanding festival market and providing much of the underlying sound of Top 40 radio.Mr. Moxey and Ultra worked in the trenches of the American market for years, pushing now famous acts like Calvin Harris and David Guetta to radio programmers when dance music was still considered a risk. Today the label is reaping its rewards through a partnership with Sony, and with hit acts like OMI and Kygo, a 24-year-old Norwegian D.J. and producer who will perform at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Jan. 21.Advertisement“Without Ultra, the American scene would have been starting from scratch,” said Joel Zimmerman, an agent at William Morris Endeavor who represents Kygo and other top E.D.M. acts like Deadmau5 and Kaskade.Ultra, which released its first single in 1996, made its name with compilation CDs like “Ultra.Dance” and “Ultra.Chilled” that came out like clockwork each year and invariably featured a scantily clad woman on the cover. But these days the label’s focus is on the popularity of singles on streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube. Albums, Mr. Moxey said, are almost an afterthought.Advertisement“We’ve moved back to a model that’s closer to the Motown model of the ’50s and ’60s,” Mr. Moxey, 49, said in an interview at the label’s loft near the Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan. “The pressure is all on the song.”While streaming has begun to catch on with consumers, its value remains disputed in the music industry, since the fractions of pennies that labels and artists make for each stream is vastly less than the revenue from one CD or album download. That calculation may be why Adele withheld “25,” her blockbuster album, from streaming services.But Ultra has fully embraced streaming. The label declined to provide specific numbers, but Mr. Moxey said that Ultra had always been profitable and that it continued to grow by 10 percent to 15 percent a year, even as the rest of the record business has struggled to keep its revenue flat.Gigantic numbers of streams help make the difference for Ultra. The more than 2,000 videos on its YouTube page have garnered four billion views, and Kygo — who has yet to release a full album — racked up a billion streams on Spotify in just one year. At Ultra’s office, the plaques on the wall commemorate not just sales figures but also YouTube subscriber milestones.“Streaming is our friend,” said Mr. Moxey, whose slowly enunciated speech speeds up when he talks about the global spread of dance music online. “Nothing is more cumbersome than a piece of plastic when all you want is the music.”Three years ago Sony Music Entertainment bought 50 percent of Ultra to establish itself in the growing dance world, giving Mr. Moxey a dual role as Sony’s president for electronic music. The deal also gives Ultra a measure of financial security, and the label can now count on Sony’s global infrastructure to help sell records. The artists Mr. Moxey signs are promoted by Sony labels throughout the world, or by Ultra’s own staff of 25.AdvertisementDoug Morris, the chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment, speaks approvingly of Mr. Moxey as an old-school record-business hustler. “Anyone who has his own business and keeps it open as long as he did it,” Mr. Morris said, “is doing something right.”Mr. Moxey got his start in dance while at the University of Chicago in the 1980s, the golden age of house music in that city. He came to New York in 1987 to attend the graduate film program at New York University but dropped out after a week, he said, and started D.J.ing at warehouse parties and working with hip-hop acts at record labels, where the top executives, he said, scoffed at the dance world.He scraped together $8,000 to make Ultra’s first record, by the New York D.J. Roger Sanchez, and took it to Miami for the Winter Music Conference, an annual gathering for the dance world, to pitch it to D.J.s and promoters from around the world.
                Different music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.            “Somebody would say, ‘Across the swimming pool, that’s the D.J. from Atlanta, that’s the D.J. from London, from Paris, from L.A.,’ ” Mr. Moxey recalled. “We would hand them a 12-inch vinyl record. That’s how you broke the record. That was the Internet.”Mr. Moxey built the label in part through a knack for turning an ordinary song into a hit by finding the right producer to remix it. That formula has continued to work for Ultra, which in 2014 hired the German D.J. Robin Schulz to remix the Mr. Probz track “Waves.” Shortly thereafter, the label had another hit with “Cheerleader,” a reggae-tinged song by the Jamaican singer OMI that was remixed by another young German producer, Felix Jaehn, and that went to No. 1 on iTunes around the world.When asked why Ultra had hired him, Mr. Jaehn noted that it happened shortly after the success of the “Waves” remix. “So they saw that phenomenon happen before and they probably thought, ‘Let’s ask the next German D.J. to try it again,’” he said.In the E.D.M. world, the perennial question behind the scenes is whether the popularity of the genre is all a bubble waiting to pop. The dance festival company SFX Entertainment went public in late 2013 at a value of more than $1 billion, but its stock has been pummeled by the market, and last week the company disclosed that it was considering bankruptcy.Mr. Moxey dismissed the suggestion of a bubble, saying that the dance world was healthy and growing. “There’s no bubble to pop,” he said, adding that the development of streaming had strengthened the business.“It has allowed the songs to get out to the audience quickly and in an exciting way to a global audience,” he said. “And dance music works in any local language, because it’s mainly the beat.”A version of this article appears in print on January 11, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Keeping a Boom in the Black.
