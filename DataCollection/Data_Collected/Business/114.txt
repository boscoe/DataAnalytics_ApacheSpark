ATLANTA —  The United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations neared agreement on Sunday night on the largest regional trade accord in history, a potentially precedent-setting model for global commerce and worker standards that would tie together 40 percent of the world’s economy, from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia.Final haggling over the arcane details of opening dairy markets to competition delayed the announcement that trade ministers promised for Sunday. But United States government officials said they were confident that a deal was imminent after nearly eight years of negotiations — including five days of round-the-clock sessions here — and negotiators from other countries echoed that confidence.Trade ministers, eager to depart after repeatedly canceling flights, tentatively planned to announce their accord Monday. If it comes together, the Trans-Pacific Partnership still faces months of debate in Congress and will inject a new flash point into both parties’ presidential contests.An accord would be a potentially legacy-making achievement for President Obama, and the capstone for his foreign policy “pivot” toward closer relations with fast-growing eastern Asia, after years of American preoccupation with the Middle East and North Africa.AdvertisementMr. Obama spent recent days contacting world leaders to seal the deal. To members of Congress, administration officials have repeatedly pressed their contention that the partnership will build a bulwark against China’s economic influence, and allow the United States and its allies — not Beijing — to set the standards for Pacific commerce.AdvertisementThe Pacific accord would phase out thousands of import tariffs as well as other barriers to international trade. It also would establish uniform rules on corporations’ intellectual property, open the Internet even in communist Vietnam, and crack down on wildlife trafficking and environmental abuses.Several potentially deal-breaking disputes besides the dairy details kept the ministers talking through the weekend, and forced the repeated delays of a celebratory announcement. Final compromises covered commercial protections for drug makers’ advanced medicines, liberalized trade in sugar and a slow phaseout — over two to three decades — of the tariffs on Japan’s autos sold in North America.The negotiators had postponed action on ending tariffs and opening the participating countries to each other’s dairy exports until the pharmaceutical drug issue was resolved. But they miscalculated how long it would take to settle questions involving the politically powerful dairy industries in Canada, New Zealand, the United States and other countries.For officials from Canada, which holds federal elections within two weeks, the issue is particularly sensitive. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been under pressure because of an economic slowdown mainly caused by the collapse of oil and other commodity prices, and he has promoted the agreement as a way to boost Canadian exports.But dairy interests there oppose opening markets to foreign competitors.The parties to the accord also include Mexico, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei.In a concession likely to be problematic with key Republicans, the United States agreed that brand-name pharmaceutical companies would have a period shorter than the current 12 years to keep secret their data on producing so-called biologics, which are advanced medicines made from living organisms.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade, has threatened to withdraw his support for the accord if United States negotiators agree to loosening pharmaceutical industry protections from those in federal law.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The generic drug industry and nonprofit health groups also strenuously opposed the United States position, pressing for access within five years to the data to speed lower-priced “biosimilars” to market. The compromise is a hybrid that protects companies’ data for five years to eight years.AdvertisementOnly once that intellectual property issue was settled did several nations including Canada, New Zealand and the United States turn to the dairy issues.The trade ministers have settled much, especially in recent months, and those agreements — filling 30 separate chapters — are what kept the negotiators from giving up in recent days on reaching a conclusion.Labor unions are poised to argue that the emerging agreement favors Big Business over workers and environmental protection. Donald Trump has castigated the Pacific trade accord repeatedly as “a bad deal,” injecting conservative populism into the debate and emboldening some congressional Republicans protective of their local interests like sugar and rice industries and opposed to Mr. Obama at every turn.The agreement for the first time would require state-owned businesses like those in Vietnam and Malaysia to comply with commercial trade rules and labor and environmental standards.Administration officials say the labor and environmental commitments are the strongest ever in a trade agreement, and a model for future pacts, although some environmental groups and most unions are unpersuaded.The worker standards commit all parties to the International Labor Organization’s principles for collective bargaining, a minimum wage and safe workplaces and against child labor, forced labor and excessive hours.Unions and human rights groups, however, are skeptical that Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei will improve labor conditions, or that Malaysia will stop human trafficking of poor workers from Myanmar and Southeast Asia. The United States reached separate agreements with the three nations on enforcing labor standards, which would allow United States tariffs to be restored if a nation is found in violation after a dispute-settlement process.For the first time in a trade agreement there would be provisions to help small businesses, which lack the resources of big corporations, to deal with trade barriers and red tape.The agreement also would overhaul special tribunals that handle trade disputes between businesses and participating nations. The changes would respond to widespread criticisms that the Investor-State Dispute Settlement panels favor businesses and interfere with nations’ efforts to pass rules safeguarding public health.AdvertisementEven if an agreement is reached, Mr. Obama cannot sign the accord until Congress has 90 days to review the pact’s details.A version of this article appears in print on October 5, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: As Pacific Trade Negotiators Haggled, U.S. Officials Remained Hopeful.
