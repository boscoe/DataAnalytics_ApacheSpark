Taubman’s PJT Partners.Since its founding, DBO Partners has worked on transactions across a number of industries, including URS’s $4 billion sale to a fellow engineering company, Aecom, and the $1.85 billion takeover of the 24 Hour Fitness chain of gyms.Now, it is adding as partners specialists in advising chip makers, cloud software service providers and other technology companies. One is Mr. Hein, who had previously served as the global co-head of semiconductor investment banking at Morgan Stanley and worked on transactions involving the likes of Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. He left Morgan Stanley in August of 2013 and worked as an independent adviser, according to his LinkedIn profile.The other new hire is Mr. DeRuff, who was most recently at the Presidio Group. He previously worked at FBR Capital Markets and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and began his career at Morgan Stanley in 1984.Advertisement
