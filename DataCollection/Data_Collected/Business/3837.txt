LONDON — The British bank HSBC said on Monday that profit fell 15 percent in 2014, adding to the lender’s challenges as it continues to reel from revelations about efforts by its Swiss private banking arm to help wealthy clients evade taxes.HSBC apologized this month after news reports, based on secret documents taken from the bank in 2007, showed that its employees had reassured clients that the lender would not disclose details of their accounts to the tax authorities of their home countries, and discussed options to avoid paying taxes on those assets.On Monday, the bank, which is based in London but generates much of its income from Asia, once again offered an apology for what it described as “conduct and compliance failures” in its Swiss unit and said that it had overhauled its private banking business and reduced its client base in Switzerland by 70 percent since its peak.“We have absolutely no appetite to do business with customers that are evading taxes,” Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC, said in a call with reporters on Monday.AdvertisementThe Guardian reported late Sunday that Mr. Gulliver had his bonus paid through a holding company into a Swiss account through 2003, when he moved to London from Hong Kong, and that he had about 5 million pounds, or about $7.69 million, in that Swiss account as of 2007.AdvertisementDuring the call with journalists, Mr. Gulliver defended his use of the Swiss account and said it was not intended to avoid taxes. He said that at the time he opened the account, it was common for Hong Kong employees to do so, in large part to protect confidentiality about their compensation.Mr. Gulliver, who was born in Derby, England, left Britain in 1980 after joining HSBC. He has spent the bulk of his 35-year banking career working outside Britain and worked in Hong Kong for many years. The bank, whose name is short for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, was run for years out of Hong Kong but now has its headquarters in London.Despite the fact he runs the bank in Britain, Mr. Gulliver said, he remains a Hong Kong resident and he pays taxes both in Britain and Hong Kong.“I’ve never paid less than the U.K. marginal tax rate,” he said.The bank said in its “Strategic Report 2014” that Mr. Gulliver’s total compensation for 2014 was more than £7.6 million, down from £8.03 million for 2013. His remuneration included a base salary of £1.25 million, a fixed-pay allowance of £1.7 million and a pension contribution of £625,000. He also had variable pay of £3.4 million and additional benefits of £642,000.HSBC’s full-year results were hurt by a variety of provisions for regulatory fines and settlements, and payments to customers in Britain who were improperly sold insurance products. In 2013, HSBC also had stronger results from the sale and reclassification of businesses as it continued to restructure its operations.Profit in 2014 fell to $13.7 billion, down from $16.2 billion in 2013. Pretax profit dropped 17 percent to $18.7 billion, down from $22.6 billion in 2013. Pretax profit was below analysts’ expectations, according to Reuters.Shares of HSBC fell 5.9 percent to £5.69 in midday trading in London on Monday.“Profits disappointed, although a tough fourth quarter masked some of the progress made over the preceding three quarters,” Mr. Gulliver said in a news release. “Many of the challenging aspects of the fourth-quarter results were common to the industry as a whole. In spite of this, there were a number of encouraging signs, particularly in commercial banking, payments and cash management and renminbi products and services.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It also reserved $1.28 billion for programs to compensate consumers who were improperly sold products in Britain like payment protection insurance.Payment protection insurance was widely sold for years in Britain and has cost the industry billions of dollars in redress after regulators determined that some customers had been improperly sold the product.Revenue fell 5 percent in 2014 to $61.2 billion, down from $64.6 billion in the prior year.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, fell 2 percent to $34.7 billion in 2014, down from $35.5 billion a year earlier.Operating expenses rose 6.1 percent to $37.9 billion for the full year, up from $35.7 billion in 2013.In Asia, which accounted for about 78.3 percent of the bank’s earnings, pretax profit declined 7.7 percent to $14.6 billion for the full year, down from $15.9 billion in 2013.HSBC’s core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of its ability to weather financial disturbances, rose to 10.9 percent at the end of 2014, up from 10.8 percent a year earlier.European banks are required to have a minimum of 4 percent common equity Tier 1 capital, but larger banks are required to maintain a higher minimum capital level, which is set by their local regulators.Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about the annual earnings report of the British bank HSBC misstated some portions of the 2014 remuneration package of its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver. He received a pension contribution of £625,000, not £625 million, and additional benefits of £642,000, not £642 million. It also misstated Mr. Gulliver’s title. He is the chief executive, not the chairman.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
