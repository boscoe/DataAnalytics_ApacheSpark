The beer giant said it was acquiring Breckenridge for an undisclosed amount and would add it to its craft and import brand unit, the High End. In an open letter to supporters, the president of Breckenridge, J. Todd Usry, said the brewery would continue to make its own decisions about the beers it creates. “I hope you will give us the chance to prove to you over time that we will continue to be Breckenridge Brewery,” he said. The sale was a surprise to many in Colorado, with people accusing Breckenridge, the state’s sixth largest craft brewer, of being more interested in money than craft. Kyle Leingang, a lawyer for Dorsey & Whitney who works on craft brewing mergers and acquisitions, said Anheuser-Busch seemed to be pursuing a strategy of acquiring successful, regionally focused brewers. “InBev is banking on the real definition of craft being higher quality and not who the owner is, and we’ll see how that plays out,” he said.
