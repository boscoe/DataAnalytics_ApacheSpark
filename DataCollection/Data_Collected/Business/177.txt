There should be enough pumpkins for Halloween this year, but that might not be the case for the canned pumpkin used in pies come Thanksgiving, according to crop experts in Illinois, the country’s top pumpkin-producing state. “I would not wait until Nov. 20,” said Mohammad Babadoost, a University of Illinois professor, referring to the Friday before Thanksgiving. Libby, a top maker of canned pumpkin, says yields could be off by as much as a third this year in Illinois, where about 90 percent of the pumpkins grown in the United States come from. Libby’s corporate and brand affairs director, Roz O’Hearn, said the company was confident it would have enough pumpkins. But, she said, “once we ship the remainder of the 2015 harvest, we’ll have no more Libby’s pumpkin to sell until harvest 2016.” Farmers are blaming record rainfall in June for washing out the crop.A version of this brief appears in print on October 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Big Chunk of Canned Pumpkin May Not Make Thanksgiving.
