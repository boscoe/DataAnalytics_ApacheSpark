LONDON – German and British regulators are examining Deutsche Bank’s systems and controls as questions have again arisen about the German lender’s reporting procedures.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain placed Deutsche Bank’s London office under so-called enhanced supervision last year after it was fined 4.7 million pounds, or about $7.1 million, by the regulator in August for reporting failures, a person briefed on the situation said on Friday.The regulator declined to comment on Friday.Separately, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority said on Friday that it had begun an inquiry into whether Deutsche Bank violated German securities regulations in disclosing its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014 on Thursday.Deutsche Bank declined comment on both inquiries, but said that it has been working to improve its internal reporting procedures.“We have been working diligently to further strengthen our systems and controls and are committed to being best in class,” the bank said in a statement. “We have invested €3.6bn since 2012 as part of this effort.”The German and British inquiries are the latest to examine reporting procedures at Deutsche Bank, one of Europe’s largest lenders.Last year, it emerged that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had also questioned the bank’s reporting procedures and oversight in late 2013.In August, the British regulator fined the lender for failing to properly report millions of equity swap transactions over a period of almost six years because of a computer software problem.In the case, the regulator said a “coding error” resulted in the buy-sell indication being improperly reversed on 29.4 million transactions. As a result, a transaction where an investor sold a swap was improperly reported as a buy.Following the fine, the F.C.A. placed Deutsche Bank’s London office under enhanced supervision, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.The F.C.A. introduced the enhanced supervision framework in Britain last summer following a government review of regulatory powers used to monitor and address potential failings by senior management in maintaining proper standards at banks.Firms are placed under enhanced supervision when regulators identify “a serious failure of culture, governance or standards” and believe tradition supervisory approaches won’t be “sufficient to tackle those issues in a timely way,” according to the F.C.A.As part of the framework, regulators normally request that a company comply with remediation procedures to address the issues raised. Following those efforts, the regulator would determine whether the institution could return to normal supervision.The Times of London reported the F.C.A.’s move on Friday.In the German inquiry, the regulator, known by its German acronym BaFin, is looking into whether Deutsche Bank should have issued a so-called ad hoc notice ahead of its earnings release.German companies are required to issue an ad hoc communication to the stock market when there is new information that could influence the share price.Dominika Kula, a spokeswoman for BaFin, said that inquiries into compliance with ad hoc communications were common. The maximum fine for a violation is 1 million euros, or about $1.1 million. However, the maximum fine imposed last year was €97,500, she said.“It’s a very standard procedure. It’s nothing unusual,” Ms. Kula said Friday.Chad Bray reported from London and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.
