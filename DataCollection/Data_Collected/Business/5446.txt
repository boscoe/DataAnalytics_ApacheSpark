The previous record was set by the Swiss bank UBS, which paid $1.5 billion in 2012 to settle accusations related to its involvement.Libor is the average of how much banks say they would pay to borrow from one another and serves as the benchmark for trillions of dollars in credit-card loans and other financial instruments.A settlement would advance Deutsche Bank’s efforts to deal with an array of accusations of misconduct that have damaged its reputation, drained billions of dollars in fines and legal fees and shaken its standing as the only German bank capable of playing in the big leagues of investment banking.But the bank’s legal troubles are far from over. It also faces investigations into currency manipulation and violations of United States sanctions against countries like Iran.Despite the charge against earnings, Deutsche Bank said it would still be profitable and would report “near record” revenue for the first quarter. The bank is scheduled to report earnings on April 29.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement
