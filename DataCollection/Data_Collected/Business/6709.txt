In a monthly supply and demand report, the agency on Wednesday increased its forecast for the price of Grade A large eggs in New York: $1.60 to $1.66 per dozen. That is up from its May estimate of $1.30 to $1.36 and tops last year’s average price of about $1.42, which was a record high, according to government data. In the fourth quarter, the report says, eggs will average $1.73 to $1.87 per dozen. Advertisement
