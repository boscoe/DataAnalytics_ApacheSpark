Starbucks, which was widely criticized last year for its lack of transparency about the drink’s ingredients, said on Monday that its drink would now be made with real pumpkin and without caramel coloring. Panera said its new drink, also to be made with pumpkin, would be made “entirely without artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, preservatives or high-fructose corn syrup.” Starbucks’s chief executive, Howard Schultz, has called the pumpkin spice latte the company’s “most popular seasonal beverage ever,” and even has a Twitter feed for the drink. On Monday, it posted: “In between a yoga retreat and a vision quest, I made a big decision to use real pumpkin. My dad is so proud.” Panera said it would offer samples on Tuesday in Seattle, across the street from the first Starbucks location by Pike Place market. Panera’s version will be sold in its stores starting Sept. 9. Starbucks has not said when its drink will be available. Advertisement
