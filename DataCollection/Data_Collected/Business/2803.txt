The Verge, a technology website owned by the online media company Vox, said on Tuesday that it would be airing a Super Bowl advertisement, before revealing that it would in fact be spending just $700 on a regional spot in Helena, Mont.The 30-second advertisement  was posted online Tuesday. The Verge initially described the advertisement as a regional buy without specifying its tiny scale.Ads for the Super Bowl, which annually draws audiences of 100 million or more, cost as much as $4.5 million for a 30-second national spot.The spot, titled “The Future Belongs to You,” describes “a world where billions of people carry supercomputers in their pockets every single day,” over scenes of a brook babbling through a forest, a mountain lake and a concert as driving rock music plays. It shows people using cutting-edge technology like virtual reality headsets, but no devices, in the traditional sense, appear.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
