In another example, eight packages of chicken tenders priced at $9.99 a pound on average cost $4.13 more than they should have.John Hempfling, chief litigator for Whole Foods, said the company had been working to address the city’s concerns since December, walking officials through its auditing and training programs and having them meet with regional executives.“They’ve never provided any evidence,” Mr. Hempfling said. “All I’ve seen from them is the violation sheets.”He said that made it hard for the grocer to assess the city’s report.Julie Menin, commissioner of the Department of Consumer Affairs, disputed that, saying that her agency met with Whole Foods in February, had repeated conversations with the company and had provided it with more than 90 pages of what she called “detailed violation data.”“We have repeatedly asked Whole Foods to provide us with evidence that they have fixed this problem — the same problem that existed in California and clearly exists in New York City,” Ms. Menin said. “They have failed to do so, which is why we are continuing our investigation.”Mr. Hempfling added that what Whole Foods called a vegetable platter was a platter of cut vegetables that could be served as hors d’oeuvres. Each platter is priced as a unit rather than by weight, which may differ from platter to platter.“In the majority of times, customers are getting more and paying less in such cases,” Mr. Hempfling said.He said the city had been doing its investigation in many New York City groceries and questioned why Whole Foods was the only grocer cited.Last year, Whole Foods paid an $800,000 fine in California after Santa Monica, Los Angeles and San Diego brought a civil protection case against the chain, accusing it of overcharging customers.Mr. Hempfling said the company planned to fight the fines sought by New York, however, because they were “excessive.”The Department of Consumer Affairs said the fine in New York for falsely labeling a package was as much as $950 for the first violation and up to $1,700 for a subsequent violation.Advertisement
