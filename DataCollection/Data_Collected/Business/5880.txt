Blackstone raised about $21 billion for its fifth fund before the financial crisis.Although the $17 billion represents the first close of the fund, the firm has received commitments in excess of the $17.5 billion limit on the fund, this person added.A spokesman for Blackstone declined to comment.The enthusiasm of investors for the new fund reflects the sense that private equity firms are poised to strike big deals — and mint money. Blackstone has been among the most successful private equity firms in the industry, reporting a 160 percent rise in private equity profit in its first fiscal quarter.Institutions like pension funds have poured billions of dollars into other private equity funds as well, with Apollo Global Management closing its most recent leveraged buyout vehicle at $18.4 billion last year.Yet so far, private equity firms have toiled hard to find suitable acquisition targets, in many cases outbid by corporate buyers who can afford to pay higher prices. About $286 billion worth of leveraged buyouts were struck last year, accounting for just 8.2 percent of all merger activity, according to Thomson Reuters. That was down from 9.7 percent in 2013.And private equity executives have also complained that asset prices have risen sharply in recent years, making prospective deals less attractive financially.In recent years, Blackstone’s private equity operations have ceded some prominence to the firm’s huge real estate division, which has struck deals for office buildings and other assets — including Hilton Hotels — around the world. That business took the spotlight last month when it agreed to buy the bulk of the real estate owned by General Electric’s finance arm.But deal makers have contended that private equity firms are still primed to undertake deals, citing both the roughly $466 billion in so-called dry powder sitting in leveraged buyout funds and prolonged low interest rates that make it easier to borrow money for takeovers.News of the Blackstone fund-raising effort was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.Advertisement
