At least three members of Volkswagen’s board said they were left in the dark about the company’s emissions cheating for two weeks after top executives admitted the deception to American environmental officials.During that period, the board was completing the terms of a contract extension for the automaker’s chief executive, Martin Winterkorn. He was pushed out five days after the use of the cheating device became public, though he insisted he had known nothing about it.The board members’ statements shed new light on flaws in the management structure and lines of communication at Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker. Volkswagen’s stock has lost about a third of its value since Sept. 18, when the cheating was made public by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.Volkswagen has admitted that some cars were programmed to disable their pollution controls unless the software detected that emission tests were being conducted. With the controls off, the vehicles had better acceleration and fuel economy, but emitted far higher levels of nitrogen oxide, a pollutant linked to lung ailments.
                Events leading up to, and in the weeks that followed, the admission by Volkswagen that it had deliberately designed its diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests.            If Mr. Winterkorn did not know about the communication with the American regulators, he was unaware of a fundamental threat to the company. If he was aware, he withheld significant information from members of his 20-member supervisory board.Advertisement“That they were not informed about a problem of this dimension, that points to a huge communications problem,” said Markus Kienle, a Frankfurt lawyer who is on the board of a shareholder-advocacy group known by its German initials SdK.AdvertisementMr. Winterkorn did not respond to requests for comment Thursday and Friday. A spokesman for Volkswagen declined to comment.Stephan Weil, a board member who is also prime minister of the German state Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is based, said he learned of the cheating while watching television news. Babette Fröhlich, another board member and an official with the IG Metall labor union, said she also learned of the scandal from the media. A third board member, Olaf Lies, the Lower Saxony economy minister, has said he was not informed by company officials and read about it online.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            The board’s executive committee, which includes Mr. Weil, had formally recommended to the full board the extension of Mr. Winterkorn’s contract by three years. That recommendation was made on Sept. 2, the day before Volkswagen officials told the E.P.A. about the emissions cheating.It was a “grave mistake” for Volkswagen executives to withhold information as long as they did, Mr. Weil said on Friday in a statement. He noted that American regulators had raised red flags about Volkswagen emissions in 2014. “Talks took place for a full year before Volkswagen admitted the deception,” Mr. Weil said. “This confession should clearly have occurred much earlier.”Critics of the company previously have said that top managers in Wolfsburg, Germany, where the company is based, hoarded power while discouraging open discussion of problems. Matthias Müller, Volkswagen’s new chief executive, has acknowledged the flaws and promised a more open style of management, although changing a company with 600,000 employees could take years.The consequences for Volkswagen have been severe. About 11 million cars have the illegal software, mostly in Europe and the United States, and recalling or repairing them is likely to cost billions of dollars. The company faces dozens of lawsuits on both continents from shareholders and customers. Volkswagen has suspended five high-ranking executives who were involved in motor development and is conducting an inquiry.After the Environmental Protection Agency made public its accusation on Friday, Sept. 18, Mr. Winterkorn acted to quell the crisis. That Sunday, and again the next Tuesday, he publicly apologized on behalf of the company. Those moves did not save him from the angry board. The next day he was out of a job.Advertisement“I am stunned that misconduct on such a scale was possible in the Volkswagen Group,” Mr. Winterkorn said in a statement accompanying his resignation. “I am not aware of any wrongdoing on my part.”Some outsiders expressed surprise that Mr. Winterkorn, known for his attention to detail, would have been unaware that E.P.A. officials had been asking for more than a year why Volkswagen diesel cars had far lower emissions in laboratory tests than on the road. “I find it very improbable,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen who follows Volkswagen closely. “He was always the one who wanted to know everything.”Volkswagen initially contested findings by independent researchers and the E.P.A. in 2014 that showed big discrepancies between the pollutants that its cars generated on the road compared to lab tests. Then, on Aug. 21, 2015, at a conference in Pacific Grove, Calif., organized by the University of California, Davis, a Volkswagen official informally mentioned to a senior E.P.A. official that the company had been deceiving regulators.The revelation surprised the official, Christopher Grundler, who runs the agency’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality. Standing next to him at the time was a regulator with the California Air Resources Board, according to an E.P.A. official who confirmed the events, earlier reported by Reuters.In a Sept. 3 conference call with officials from the E.P.A. and the state of California, company executives detailed how Volkswagen vehicles were programmed to trick emissions-testing equipment.An E.P.A. spokeswoman declined to identify the Volkswagen officials who have been in talks with the agency.Initially, as the scandal broke, Volkswagen’s board avoided criticizing Mr. Winterkorn. When he resigned, the executive committee said in a statement that it had “great respect” for him and that he “had no knowledge of the manipulation of emissions data.”
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            Subsequently, several members expressed displeasure with Mr. Winterkorn’s failure to keep them in the loop. Mr. Weil, the prime minister of Lower Saxony, complained about it in a speech last week to the state Parliament.AdvertisementVolkswagen is the largest company by far in the state and employs about 110,000 people there. The state government owns a 20 percent stake in Volkswagen, and by law has veto power over major decisions.Under German law, at least half of the seats on a company supervisory board are held by labor representatives. A spokesman for members of Volkswagen’s workers’ council, which is separate from the union and also has seats on the board, said he did not know how they learned of the emissions scandal and could not comment.At Volkswagen, four of the 20 board seats are held by descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, designer of the original Beetle. The family owns a majority of Volkswagen shares through a holding company. A spokesman for the holding company declined to comment.Volkswagen executives had a duty to inform the supervisory board of the emissions problem, said Ulrich Hocker, a Düsseldorf lawyer who is president of a shareholder advocacy group known by its German initials, D.S.W. But he said only the supervisory board would have legal standing to seek damages from Mr. Winterkorn, who has kept a low profile since leaving.Some shareholders have complained that Volkswagen did not follow German laws requiring it to publicize information that could affect the stock price.Mr. Hocker said shareholders are angry and want changes. “The whole company was run from Wolfsburg,” he said. “They have to get away from this centralized management.”A version of this article appears in print on October 24, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: 3 Directors Say VW Hid Deceit From the Board .
