Citing time lost to a tropical storm, the government of Puerto Rico on Saturday postponed by one week a plan for a “negotiated moratorium” on $72 billion of debt.Officials have been working on the plan since the end of June, when Gov. Alejandro García Padilla announced that Puerto Rico’s economic decline had become self-feeding, and said that without profound structural changes, the island would never be able to pay back its debt.He spoke in general terms about slowing Puerto Rico’s scheduled debt payments while sweeping economic changes took place.A detailed plan was to be completed by Sunday, but on Saturday evening the governor’s chief of staff, Víctor Suárez Meléndez, said it was not ready.“The government’s efforts in the past days have been focused on preparing for the possible impact of Tropical Storm Erika,” he said in a statement. The new due date is Sept. 8.A version of this article appears in print on August 31, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Citing Storm, Puerto Rico Delays Plan.
