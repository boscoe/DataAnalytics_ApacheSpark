CNBC announced Tuesday that it was abandoning Nielsen ratings for its daytime programming in favor of a research firm that will survey financial advisers and investment professionals to gauge the effectiveness of ad campaigns on the business news network.The network said its new partner, Cogent Reports, would measure the viewing of people who watched its Business Day programming outside of their homes — at the office or the gym, for instance — viewing that Nielsen did not measure. Cogent Reports’ research will focus on CNBC’s target audience of business professionals and affluent investors, who are more likely to pay attention to financial news.“Throughout our 25-year history, traditional measurement companies have struggled to capture CNBC’s audience of business executives, decision makers and affluent investors who watch our network from their corner offices, trading floors, five-star hotel rooms, country clubs, restaurants and health clubs,” Mark Hoffman, president of CNBC, said in a statement. “We are excited to begin to provide our marketing partners with a more complete understanding of the power and quality of our prestigious audience.”CNBC will continue to use Nielsen ratings for its evening programming.Nielsen said that television networks, especially those appealing to targeted groups, long had used alternative data sources. “For networks with niche audiences, like CNBC, pure age- and gender-based ratings are not always the best means against which to sell,” said Ben Billingsley, a Nielsen spokesman.The news comes as Nielsen is under assault by some television executives who have called the firm’s methodologies outdated. Philippe Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive, recently said that a large portion of viewing on Viacom networks on mobile apps, gaming devices and other digital outlets was not included in traditional Nielsen ratings.According to Nielsen data, CNBC drew an average of 137,000 total daytime viewers in 2014, up 5.4 percent from an average of 130,000 in 2013.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
