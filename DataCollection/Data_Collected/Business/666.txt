DETROIT —  After soundly rejecting an earlier proposal, union workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles overwhelmingly ratified a four-year agreement that brings the wages of entry-level workers into line with those of veteran employees, the union announced on Thursday.The United Automobile Workers will now take the contract across town to General Motors, which is on better financial footing but does not have a work force as divided between senior and entry-level workers as Fiat Chrysler’s.The deal with Fiat Chrysler, which covers 36,000 hourly workers and about 4,000 salaried workers, passed with the support of 77 percent of the employees, the union said. The first proposal was rejected by 65 percent of the workers.In a statement, Dennis Williams, president of the union, praised the agreement with Fiat Chrysler as one “that affords U.A.W. members a strong wage package and job security while still allowing the company to competitively produce high-quality vehicles for our customers.”AdvertisementThe new agreement was announced on Oct. 8, averting a strike.Fiat Chrysler said the contract would allow it to move forward with new investments and meet its production goals. “This agreement represents an investment in our U.S. work force and recognizes its contributions to the company’s growth over the past six years,” the company said in a statement.AdvertisementThe hallmark of the agreement is a provision that overcame the biggest sticking point in the negotiations, allowing entry-level employees to effectively achieve wage parity with veteran workers.More than 40 percent of Fiat Chrysler workers are entry level. Under the old contract, they earned from $16 to $19 an hour, while senior workers earned $28. Under the new agreement, those entry-level workers will earn about $29 an hour after eight years, and veteran workers will increase their pay to almost $30 an hour.The previous proposal that was so roundly rejected capped entry-level pay at about $25 an hour.The ratified contract also gives entry-level workers $3,000 signing bonuses — a provision included in the first agreement, and $4,000 bonuses for senior workers — a $1,000 increase over the first deal.
                Prodded by its union, the auto industry served as the 20th-century trailblazer in spreading prosperity. But the model of a “social contract” has begun to unravel.            And in a significant change, the new contract omitted a provision for a health care cooperative aimed at lowering the medical costs of hourly and salaried employees. Some workers had been concerned that the component would hurt their benefits.Even with these changes, the more aggressive move against the two-tier system is what led many workers to support the deal.“The big thing for me is the clear path to traditional wages, which I think a lot of people were looking for,” said Scott McGinnis, an entry-level assembly plant worker in Sterling Heights, Mich., who voted against the previous agreement.Now, the union and G.M. will face a new set of challenges as they seek an agreement, though the hurdles are not seen to be as high as they were with Fiat Chrysler.AdvertisementWhen the union selected Fiat Chrysler in September to set the contract template for negotiations with Ford and G.M., there was widespread puzzlement. After all, Fiat Chrysler was smaller and poorer than its rivals, and employed significantly more workers in the two-tier wage system, an increasing source of discontent among workers.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But G.M. has not had a prominent move to Mexico yet, Ms. Dziczek noted.And at G.M., only about 20 percent of its more than 50,000 workers are entry level; Fiat Chrysler has more than twice that percentage.
                Chrysler, founded in 1925, has had a tumultuous history as the third-largest of Detroit’s auto companies.            “The F.C.A. contract was designed to make it more attractive to people who thought they were getting a raw deal, the Tier 2 workers,” Ms. Dziczek said. “That doesn’t affect as many workers at G.M.”In addition, compared with Fiat Chrysler, G.M. is in a much stronger financial state. In negotiations past, the specter of plant closings dominated contract talks. These days, G.M. is in a different place. Just Thursday, for example, the automaker announced plans to add 1,200 jobs and a second shift to the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant in Detroit. It also reported this week that it had made a pretax profit of $8.3 billion in North America in the first nine months of the year.That solid footing could prove to be G.M.’s biggest bargaining challenge, experts said.“This is a company that just posted a very strong profitability,” Ms. Dziczek said. “The company’s just not in as precarious a position.” She added that could lead workers to expect G.M.’s contract to exceed Fiat Chrysler’s.Sean Crawford, an entry-level worker at Lake Orion Assembly in Michigan, is among those workers with rising expectations.“G.M. is more profitable than it’s ever been,” he said. “We’ve been killing ourselves on the floor, while G.M.’s raking in billions. We need something better.”AdvertisementAt the same time, the U.A.W. will take lessons learned at Fiat Chrysler to General Motors. After the first proposal’s stunning defeat, the union took several steps to better communicate with workers, including increasing its presence on social media platforms.“I think transparency has been a lot better this time, in terms of communication with the people,” said Mr. McGinnis, the assembly plant worker.Vernita Glover, an entry-level worker at the Sterling Heights assembly plant, who said she had voted against the initial contract, partly because she did not understand some of the plan’s provisions, also cited the improved communication.“Digital-wise they kept us updated, and that eased everybody’s minds as far as questions and answers,” she said. “On websites, Facebook and other places, they really got involved and kept their members informed.”A version of this article appears in print on October 23, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: This Time, Fiat Chrysler Workers Approve Contract .
