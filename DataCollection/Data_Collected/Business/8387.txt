Mulligan, to the newly created role of chief operating officer. Mr. Mulligan, who is also an executive vice president, will assume the oversight of stores, supply chain and properties as the retailer continues to reshape its management team. Cathy Smith, who was previously chief financial officer at Express Scripts, a position she left in December, was named to succeed Mr. Mulligan. Ms. Smith has also served as chief finance officer of Walmart International. Since taking over a year ago, Brian Cornell, Target’s chairman and chief executive, has been trying to reinvent the company as a more nimble force in the face of increasing competition. Mr. Cornell is investing in e-commerce and expanding Target’s small-format stores as it tries to reclaim its position as a “cheap chic” retailer. Mr. Mulligan joined Target in 1996 as a financial analyst. He has been the finance chief since 2012. From May until August of last year, he served as interim chief after the abrupt departure of Gregg Steinhafel following a major credit card breach and a botched foray into Canada. Advertisement
