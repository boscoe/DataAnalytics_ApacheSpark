FRANKFURT — Volkswagen acknowledged on Wednesday that its former chief executive was given a memo in May 2014 that contained information about irregularities in the emissions of its diesel cars, well over a year before the company publicly admitted cheating on pollution tests.But in its first detailed chronology of the months leading up to that public admission last September, Volkswagen said it did not know whether Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive who resigned after the diesel scandal, had actually read the memo. The company said the memo was included in his “extensive” weekend reading in May 2014.In offering that description of events, the company said in a news release on Wednesday that whether or not Mr. Winterkorn had read the document, senior Volkswagen management did not realize the gravity of the diesel emission problem and the potential financial impact until much later.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            And so, Volkswagen indicated on Wednesday, the company had fulfilled its legal duty to inform shareholders when it eventually admitted last September that many of its diesel engines had been equipped with software enabling the cars to cheat on emissions tests.AdvertisementThe statement, meant to counter shareholder lawsuits, confirms information reported by the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag and later by The New York Times based on internal documents. Volkswagen said the memo to Mr. Winterkorn in May 2014 and other company communications had been misinterpreted in media reports. The documents do not prove that top management was aware of illegal activity until last September, the company said.AdvertisementIn addition to fines in the United States that are likely to run into the billions of dollars, Volkswagen faces lawsuits from shareholders who say the company broke German law by not informing them of the diesel problem sooner. Company shares have lost a third of their value since the emissions cheating became public.“After careful examination by internal and external legal experts, the company confirms its belief that its management board duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law,” Volkswagen said on Wednesday.The company also said in Wednesday’s statement that no one on the company’s management board took part in the decision a decade ago to illegally modify software, in 11 million cars, to fool regulators by turning up pollution controls during official tests. At other times the cars emitted far more nitrogen oxides than allowed.The so-called defeat device was the work of employees in the department designing a new engine, who were unable to meet United States emissions regulations with the amount of development money they had been allocated, Volkswagen said.
            VW’s emissions cheating is said to have begun in 2005.        According to the chronology disclosed by Volkswagen on Wednesday, Mr. Winterkorn received another memo about the diesel issue in November 2014, by which time Volkswagen was negotiating with the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States about how to bring emissions into compliance.“The diesel issue, as it was treated as one of many product issues facing the company, did not initially receive particular attention at the management levels of Volkswagen,” the company said.In July 2015, Volkswagen employees discussed the diesel situation on the periphery of a meeting about product issues in the presence of Mr. Winterkorn and Herbert Diess, the executive in charge of Volkswagen brand cars. But it is not clear whether they understood that Volkswagen software had been illegally modified, the company said.In August 2015, Volkswagen technicians provided information to a member of the management board, who was not named, indicating that the diesel cars were equipped with illegal software. Volkswagen confessed to regulators on Sept. 3 of last year, and Mr. Winterkorn was informed by a memo dated Sept. 4, the company said.Advertisement“For global automobile manufacturers, service measures and recall campaigns are nothing out of the ordinary,” the company said. “Volkswagen expressly regrets that, looking back, the situation is different.”A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: A VW Memo in 2014 Told  of Its Emissions Problems.
