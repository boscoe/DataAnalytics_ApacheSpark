LONDON — Lower petroleum prices are shaking up the plans and bottom lines of the world’s biggest oil companies, and Royal Dutch Shell is the latest to show the effects.On Thursday, the company reported a loss of $7.4 billion for the third quarter, in contrast to a profit of $4.5 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Adjusted for inventory changes and one-time items, a more closely watched measurement, earnings fell 70 percent to $1.8 billion.The company took about $7.9 billion in write-offs for operations including its recently halted exploration venture off Alaska and a canceled heavy-oil project in Canada.Like others in the oil industry, the company, based in The Hague, is grappling with its biggest challenges in decades. Not only must Shell and other companies adapt to the deep and potentially protracted slump in oil and gas prices, but they are also searching for an adequate response to global concerns about the role that petroleum fuels play in climate change.AdvertisementShell’s earnings from oil and gas extraction were pulled down by petroleum prices that in the third quarter averaged about 50 percent below what they were a year earlier. The company is beginning to take large write-offs as it cancels projects that no longer make economic sense in the current price environment. Shell also wrote off an additional $3.7 billion, including $2.3 billion on North American shale gas properties, because of downward revisions of the long-term outlook for the prices of gas and oil, the company said.AdvertisementBen van Beurden, who became Shell’s chief executive in 2014, has been reviewing the company’s investment plans and shelving some of its riskier and more costly efforts.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            On Tuesday, for example, Shell said it was halting construction of an expensive oil sands project called Carmon Creek in the Canadian province of Alberta.Carmon Creek was intended to produce 80,000 barrels of oil a day, a substantial amount, by heating heavy oil underground and pumping it out, a process that requires large amounts of capital upfront but then usually produces oil for decades. Shell said it would take a $2 billion write-down on the project.“We are making changes to Shell’s portfolio mix by reviewing our longer-term upstream options worldwide, and managing affordability and exposure in the current world of lower oil prices,” Mr. van Beurden said in a statement on Tuesday. “This is forcing tough choices at Shell.”Analysts say that Mr. van Beurden is trying to clean up mistakes by his predecessors and that doing so could allow Shell to focus on its strengths in liquefied natural gas and deepwater oil projects.“Getting out of previous strategic missteps (Alaska, shale, more oil sands) via the impairments is a necessary evil,” Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in London, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Late last month, Shell ended its expensive and ultimately fruitless nine-year effort to explore for oil in the Alaskan Arctic, a $7 billion investment that Shell had pursued despite strong opposition from environmental activists. The company had long insisted that the offshore promise of Alaska made it worthwhile to bear the disapproval of environmental groups and to incur the huge costs of operating in the difficult Arctic environment.AdvertisementIn a conference call with journalists on Thursday, Mr. van Beurden said the well that Shell drilled in the Chukchi Sea this summer was “a dry hole” and “a major disappointment,” but that it was “very conclusive” and made further expensive drilling unnecessary. He added the company was “demobilizing” its fleet of drill ships and support vessels there and winding down the operation.Mr. van Beurden also criticized the licensing process in the United States, saying that the American authorities “should simplify and modify the permitting process” if they have the ambition to further develop oil in the area. On Thursday, Shell said it was taking $2.6 billion in write-offs for Alaska.But the biggest problem for Shell, like other oil companies, is making money from what traditionally has been the core business: finding, producing and selling oil and gas. Even without the big write-offs, Shell’s exploration and production unit lost $425 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $4.3 billion a year earlier.Simon Henry, Shell’s chief financial officer, said on Thursday in the conference call that the company’s break-even price for oil was about $60 a barrel. Prices for Brent crude have been hovering around $48 a barrel.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Italian company Eni said on Thursday that its adjusted operating profit fell by 75 percent to 750 million euros, or $828 million.Some companies are proving more resilient than others. The French company Total reported on Thursday that its adjusted net income for the quarter fell by a more modest 23 percent to $2.8 billion, largely because of a strong performance at its refining and chemicals units.A version of this article appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Hurt by Low Oil Prices and $7.9 Billion in Write-Offs, Royal Dutch Shell Posts a Loss.
