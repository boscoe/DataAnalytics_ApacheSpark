It also would seek to become a “simpler and more integrated group” by assuming direct control of its operations in Eastern Europe.The lender said it would exit or revamp several underperforming businesses, including its retail banking operations in Austria and its leasing business in Italy, by the end of 2016. As part of its reshaping, the bank said it would invest €1.2 billion in digital upgrades.UniCredit is the latest European lender to announce a major overhaul of its operations as banks across Europe are having to hold more capital to meet stricter regulatory requirements.UniCredit has faced pressure from investors about the speed of its turnaround and concerns that regulators might force it to raise additional capital. The bank posted a loss of €15 billion in fourth quarter 2013 as it cleaned up its balance sheet two years ago.Several lenders, including Credit Suisse and Standard Chartered, have also announced plans this year to raise capital alongside job cuts.The strategy update came as UniCredit reported that its profit declined nearly 30 percent to €507 million in the third quarter, from €722 million in the same period a year earlier.“We aim at these goals in a persistently tough macroeconomic environment, marked by historically low interest rates and decelerating worldwide economic growth,” Federico Ghizzoni, the UniCredit chief executive, said in a news release.“The plan is rigorous and at the same time ambitious,” he added. “Above all, it is a realistic plan, as it is based on our managerial decisions and it is a totally self-financed plan. Therefore, we are fully confident of its successful execution.”Shares of UniCredit rose about 1.7 percent to €6.02 in afternoon trading in Milan.The planned job cuts represent about 14 percent of UniCredit’s work force of about 126,800 employees.UniCredit said that about 6,000 of the job losses would come from the sale of its Ukraine unit and a planned joint venture between its Pioneer Investments unit and the asset management arm of Banco Santander of Spain. It also will cut jobs in Austria, Germany and Italy.The bank revised several of its financial goals on Wednesday, saying it was aiming for an annual profit of €5.3 billion and a return on tangible equity, a measure of profitability, of 11 percent by 2018.In the third quarter, net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined 6.3 percent at UniCredit to €2.93 billion, from €3.12 billion in the same period a year earlier.The bank’s operating costs rose 1.6 percent to €3.38 billion in the period, from €3.33 billion in the third quarter of 2014.Impairments for loans continued to drag on its results, increasing by a third to €1.01 billion in the third quarter, from €754 million in the same period a year earlier.Advertisement
