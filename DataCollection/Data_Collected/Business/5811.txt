LONDON — The Swiss bank UBS said on Tuesday that its first-quarter profit rose 88 percent on gains in its investment bank and its wealth management business amid a sharp increase in the value of the Swiss franc.For the three months ended March 31, UBS said profit rose to 1.98 billion Swiss francs, or about $2.1 billion, from 1.05 billion francs in the first quarter of 2014. The results exceeded analysts’ expectations, according to Reuters.In January, the Swiss National Bank abruptly abandoned a cap on the Swiss franc against the euro, causing the value of the franc to surge.Volatility in currencies, combined with negative interest rates in parts of Europe, had been expected to affect the results of larger Swiss lenders, such as UBS, which conducts its business in a variety of currencies but reports its results in francs.AdvertisementUBS and its rival Credit Suisse both reported stronger quarterly results, benefiting from an uptick in market activity, particularly increased foreign exchange transactions by clients.Advertisement“I’m pleased with the strong quarter. We stayed close to our clients, we stayed disciplined on risk and we delivered across all businesses and regions,” Sergio P. Ermotti, the chief executive of UBS, said in a news release. “The results again demonstrate the benefits of a strategy defined early and executed with a focus on long-term value creation.”UBS said that its adjusted pretax profit, which excluded items like gains on sales of real estate that the bank’s management says are not representative of the underlying performance of its business, was 2.27 billion francs.After a government rescue in 2008, UBS has aggressively cut costs and shed riskier debt in recent years in order to meet stricter Swiss regulations and to better prepare the bank to weather future financial upheavals. In the process, it shrank its investment bank and shifted its focus to wealth management, an area it sees as more consistently profitable.In the wealth management division, the bank said that its pretax profit rose 54 percent, to 951 million francs in the first quarter. That business in the Americas, which is operated separately, had its pretax profit decline 1 percent, to $268 million in the quarter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
