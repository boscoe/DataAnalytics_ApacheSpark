The recall covers 206,000 CX-9 S.U.V.s from the 2007-14 model years, mainly in the United States and Canada. The company said in documents posted on Wednesday by federal safety regulators that front ball joints could rust from water leaks and separate from the suspension. Ball joints allow the wheels to pivot when the steering wheel is turned. Owners will be notified by letter, starting in September. Dealers will replace suspension parts on both sides. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the problem in June. Mazda said on Wednesday that it had no reports of crashes or injuries from the problem. In documents filed with N.H.T.S.A., Mazda said it first learned about the problem in May 2012 and began investigating. It fixed the problem at the factory in January 2014 but decided not to do a recall because the ball joints did not separate suddenly and owners would be warned by front-end noise. But N.H.T.S.A. opened its investigation after receiving 16 complaints about the problem. Mazda said it decided to issue the recall because in some of the complaints, the failure happened suddenly.
