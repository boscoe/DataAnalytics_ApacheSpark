The chain’s same-store sales, a closely watched performance gauge for retailers, were up just 1.3 percent for the quarter ended July 5, far less than the 2.8 percent gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Those sales rose 3.6 percent in the second quarter and grew 4.5 percent in the first quarter. The rapid deceleration is troubling for investors, who have wondered how long Whole Foods can maintain its grip on the specialty grocery category it pioneered and helped take mainstream. Third-quarter net income increased 2 percent to $154 million, or 43 cents a share. That missed Wall Street’s estimate of 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement
