But the health agency said it would probably keep its recommendations the same, namely that consumers take simple steps, likeopening windows for a few minutes every day, to reduce their exposure. The C.D.C. said that in its original report it had used an incorrect value for ceiling height, resulting in health risks that werelower than they should have been. It now estimates the risk of cancer at six to 30 cases per 100,000 people, as opposed to two to nine cases per 100,000 people. Lumber Liquidators said in a statement on Monday that it had strengthened its “quality assurance procedures.”Advertisement
