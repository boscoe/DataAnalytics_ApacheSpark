The government, which owned as much as 40 percent of Lloyds after the bailout, now holds just under 14 percent.Royal Bank of Scotland has had a rockier road to private ownership. In February, the bank reported its seventh consecutive annual loss.After the loss, R.B.S., based in Edinburgh, announced plans to dismantle its global investment bank and to shrink the number of countries where it operates as it shifts to being a British-focused retail and corporate bank.The lender’s second-quarter results showed positive signs as profit rose 27 percent, exceeding analysts’ expectations.The bank also recorded restructuring charges of £1.05 billion related to its overhaul in the quarter and said it was not likely to begin to return capital to investors through share buybacks and dividends before the first quarter of 2017.Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS are acting as the lead underwriters for the R.B.S. offering.Advertisement
