To the Editor:Re: “The Great Obama Bull Market” (Strategies, by Jeff Sommer, Aug. 21):The stock market has soared under President Obama largely because of purposeful financial engineering or, as Richard Fisher, the retired president of the Dallas Fed, famously noted, an injection of “cocaine and heroin into the system.”The Federal Reserve dropped rates to near zero virtually concurrent with Mr. Obama’s inauguration, as noted, and has kept them “extraordinarily accommodative” for his entire tenure. Lower rates raise asset values, inflating stock prices and real estate.Yet the economy remains tepid and the net effect of Fed policy was to make the rich richer and put housing prices beyond the reach of many first-time buyers — certainly a perverse outcome for a president opposed to growing income inequality.Ken Broad Mill Valley, Calif., Aug. 23Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.comA version of this article appears in print on August 28, 2016, on Page BU4 of the New York edition with the headline: Letters.
