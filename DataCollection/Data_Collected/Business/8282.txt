Macy’s earned $217 million, or 64 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Aug. 1. That compares with $292 million, or 80 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue fell 2.6 percent, to $6.1 billion, from $6.26 billion. The company, whose shares fell 4 percent, also said it formed a joint venture in China, Macy’s China, that will start by selling products on the Tmall Global marketplace, which is owned by Alibaba. Karen M. Hoguet, the company’s chief financial officer, said earnings in the quarter were below the company’s expectations as consumers spent more on restaurants, recreational services, health care and electronics rather than general merchandise, apparel and furnishings.
