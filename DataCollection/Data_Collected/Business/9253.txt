It said in a regulatory filing on Monday that many of the reductions would come through attrition. It also said it expected workers whose jobs were cut would get other jobs in the company or find new ones being created by over 100 new stores in development. It has been facing intense competition as organic offerings become more widely available. It is planning to open a chain of lower-priced “365” stores. Advertisement
