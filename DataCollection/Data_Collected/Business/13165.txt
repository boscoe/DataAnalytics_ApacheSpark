WASHINGTON — Retail sales in the United States unexpectedly fell in March as households cut back on purchases of automobiles and other items. In another surprise in economic data released on Wednesday, producer prices dropped last month as rising energy prices were offset by a decline in the cost of services.The Commerce Department said retail sales declined 0.3 percent last month, confounding economists’ expectations for a 0.1 percent gain. They were unchanged in February.

Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services ticked up 0.1 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in February. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity.The weak retail sales report for March added to recent data on trade, wholesale inventories and business spending in suggesting the economy hit a soft patch in the first three months of the year.

That was reinforced by a second report from the Commerce Department showing a 0.1 percent dip in business inventories in February, matching the decline in January.AdvertisementAlso on Wednesday, the Labor Department said its producer price index slipped 0.1 percent last month after dropping 0.2 percent in February. In the 12 months through March, the index dipped 0.1 percent after being unchanged in February.

Retail sales remained lackluster despite a strengthening labor market, which is starting to lift wages. Part of the weakness could be caused by a stock market sell-off that hurt consumer sentiment early this year. The value of sales is also being restrained by low prices, as retailers offer huge discounts to clear unwanted merchandise clogging up warehouses.AdvertisementAuto sales dropped 2.1 percent last month, the largest decrease in just over a year, after being unchanged in February. Households are buying fewer automobiles after record purchases last year.Receipts at service stations rose 0.9 percent in March, the biggest gain since June, as gasoline prices increased.Other data in the report were generally mixed. Receipts at clothing stores and online retailers fell. Sales at restaurants and bars were also weak. But Americans spent more on sporting goods and hobbies, as well as on electronics and appliances. Building materials and garden equipment store receipts increased sharply.A version of this list appears in print on April 14, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Retail Sales Fell Unexpectedly in March.
