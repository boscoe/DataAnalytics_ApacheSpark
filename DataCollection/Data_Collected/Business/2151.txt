StewartIf only there were more lumps of coal in Christmas stockings.That might be the last, fanciful hope for the coal industry, which is in an epic crisis threatening to send even the largest coal companies into bankruptcy. “We’re looking at the end game for a lot of producers,” said Jorge Beristain, head of Americas metals and mining equity research for Deutsche Bank, who titled his latest report on coal “The Hour of Reckoning.”Since I spotlighted the plight of the coal industry last summer, things have gone “from bad to worse,” Mr. Beristain said.The Paris climate accord struck this month will most likely accelerate moves toward zero-carbon energy sources like wind and solar and away from oil and coal, putting yet another stake into the heart of the industry. In September, California followed Norway in requiring its two giant pension funds, Calpers and Calstrs, to divest their coal holdings. This month, Donald L. Blankenship, the former chief executive of the now-bankrupt Massey Energy, became the most prominent American coal executive ever convicted of a crime related to mining deaths.“There’s been a social backlash against coal,” Mr. Beristain said. “It’s gotten ugly.”In addition to a backlash, coal faces a collapse in prices and demand driven largely by cheap natural gas, which hit a 16-year low of $1.65 per million British thermal units on Dec. 15. “Coal is facing a maelstrom of competition,” said Anthony Young, a mining analyst at Macquarie Group, pointing to natural gas and renewables, which are rapidly gaining market share as utilities abandon inefficient, aging coal-fired plants. “Once the utilities switch, they’re never going back.”The stock prices for the two biggest remaining public coal producers — Arch Coal and Peabody Energy — suggest bankruptcy could be imminent. Both companies did reverse stock splits (reducing the number of shares to create a higher-value security) — Arch a one-for-10 reverse split in August, and Peabody a one-for-15 reverse split in October. But after spiking to over $9, Arch shares were again trading below $1 this week (or a pre-split price of less than 10 cents a share). Peabody shares jumped to $26, but were selling for $8.50 this week (or 57 cents a share pre-split).Apart from a few politicians in coal-producing states and mining-industry workers and executives, no one is exactly mourning the industry’s plight. Big pension funds and endowments are still jettisoning their stocks and environmentalists and student activists are keeping up the pressure. “Coal,” Mr. Beristain said, “has been tarred and feathered.”For Steven H. Davis, the former chairman of global law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, this will be the first holiday season since the firm’s 2012 collapse that he can celebrate without threat of a jail term hanging over his head.In October, a Manhattan jury acquitted him and two co-defendants of dozens of felony charges but deadlocked on others. During the four-and-a-half-month trial, no one testified that Mr. Davis knew about any of the questionable accounting maneuvers, let alone that he orchestrated them. Jurors were asked by prosecutors to infer that comments by Mr. Davis that the firm needed to meet its loan obligations, which seem innocuous on their face, were actually “a command to commit fraud.”That seems a stretch, as I noted in an earlier column.The jury’s preliminary vote on the most serious felony charges against Mr. Davis was 11-1 in favor of acquittal, according to jurors I interviewed.In light of the outcome, and after prosecutors reviewed the case, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., indicated he would dispose of Mr. Davis’s case with a deferred prosecution agreement. Charges will be dropped as long as Mr. Davis meets certain conditions. He won’t have to plead guilty or face automatic disbarment.Prosecutors have been criticized by many for failing to pursue more white-collar criminal cases after the financial crisis. But they have a higher duty to seek justice and not pursue unsubstantiated charges that garner favorable headlines but can ruin lives and careers. Mr. Davis has been out of work since he was indicted.Mr. Davis’s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, said Mr. Vance and his prosecutors “reviewed the evidence and concluded he shouldn’t be retried. To the credit of the office, they decided to do the right thing rather than stubbornly going ahead.”If my experience is any indication, travelers hoping for lower airfares and more travel options this holiday season have been sorely disappointed.I postponed a trip to Houston next week to visit family when I encountered fares that topped $1,000 for a coach seat — on a flight that departed New York at 5:40 a.m.The industry “discipline” I highlighted in June — which seems to be the code word for limiting flights and keeping prices high — certainly seems to be paying off for the airlines: They’re heading for record profits this year.The International Air Transport Association, the airline trade group, said this month that North American airlines would earn a record $33 billion this year, and even more — $36.3 billion — next year.Given plunging fuel prices, not to mention a Justice Department antitrust investigation that began soon after my column appeared, you would think airlines would be competing more aggressively. After all, high profits go hand-in-hand with a lack of competition.The air transport association attributed the record profitability in part to lower fuel prices. But in a competitive industry, those savings would be passed on to customers in the form of lower prices and better service — not fatter profit margins.The record profits “show that the airlines’ anti-consumer strategy is working for them, but not for fliers,” said Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic senator from Connecticut, who called for an antitrust investigation of the industry last summer.“Their fuel costs are dropping, their rationale for added charges like baggage fees has evaporated, but consumers are seeing no benefits in lower fares,” he said, adding that the airlines may be “overplaying their hand. They’re creating a very powerful case for the Department of Justice to take action.”Have you been to McDonald’s lately?This week I revisited the Upper East Side outpost where I had lunch with the celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian last January, and barely recognized it. It had gotten the makeover McDonald’s is rolling out across the country. Gone was the garish lighting and bright yellow and red décor. Except for the exuberant holiday crowd, the soothing atmosphere and subdued color scheme might have passed for a New Age spa.But what about the food? In January, after one bite of a tasteless chicken wrap and a squishy cheeseburger bun, Mr. Zakarian wryly noted, “The food could be better.”Heidi Barker, a McDonald’s spokeswoman, told me this week that the chain had taken up Mr. Zakarian’s challenge. “Steve Easterbrook, our C.E.O., has made it clear that as a brand and a business we have to do better. And that means better-tasting food. Better ingredients. We want changes that people will notice.”In March, McDonald’s said it would phase out the use of chickens injected with antibiotics and use milk only from cows not treated with hormones. In September, it said it would use only eggs from cage-free hens. It’s offering breakfast throughout the day. New menu items include an “artisan” grilled chicken sandwich, a buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich (using real buttermilk, Ms. Barker stressed) and even a lobster roll during the summer months. Gone are the wan chicken wraps that had visibly pained Mr. Zakarian.Consumers and investors have taken notice. In October, McDonalds said same-store sales rose 0.9 percent — the first increase in same-store comparisons in two years. After dropping below $90 in January, shares of McDonald’s were trading this week at over $118 — up over 30 percent in a flat-to-down year for the overall market.On my latest visit, the lines were chaotic, but once I reached the register, the server was a model of patience and courtesy. The new crispy chicken sandwich was vastly better than anything I tasted on my last visit. And the bun easily passed the squish test. It called to mind the toasted challah bun used for the famous cheeseburger at the Lambs Club, the upscale Midtown restaurant co-owned by Mr. Zakarian.Advertisement
