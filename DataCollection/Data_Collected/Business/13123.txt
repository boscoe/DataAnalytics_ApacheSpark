Since then, GE Capital has entered into agreements for sales worth about $165 billion.GE Money Bank said that it planned to sell a majority of its shares in an offering to institutional investors, although it did not give a time frame. The bank had a tangible equity value of 27.3 billion Czech korunas, or about $1.2 billion, at the end of 2015.“An I.P.O. of GE Money Bank to institutional investors will mark another milestone toward achieving G.E.’s objective of reducing its financial services assets, in line with the broader strategy of focusing on investment and growth in its technology and industrial businesses,” Richard A. Laxer, the president and chief executive of GE Capital International, said in a news release.The bank, based in Prague, has 229 branches and 629 A.T.M.s in the Czech Republic, and it serves 1.17 million retail and commercial customers, representing more than 11 percent of the Czech population. The company posted a profit of 4.5 million korunas in 2015.As part of its separation from GE Capital, the bank will most likely be rebranded, it said.GE Money Bank said that GE Capital was committed to retaining a significant minority stake in the company for at least six months, under the terms of a proposed lockup agreement. The stake would be reduced over time, as the bank transitions to full independence.Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase are serving as joint global coordinators on the offering.Advertisement
