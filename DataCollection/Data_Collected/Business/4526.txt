Michael Oreskes, a former senior editor at The New York Times and The Associated Press, has been appointed senior vice president and editorial director at NPR, the public broadcaster announced on Thursday.Mr. Oreskes was most recently a vice president and senior managing editor at The A.P. Before that he was executive editor of The International Herald Tribune, and a deputy managing editor at The Times.He will start his new job at the end of April, working with 200 newsrooms and 1,500 journalists at NPR member stations, the network said in a statement.Jarl Mohn, the president and chief executive of NPR, said Mr. Oreskes brought “a unique perspective on how to cover the most important stories of the day and an understanding of the issues that are being overlooked or not reported well.”News organizations like NPR, Mr. Oreskes said, can build “audience by grabbing their attention with stories told in creative new ways.”NPR, which has been lauded for its efforts to expand on the web, has 26 million radio listeners and more than 30 million unique visitors a month online, according to its own figures.An earlier version of this article, and an accompanying picture caption, misstated part of Mr. Oreskes’s role at NPR. He will supervise NPR’s news operation, but not the news operations of its member stations.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
