Sarvary would resign both as chief executive and as a director. Both the chairman, P. Andrews McLane, and the head of the board’s corporate governance committee, Christopher A. Masto, will resign as well.The company has chosen a new chairman, Francis A. Doyle, and will search for a new chief executive.Tempur Sealy’s moves were prompted after shareholders backed a campaign by H Partners, a hedge fund that this year challenged the governance of the company. The campaign was part of the wave of shareholder activism that has swept over corporate America, as investors call for huge changes in both management and strategy.Those investors have succeeded in changing the courses of companies like Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden, and Sotheby’s, the famed auction house. Another prominent challenge, at DuPont, is set to come to a head on Wednesday at the company’s annual meeting.As recognition of H Partners’ victory, Tempur Sealy gave Usman Nabi, a senior partner at H Partners, a board seat and oversight over the search for a new chief executive. (The mattress maker’s chief operating officer, W. Timothy Yaggi, will serve as interim chief executive until a permanent replacement is found.)“Mr. Nabi brings a strong record of shareholder value creation, including expertise in C.E.O. recruitment and compensation structuring,” Mr. Doyle said in a statement. “We are committed to working together for the long-term success of Tempur Sealy.”The company will also set up what it calls a stockholder liaison committee, which will be charged with improving communications between its board and its investors.Advertisement
