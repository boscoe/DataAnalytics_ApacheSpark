In September, Expedia closed its acquisition of a fellow travel site, Orbitz Worldwide, for $1.6 billion including debt. Also this year, Expedia purchased Travelocity from Sabre Corporation for $280 million in cash. Other brands under the Expedia umbrella include Hotels.com, Hotwire.com and Trivago.But Expedia said in a call on Tuesday that this acquisition would be different from others it has done because HomeAway would be run almost autonomously out of Austin, Tex.In conjunction with the deal announcement, HomeAway said it was changing its business model to charge travelers a fee, based on a sliding scale. The company did not disclose details but said it was expected to add an average of 6 percent to most transactions. Traditionally, HomeAway generated revenue by charging property owners to list their rentals. HomeAway also plans to lower commission rates for these pay-per-booking customers.HomeAway has recently existed largely in the shadow of Airbnb, even though their businesses are somewhat different. Airbnb has attracted much attention because it is one of the most highly valued private companies, most recently valued by investors at $20 billion. Airbnb allows people to rent out their homes or apartments on a short-term basis, while HomeAway focuses on vacation rentals.The acquisition will give HomeAway distribution, technology and expertise from Expedia, Brian Sharples, the chief executive of HomeAway, said in a statement.The companies expect the transaction to close during the first quarter of 2016. Stocks of both HomeAway and Expedia increased in after-hours trading.HomeAway also said on Wednesday that revenue increased 11.6 percent in the third quarter, to $130.7 million, from the same period a year ago.Advertisement
