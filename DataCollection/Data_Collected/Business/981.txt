Stanley F. Druckenmiller, the hedge fund titan and founder of Duquesne Capital, is not optimistic about much these days.The investor who led George Soros’s bold bet against the British pound in 1992, Mr. Druckenmiller is worried about the Federal Reserve and its “emergency measures” of quantitative easing. He is worried about the stock market entering a bear market. And he thinks we are in a bubble of sorts.Speaking on Tuesday at the DealBook conference at the Whitney Museum of American Art, Mr. Druckenmiller praised the Fed for responding quickly to the financial crisis of 2008 but said its emergency measures of pumping trillions of dollars into the financial system by buying back bonds and keeping interest rates low had gone on too long.“You’re pulling demand forward today, this is not some permanent boost. You’re borrowing from the future,” Mr. Druckenmiller said. “The chickens will come home to roost,” warned Mr. Druckenmiller, who has been a frequent and vocal critic of the Fed and its policy of near-zero interest rates.AdvertisementMr. Druckenmiller, who stopped managing investor money for his hedge fund in 2010, also provided a glimpse into some of his current positions, telling the audience that he was shorting the euro and bracing for a bear market, which he said began in May of this year.“I can see myself getting very bearish, I can’t see myself getting bullish,” he said. Mr. Druckenmiller also told the audience that some of his best returns had been in “great periods of chaos.”AdvertisementDespite the downbeat message, Mr. Druckenmiller said there was one thing he was optimistic about.“My future,” he said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
