The bank’s co-chief executives, Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen, scheduled a news conference for Monday to present more details.Pressure from regulators has made it more difficult for Deutsche Bank to reconcile risky investment banking activities with the steadier but less profitable business of taking deposits and writing loans, leading to the decision to spin off Postbank, which it acquired in 2008. Deutsche Bank has been constrained by perceptions that the investment banking business, based in London and New York, risked the savings of ordinary Germans.Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.Deutsche Bank is under additional pressure after agreeing on Thursday to pay a $2.5 billion penalty to settle accusations it was among banks that manipulated the benchmarks used to set rates on trillions of dollars in loans. The fine was the highest so far of any banks accused in the case, which covers misconduct that took place from 2005 to 2011While no top executives of Deutsche Bank were accused of being directly involved in the rate fixing, United States and British authorities criticized what they said were lax internal controls and failure to heed warnings that misconduct was taking place. Officials also portrayed Deutsche Bank as suffering from organizational chaos that hampered efforts to collect evidence.One motivation for splitting up Deutsche Bank would be to streamline the organization and make it easier to manage. The bank said Friday that it aimed to “redesign its operating and governance models to achieve greater efficiency and a more robust control environment.”According to speculation in recent days, Postbank could be sold in a stock offering or be sold to another bank or investor.Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, is one of the last big banks in Europe to bow to pressure from regulators to become less risky and to rely less on borrowed money. Other banks like UniCredit in Italy, UBS in Switzerland and Barclays in Britain have sharply reduced the size of their investment banks and their Wall Street profiles.Amid reports that Deutsche Bank would spin off Postbank, representatives of workers protested in front of company headquarters earlier on Friday, saying the reorganization would lead to job cuts. But Deutsche Bank said the plan was approved unanimously by the supervisory board, half of whose members represent bank employees.Advertisement
