Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by revenue, said Brett Biggs, 47, who runs the finances of the company’s international division, would take over the finance chief role from Charles Holley, 59, who will retire at the end of the year. In a separate statement, the company said Steve Bratspies, who has been in charge of food, was appointed chief merchandising officer, deciding what and how Walmart will sell items at its stores. The moves are the latest in a series of shuffles of top posts under Doug McMillon, who has been reshaping the retailer since taking the helm as chief executive 18 months ago. Last week, Mr. McMillon announced plans to cut 450 jobs at its headquarters in Arkansas. Mr. Biggs has worked in all of the retailer’s three major divisions since joining the company in 2000, including as international finance chief since January 2014. Mr. Bratspies joined Walmart in 2005 and has held positions in marketing, grocery and general merchandise. Advertisement
