Mr. Walsh had been expected to leave this year, but it was unclear whether he would be replaced by Christopher Lynch, the chief financial officer, or by a younger division leader.Mr. Jacques, 44, has spent more than three years on Rio Tinto’s executive committee. He was tasked with bringing greater focus to the copper and coal businesses and has been credited with improving safety while significantly reducing costs as the global mining sector faltered.Most recently, the French-born executive took the lead role in negotiations over a $4.4 billion financing agreement necessary for an expansion of the giant Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia.Mr. Jacques will join the board and becomes deputy chief executive effective immediately, the company said in a statement.Advertisement
