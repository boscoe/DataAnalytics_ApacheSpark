Unexpectedly dismal job growth last month cast a shadow on the nation’s economy, as a government report on Friday sent analysts scrambling for adjectives like “dreadful,” “a body blow” and “grim” to describe just how disappointing they found the latest employment figures.The Labor Department found that the jobless rate held steady at 5.1 percent in September, but wage gains stalled, the labor force shrank and employers created many fewer positions than they had been averaging in recent months. While the latest report is only a snapshot of the economy and the weakness may ultimately prove fleeting, it made clear that ordinary workers are still failing to take home the kind of monetary rewards normally expected from a recovery that has being going on for more than six years.The new estimates came just two weeks after the Federal Reserve decided that the economy’s advance remained too fragile to risk lifting interest rates from their near-zero level — even as it hinted an increase would come before the year’s end. Now, experts said, signs of a slowdown may well push any rise into 2016.The odds of a move in December have “clearly diminished,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago. “There’s nothing good in this morning’s report.”AdvertisementDespite the lagging economy, the mere likelihood that the Fed would yet again postpone a retreat on its stimulus program may have ultimately buoyed some investors’ confidence. After opening sharply down after the Labor Department’s announcement, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index turned around, ending the day up over 1.4 percent, to 1,951.36. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond dipped below 2 percent.Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Yellen, had “really made it clear that she’d like to re-engage those sidelined in recent years by allowing the unemployment rate to fall below what most consider full employment. It’s the only way we’re going to regain living standards lost in recent years.”The Fed faces an uphill battle, she and other analysts suggested, as the United States now appears to be importing some of the economic malaise that has infected other parts of the world, particularly China and Europe.Ms. Swonk, who labeled the employment numbers a “body blow,” warned that the economy was likely to be plagued by subpar growth for a while.Industry has been hurt by the strong dollar and weak global demand; the oil industry has cut back sharply on investment in response to the fall in energy prices; and farming has suffered because of slumping agricultural commodity prices. Last month, the sectors that absorbed the greatest job losses were mining, logging and manufacturing.By contrast, health care, leisure and hospitality, and professional and business services remained strong, highlighting other signs of sturdiness in the economy that countered the otherwise disheartening jobs news.Consumer demand at home has been on the upswing and vehicle sales have been strong. And a broader measure of unemployment, which includes part-time workers who want full-time jobs and those too discouraged to even search, dipped to 10 percent in September, its lowest mark since May 2008.Advertisement“Against the backdrop of accelerating real consumption, it’s hard to see what’s driving this softening and what could sustain it,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, sounding a more optimistic note. “We have to expect better numbers next month, and the odds still strongly favor upward revisions, despite the unexpected downward revision to August.”But Mr. Shepherdson was drowned out by a chorus of more negative reactions to the estimate that employers created only 142,000 jobs in September. Adding to the gloom, the Labor Department revised August’s employment numbers, registering only 136,000 new jobs for that month, well below the 173,000 originally reported.With Friday’s revision, job gains have averaged just 167,000 a month for the last three months, compared with an average of about 260,000 for 2014. Average hourly wages in the private sector dropped slightly, as did the average length of the workweek.With the presidential campaign already underway, neither party wasted much time in using the jobs report to attack the other side.Republicans criticized the president for promoting a program that they argue stifles economic growth. The slowdown may provide a political opening for Republican contenders to attack Mr. Obama and the Democrats on an issue that was not resonating as much with voters when the job market was on the upswing.In response, President Obama vowed on Friday not to sign another temporary spending measure after the one passed this week in an effort to raise the pressure on Congress to reach a long-term agreement to finance the government.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr. Obama warned that the economy could be endangered by the continual game of budget chicken encouraged by conservative Republicans in hopes of forcing Democrats to give ground on other issues, like health care and the fate of Planned Parenthood.The short-term spending bill passed this week to pay for government operations only until Dec. 11, he said, was a “gimmick” that “sets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas.” He added: “This is not the way the U.S. should be operating.”SHARE OFPOPULATION 1-MONTHCHANGESEPT.Employed59.2%–Labor force(workers andunemployed)62.4–5.1%‘HIDDEN’UNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGEIn millionsSEPT.FMAMJJASWorking parttime, but wantfull-time work6.0–1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.People whocurrently wanta job§5.6†–4.4%Unch.–0.7pts.9.2–0.3pts.–1.86.4–0.2–0.6UNEMPLOYMENT BYEDUCATION LEVEL1-MONTHCHANGE†††3.5+0.1–0.8SEPT.16.30.6–3.5–Less thanHigh school 7.9%+High school 5.2–1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESome college4.3–SEPT.Bachelor’s or higher2.5Unch.26.3–7.4%–17.3%11.4–5.8–14.3TYPE OF WORK1-MONTHCHANGEIn millionsSEPT.Nonfarm payroll,12-month changeNonfarm142.4+Goods19.5–Services122.8+Agriculture2.4+AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS Rank-and-fileworkers1-MONTHCHANGESEPT.FMAMJJAS$865.61–UNEMPLOYMENT RATESHARE OFPOPULATION 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.6.5%Employed59.2%–0.2pts.+0.2pts.6.0Labor force(workers andunemployed)62.4–0.2–0.35.1%5.55.0‘HIDDEN’UNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGE4.5In millionsSEPT.ONDJFMAMJJASWorking parttime, but wantfull-time work6.0–6.9%–14.5%UNEMPLOYMENTDEMOGRAPHICS1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.People whocurrently wanta job§5.6†–5.7–7.0White4.4%Unch.–0.7pts.Black9.2–0.3pts.–1.8Hispanic6.4–0.2–0.6UNEMPLOYMENT BYEDUCATION LEVEL1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGE†††Asian3.5+0.1–0.8SEPT.Teenagers (16-19)16.30.6–3.5–Less thanHigh school 7.9%+0.2pts.–0.4pts.DURATION OFUNEMPLOYMENT High school 5.2–0.3–0.11-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESome college4.3–0.1–1.1In weeksSEPT.Bachelor’s or higher2.5Unch.–0.4Average26.3–7.4%–17.3%Median11.4–5.8–14.3TYPE OF WORK1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn millionsSEPT.Nonfarm payroll,12-month changeEMPLOYMENTNonfarm142.4+0.1%+2.0%+3%Goods19.5–0.1+1.1Services122.8+0.1+2.1+2Agriculture2.4+0.5–0.8+1AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS Rank-and-fileworkers1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.0ONDJFMAMJJAS$865.61–0.3%%+2.2%UNEMPLOYMENT RATE6.5%6.05.1%5.55.04.5ONDJFMAMJJASUNEMPLOYMENTDEMOGRAPHICS1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.White4.4%Unch.–0.7pts.Black9.2–0.3pts.–1.8Hispanic6.4–0.2–0.6†††Asian3.5+0.1–0.8Teenagers (16-19)16.3–0.6–3.5DURATION OFUNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn weeksSEPT.Average26.3–7.4%–17.3%Median11.45.8–14.3–Nonfarm payroll,12-month changeEMPLOYMENT+3%+2+10ONDJFMAMJJASSHARE OFPOPULATION 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.Employed59.2%–0.2pts.+0.2pts.Labor force(workers andunemployed)62.4–0.2–0.3‘HIDDEN’UNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn millionsSEPT.Working parttime, but wantfull-time work6.0–6.9%–14.5%People whocurrently wanta job§5.6†–5.7–7.0UNEMPLOYMENT BYEDUCATION LEVEL1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.Less thanHigh school 7.9%+0.2pts.–0.4pts.High school 5.2–0.3–0.1Some college4.3–0.1–1.1Bachelor’s or higher2.5Unch.–0.4TYPE OF WORK1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn millionsAUG.Nonfarm142.4+0.1%+2.0%Goods19.5–0.1+1.1Services122.8+0.1+2.1Agriculture2.4+0.5–0.8AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS Rank-and-fileworkers1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESEPT.$865.61–0.3%%+2.2%OCT. 2, 2015
To prevent a recurrence, he said he would veto any further budget measures postponing a full-fledged spending plan. “I will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week,” Mr. Obama said. “We purchased ourselves another 10 weeks. We need to use them.”AdvertisementWhile overall growth remains on a slow but steady track, the job outlook varies markedly depending on geography, training and industry.Looking at the feeble rise in median wages, Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor Economic Research, pointed out that such figures masked a wide disparity among industries. Workers in financial services, construction and graphic design, for example, have on average enjoyed double-digit wage growth from the previous year. Those stuck in neutral or suffering from effective wage declines included those in the manufacturing, retail clothing and textile industries.The demand for young, high-technology workers has been evident to Isaac Oates, the chief executive of Justworks, a human resources management company that handles mostly small businesses. “We see that a lot of companies are growing quickly” in this area, saying his own firm has grown to 60 workers from 40 over the past three months in order to keep pace.Other industries, like travel and leisure, have proved more resilient job creators, even if wages have not grown much. An improving housing market has also helped push down the number of unemployed workers with construction experience to its lowest level since 2000, according to the Associated General Contractors of America.The picture is bleaker for those in the low-skill corners of the economy.“We’re still finding a lot of skilled jobs come open, but it’s certainly slowed down for the unskilled,” said Robert A. Funk, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City with 750 offices.Skilled workers are at a premium at Advanced Technology Services, a manufacturing consulting company based in Peoria, Ill.“Where we’re struggling is in the area of talented people in manufacturing,” Jeff Owens, the company’s president, said, mentioning that he would like to add about 160 managers, electricians, information technology workers and machinists to his 3,300-person staff.AdvertisementLocation also matters. Mr. Funk, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he observed a slowing down in the last six weeks, with the biggest drop-offs in the oil-drilling states, including Texas, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota.Others fear that the economy is never going to deliver many gains to workers who have been waiting years to receive any bounty from the upswing in business activity.William Spriggs, chief economist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: “We’ve pretty much reached a kind of stability, and the unemployment rate will continue to fall, mostly because of retirements.”An analysis this week from Morgan Stanley noted that the decline in the unemployment rate to 5.1 percent in August, from 5.5 percent in May, was almost entirely attributable to changes in the labor force participation rate. The percentage of the working-age population that is employed — which many economists consider a better indicator of the health of the job market than the official jobless figure — has stayed flat at under 60 percent for several years, still well below its prerecession level of about 63.Public sector jobs were one of the few bright spots, growing by 24,000 in September, thanks to hiring on the state and local level. But government workers — from teachers to police officers to transit workers — have not made up the lost ground, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented research organization in Washington.“The number of teachers and education staff fell dramatically during the recession,” Ms. Gould said, “and has failed to recover to anywhere near its prerecession level, let alone the level that would be required to keep up with an expanding student population.”Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.A version of this article appears in print on October 3, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Grim Jobs Report Is Likely to Delay a Move by the Fed on Rates .
