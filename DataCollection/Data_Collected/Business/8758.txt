TOKYO —  Toshiba booked a net loss for the last financial year and pledged a bold restructuring, raising hopes it was finally moving beyond a $1.3 billion accounting scandal.The submission of its books, twice postponed because of accounting woes, helped allay concerns among some investors that Toshiba risked delisting if it missed its latest filing deadline.Shares in Toshiba rose 1.8 percent on Monday, but they are still down around 30 percent since early April, when its accounting problems were disclosed.“Toshiba is still facing a number of daunting issues, such as what to do with its unprofitable PC and TV businesses,” said Hiroyasu Nishikawa, a senior analyst at IwaiCosmo Securities Company, adding that the accounting troubles would drag on because of shareholder lawsuits.AdvertisementFor the last financial year, Toshiba reported a 37.8 billion yen ($318 million) net loss.
