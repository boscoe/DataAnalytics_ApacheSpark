Taubman builds his boutique firm, he is bringing on one of his longtime clients as a consultant of sorts.Mr. Taubman’s firm, PJT Partners, has hired David J. Stern, the former commissioner of the National Basketball Association, as a senior adviser on what Mr. Stern insists will be more than just sports deals.It is one of the first major appointments to be announced by PJT after it began its new life as a publicly traded company.Mr. Taubman’s relationship with Mr. Stern dates back more than two decades, when Morgan Stanley advised the N.B.A. on its expansion into Toronto and Vancouver. Since then, the two men regularly kept in touch.Though Mr. Stern said that he had been asked — and had rejected — inquiries about playing a similar role at other firms, when Mr. Taubman approached him about becoming an adviser, he said yes.PJT has experience working on sports-related transactions, with Mr. Taubman and with Don Cornwell, a former Morgan Stanley sports banker. But Mr. Stern is expected to dispense advice on more matters, like globalization and digital media.“Sports has become a springboard for everything from real estate to regional sports TV networks and more,” Mr. Stern said.“There are very interesting changes that are taking place in the global media marketplace,” he added. “A lot of companies are trying to understand it.”Mr. Stern, who worked as a lawyer before moving to the N.B.A., already has a number of other advisory roles, including at Greycroft Partners, Discovery Communications and his old employer. But PJT will serve as his biggest time commitment for now.“David is someone with an incredible Rolodex of corporate relationships, and he’s done a lot around the world,” Mr. Taubman said. “He represents what we want our firm to be.”Advertisement
