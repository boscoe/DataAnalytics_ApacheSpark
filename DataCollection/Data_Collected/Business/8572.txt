Japan’s consumer inflation ground to a halt for the first time in more than two years and household spending unexpectedly fell in July, increasing pressure on policy makers to offer fresh fiscal and monetary support to underpin a fragile recovery. The gloomy data, coupled with soft exports that were blamed on China’s slowdown, reinforces the dominant market view that any rebound in Japan’s growth after the contraction from April to June will be modest. The core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was unchanged in July from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday. That was the slowest pace of growth since May 2013. Separate data showed household spending fell 0.2 percent in the year to July.
