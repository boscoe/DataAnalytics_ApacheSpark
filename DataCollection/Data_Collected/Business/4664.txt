The crash of a German passenger jet in the French Alps has once again raised the question of whether commercial airplanes should transmit flight information in real time.Investigators in France are trying to figure out why the pilots of the Germanwings Airbus A320 jet remained silent for nearly 10 minutes as their plane descended from its cruising altitude of 37,000 feet and crashed into a mountain on Tuesday. All 144 passengers and six crew members died, according to local authorities.A senior military official involved in the investigation said Wednesday that an audio file from the cockpit voice recorder suggested that one pilot had left the cockpit and could not get back in. Investigators also said that the memory card from the plane’s other so-called black box, the flight data recorder, was missing, leaving them without reliable information, for now, on the plane’s altitude, speed and location.The crash comes as the aviation industry, regulators and pilots have been grappling with the question of real-time flight monitoring, particularly since the disappearance last year of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. In 2009, the crash of Air France Flight 447 in the Atlantic highlighted the shortcomings of the existing technology after it took search teams two years to locate the plane’s black boxes.Regulators and airlines are weighing whether the cost of the extra technology needed for such monitoring would be justified given the fact that airline crashes have become increasingly rare. Last year was the safest year on record for commercial flight.Still, the crash Tuesday has revived the question of whether pilots should be videotaped during flight.
                Maps and timeline of what is known about the crash.            This year, the National Transportation Safety Board endorsed the use of cockpit videos as one of eight recommendations to help investigators and emergency medical workers react faster to accidents.The safety agency said that all flight data and cockpit voice recorders should have a tamper-resistant mode to broadcast to a ground station enough information to establish a crash site within about seven miles. In practice, this could include either a recorder that would eject at impact or some form of data streaming.It also called for low-frequency devices that can broadcast their location for 90 days; such “pings” are already embedded in two black boxes, but their batteries are required to last only 30 days and their range is limited.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In these cases, airlines require pilots to send satellite messages or radio their position at set periods.But this also means that planes flying over oceans or in areas where radar coverage is scarce can vanish from view. This explains why finding Air France Flight 447 was so challenging. Few in the industry expected that another plane would ever disappear entirely and never be found, as has been the case with the Malaysian jet.The Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilot union in the country, is opposed to the use of “cockpit image recorders,” saying that they are an invasion of privacy and that existing technology provides ample information about what happens on a plane.“There isn’t really a need for such a thing,” said Patrick Smith, a commercial pilot and the author of “Ask the Pilot: Everything You Need to Know About Air Travel.”“It’s very rarely that the so-called black boxes are not recovered,” Mr. Smith said.A version of this article appears in print on March 26, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Cost a Factor in Streaming Flight Data in Real Time.
