KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — The Philippines on Sunday called on neighboring Southeast Asian nations before a regional summit meeting in Malaysia to push for an immediate halt to China’s reclamation in the disputed South China Sea.China claims 90 percent of the South China Sea, which is believed to be rich in oil and gas. Its claims overlap others by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.Recent satellite images suggest that China has made rapid progress in building an airstrip suitable for military use in contested territory in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea and may be planning another.In a speech to foreign ministers of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario of the Philippines did not name China directly but said its “northern neighbor” was quickly advancing with its reclamation efforts.Advertisement“Is it not time for Asean to say to our northern neighbor that what it is doing is wrong and that the massive reclamations must be immediately stopped?” Mr. Rosario asked.AdvertisementThe territorial dispute is seen as carrying risks of leading to conflict as countries stake their claims.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
