The new tier, Rdio Select, which was announced Thursday by the company, offers ad-free radio and the ability for users to choose 25 songs to listen to each day on demand.Rdio Select subscribers will also be able to keep up to 25 downloads for offline use, and will have access to various 10-song playlists. The service will initially be available in the United States and five other countries, and will also be offered through a 60-day free trial.“We’re excited to reach a new group of price-sensitive music subscribers with Rdio Select and have designed the service to appeal to a wide audience,” Anthony Bay, Rdio’s chief executive, said in a statement.The price of online music — and how much of that money makes its way back to musicians — is a subject of constant debate in the industry. Many analysts and technology executives believe that $10 a month for all-you-can-listen-to music is more than the average consumer is willing to pay.At the same time, record labels have been resistant to change their licensing deals to let streaming services charge much less, and they have reportedly been pressuring online outlets to limit how much free music they offer. Apple reportedly wanted to charge $8 a month for its coming streaming service, but the major labels held out in negotiations for $10.Even with those conflicts, streaming has grown quickly. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, subscription services around the world had 41 million paying customers last year and generated $1.6 billion in revenue for the industry. This week the Warner Music Group, home to Bruno Mars, Charli XCX and the “Furious 7” soundtrack, reported that in this year’s first quarter its income from streaming services overtook those from downloads for the first time.Rdio, introduced in 2010 by the founders of Skype, has been a well-regarded competitor to Spotify, Rhapsody and Google Play, and is now available in 85 countries. It has never disclosed its subscriber numbers, but they are believed to be far below those of Spotify, which has 15 million paying users around the world and 45 million on its free version. Pandora has 79 million users, most of them listening free with ads.Advertisement
