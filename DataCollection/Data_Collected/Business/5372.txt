The stock market bounced back from a big loss on Friday, buoyed by some strong first-quarter earnings reports.The toymaker Hasbro reported an unexpected gain in sales on strong demand for its Transformers, Nerf and Marvel toys. The oil and gas services company Halliburton and the investment bank Morgan Stanley also reported results that exceeded analysts’ predictions.Stocks were weighed down Friday by concern over the unresolved Greek debt crisis and disappointing earnings reports.This week is one of the busiest for first-quarter earnings, with 147 companies, close to a third of those in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, scheduled to report results. Investors are already expecting weak earnings because a surge in the dollar is hurting overseas sales. A big drop in oil prices is also hitting energy companies.AdvertisementThe strong earnings reported on Monday “are setting a good trend to start the week,” said David Lyon, a global investment specialist at JPMorgan Private Bank. “Earnings are coming in better than the weakened expectations.”
