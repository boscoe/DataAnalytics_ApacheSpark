WASHINGTON — Industrial production in the United States fell in April for a fifth straight month, in part because of a further decline in oil and gas drilling, painting a lackluster picture of economic growth in the second quarter.The economy's struggle to pick up steam after a dismal first quarter was underscored by other data on Friday showing a sharp drop in consumer confidence in early May and only a mild rebound in factory activity in New York State.Industrial output slipped 0.3 percent after a revised 0.3 percent drop in March, the Federal Reserve said. Economists had forecast that industrial production would edge up 0.1 percent after a previously reported 0.6 percent fall in March.A plunge of 14.5 percent in oil and gas well drilling pushed mining production down 0.8 percent last month. It was the fourth straight monthly decline in mining output.FEB.–0.1%MARCH–0.3%APRIL–0.3% 108106104102100’14’15Crude oil prices have fallen by about 50 percent since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity.AdvertisementCompanies like Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oil field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year. Caterpillar has cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned that lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.Advertisement“We see a further drop in mining investment over the next few quarters,” said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. She added that she did not expect business investment outside the mining sector to offset that.The economy was slammed this year by bad weather, port disruptions, the strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms.The government reported last month that gross domestic product expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter. But trade and inventory data published after the data snapshot suggested the economy actually contracted.
