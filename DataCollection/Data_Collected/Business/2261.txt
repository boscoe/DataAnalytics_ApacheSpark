A preview of the film.LOS ANGELES —  Sony Pictures on Wednesday said it had reached agreements with cable, satellite and telecom providers to bring “The Interview” into consumers’ living rooms, greatly expanding the digital release of the controversial film.Sony will also expand the movie’s theatrical run in the United States to more than 580 theaters from 331, starting on Friday.“The Interview,” a crude comedy about the fictional assassination of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, became the center of a free speech uproar this month when theaters balked at playing it in the face of a terror threat and Sony canceled its original release. The film was ultimately made available for online rental and sale last week, followed by limited theatrical distribution in a few hundred independent theaters.Starting on Wednesday, a parade of cable and satellite TV providers will make “The Interview” available on pay-per-view and on-demand services. Among the participants are Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Bright House, Cablevision, Charter Communications, AT&T U-verse, Verizon FiOS and DirecTV.

Walmart’s digital on-demand service, Vudu, will also offer the film, joining iTunes, the Google Play store, YouTube Movies, Xbox Video and others.AdvertisementSony’s new partners are arriving more than fashionably late. The studio, battered by harsh criticism in the wake of its decision to cancel the film’s original theatrical release, had pushed most of them, if not all, to adopt “The Interview” last week. But Comcast, Time Warner and their competitors initially balked, citing worries that they would become hacking targets if they picked up the film.Advertisement“The Interview” has been contentious in Hollywood not only because of the efforts of hackers to stop its release but because of its early availability on digital services. Theaters typically receive a three-month exclusive window to show new studio-produced movies, and theater owners have been adamant about discouraging Hollywood efforts to shorten that period in favor of digital availability.So far, “The Interview,” which cost $44 million to make, has taken in $3.1 million from theaters, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data. Sony has not regularly reported figures for online rentals and sales, except to say that the film generated $15 million on digital services in its first four days of availability.Sony has emphasized that despite the media attention recently given to “The Interview,” efforts were made to keep the price of online rentals and sales low — in other words, Sony believes it could have charged more but did not. The movie has been renting for $6 and selling for $15, in line with standard Internet pricing.A version of this article appears in print on January 1, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Sony in Deals for Wider Viewing of ‘The Interview’.
