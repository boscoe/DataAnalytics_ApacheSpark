That was in line with the expectations, according to Reuters.Santander, one of Europe’s largest banks, wrote down billions of euros in mortgages in 2013 amid a weak economy in Spain, its home market, but an improving economic outlook for the country has allowed the bank to decrease its provisions for bad loans in the past year.New loans to businesses in Spain increased 24 percent in the first quarter, while new loans to individuals in Spain rose 36 percent, Santander said. Over all, the bank’s loan portfolio rose 14 percent to €813.3 billion. Santander does business in a variety of markets outside Spain, including Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States.Provisions for delinquent and defaulted loans fell 4.9 percent to €2.56 billion, from €2.69 billion in the first quarter of 2014.“Santander’s strong increase in lending reflects our commitment to helping our customers grow,” Ana Botín, the bank’s executive chairwoman, said in a news release. “When we raised capital in January, we said our goal was to target organic growth in our core markets forecasted to achieve strong economic recovery.”The positive results at Santander come amid an accelerating economic recovery in Spain, which is expected to grow faster this year than a number of its European peers.On Monday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the country’s economy is expected to grow 2.9 percent in 2014, up from an earlier forecast of 2.4 percent.The weakening of the euro against the United States dollar and the British pound also lifted Santander’s results in the first quarter. Santander, which reports its results in euros, benefited from a weaker euro as its profit in countries outside of the eurozone was boosted by the exchange rate. Without the impact of the exchange rates, profits would have risen 22 percent, the bank said.Net interest income, or what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, rose 15 percent to €8.04 billion in the first quarter, compared with €6.9 billion in the same period a year earlier.Santander’s nonperforming loan rate, which measures loans in default, was 4.85 percent, about 0.34 of a percentage point lower than in the fourth quarter.Operating expenses rose 10.9 percent to €5.38 billion, from €4.85 billion in the first quarter of 2014.Santander’s earnings in Spain jumped 42.1 percent to €357 million in the first quarter, from €251 million in the same period a year earlier.In Britain, the bank’s profit rose 27 percent to €477 million in the first quarter, from €376 million in the first quarter of 2014.In Santander’s operations in Latin America, profit increased 28.5 percent to €914 million in the first quarter, from €712 million in the prior-year period.Advertisement
