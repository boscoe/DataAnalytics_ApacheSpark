She will be responsible for improving research, including ratings, consumer wants and needs, across Disney’s television networks other than ESPN (ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, ABC Family) with an eye toward developing new “product opportunities,” Disney said.In a statement, Ms. Davis said she would “champion the consumers’ voice within Disney-ABC in a way that drives innovation for viewers and value for the business.”Every major media company is trying to figure out how to meet the demands of younger consumers, who increasingly watch television in nontraditional ways, while protecting what remains a very valuable traditional business. Some companies — notably CBS and HBO — have unveiled subscription Internet services that allow consumers to watch current and past shows on demand. Disney has said that it has no immediate plans to follow, but it is watching developments carefully.Also joining Disney will be John Frelinghuysen, who will take the title of executive vice president for digital media, strategy and business development. He will help fill a void left in the spring when Albert Cheng took a job at Amazon after leading the Disney-ABC Television Group’s digital efforts for a decade. Disney said Mr. Frelinghuysen would be charged with “defining and executing plans to effectively monetize both new and existing short-form and long-form content and distribution.”Mr. Frelinghuysen, who was an AOL senior vice president in charge of strategy, said in a statement that he saw “opportunity for creating new content experiences and driving revenue growth in digital video.”Both new executives will report to Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney-ABC Television Group.Advertisement
