FRANKFURT — Debt relief has emerged as a major sticking point in last-ditch negotiations to keep Greece from leaving the eurozone.What the country may need most is not a reduction in the overall size of its debt, though, but an easier schedule for repaying the money. Or at least that is the view of many economists.The size of Greece’s debt is daunting. At 317 billion euros at the end of 2014, or nearly $354 billion, it is the second-highest national debt in the world, when measured as a proportion of gross domestic product: 177 percent. Only Japan’s, at 245 percent, is higher.But as anyone who owes money knows, the burden is not so much the size of the loan but the terms of repayment. And Greece’s big problem is payments coming due in the next few years.AdvertisementGreece needs about €30 billion, for example, just to meet its obligations through September 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. That includes interest, arrears and payments due on maturing debt. A lot of that money is owed within the next few months, and it is clear that the government does not have the cash.AdvertisementThe good news, economists say, is that rescheduling the debt is much easier than forgiving it.German leaders have said they are against a so-called haircut — an actual debt reduction. But Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, said on Thursday that he would not rule out “reprofiling” Greek debt. He presumably meant changing the terms to make repayment less onerous and less likely to further squeeze Greece’s already shrinking economy.“Somehow Greece has to get over the next five years,” said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “There would be ways to ease the debt burden further without doing an outright haircut.”Among Greece’s creditors, there is growing recognition that some kind of debt relief is inevitable. In a report last week, the I.M.F. said that, partly because of economic mismanagement by the leftist Greek government, Greece’s debt was too high and the country needed an estimated €60 billion in additional financing.Before talks scheduled for Saturday, eurozone finance ministers requested more information on the state of Greece’s debt, a sign they are considering the issue. But Greece did not formally ask for debt relief in the bailout proposal it submitted Thursday night. And detailed talks on Greece’s debt burden are likely to come only later, if there is an accord this weekend on granting the country another financial rescue.Rather than “debt relief,” the phrase of the moment in Brussels is “debt sustainability.” That means that Greece’s debt payments should be manageable over the long term. And they should not be so large, according to the sustainability camp, that they undercut any chance for the economy to grow.About two-thirds of the money Greece must pay back by mid-2018 is owed to either the European Central Bank or the I.M.F.Greece has already missed a €1.5 billion I.M.F. payment that was due at the end of June. The country cannot receive further financial assistance from the fund until it repays that money.
                European leaders weighed the latest measures from Athens.            On July 20, Greece must pay back €4.25 billion in principal and interest on bonds held by the European Central Bank.AdvertisementMr. Darvas suggested that Greece be allowed to borrow from the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone rescue fund, to repay the I.M.F. — in effect swapping one debt for another. Loans from that rescue fund carry a much lower interest rate.In fact, Greece’s pending proposal includes a request to borrow an additional €53.5 billion from the European Stability Mechanism. If the deal comes through, part of that loan money could be used to make the I.M.F. and E.C.B. payments. In addition, Mr. Darvas said, the eurozone creditors should extend the period during which Greece would not have to make any interest payments, while giving the country longer to repay the principal on its loans.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That is less burdensome than the payback terms for Ireland or Portugal, which also received international bailouts. And the interest might be bearable for Greece, if it were not for the big payments looming in coming months and years.Greece’s total debt would remain high, but the number would probably look less scary as the years passed, if the Greek economy grew and inflation whittled away the true value.“There may still be room for an agreement,” Olivier Blanchard, chief economist of the I.M.F., said Friday in a blog post. A new accord, he added, should be based on “a more explicit recognition of the need for more financing and more debt relief.”
                European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.            Mr. Blanchard emphasized that Greece would also have to do its part by taking steps to improve the performance of its economy. Failure to do so, he wrote, would raise the cost to its creditors of debt relief.And even with debt relief, Greece will still need to keep a tight rein on spending. The I.M.F., in its report on Greek debt last week, said the country would have to spend less than it collected in taxes and other revenue, and do so for years to come.One big element of talks this weekend will be the size of the country’s so-called primary surplus. That is the money left over after government expenditures, not counting debt service. “Fundamentally, the euro area faces a political choice: lower reforms and fiscal targets for Greece means a higher cost for the creditor countries,” Mr. Blanchard wrote.AdvertisementHowever grudgingly, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, largely caved in to creditor demands for spending discipline in the proposal his government filed on Thursday. The government agreed to raise sales taxes and eliminate tax breaks for some Greek islands, as well as for farmers. It also agreed to cuts in pensions demanded by creditors, an increase in the retirement age, and cuts in military spending.Still, debt relief remains a tough sell in the rest of Europe. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has ruled out what she referred to as a “classic haircut” — phrasing that may leave room for debt restructuring that does not include outright forgiveness. Her caution is a sign that many Germans remain hostile to giving Greece a break on its debt.Greeks, on the other hand, expect debt relief as a reward for the pain they will continue to suffer, if the creditors accept the new Tsipras offer.Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister, told the Parliament on Friday that the country would get debt relief and additional aid in return for “credible measures” to improve the economy.Greek leaders may need at least a general promise of debt relief from creditors in order to win parliamentary approval for any deal.Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and James Kanter from Brussels.A version of this article appears in print on July 11, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Economists Suggest a Longer Payment Plan to Ease Greece’s Debts.
