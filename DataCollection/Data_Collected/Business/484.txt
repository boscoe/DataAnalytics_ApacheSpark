SAN FRANCISCO — While the market for initial public offerings has been unfriendly in recent weeks, IAC/InterActiveCorp is betting that investors will still flock to buy a piece of a top online dating company.IAC’s Match Group, the home of Tinder, Match.com and OkCupid, filed to go public on Friday, setting the stage for the company to gain at least some distance from its corporate parent.IAC said in June that it would split off Match, with the Internet conglomerate’s founder, Barry Diller, saying that it was “healthy to give them separation and independence from a mother church.”Match has shown steady growth over the past three years. Its net earnings for last year rose 64 percent from 2012, to $148.4 million. Its revenue for the same period rose almost 25 percent, to $888.3 million.AdvertisementAs of Sept. 30, the company had about 59 million monthly active users and roughly 4.7 million paid members.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
