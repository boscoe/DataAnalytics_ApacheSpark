His appointment is set to end in April.“The supervisory board of Linde AG accepted his decision with much regret,” the company said in a news release.News that merger talks had ended sent Linde’s shares down 6 percent in Frankfurt on Monday, but the company’s stock recovered some of those losses on Tuesday.Linde has three divisions, focused on industrial gases, engineering and supply chain services. Its gas division concentrates on industrial and medical gases, including oxygen, nitrogen and argon.The company generated 17.9 billion euros ($20.1 billion) in revenue in 2015 and has about 64,000 employees in more than 100 countries.A combination with Praxair would have created a company with a combined market capitalization of more than $60 billion.The merger discussions came after Air Liquide, a French industrial-gas producer, completed its acquisition in May of Airgas for more than $10 billion.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
