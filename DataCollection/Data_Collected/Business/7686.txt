The price had surged in the years after the 2008 financial crisis, topping out at nearly $1,900 an ounce in August 2011 as investors guessed that the Federal Reserve’s low interest rate policy and huge bond-buying program would undermine the dollar and lead to inflation. Instead, inflation has remained subdued and the economy has maintained its recovery, albeit at an uneven pace. That has increased demand for the dollar, and on Monday the price of gold sank another $25, to $1,106.70 an ounce — about 40 percent below its recent peak and the lowest price since March 2010. Gold’s allure as a store of value in times of crisis also appears to be fading. Neither the recent stock market crash in China nor the Greek debt crisis restored the attraction of gold. Advertisement
