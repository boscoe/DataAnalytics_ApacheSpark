Now they are meeting a more mixed reception.Pure Storage, a provider of computer data storage, on Tuesday evening priced its stock market debut at $17 a share, at the midpoint of its expected range. That values the six-year-old company at about $3.1 billion.That somewhat muted pricing follows a move by the Digicel Group, a mobile and cable services provider, to cancel its planned initial public offering altogether in the face of what it called “recent volatility” in the markets.The bumpiness raises questions about what kind of fate awaits the offerings of First Data, the big payments processor, and Albertsons, the supermarket operator.Tuesday’s developments highlight the rockier market for I.P.O.s, which until last year had proved a buoyant section of the Wall Street landscape.Since January, however, companies seeking to list on public markets have hit a rough patch. The average initial stock sale has fallen 4.3 percent from its offer price so far this year, according to data from Renaissance Capital.That has led to a slowdown in overall I.P.O. activity, with the 141 pricings this year representing a nearly 35 percent drop from the same time last year. One company, Surgery Partners, priced its market debut at $19, well below its expected price range of $23 to $26 a share.Pure Storage, whose business revolves around selling storage based on flash storage that is meant to be faster than traditional hard drives, was seen by some investors and analysts as a test of the market’s receptivity to initial offerings, particularly from the technology sector.At $17 a share, the company raised $425 million. If demand proves more robust, the company could raise an additional $63.75 million by having its underwriters exercise what is known as an overallotment option, or greenshoe.In pricing its offering, Pure Storage dodged the fate of Digicel, which was meant to be one of the more ambitious market debutantes of the year. Though little known in the United States and Europe, Digicel, a Bermuda-based telecommunications company, has become a major service provider in the Caribbean and the South Pacific.Digicel had sought to raise nearly $2 billion in its offering, valuing itself at about $5 billion. That would have made it one of the bigger companies to go public this year.But in a statement, Denis O’Brien, the Irish businessman who is chairman of Digicel, called his company’s planned offering “optional” and dependent on getting a fulsome valuation in the I.P.O.“Recent volatility in equity markets has seen a number of I.P.O.s listing at a discount to their signaled price range, and this was a less attractive route for us,” he said.Advertisement
