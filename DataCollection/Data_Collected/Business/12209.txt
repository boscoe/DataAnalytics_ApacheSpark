HONG KONG — China said Monday evening that it would free up banks in the country to lend more, as the government tries to shore up slowing economic growth.The country’s top financial policy makers are trying to reassure the rest of the world that their management of the economy remains on track, and that they still have many tools at their disposal to avoid an even sharper slowdown in growth. China is also grappling with persistent capital outflows because of expectations that the currency, the renminbi, could weaken further.The country’s top leaders are to convene in Beijing on Thursday for the first of the so-called two meetings, the annual gatherings of the full membership of the national legislature and a sprawling committee of political advisers.
                China’s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.            Effective Tuesday, China’s central bank said, the amount of cash that commercial banks are required to set aside as reserves will be reduced. Lowering the reserve requirement ratio essentially gives the state-controlled banking system more money to lend.AdvertisementThe move is the latest example of the fine line that China’s policy makers are trying to walk as they look to bolster the economy, the world’s second-largest after the United States.AdvertisementA major lending binge in recent years has left China with too many steel and cement factories and has saddled many state-owned companies with too much debt. At the same time, China’s leaders are trying to channel lending to areas long underserved by state-owned banks, such as small and midsize businesses, that the leaders see as essential to nurturing growth.This is the fifth time that the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has cut the reserve requirement ratio since the start of last year. The move on Monday could release around 630 billion renminbi, or about $96 billion, in additional liquidity to China’s banking system, according to estimates from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.For the biggest banks, the ratio of total deposits that must be kept in reserve was reduced to 17 percent, from 17.5 percent.By lowering the reserve requirement ratio, or R.R.R., by half a percentage point, the central bank is partly seeking to offset its own actions in support of the currency. The central bank has been selling dollars and buying renminbi to prop up the value of its currency, which has been under pressure.
                As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.            But that has siphoned liquidity out of the system. In response, the central bank has been injecting billions of renminbi into the country’s financial system. The reserve requirement ratio cut serves the same purpose, essentially representing a lending quota.In a news release on Monday, China’s central bank said the reduction was intended “to maintain adequate and reasonable liquidity in the financial system and guide the steady moderate growth of money and credit.”In recent months, the People’s Bank of China has slowly been switching its focus away from changing reserve requirements. Instead, it has been putting greater emphasis on interest rates as a way to control liquidity. Still, the pressure on the renminbi to weaken remains such that the central bank will probably need to dig deeper into its monetary policy toolbox.Although the central bank has been moving toward more market-driven interest rates, traditional measures like the reserve requirement ratio cut still create across-the-board stimulus, Mark Williams, the chief China economist at Capital Economics, wrote Monday evening in a research note.Advertisement“The move underscores a message that officials have repeated in recent days, including at the G-20 meeting: Policy makers still have room to support the economy,” he said.Follow Neil Gough on Twitter @n_gough.A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: China Moves to Encourage Banks to Do More Lending.
