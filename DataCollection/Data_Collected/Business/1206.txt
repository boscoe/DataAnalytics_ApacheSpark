AdvertisementSupported byBy Jack Ewing and Danny HakimVolkswagen has hired an expert in self-driving car technology from Apple, sending a signal that it will continue to invest in leading-edge technologies despite the financial burden created by its emissions cheating crisis.Separately, the company has reached an agreement to largely complete its release of records sought by 47 American state attorneys general by year’s end, people with knowledge of the investigations said. Investigators are examining violations of state law on two fronts for Volkswagen, which in September admitted to installing so-called defeat device software in 11 million diesel cars worldwide that was designed to detect when cars were in laboratory tests and cause the vehicles to lower their emissions of pollutants.While defeat devices are banned in the United States and Europe, the company said this week that it was still determining “whether the software in question officially constituted a defeat device” under European Union regulations.Germany’s motor vehicle regulatory agency said on Tuesday that it had ordered Volkswagen to retest 800,000 vehicles in Europe after the company admitted to making false claims about carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy.By hiring the former Apple executive Johann Jungwirth, 42, Volkswagen is signaling that the emissions crisis will not prevent the company from trying to keep pace with new developments in the industry. Mr. Jungwirth will lead a newly created Digitalization Strategy Department and report directly to Matthias Müller, the Volkswagen chief executive, the company said.At Apple, Mr. Jungwirth, a former executive at the German carmaker Daimler, was formally director of Mac systems engineering. But he is widely believed to have been a member of a team working on a secretive car project for Apple.The Apple car project has provoked nervousness among traditional automakers mindful of how the company upended the mobile phone market after it introduced the iPhone. Google has also been researching self-driving cars.Volkswagen is under severe financial pressure after admitting that it deceived regulators and customers for years about how much harmful emissions its vehicles produced. In addition to lost sales, Volkswagen faces billions of euros in costs to make vehicles compliant with regulations and to pay fines and legal judgments.Mr. Jungwirth, who was born in Romania, holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University in Stuttgart, Germany, Volkswagen said. He also studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Before joining Apple last year, Mr. Jungwirth was head of a research and development center in Sunnyvale, Calif., operated by Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler. The center’s projects included research on self-driving vehicles and battery-powered cars.Last week, Volkswagen admitted to understating emissions of carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming, and overstating fuel economy for 800,000 vehicles in Europe. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, which regulates motor vehicles in Germany, said on Tuesday that it would supervise retesting of the vehicles and also investigate the process that led to the false emissions claims.The erroneous carbon dioxide claims came to light after Volkswagen’s September admission that it had installed defeat devices designed to deceive regulators about nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines.The emissions-cheating investigations by 47 American states and the District of Columbia are being led by the attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington. The lead states issued a joint statement Monday evening after Volkswagen announced a plan to make payments of up to $1,000 to diesel owners in the United States, calling it “a good-will gesture and nothing more.”“It in no way diminishes the seriousness of the deceptive practices and environmental harms that are the subject of the states’ investigation, or the determination of the attorneys general of 48 jurisdictions to hold Volkswagen to account for its conduct,” the statement said.Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said Tuesday, “We are cooperating with all agencies, but are unable to comment on active or pending litigation.”The attorney general’s office in California, which has stringent environmental laws, is conducting its own investigation, as are attorneys general in Texas and West Virginia.The Volkswagen case has little precedent, particularly because the company has already admitted wrongdoing. It is facing state civil investigations across the country, a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, a flurry of civil lawsuits and investigations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.VW is also facing other investigations across the world, from the state prosecutor’s office in Germany to regulators in South Korea. Last month, the Paris prosecutor’s office raided Volkswagen’s French offices and seized computers. Regulators in India recently said that several of the company’s models did not meet its emissions standards.Jones Day, an American law firm, is also conducting an internal investigation on Volkswagen’s behalf.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting.Advertisement
