Even so, Target needs more customers wandering its aisles over the holiday season and a sustainable plan to compete with Amazon.By most accounts, Target turned things around in its latest quarter. Although overall revenue tumbled nearly 7 percent for the three months ending Oct. 29, to $16 billion, the company surpassed profit and sales forecasts. More high-margin apparel, home and baby items flew off the shelves. E-commerce revenue also grew a healthy 26 percent.The results, which sent Target shares up almost 7 percent on Wednesday, represent a stark turnaround from the previous quarter, when the company blamed a drop in demand for Apple iPhones and such for its weakness. A rocky grocery business and management shake-ups augured more challenges. In August, it cut its full-year earnings expectations.This latest improvement may be short-lived, however. The retailer’s chief executive, Brian Cornell, was peppier about the final months of the year but not especially cheery. Target expects comparable-store sales to be flat this quarter. Restoring growth in foot traffic is a priority.Marketing its more than 1,000 retail locations as pickup destinations for online orders can help. So, too, should opening stores in cities like New York. Amazon’s product breadth and ever-speedier home delivery are formidable, however. Walmart also is plowing headlong into digital with the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. Trading at just 13 times earnings, below many of its peers, could make Target a mark for investors. It is just not clear yet whether the company can maintain a steady aim.Advertisement
