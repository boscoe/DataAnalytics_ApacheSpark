Daniel Lubetzky, the chief executive of KIND Snacks, says the lessons he learned as a magician are also applicable to the business world.Over the course of more than 400 interviews with C.E.O.s and other leaders for the weekly Corner Office feature by Adam Bryant, an intriguing fact emerged: Several of the C.E.O.s — including Aaron Levie of Box, Janet Elkin of Supplemental Health Care and Daniel Lubetzky of Kind Snacks — were professional magicians earlier in their lives.Just a coincidence? Or did those experiences help make them better leaders?“First of all, magicians practice a lot,” said Mr. Lubetzky, who performed magic shows from the time he was 8 years old until he was 19. “It requires a lot of discipline. Second, you can’t be afraid to be a leader, to go onstage, and you learn to have presence. You need to be able to visualize and connect and create. Most important, you learn to think outside the box.”In the accompanying video, he elaborates on how his training as a magician helps him lead.Each week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership.
