AdvertisementSupported by Landon Thomas Jr.Pimco, the global bond giant, said on Monday that it was setting up a global advisory board featuring luminaries like Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Gordon Brown, the onetime British prime minister.Mr. Bernanke, who was hired by Pimco as a senior adviser in April, will be chairman of the advisory board. Other board members are Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank; Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former top official at the State Department; and Ng Kok Song, who previously was the chief investment officer for Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.Pimco said the five experts would provide advice on global politics and economics to the firm’s team of portfolio managers, meeting several times a year at the company’s headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif., as well as in other Pimco offices around the world.They are also expected to feature prominently at the firm’s so-called secular forum, a talking shop held every May and lasting several days, in which Pimco economists and bond managers develop long-range investing themes.While Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Trichet have maintained fairly active profiles in global policy and investment circles, Mr. Brown, quite a private man for a politician, has been less frequently seen — except for his star turn in lobbying for Scotland to stay in Britain in 2014.Nevertheless, as former heads of governments go, Mr. Brown, who also served as chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Tony Blair, is as expert as they come in terms of international economics. Analysts have long thought that the ideal post-political job for him would be leading a global policy institution, like the International Monetary Fund.“The global advisory board is an unrivaled team of macroeconomic thinkers and former policy makers, whose insights into the intersection of policy and financial markets will be a valuable input to our investment process,” said Dan Ivascyn, Pimco’s chief investment officer.Advertisement
