LONDON — The Swedish private equity firm EQT Partners said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire the tourism company Kuoni Group in a deal that would take the Swiss firm private.Kuoni was founded in Zurich in 1906 by Alfred Kuoni and organized its first guided overseas tour to Egypt the next year.Under the terms of the deal, which valued Kuoni at 1.39 billion Swiss francs, or about $1.36 billion, EQT said it had offered 370 francs a share, a 21 percent premium on the closing price on Monday.The offer represents a 60 percent premium on the 60-day, volume-weighted average price of Kuoni’s shares on Jan. 4, the day before it confirmed it was talking with potential bidders, EQT said.Advertisement“Over the last months, the board has very carefully analyzed all strategic options in order to secure the successful implementation of Kuoni Group’s strategy,” Heinz Karrer, the Kuoni chairman, said in a news release.Advertisement“The board concluded unanimously that taking Kuoni private and handing over the responsibility for the group to an internationally renowned new owner with comprehensive experience in managing and further developing industry leaders, with the necessary financial strengths and with a long-term perspective, would be the ideal solution to the benefit of all stakeholders,’’ he said. “EQT fulfills all these requirements in the best possible way.”Kuoni’s board has recommended that shareholders accept the EQT offer.Shares of Kuoni jumped 18.8 percent to 362.5 francs in midmorning trading in Zurich on Tuesday.The Kuoni and Hugentobler Foundation, Kuoni’s long-term anchor shareholder, is supporting the transaction and has reached an agreement with EQT regarding the governance and future development of the company, EQT said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It posted revenue of 3.4 billion francs in 2014 and employed about 8,000 people.It announced plans last year to focus on its core business of providing services to the global travel industry and agreed to sell its tour operations in Europe and its tour operations in Hong Kong and India.EQT was advised by JPMorgan Chase and the law firms Bär & Karrer and Latham & Watkins.A version of this article appears in print on February 3, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Going Private.
