A federal appeals court in New York ruled on Friday that Actavis cannot withdraw its top-selling Alzheimer’s disease drug from the market in favor of a more expensive extended-release version. The decision, at the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, is a victory for New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who sued to block the switch, arguing that Actavis was trying to stifle competition from generic drug makers. A three-judge panel upheld an order in December by Judge Robert W. Sweet of Federal District Court that required Actavis to keep the older drug, Namenda IR, on the market. Actavis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Schneiderman filed an antitrust lawsuit against Actavis last year after the company said it planned to discontinue Namenda IR in favor of Namenda XR. The two drugs have the same active ingredient, memantine, but Namenda XR is taken once daily instead of twice.A version of this brief appears in print on May 23, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Court Bars Removal of Cheaper Alzheimer’s Drug .
