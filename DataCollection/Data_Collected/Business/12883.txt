On Tuesday, TerraForm Global warned that SunEdison was at “substantial risk” of bankruptcy. SunEdison shares fell about 4 percent in extended trading on Thursday. The company, in a regulatory filing, said the government had also sought information on the “conduct of a former non-executive employee who is alleged to have committed wrongdoing in connection with the Vivint termination negotiations.” SunEdison has delayed filing its annual report twice, saying it has identified material weaknesses in its financial reporting controls.Advertisement
