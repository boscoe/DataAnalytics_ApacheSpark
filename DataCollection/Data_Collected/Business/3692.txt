HONG KONG — The average prices for new homes in China’s 70 major cities fell for the fifth consecutive month but showed some signs of stabilizing in the top cities, according to data released Tuesday.Prices for new homes in Beijing fell 0.1 percent from December to January, slowing from a 0.2 percent fall in December from November, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Shanghai prices were flat.Data showed that prices for new homes, compared with the same period a year earlier, were down 5.1 percent, accelerating from the annual 4.3 percent fall in December.Among the 70 major cities the bureau monitors, 64 posted a monthly decline, down from 66 in December.AdvertisementLiu Jianwei, senior statistician at the bureau, said in a news release that prices became more polarized among the cities, with first-tier centers stabilizing while the second tier narrowed its declines and the third tier recorded faster falls.AdvertisementStabilizing prices in Beijing and Shanghai suggest China’s real estate market is showing signs of recovery, as some developers raise prices in major cities following government efforts to revitalize an economy growing at its slowest rate in more than two decades.Some major Chinese developers also said they were planning to raise prices for new luxury projects in prime areas this year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
