It’s always tricky to blame a major business scandal on midlevel employees acting without the knowledge of top management.That becomes harder still when those at the top become the subject of an investigation, and court documents portray a vast conspiracy involving hundreds of employees.This is the predicament for Volkswagen after Hans Dieter Pötsch, the chairman of the company’s supervisory board and its former chief financial officer, was accused of failing to notify shareholders quickly enough of the financial risks of the emissions cheating scandal.More than a year after the company was accused of wrongdoing, this investigation could provide ammunition to those suing Volkswagen, claiming that the carmaker’s managers were aware of the impending scandal and failed to notify shareholders as required by law.AdvertisementThe accusations are likely to intensify criticism that the company remains in the hands of insiders who were in charge while it produced millions of cars deliberately devised to cheat on air-quality tests.AdvertisementPity the bankers.Their bonuses are expected to decline for the third consecutive year.The payouts are projected to be 5 to 10 percent lower this year, according to a report by Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm.

AT&T, by contrast, has little experience in entertainment and the culture at Time Warner encourages competition among business units, rather than collaboration.• The presidential election is on Tuesday. Financial markets are already on edge and there could be some volatile trading ahead.“We were closer than we realized — maybe a $105 cash plus $105 stock would have done it! But we were definitely over our skis!!!!”— Marc Benioff, a founder and the chief executive of Salesforce, on how the company nearly beat Microsoft to LinkedIn.
