Vehicle sales in the United States are running at a record pace, prompting automakers to consider ways to capitalize on the boom times.One of their strategies is becoming increasingly clear. Automakers are quickly expanding their product lineups, introducing a blitz of new models in virtually every market segment — from giant sport utility vehicles to compact electric cars.Many of the latest offerings were on display on Wednesday at the media previews for the New York International Auto Show. Both Nissan and Volkswagen’s Audi luxury brand unveiled high-horsepower sports cars, and Ford’s Lincoln division showed a new version of its full-size Navigator S.U.V. At the other end of the spectrum, Hyundai introduced a new sedan devoted to hybrid and electric power.The parade of new models provide another reminder of the striking turnaround in the auto industry. Just a few years ago, after a deep recession, automakers faced major restructuring, including the government-backed bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler.AdvertisementBack then, the goal was to pare back brands and models to save money. But now, with most companies posting big profits, they are splurging on new investments and technology.AdvertisementAnd with the industry coming off record sales of 17.5 million vehicles last year in the United States, no automaker wants to be underrepresented in hot segments like small S.U.V.s, or even niche products, such as sports cars.“The industry as a whole has never been as healthy as it is now,” said Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan and Renault. “It’s a very favorable environment.”Nissan, which has enjoyed strong sales of its mainstream cars and S.U.V.s, is adding to its lineup with new versions of its GT-R sports car and Titan pickup truck. The goal, Mr. Ghosn said, is to increase market share in the robust American market.“Market share is a result of the investment that you do,” said Mr. Ghosn. “We’re doing all this investment to get a good return by having a bigger piece of the pie.”Industry sales so far this year are running ahead of the pace set in 2015. But there are concerns among Wall Street analysts that automakers may fall back into bad habits such as overproduction or subsidizing sales with heavy incentives.Some analysts have cautioned that the sales cycle may be peaking and maybe even headed for an inevitable downturn.“The sales results in the U.S. so far this year have been positive, but there remains a question of when will the next shoe drop,” said Jack R. Nerad, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.AdvertisementAnalysts point out troubling signs that the industry is trying to prop up sales. Some carmakers, for example, are pushing slower-selling models with more discounts and cheap leases, and are making mostly cosmetic changes to older vehicles to freshen their appeal.

Audi, for example, introduced a convertible version of its R8 sports car powered by a huge V10 engine.Audi executives say companies need to stretch their product portfolios to appeal to the specific tastes of various consumers.“We are seeing more fragmented market segments, so we have to come up with new concepts,” said Dietmar Voggenreiter, a member of Audi’s board of management.AdvertisementOther companies are simply eager to enter segments that are dominated by competitors.The Korean carmaker Hyundai competes head-on with Toyota in many passenger car and S.U.V. categories. But the company did not have a product to rival Toyota’s top-selling line of Prius hybrids, powered by a combination of gasoline engines and batteries.On Wednesday, Hyundai introduced its new Ioniq sedan that will be available in hybrid, plug-in hybrid and pure electric versions. The automaker is also ramping up its luxury Genesis brand to broaden its clientele of wealthier consumers.Yet even as Hyundai and others step up their offerings of hybrids and electric vehicles, leaders in various segments continue to broaden their own lineups to stay ahead.Toyota has dominated hybrid sales for years with the Prius, but the company recently introduced a new generation of the basic model and, on Wednesday, introduced a new variation called Prius Prime.Among other things, Prius Prime lets drivers operate the vehicle solely on battery power, in addition to its traditional hybrid mode. The car is also packed with autonomous features like parking assistance and cameras that monitor blind spots in the driver’s field of vision.Toyota calls the vehicle the most technologically advanced hybrid on the market — serving notice that it will keep investing to stay ahead of the competition.A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Soaring Profits Produce Parade of New Cars.
