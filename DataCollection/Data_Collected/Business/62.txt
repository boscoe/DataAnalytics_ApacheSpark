AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedThe First Data Corporation said on Thursday that it would seek to raise up to $3.2 billion when it goes public, as it pursues what will be one of the biggest stock market debuts this year.The company, a credit card and payments processor, said in an amended prospectus that it planned to sell shares at $18 to $20 each. At the midpoint of its expected price range, the company would be valued at about $16.7 billion.First Data’s owner, the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, took the company private during the leveraged buyout boom eight years ago.Still, in going public, First Data will become one of the last major leveraged buyouts to hit the public markets and help its owner make an exit. Private equity firms have rushed to hold initial offerings for their companies over the last five years, spurred on by huge gains in the stock markets.Some significant buyout targets still remain privately held. Among them are Clear Channel Communications, the broadcaster now rebranded as iHeartMedia, and Toys “R” Us, which K.K.R. bought with Bain Capital and Vornado.First Data is going public at a relatively quiet time for initial offerings. About 138 I.P.O.s have priced so far this year, down 35 percent from last year, according to data from Renaissance Capital. And those stock sales that were successfully completed have not performed particularly well, on average falling about 5 percent from their offering price.Another company held by private equity firms, Surgery Partners, priced its initial offering well below an expected price range on Wednesday, though the surgical center operator may have suffered from a general decline in health care stocks.Investors and analysts have long awaited the return of First Data, which claims some 4,000 financial institutions as clients and an ability to process more than 2,300 transactions a second.Yet the company has been moving beyond credit card payments as the industry has grown more competitive, with PayPal and Total System Services rolling out their own offerings.K.K.R. is expected to remain First Data’s biggest shareholder though the company’s sale of new shares will reduce the private equity firm’s stake to roughly 60 percent from 75 percent.First Data will use its share of the proceeds from the I.P.O. to pay down debt.The company is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange around the middle of the month, under the ticker symbol “FDC.”Its offering is being led by Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and K.K.R.’s own capital markets arm.Advertisement
