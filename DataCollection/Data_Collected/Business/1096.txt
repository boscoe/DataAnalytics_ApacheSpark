PARIS — Crédit Agricole and Société Générale, two of France’s largest banks, reported higher third-quarter profits on Thursday as their retail divisions posted improved results.Crédit Agricole, which ranks second only to BNP Paribas among French lenders in terms of assets, posted net income of 930 million euros, about $1 billion, for the three months from July through September, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier. Its revenue slipped 2 percent to €3.9 billion, it said, though it noted that the figure was broadly stable after accounting for a revaluation of its own debt, loan hedges and other items. It said most business lines had improved, particularly domestic and international retail banking.Société Générale reported a rise in net income of nearly 28 percent from the year-earlier quarter, at €1.1 billion. Revenue rose 8.3 percent to €6.4 billion.The lender said that its French and international retail banking divisions had performed solidly, but that “challenging market conditions” had hurt its investment banking unit, where net income slid 30 percent to €320 million. A one-time accounting gain from the revaluation of its own debt gave the bank a €447 million lift to the bottom line.AdvertisementBoth banks’ earnings were better than most analysts had expected, but the fate of their shares diverged sharply in morning trading, with Crédit Agricole tumbling 6 percent and Société Générale rising more than 5 percent.AdvertisementJon Peace, an analyst at Nomura in London, said the share movement had “a lot to do with investor positioning,” as analysts had been expecting Société Générale’s difficult quarter in equities trading “but hadn’t anticipated a strong performance from the retail bank” to offset it.He noted that Société Générale had also reaffirmed that it would pay its 50 percent dividend in cash, while Crédit Agricole would pay its dividend in shares, “a reminder it still needs to build its capital ratios.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It agreed in October to a $787 million settlement with federal and New York State authorities related to an investigation into dollar-denominated transactions that it carried out with Sudan and other countries on a United States blacklist. It said that it had already made provisions against that penalty, and that it would “therefore have no impact on the financial statements for the second half of 2015.”As part of that pact, it also agreed to improve its internal controls, but unlike BNP Paribas, which stumbled badly in its handling of a similar matter, Crédit Agricole managed to avoid criminal charges in the United States.On Wednesday, Crédit Agricole announced that its chairman, Jean-Marie Sander, was stepping down to make way for Dominique Lefebvre, who holds the job of chairman at two Crédit Agricole business units, Rue La Boétie and Fédération Nationale du Crédit Agricole.The two banks are also in the process of taking Amundi Group, an asset management company, public; in that deal, Crédit Agricole will continue to hold about 75 percent of Amundi while Société Générale will sell its shares to investors. Amundi had strong inflows of €19 billion in the third quarter, the banks said on Thursday.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
