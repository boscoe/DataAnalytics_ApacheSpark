The insurance was meant to cover monthly payments on mortgages or credit cards if a consumer was unable to make the payments, for reasons like a debilitating illness or loss of job.But the Financial Conduct Authority eventually determined that the complex pricing and detailed policy conditions for eligibility for payments under the insurance plan made the product inappropriate for some consumers. The agency took the industry to court over the matter in 2011, and the banks opted to settle with the government.A process was set up in which the banks sent out letters and reviewed complaints that came in. If they reject a complaint and claim for redress, a mediator — the Financial Ombudsman Service — can review it and try to resolve the dispute.The volume of claims has far surpassed the lenders’ original estimates and the number of claims has not fallen as quickly as expected, in part because of the rise of management companies, which seek compensation on behalf of consumers for a fee.The Financial Conduct Authority announced in January that it would review the efforts that banks have made to compensate consumers and would examine whether further intervention, including possibly setting a claims deadline, is appropriate.On Friday, the Financial Conduct Authority said its review found that a “high and growing proportion” of complaints were being made recently by management agencies and that they were related to older sales of the insurance, for which there is less documentary evidence of the circumstances of the sale.The regulator also said that, more recently, a significant proportion of complaints “turn out not to have involved a P.P.I. sale.”The continued pace of new claims has forced the country’s biggest banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and the Lloyds Banking Group, to set aside additional reserves and routinely discuss the pace of claims on their earnings calls.Lloyds, one of the biggest providers of the the loan insurance, was fined 117 million pounds, or $177 million, in June over its handling of customer complaints related to the product. Lloyds has set aside more than £13 billion to cover claims, including adding £1.4 billion to its reserves in the second quarter.António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, has called payment protection insurance the lender’s biggest “legacy issue.”Advertisement
