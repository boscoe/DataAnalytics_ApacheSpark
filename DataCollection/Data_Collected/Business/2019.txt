The Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that fuel economy rose in 2014 by 0.2 m.p.g., from 24.1 m.p.g. in 2013, as the benefits of technical improvements were nearly offset by resurgent consumer demand for larger vehicles. That is a second straight year of modest gains after efficiency improved a more robust 1.2 m.p.g. from 2011 to 2012. Still, automakers exceeded overall federal targets by a wide margin. Chris Grundler, director of the agency’s Office of Air Quality and Transportation, predicted slow growth again for 2015. Advertisement
