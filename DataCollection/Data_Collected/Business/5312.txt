Noticeably absent was any reference to the industry’s strong support for strict uniform oversight and strong disclosure requirements for the type of reinsurance arrangements explored in the piece. Life insurers recognize the premium placed on financial strength and transparency.Reinsurance transactions with affiliated subsidiaries, while complex, require at least one regulator, and in most cases two regulators to approve of the transactions, and they do so with all the necessary financial information at their disposal.This includes public and nonpublic information. Regulators also readily consult independent financial analysts to review the transactions if necessary. These well-vetted transactions have not put individual companies or the industry at risk.Most important, life insurers remain firmly committed to keeping their promises to policyholders today and in the future.Paul GrahamWashington, April 12  The writer is senior vice president and chief actuary of the American Council of Life Insurers.To the Editor:I retired as a successful insurance broker 25 years ago. In my day, every state maintained an insurance guaranty fund, and I believe these mechanisms are still in force throughout the country.What was overlooked in the article was any reference to these guarantees, which provide another taxpayer bailout in the event of default.In my day, captive reinsurers were just beginning to proliferate, and frankly, even as an expert in the field, I had no understanding of the potential catastrophes as described.Kudos to Mary Williams Walsh.Warren G.
