A spokesman for Nissan, Steve Yaeger, said the automaker was aware of one crash.Nissan told federal regulators in the report posted Friday that it would shorten the trim piece because “in certain rare instances, a driver’s shoe could contact the edge of the center console lower trim panel and potentially impede smooth pedal operation.”Nissan said that beginning in March it shortened the plastic panel on new vehicles but it did not consider the snagging to be a safety problem. Instead, it told regulators that it would have a “service campaign” and would trim the panel on older models.But regulators insisted on a recall, which is more demanding and includes requiring an automaker to report completion rates with the possibility of fines for failing to follow federal regulations.Advertisement
