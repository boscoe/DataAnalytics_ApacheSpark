Executives were feeling bullish early this week at the nation’s biggest retail trade show. James Curleigh, president of the Levi’s brand, crooned the Beatles’ “Revolution” in front of hundreds of his peers at a packed New York convention center. Robert B. Harrison, an executive at Macy’s, boasted that his company was set to surpass Netflix to become the seventh-largest online retailer in the country. Kip Tindell, the Container Store’s chief executive, declared retailing “the greatest occupation there is.”Then on Wednesday the Commerce Department struck a far gloomier note.Retail sales unexpectedly dropped 0.9 percent in December compared with the previous month, according to figures released on Wednesday, suggesting that falling gas prices and a brighter job market have yet to lift consumer spending.The decrease, far worse than economists’ median forecast of a decline of 0.1 percent, followed a smaller-than-expected gain of 0.4 percent in November. The weak spending numbers could prompt economists to be more pessimistic in their outlook for economic growth this year.The headline figure for December is misleading because it includes gasoline prices, which are sliding. Once gas and automobile sales are excluded, retail spending fell 0.3 percent, but even that dip still suggests consumers saved the extra money instead of spending it. Economists had expected sales excluding gas and autos to jump 0.5 percent.AdvertisementSales in electronics stores and at clothing and department stores fell in December’s broad retreat. One factor weighing on consumer sentiment has been wage growth, which has been sluggish despite falling unemployment.Advertisement“We had a very conflicted consumer this holiday season,” said Steve Barr, United States retail and consumer sector leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers. He said lower-income households still struggled to spend more despite the lower gas prices, because any money saved was offset by cost-of-living increases. Sluggish wage growth continued to limit demand, he said.“Retailers responded with a much earlier start to the holiday season and heavy promotions,” Mr. Barr said. “Now you worry whether they’ve permanently conditioned the consumer to expect deep discounts.”Still, the National Retail Federation, the trade group that hosted this week’s show, said it saw signs of optimism among consumers. Though the federation also reported a slowdown in sales in December, it said on Wednesday that spending overall for November and December rose 4 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, to $616.1 billion, the fastest rate of growth since 2011.Nonstore holiday sales, an indicator of online purchases, grew 6.8 percent to $101.9 billion, according to the federation.“There is every reason to believe that we have moved well beyond the days of consumer pessimism and that the trajectory for retailers continues to point up,” said Matthew R. Shay, the trade group’s chief executive.

And compared with the same month last year, overall retail spending grew 3.2 percent, the data showed, with gains in all retail categories except department stores and gas stations.Full-year figures for consumer spending painted an even more upbeat picture, with retail sales rising 4 percent in 2014 compared with the previous year, led by an almost 9 percent surge in auto sales. Spending on building materials and home furnishings also increased significantly, reflecting strong home sales. Shoes and clothing purchases, together with electronics sales, managed growth of under 3 percent for the year.“It’s a no-brainer. It’s going to be a better year for the consumer in 2015,” Paula Campbell Roberts, a consumer analyst at Morgan Stanley, said before the data’s release. She said that lower gas prices alone had brought consumers a windfall of $50 billion in the fourth quarter, and that they could expect $80 billion more in the first quarter.“That’s income that’s not having to be devoted to putting gas in our gas tanks and we can spend elsewhere,” she said.“It’s true that wage growth has been sluggish,” she added. “But we know that with each passing month, labor markets are getting tighter.” She said she expected wages to grow at an average clip of about 2.5 percent in 2015, slightly faster than the 2 percent logged last year.Some retailers have fared better than others. Family Dollar said last week that its same-store sales dropped 0.4 percent in the final quarter, despite analysts’ projections of healthy gains. The company added, however, that comparable sales for December rose 1.2 percent. At the other end of the spectrum, Tiffany & Company said that same-store sales over the holidays dipped 1 percent, a result the jeweler’s chief executive, Michael J. Kowalski, called “disappointing overall.”Still, Urban Outfitters said holiday sales rose a robust 4 percent, while they rose 3.7 percent at J. C. Penney and 2.7 percent at Macy’s. RetailMetrics, which tracks retail sales data, said it estimated that fourth-quarter earnings at the 122 retailers it tracks grew a steady 7.5 percent.“Consumers’ real disposable cash flows are surging, confidence is high and rising, and the labor market is recovering at an astonishing rate,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a research note. “There is no reason to think the dip in the core is anything other than noise.”A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Americans Pocketing What They Save on Gas, Retail Data Suggests.
