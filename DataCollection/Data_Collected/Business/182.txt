DETROIT —  The United Automobile Workers union has set a Wednesday-night deadline for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to agree to a new contract or risk a nationwide strike by the company’s 36,000 hourly workers.In a letter to the company on Tuesday, the union said it would stop extending its previous four-year contract, which expired last month, at 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday.Fiat Chrysler confirmed that it had received what it called a strike notification from the union but emphasized that negotiations were continuing.The strike deadline, while not unexpected, will intensify bargaining that began last week after 65 percent of Fiat Chrysler workers rejected a tentative agreement proposed jointly by the company and the union leadership.AdvertisementDennis Williams, the union’s president, has vowed to get a revised agreement that addresses workers’ concerns about health care changes, product commitments at various plants and a divisive two-tier wage system.Advertisement“You have spoken and we have heard you,” Mr. Williams told workers in a message posted Monday on the union’s website. “We have been listening to your issues and concerns.”Mr. Williams and his negotiating team have come under fire by workers for failing to persuade Fiat Chrysler to agree to a cap on the number of lower-paid workers.More than 40 percent of the company’s factory workers are considered entry-level employees and are paid $16 to $19 an hour, compared with $28 for veteran workers.The initial agreement included raises for the lower-tier employees of up to $25 an hour over the course of the four-year deal, as well as raises for longtime workers to nearly $30 an hour.But the deal did not put a limit on entry-level jobs or offer any possibility that a worker hired at lower pay could move up to top-wage status.Now Mr. Williams is under pressure from his membership to get concessions or call the first strike against a Detroit automaker in eight years.
                Chrysler, founded in 1925, has had a tumultuous history as the third-largest of Detroit’s auto companies.            In 2007, the union held brief strikes at General Motors and what was then the Chrysler Corporation during negotiations on a new contract. The walkout at G.M. lasted two days before a deal was reached, and the strike at Chrysler ended in less than eight hours.AdvertisementIn his message to members, Mr. Williams pledged to communicate more openly and to post “more facts and explanations” to help them understand the challenges of reaching a better deal with Fiat Chrysler.“We are also going to tell the whole story,” he said. “This is a very serious situation.”He defended the union leadership’s commitment to keep products in American factories and lashed out at speculation that the initial contract proposal allowed the company latitude to move the manufacturing of some car models to Mexico.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Since it reached that limit this year, the company has begun promoting hundreds of workers to top-wage status.But the caps at G.M. and Fiat Chrysler were removed as part of the conditions set by the federal government when it bailed out both companies in 2009.AdvertisementIn the bailout talks, the union also agreed to relinquish the right to strike at G.M. or Fiat Chrysler — until this year’s contract negotiations.A version of this article appears in print on October 7, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: U.A.W. Warns Fiat Chrysler to Make Deal or Face Strike.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
