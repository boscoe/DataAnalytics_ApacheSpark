Thus, the company lowered its projected sales and profit growth for the full year.Campbell is just the latest in a string of big, mainstream food companies to report disappointing earnings this year. Such companies have had trouble keeping up with the shift in consumer eating patterns away from processed and packaged foods to fresh fruits and vegetables and grab-and-go prepared foods.“We are well aware of the consumer distrust of Big Food,” Ms. Morrison said this month at the annual Cagny Conference hosted by investment analysts.Analysts on a conference call Wednesday seemed most concerned with the deterioration of the company’s gross profit margins, which it attributed largely to inflation and promotional activity. Gross margins fell to 32.6 percent of sales from 35.7 percent of sales in the same period in 2014.“We’ve seen some pretty significant erosion,” said Andrew Lazar, an analyst for Barclays. “Are they low or are they a new, more reasonable base from which you try and improve going forward?”Anthony DiSilvestro, Campbell’s chief financial officer, said that the restructuring plan the company announced recently, which aims to pare $200 million out of its cost structure, should help bolster profitability.Like other big food companies, Campbell has tried raising prices on some of its products with limited success. Consumers are more attuned to prices than ever, thanks to mobile apps and other tools that help them make comparisons and track changes.Bolthouse Farms, a fresh juice and salad dressing business that Campbell bought in 2012, has yet to pay off significantly.Campbell has come out with a new blueberry and vanilla almond milk under the Bolthouse label, as well as a new “ultra premium” cold-pressed juice called 1915.It also recently took the wraps off a line of organic soups, and Ms. Morrison said retailers have welcomed the company’s premium soups. “We’ve gotten four feet extra from premium soups in the stores, which has enabled us to expand Slow Kettle and boxed soups, and for our new organic soup,” she said.Advertisement
