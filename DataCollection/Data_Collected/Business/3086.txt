The news from the Monetary Authority of Singapore comes as central banks around the world have taken action in recent weeks to ease policies amid steep falls in the price of oil and broader economic uncertainty.Singapore’s central bank said it would slow the pace of appreciation of the dollar within a targeted band, citing recent developments in both global and domestic environments. The currency of Singapore, a city-state, is set against a basket of currencies within an undisclosed range. Adjusting its currency is one of the government’s main policy tools.The currency dropped 1.4 percent to 1.35 Singapore dollars against the United States dollar on Wednesday, its lowest level in more than four years.Several governments have shocked global markets recently with a series of policy changes. Central banks in Denmark, Canada and India unexpectedly cut rates this month, and Switzerland removed a cap on its currency, the franc. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, announced that it would begin a program to buy government bonds in an attempt to pump money into the eurozone.Central banks in China and South Korea also cut borrowing costs last year.These policy actions may have helped prompt Singapore’s central bank to take action, analysts at the bank HSBC said Wednesday.“This has perhaps led to concerns that Singapore’s exports — both in goods and crucially in services as well — would feel competitive pressure, especially from other Asian economies,” the analysts said in a note to clients.On Wednesday, the central bank also cut its inflation forecast for 2015, saying that the outlook had “shifted significantly” because of lower oil prices. Declines in the price of oil have led to a sharp fall in import prices.For several years, Singapore has felt the impact of slowing global economic growth. Its economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, roughly half the pace of the previous quarter, the central bank said. The Singapore economy is expected to grow 2 to 4 percent in 2015.Advertisement
