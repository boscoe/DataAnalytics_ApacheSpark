AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael CieplySony Pictures Entertainment has a new idea — or maybe a very old one — for its sticky superhero, Spider-Man: He’s going graphic, with an animated feature.Born in a Marvel comic book in 1962 and featured in a string of live-action movies since, Spider-Man will be the hero of an animated movie to be created by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the studio’s motion picture group chairman, Tom Rothman, told the crowd at Cinemacon, an exhibitors convention in Las Vegas, on Wednesday.Mr. Lord and Mr. Miller are known for “The Lego Movie” and “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,” but they have also directed live-action films like Sony’s “22 Jump Street,” which was released last June.The animated film, Mr. Rothman said, will be released on July 20, 2018, and will have Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Amy Pascal as producers. Mr. Lord and Mr. Miller will write a treatment for the film and join in producing it, according to a statement from the studio.The statement did not tip the story line or title, but said it would “exist independently” of a live-action “Spider-Man” that is being produced by Ms. Pascal and by Kevin Feige of Marvel Entertainment, for release on July 28, 2017.Advertisement
