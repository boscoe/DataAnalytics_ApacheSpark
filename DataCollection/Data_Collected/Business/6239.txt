WASHINGTON —  Sales of existing homes in the United States slipped in April, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday, mainly because of relatively few listings and rising prices.The Realtors group said sales of existing homes fell 3.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million. April was the second consecutive month in which the sales rate topped five million homes. Purchases have recovered from a disappointing 2014 because strong job growth and low mortgage rates have generated more potential buyers.

Only 5.3 months’ supply of homes is on the market, versus an average of six months in a healthy market. The number of listings actually tumbled 0.9 percent in April compared with a year ago.The tight supplies have caused properties to fly off the market and prices to rocket upward. The median home sold in just 39 days last month, compared with 52 days in March and 62 days in February. Sales levels dropped in the Northeast, South and West, but they edged up 1.7 percent in the Midwest.

But they cautioned that the pickup in activity could be moderate, given that the April surge in the index was driven by a big jump in applications for building permits while other components of the index showed more modest increases.AdvertisementSeven of the 10 forward-pointing indicators that make up the index showed strength in April. The largest increase came from the surge in building permits, followed by changes in interest rates.An index of factory orders declined, while average weekly manufacturing hours and new orders for consumer goods were unchanged in April.The Labor Department said weekly applications for unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 274,000. The four-week average, a less volatile figure, fell to a fresh 15-year low of 266,250. The number of applications remains at a level that is consistent with a healthy job market.A version of this article appears in print on May 22, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Rise in Prices Pushes Home Sales Down.
