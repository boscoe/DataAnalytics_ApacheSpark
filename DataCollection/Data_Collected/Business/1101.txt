HOUSTON —  When the Obama administration began considering the Keystone XL pipeline seven years ago, oil production in the United States was falling and most analysts thought it would never recover. At the same time, Mexican oil production was also in decline, meaning that domestic refineries would soon need another source of crude.Canada, and its expanding oil sands industry, seemed like the perfect solution. But so much has changed in the oil patch since then that many energy experts say the Keystone pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected on Friday, matters far less than it once did.Domestic production has nearly doubled and has flooded the market with so much crude oil that prices have plummeted. Refineries along the Gulf Coast still need the heavy crude Canada produces, but they are finding new ways to obtain it, and storage facilities are filled to the brim.“Keystone XL is not nearly as important as it seemed to be a few years ago,” said Rusty Braziel, the president of RBN Energy, a consulting firm. “For Gulf refineries it is not a huge deal.”
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            In just the past three years, two million barrels of new crude pipeline capacity has been built around the Gulf of Mexico region, and more pipelines are on the way, capable of transporting Canadian crude along with domestic oil.AdvertisementRail connections from Canada, built to move oil in part because of the Keystone delays, have multiplied. And with crude prices expected to stay relatively low for years, the expansion of Canadian oil sands production has slowed.AdvertisementSouth of the border, Mexican officials are putting in place a change in the Constitution to allow foreign oil companies to invest in their fields, opening the possibility of a rebound in Mexican production over the next decade. Even without the Keystone XL, total American imports of Canadian crude — from oil sands as well as more conventional varieties — have increased to 3.8 million barrels a day from 2.5 million barrels a day since 2008 while imports from OPEC countries have plummeted.Still, the pipeline’s proponents see a long-term benefit to building it to transport 830,000 barrels a day, mostly from Canada. Dependence on Canada for energy is less fraught with risk than reliance on countries like Nigeria or Saudi Arabia, proponents say.As Washington debates Keystone XL, here’s how the 1,179-mile pipeline became so political.“It’s ironic that the administration would strike a deal to allow Iranian crude on the global market while refusing to give our closest ally, Canada, access to U.S. refineries,” Jack Gerard, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement.The oil industry has plenty to gain from the pipeline. It would make producers’ considerable investments in Canadian oil sands production more valuable, while ensuring American refineries a secure source of crude for decades. Labor unions joined in the call for the pipeline, pointing to the thousands of jobs that its construction would produce.The domestic shale revolution has mostly produced a flood of light sweet oil, which does not match exactly with the needs of many Gulf of Mexico refineries which were intended to process heavy Mexican, Venezuelan and Canadian crude.But the landscape in the refinery business has changed as well in recent years as refineries have invested heavily to take the new local output. That has enabled the refiners around Houston to reduce their imports of medium and heavy crude to 900,000 barrels a day in July from an average of 1.4 million barrels a day in 2010, a new RBN Energy report found.The biggest change has been the construction of pipelines not named Keystone XL in the United States.AdvertisementThe Obama administration, for example, approved a shorter section of the pipeline connecting the storage field in Cushing, Okla., with Texas refineries, allowing an increase in both Canadian and domestic shipments of 700,000 barrels a day. At the same time, Enbridge and Enterprise Partners expanded a separate pipeline system, called Seaway, which can now deliver 850,000 barrels a day from Cushing to the Gulf refinery hub.That means, energy experts said, that American consumers should not feel a difference.“In terms of distribution and what people will pay, Keystone doesn’t really mean much,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service. He said more Canadian oil “will go by rail to some places or by pipeline to others.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
