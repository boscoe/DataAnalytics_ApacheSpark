David Carr, a media columnist for The New York Times, died on Thursday. His style was sometimes blunt, almost always searingly honest — a voice from a shrewd and well-informed skeptic. “He was the finest media reporter of his generation, a remarkable and funny man who was one of the leaders of our newsroom,” Dean Baquet, The Times’s executive editor, wrote shortly after Mr. Carr’s death.
