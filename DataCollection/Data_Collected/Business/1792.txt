Boeing, however, was in good shape to retain its title as the world’s largest jetliner producer as Airbus, a European company, continued to lag on deliveries. Airbus Group shares rose 2.9 percent; Boeing was virtually unchanged. On Monday, Airbus said it had sold 169 aircraft in November, bringing the gross 2015 total to 1,079. After cancellations and model conversions, the net was 1,007. That compares with Boeing’s 655 gross orders between Jan. 1 and Dec. 2, giving it 568 after cancellations. Airbus handed over 556 aircraft in the first 11 months, including 10 midsize A350s and 24 A380 superjumbos. Boeing remained ahead, with 709 deliveries. Despite the share bounce, analysts said the latest data brought few surprises. But it highlighted Airbus’s stronger position for now in the race for orders of upgraded medium-haul jets, potentially casting a shadow over the unveiling this week of Boeing’s new 737 MAX.
