AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks fell on Tuesday from nominal record highs, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped below 5,000 a day after passing that milestone for the first time since the dot-com era 15 years ago.The losses were modest but broad, with eight industry sectors in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index falling. Higher oil prices helped oil drillers and other energy companies buck the trend. They eked out a 0.2 percent rise for the day.With no major economic news and few earnings reports, investors were at pains to point to a catalyst for the stock slump other than the anxiety that sometime follows big gains.“It’s only natural we would get a little flutter after a milestone like yesterday,” said John Manley, Wells Fargo Funds’ chief equity strategist, referring to the Nasdaq’s closing above 5,000. “It may very well go on for a few days.”The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,203.37. The S.&P. 500 declined 9.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,107.78. The Nasdaq gave up 28.20 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 4,979.90. Ford Motor slumped after reporting United States sales from last month that disappointed investors. Sales fell 1.9 percent as dealers lacked the inventory to meet demand for the new F-150 pickup truck. Ford dropped 40 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $16.17.Oil rose on reports that Saudi Arabia had raised prices for Asian customers and because of fears of rising tensions with Iran after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel addressed Congress. The stock price of several oil drillers surged. Denbury Resources, an oil and gas producer, jumped 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $8.58. With nearly all companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported their fourth-quarter results, earnings per share for companies in the S.&P. 500 index are expected to have risen a healthy 7.7 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ.Financial analysts expect earnings to drop compared with the year-earlier periods for the next two quarters, but that is mostly because of a drag from energy companies. Oil prices have fallen more than 50 percent since last June.Anastasia V. Amoroso, global market strategist for J. P. Morgan Asset Management, said she was not surprised by the pullback. “We’re seeing a market that is fairly valued, earnings are behind us, and no major catalysts are coming up,” she said. “It’s a market ready for a pause.”The slump in the United States followed losses in European markets. The CAC 40 in France and the DAX in Germany each lost 1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain dropped 0.7 percent. On Monday, the Nasdaq rose to about 40 points, not adjusted for inflation, from its 5,048.62 peak reached on March 10, 2000. The index has changed significantly since then. Gone is the heavy weighting of telecommunications stocks and the big bets on Internet companies with little or no earnings.Among other stocks in the news, the personal finance company Springleaf Holdings rose $12.19, or 32 percent, to $50.23 after it said it would buy OneMain Financial from Citigroup for $4.25 billion.
