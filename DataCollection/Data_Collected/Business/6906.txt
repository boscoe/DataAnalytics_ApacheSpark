The study, conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, rated 102 vehicles on how easily a child safety seat could be installed. It focused on the vehicles’ so-called Latch system, which consists of three anchors that the seat is secured to. Only three models received the highest rating of Good: the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz GL-Class and the Volkswagen Passat. Children are safer when in an age-appropriate child restraint, but these are not always easy to install, especially when using a vehicle’s seatbelts. And if the restraint is not properly anchored to the vehicle, a child could be severely injured in a crash. The federally mandated Latch system, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children, was meant to be easier than using seatbelts to attach safety seats. Advertisement
