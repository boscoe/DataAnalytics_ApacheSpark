A judge in Georgia has reduced a $150 million award sought by the jury to $40 million for the family of a 4-year-old boy killed when the 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee in which he was riding was rear-ended and burst into flames, according to orders released on Tuesday. The judge, J. Kevin Chason in Decatur County, said the family of the boy, Remington Walden, should receive $30 million for his wrongful death and $10 million for pain and suffering. He also denied a motion from Chrysler, the vehicle maker, for a new trial, calling the evidence presented against it during a nearly two-week trial this year “overwhelming.” Michael Palese, a spokesman for Chrysler, now a unit of Fiat Chrysler, said the reduced damages did not fix the “many errors” tainting the verdict. A lawyer for the Waldens was not immediately available.A version of this brief appears in print on July 29, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Judge Cuts Award to Family of Boy Killed in Jeep Crash.
