A federal judge on Tuesday certified a class action against the Minneapolis-based retailer Target that had been brought by several banks over a data breach in 2013. Paul A. Magnuson, a United States District Court judge in St. Paul, said the banks could pursue their claims together over the breach, which compromised at least 40 million credit cards during the holiday season. A Target spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said the company was “disappointed” and would evaluate its next steps after reviewing the decision. The ruling makes a settlement with the banks more likely. Four weeks ago, Target agreed to pay as much as $67 million to financial institutions that issue Visa cards, in a deal struck with the credit card network. In May, a proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard fell through.A version of this brief appears in print on September 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ruling Allows Banks to Sue Target Over 2013 Data Breach.
