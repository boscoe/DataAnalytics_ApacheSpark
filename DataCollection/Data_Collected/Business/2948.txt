LONDON — Aer Lingus said on Monday that its board of directors was considering the latest revised takeover bid from the parent of British Airways and the Spanish carrier Iberia, the third time it has been approached since December.Aer Lingus, an Irish carrier, had previously rejected two takeover offers from the parent company, the International Consolidated Airlines Group, the first of which came in mid-December.In its latest bid, the International Consolidated Airlines Group offered to pay 2.55 euros a share, or about $2.86. That is up from its offer of €2.40 a share, which it made on Dec. 29.The Irish carrier’s shares closed at €2.35 in Dublin on Friday.“The revised proposal remains conditional on, amongst other things, confirmatory due diligence, the recommendation of the board of Aer Lingus and the receipt of irrevocable commitments from Ryanair Limited and the minister for finance of Ireland to accept the offer,” Aer Lingus said in a news release.The discount carrier Ryanair holds a 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus and is its largest shareholder, while the Irish government has a 25.1 percent stake.Ryanair has made three unsuccessful offers for Aer Lingus, and it is challenging a ruling by the British competition authorities that it must reduce most of its holdings in its Irish rival.Analysts have said the International Consolidated Airlines Group deal would be attractive, in part because Aer Lingus holds many takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow Airport near London, the main hub of British Airways.Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports, handling more than 191,000 passengers a day. The bulk of them come from international flights, including more lucrative long-haul flights.British Airways is by far the largest airline at Heathrow, accounting for 51.3 percent of all takeoffs and landings there each week, based on current traffic data. Aer Lingus has 3.1 percent.The Irish airline market, given its proximity to Britain and potential to increase British Airways’ traffic at its hub, also makes the deal attractive.The International Consolidated Airlines Group is one of the world’s largest airline groups, carrying more than 77.3 million passengers in 2014. Its portfolio of carriers includes British Airways and two Spanish carriers: Iberia, a full-service airline, and Vueling Airlines, a low-cost carrier.The company posted revenue of €15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014, up 7.4 percent from the period a year earlier.A version of this article appears in print on 01/27/2015, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Revised Offer.
