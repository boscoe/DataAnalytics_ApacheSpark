ABC’s “World News Tonight” was in second place with 9.1 million viewers, also the highest total since March, followed by “CBS Evening News” with 8 million, its biggest number since February.In the 25-to-54 age group, the demographic that is important to advertisers for the evening newscasts, NBC had 2.5 million viewers compared with 2 million for ABC and 1.7 million for CBS. It was NBC’s highest rating in that demographic since February.Mr. Holt, who formally took over “NBC Nightly News” in June after Brian Williams was reassigned to MSNBC, has settled comfortably into the No. 1 position. “Nightly News” has scored the highest viewership among the evening news shows for 22 consecutive weeks, including wins in both the 25-to-54 and 18-to-49 age groups for 17 consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, ABC is scoring its highest viewership totals, season to date, in eight years.Still, viewership for the evening news is not what it once was. Even with the aid of a big breaking news story last week, totals for “Nightly News” and “World News Tonight” were both slightly down from the comparable week in November last year, while “CBS Evening News” ticked up 5 percent year-over-year.CBS also experienced a bump for “60 Minutes” on Nov. 15, with Mr. Pelley leading the show from Paris, two days after the attacks. With a strong lead-in from the New England Patriots-New York Giants game, that edition of “60 Minutes” brought in 18.1 million viewers, its largest viewership since late November of last year.Advertisement
