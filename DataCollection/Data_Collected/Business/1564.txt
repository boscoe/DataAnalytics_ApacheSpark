That suggests consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, has slowed from the third quarter’s brisk pace.The tepid rise in consumer spending could combine with an anticipated drag from a continuing inventory reduction to hold the economy to around a 2 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter.But the economy, which expanded at a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter, could get support from business spending.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.3 percent last month, after rising 0.4 percent in September.Coming on the heels of data this month showing a solid increase in manufacturing output in October, it suggested the worst of the pullback from a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy companies was over.“The surge in core capital goods orders could be a crucial signal that this important sector of the economy may be at a turning point,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief United States economist at TD Securities in New York.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has been slammed by the strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector. The dollar has appreciated 18.1 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since June 2014.The pace of appreciation, however, is gradually slowing. Economists also believe that the bulk of spending cuts by oil field companies like Schlumberger in response to lower crude prices have already been carried out.Economists speculate that rising rents are diverting money from discretionary spending. While consumer sentiment increased in November from October, households continued to fret over their financial prospects, another report showed.But as the labor market continues to tighten, there is optimism that wage growth will pick up and encourage consumers to loosen their purse strings and lift spending.A fourth report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 260,000 for the week ended Nov. 21.Claims have now held below the 300,000 threshold for 38 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years, and remain close to levels last seen in the early 1970s.Strengthening labor market conditions are gradually lifting income. The Commerce Department said personal income increased 0.4 percent last month, following a 0.2 percent gain in September. Wages and salaries shot up 0.6 percent, the largest increase since May.Savings increased to $761.9 billion last month, the highest level since December 2012, from $722.9 billion in September. Higher savings could over time buoy consumer spending.There was still no sign of inflation, which has persistently run below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target.A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent in the 12 months through October after a similar rise in September. Excluding food and energy, the personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 1.3 percent for the 10th straight month.In another report, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes jumped 10.7 percent in October, which could allay concerns of a significant slowdown in housing.Advertisement
