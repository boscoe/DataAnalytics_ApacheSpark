The Carlyle Group reported a loss for the third quarter on Wednesday, in line with other private equity firms, as global market turmoil took a toll on the value of its investment portfolio.The private equity firm, based in Washington, said that its economic net loss, which included unrealized gains and losses, was $128 million compared with an economic net income of $181 million in the third quarter last year.The loss, which amounted to 43 cents a share, was greater than the 35 cent a share loss expected in a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.David M. Rubenstein, Carlyle’s co-chief executive, said the results were largely driven by lower mark-to-market valuations at the end of a volatile period for the markets. Since the end of September, “global markets and valuations have moved higher,” he said. “Our core business trends remain unaffected by these short-term movements.”AdvertisementOther private equity firms reported similar issues during the quarter. On Tuesday, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts reported an economic net loss of $286 million.
