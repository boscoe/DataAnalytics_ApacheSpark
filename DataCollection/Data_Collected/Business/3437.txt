U.S. SEEKS FELONY PLEAS BY BIG BANKS  |  The Justice Department is pushing some of the biggest banks on Wall Street, including American institutions, to plead guilty to criminal charges that they manipulated the prices of foreign currencies, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. In the final stages of a long-running investigation into corruption in the world’s biggest financial market, federal prosecutors have recently informed Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Citigroup that they must enter guilty pleas to settle the cases, according to lawyers briefed on the matter. Additional currency misconduct has surfaced in a New York state investigation, confidential documents show. The documents, excerpts from online chat rooms, suggest that banks designed electronic trading platforms that effectively drove up the price of currencies sold to clients. Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York State’s top financial regulator, initially focused on platforms at Barclays and Deutsche Bank, but he has since also subpoenaed Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, BNP Paribas and Société Générale. None of the banks have been accused of wrongdoing, and they are cooperating with the investigation. Negotiations with the Justice Department are likely to center on which entity will plead guilty: the bank’s parent company, or a subsidiary that housed the misconduct. The banks, which have argued that the wrongdoing was isolated to midlevel employees, prefer that a subsidiary take the fall. The currency case is expected to ensnare traders but not top-level executives.“The developments underscore a broader reality on Wall Street of late: One investigation begets another,” Mr. Protess and Ms. Silver-Greenberg write. In pursuing cases last year against Credit Suisse and BNP Paribas, prosecutors confronted the popular belief that banks had grown so important to the economy that they could not be charged. After those deals set off few if any practical repercussions, prosecutors in the currency case are now demanding pleas from JPMorgan and Citigroup, the lawyers said, in addition to Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland. 

FEMALE CHIEFS AS ACTIVIST TARGETS  |  Only 23 women lead companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, but at least a quarter of them have fallen into the cross hairs of activist investors, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook Column. “What could explain this phenomenon?” he writes. “Are companies led by women truly more likely to be poor performers in need of change? Or do activist investors ‒ all of them men ‒ see women as softer targets?”
The activist investor Nelson Peltz, for instance, has taken aim at Indra K. Nooyi of PepsiCo, Ellen J. Kullman of DuPont and Irene B. Rosenfeld of Mondelez. Starboard Value, another activist fund, has set its sights on Yahoo and Marissa Mayer. “It goes without saying that activist investors have mostly waged campaigns against male chief executives because of the dearth of women at the top ranks of large companies,” Mr. Sorkin writes. “Still, the anomaly remains, raising the question of whether activists are singling out companies led by women.”
Activist investors expressed outrage when asked if they were targeting companies with women at their helms, insisting that a company’s performance was the only factor in their calculus to pursue an investment or activist campaign. But recent research suggests that there may be a subconscious gender bias among activist investors. “Researchers have also shown that executives who are women may be expected to be more likely to compromise and less likely to fight, which, for an activist seeking a role on the board, may make it a more attractive target,” Mr. Sorkin writes.



PUERTO RICO DEBT PLAN IN JEOPARDY  |  Critical elements of Puerto Rico’s plan to avert financial disaster are in jeopardy after a federal judge struck down a law, known as the Recovery Act, that allowed the government to restructure certain debts, DealBook’s Michael Corkery reports. The law was intended to give Puerto Rico’s public corporations protections similar to bankruptcy. The government said on Monday that it planned to appeal the judge’s ruling.
Without the Recovery Act, government officials worry that attempts to gain concessions from creditors and unions at public corporations like the  Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority will dissolve into chaos, Mr. Corkery writes. The court ruling frightened some investors, who worry that the island is running out of ways to escape tens of billions of dollars in debt and a stagnant economy. On Monday, yields on a $3.5 billion bond that the commonwealth issued last March traded as high as 10.23 percent, topping yields on similar Greek bonds. The plunging prices could complicate Puerto Rico’s plans to sell roughly $2 billion in new bonds in the coming months.
Puerto Rican officials ‒ backed by hedge funds that own billions of dollars of the island’s debt ‒ are pushing for federal legislation this week that could allow the commonwealth to approve bankruptcy filings by its municipalities and public corporations. The legal turmoil is also testing the big bet by many of Wall Street’s largest hedge funds and private equity firms that have rushed into the commonwealth’s bonds and now own an estimated 25 percent of Puerto Rico debt.

UBS PROFIT RISES  |  The Swiss bank UBS said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 5 percent on lower legal costs and a tax gain, DealBook’s Chad Bray writes. For the three months that ended Dec. 31, UBS reported profit of 963 million Swiss francs, or about $1.04 billion, from 917 million francs in the period a year earlier. The bank’s fourth-quarter results were helped by a tax benefit of 493 million francs. For the full year, UBS said, its profit rose 13 percent, to 3.6 billion francs.
UBS also booked significantly lower costs for potential litigation and regulatory matters. But as part of its quarterly report, UBS said that it had received inquiries from the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn into the possibility of illegal sales of so-called bearer bonds and other unregistered securities to people in the United States and that it was cooperating in those investigations. The bank also warned that Switzerland’s move in January to abandon measures that held down the value of the franc in relation to the euro could hurt UBS’s profits in the future.
