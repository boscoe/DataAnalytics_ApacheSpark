WASHINGTON — American manufacturing growth improved and private-sector businesses added jobs at a robust pace in June, data released on Wednesday showed.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said on Wednesday that its manufacturing index rose to 53.5 last month from 52.8 in May. Manufacturing activity matched January’s level for the highest this year. Any reading above 50 signals expansion.Manufacturing growth has accelerated for the last two months, evidence that American factories are beginning to adapt and overcome the drags caused by a rise in the dollar’s value and cheaper oil prices, two trends that date to last fall.The gauge of new orders rose slightly to 56 from 55.8. But manufacturers are responding to the increased demand by hiring more workers, as the employment measure increased to 55.5 from 51.7, a sign that many companies expect additional orders in the coming months and are hiring in advance.Advertisement“When it goes up like that, it’s in anticipation of future orders,” said Bradley Holcombe, chairman of I.S.M.’s manufacturing business survey committee.AdvertisementNot every element of the index reflected growth. The index’s measure of production slipped to 54 from 54.5.Of the 18 industries surveyed, four reported contracting in June: petroleum and coal products, primary metals, plastics and rubber products, and machinery.

The stronger dollar made American goods more expensive overseas, which is weighing on sales.Still, the negative consequences of those two trends seem to be tailing off.The increase in the index “indicates that the drag on factories coming from the strong U.S. dollar and weak oil industry is no longer having as much negative impact as before,” said Michael Gregory, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That is the most since December.The report buoys evidence that rising consumer spending and a healthy housing market are supporting more hiring. Americans have spent freely in recent months, and home sales are running at their best pace in eight years. Construction firms added 19,000 jobs last month, while retail, shipping and utility companies gained 50,000.On Thursday, the government will issue its official jobs report for June. Economists forecast that it will show that employers added 233,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent from 5.5 percent.The ADP survey covers only private businesses, however, and frequently diverges from the official figures. In May, the government said employers created 280,000 new jobs, much more than the ADP estimate.AdvertisementCompanies with fewer than 50 employees accounted for half the total job gains, adding 120,000 jobs. Medium-size businesses, with 50 to 499 workers, gained 86,000, and large companies hired 32,000 new workers.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
