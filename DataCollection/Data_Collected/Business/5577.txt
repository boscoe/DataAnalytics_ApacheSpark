The market slumped Monday as investors looked to a flood of earnings reports this week.Stocks appeared headed for new highs in the morning, but drifted lower in the afternoon as health care companies dropped sharply. Mylan, a maker of generic drugs, fell nearly 6 percent. It was a downbeat note for the market after strong gains last week.With little news and stocks at highs, “I think we have some profit-taking here,” said Philip Orlando, chief stock strategist of Federated Investors, as shares started to decline in the afternoon.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,037.97.

Investors are anxious because falling oil prices and a strengthening dollar have hurt first-quarter results at some companies. Per-share earnings for the S.&P. 500 are expected to fall 0.8 percent from a year earlier, according to S&P Capital IQ, a provider of financial data.AdvertisementThat would be the first drop since 2009, though it is better than the 2.4 percent drop many predicted two months ago.Investors also are worried about the stronger dollar, which makes money generated overseas worth less when translated back into American currency. Companies can compensate by cutting costs, but that is not easy given previous reductions.“We’re at the point in the cycle where revenue needs to pick up, but it’s not,” said David M. Lebovitz, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. “I’m not so sure companies can slash their way to earnings; they’re running pretty leanly.”

Investors were encouraged by news that Greece had reshuffled its team that is negotiating a bailout, raising hopes that it can avert a default.Some see the shake-up as a way to reduce the clout of the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who has been criticized for failing to put together a list of changes that Greece’s European creditors want before they release new loans. Greece’s government is expected to run out of money to pay its bills in a few weeks.AdvertisementThe Greek stock index rallied on the news, closing up 4.4 percent. France’s CAC-40 index rose 1.3 percent and Germany’s DAX jumped 1.9 percent.
