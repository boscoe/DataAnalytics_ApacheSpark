LONDON — The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Friday that it had updated all customer accounts after a technology failure this week that meant about 600,000 transactions were not processed.The lender, which is based in Edinburgh, said on Wednesday that an overnight technology problem had left some customers’ transactions, including direct debits and other payments, unprocessed.The disruption affected the company’s R.B.S., National Westminster Bank, Coutts and Ulster Bank brands.“We can confirm that the issues customers were experiencing in relation to delayed credits and debits have now been resolved and accounts have been updated,” an R.B.S. spokeswoman said on Friday in an emailed statement. “We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience and distress that this has caused our customers.”AdvertisementThe bank, which is 80 percent owned by the British government, has pledged that no customer would “be left out of pocket” as a result of the technology failure.R.B.S. has experienced other embarrassing technical problems in recent years.The most notable was a failure that left millions of customers unable to access their accounts for several weeks in 2012. As a result, the lender was fined 56 million pounds, or about $89 million, by British regulators last year.AdvertisementR.B.S., which announced an extensive reshaping in February in hopes of simplifying the business and turning around the lender, is expected to complete a program this year to increase investment in its information technology systems by £750 million.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
