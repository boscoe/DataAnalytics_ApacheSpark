Crew’s smaller but fast-growing hipster brand, is recalling about 50,900 pairs of sandals in the United States and Canada because they may cause wearers to trip and fall.A metal shank could dislodge and break through the bottom of the sandals, creating a fall hazard, according to a recall notice issued on Thursday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and linked to from Madewell’s website.Madewell had received eight reports of the shanks dislodging and breaking through the sole, but no injuries had been reported, the notice said.The footwear recall is an embarrassment for Madewell, the brainchild of Mickey Drexler, J. Crew Group’s chief executive. Since Madewell’s introduction in 2006 as J. Crew’s slightly cheaper sister brand, it has amassed a following among younger women seeking quality clothes and accessories with a vintage twist.Footwear recalls are rare. Only a few are issued each year in the United States. In May, Rocky Brands recalled about 1,800 Chinese-made rubber boots designed to guard against snake bites, after a Rocky Brands contractor suffered injuries from a snake bite while wearing them.Affected by the Madewell recall were the “Sightseer” sandals from the brand’s spring 2015 collection, which were manufactured in Brazil, according to the recall notice.The sandals were sold in the brand’s stores, on the Madewell website and on shopbop.com from February 2015 to July 2015. The price ranged from $60 to $80.The style number is on a sticker on the sole of the sandal, the notice says. Consumers were advised to immediately stop wearing the sandals and to contact Madewell to return them for a full refund.Advertisement
