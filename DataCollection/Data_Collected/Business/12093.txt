The stock market reversed steep declines and ended slightly higher on Wednesday, thanks in part to a pickup in oil and gas stocks.Indexes continue to be weighed down by bank stocks, which remain under pressure because of economic unease and worries about the amount of loans on their books to struggling oil and gas companies.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 8.53 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,929.80, and the Nasdaq composite rose 39.02 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,542.61. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 53.21 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,484.99.Stocks had been lower earlier in the day, with the Dow down as much as 265 points. However, as oil prices recovered through the day, so did energy stocks and the broader market.

After being down nearly 4 percent earlier, oil closed up 28 cents, or 1 percent, to $32.15 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price oil internationally, rose $1.14, or 3.4 percent, to $34.41 a barrel in London. The energy component of the S.&P. 500, which had been down roughly 2 percent, closed up 1 percent.Advertisement“As goes oil, so goes everything,” said Ian Winer, co-head of equities trading at Wedbush Securities.AdvertisementThe market’s only area of weakness by the end of trading was the financial sector. Bank stocks had some of the biggest losses, and the financial services component of the S.&P. 500 lost 0.8 percent.Despite substantial gains in recent days, many investors remain hesitant, analysts say. Bank stocks are often a proxy for how well the economy is expected to do, because loans can sour during a slowdown. While oil rose on Wednesday, downward pressure on commodity prices has not relented.

Crude fell 4 percent on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, told a meeting of energy leaders in Houston that production cuts aimed at supporting falling crude prices wouldn’t work. He said that the market should instead let some operators go out of business.“Fundamentally, there’s nothing that shows the U.S. economy is faltering here,” said David Kelly, chief investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. “But people continue to be worried about low commodity prices, and there is general unease that has lingered from how the markets started this year.”Bond prices fell.
