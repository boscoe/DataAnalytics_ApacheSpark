Now the industrial conglomerate is potentially becoming even smaller.The company said on Thursday that it was exploring a sale of its asset management arm as part of its plan to focus on its core manufacturing operations.Any move to sell GE Asset Management would be separate from the sale of GE Capital, a huge endeavor that will involve disposing of hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of assets.But the company said that disposing of the asset management business — which includes its own pension plan and oversees $115 billion worth of assets — would be complementary.“GE Asset Management has world-class investment capabilities and an experienced, talented team that has done a terrific job managing assets for benefit plans serving G.E. employees and retirees, as well as other investors,” Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Over time, there has been significant interest from premier investment firms in acquiring G.E.A.M., reflecting its reputation and attractiveness to others in the asset management industry. As we continue to transform G.E. to focus on our industrial core, now is the right time to explore such a sale.”G.E. said that it was looking for another investment manager to buy the asset management arm but that it would retain responsibility as the sponsor of the corporate pension plan.Proceeds from any sale would be put into G.E.’s pension trust.Credit Suisse will advise G.E. on the sales process.Advertisement
