Stalwarts like General Electric and Hewlett-Packard have spun off or said they would spin off often slower-growing divisions into separate publicly traded companies, arguing that doing so gives each business more clarity and operating focus.For Johnson Controls, parting with its automotive business, which manufactures seating and other interior parts for cars, would remove a division that generated about $22 billion in sales in its 2014 fiscal year, or more than half of its yearly revenue.But this business has shown signs of slowing growth. In Johnson Controls’ most recent quarter, it said revenue from its automotive line rose just 1 percent, to $5.2 billion, excluding the effect of the strengthening dollar. And despite its size, the unit provides slightly less than a third of the company’s overall operating income.Any separation would exclude Johnson Controls’ auto battery business, which has enjoyed rising sales and which the company views as an important engine of its future.Such a move would be part of what the company has called the “Johnson Controls Operating System,” a broad overhaul meant to improve profitability and speed growth.Already, the company, which has 170,000 employees worldwide, has struck a number of deals for its various divisions, including one that sold its workplace solutions arm to the real estate firm CBRE Group for nearly $1.5 billion.“Today’s announcement continues our strategy of proactive portfolio management to drive focus on strategic product-oriented businesses where we can be a global market leader, drive more profitable growth and deliver maximum long-term value for our customers and shareholders,” Alex A. Molinaroli, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Shares of the manufacturer have risen about 2.5 percent over the last 12 months, closing on Tuesday at $51.56. That gives the company a market value of about $33.8 billion.Investors appeared to support the company’s latest move, pushing Johnson Controls’ shares up nearly 4 percent on Wednesday to $53.59. Johnson Controls said it had no firm deadline for a decision, and added that it was weighing other options for the auto business.“What I would tell you is we want to get the right value and position our business and the seating business in a way to be successful in the future,” Mr. Molinaroli told analysts in a conference call Wednesday. “And so, as we go forward, we’ll be looking at different options, everything from joint ventures, sales, selling off part of the business to selling the entire business, to potentially even spinning the business off if that makes the most sense from a go-forward perspective.”Advising the company on its deliberations are Goldman Sachs, Centerview Partners and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.
