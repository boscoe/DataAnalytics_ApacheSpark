AdvertisementSupported byBy Alexandra Stevenson and Matthew GoldsteinUnited States and international authorities are expected on Wednesday to announce one of the largest corruption fines ever in a case involving two Brazilian companies, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.The companies — Odebrecht, the construction company that built Miami International Airport, and Braskem S.A., an affiliated petrochemical firm — are expected to settle bribery charges in an agreement that could total $3 billion.The charges stem from a global investigation by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and by authorities in Switzerland and Brazil, according to these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The bulk of the fines is expected to go to Brazil.In the United States, the settlement would be the largest penalty in a case involving a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, a federal law that makes it illegal for American companies to bribe foreign officials to gain access to a deal.The case is part of a wide-ranging political corruption investigation into the oil company Petrobras and kickbacks that has roiled Brazil, these people said.Odebrecht, one of the largest construction companies in Brazil, has expanded aggressively in Latin America and Africa over the past decade. The company was heavily involved in work for the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics, and it has long cultivated relationships with the country’s political class, regardless of party.Marcelo Odebrecht, a former chief executive of the company, was convicted of corruption and money laundering in March and was sentenced to 19 years in prison.Odebrecht, the construction company that built Miami International Airport, settled bribery charges in a case stemming from a global investigation.On Dec. 1, Odebrecht published a statement apologizing for its “participation in illicit actions.”In the statement, it said: “It does not matter that we gave in to external pressure. Nor is it relevant that there are behaviors that the private and public sectors must resist and correct in their relationships.“What matters is that we acknowledge our involvement. We were complicit and did not fight these practices, as we should have. This was a grave error.”Some 77 Odebrecht officials agreed to provide plea-bargain testimony to Brazilian officials, according to the Brazilian news media, which also said those agreements were awaiting approval by the country’s Supreme Court.In October, Braskem disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was in negotiations with federal prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States about a potential settlement involving allegations of misconduct. The company said it intended to start talks with officials in Brazil as well.In the filing, Braskem said that the negotiations with the authorities stemmed from an internal investigation that began in March 2015. Braskem did not provide details on the suspected misconduct.Negotiations between the two companies and authorities in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland were reported earlier on Tuesday by the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo.This year, prosecutors in Brazil filed charges against the country’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, including allegations that he helped Odebrecht secure lucrative contracts in Angola as well as financing from Brazil’s national development bank in that country. Mr. da Silva has denied the charges.News of a potential deal comes months after federal prosecutors in Brooklyn secured a guilty plea in a case involving the hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management. In September, Och-Ziff’s African unit pleaded guilty to bribery charges, signifying the first time a publicly listed hedge fund had paid a penalty for violating the corrupt practices act.Simon Romero and Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.Advertisement
