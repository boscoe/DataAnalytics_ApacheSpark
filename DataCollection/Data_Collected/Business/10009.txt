Every two years, Goldman Sachs promotes a fresh class of partners in a closely watched tradition that heralds back to the time when the company was still a private firm. This year’s list of the chosen is the longest since 2010 and includes the largest percentage of women.Goldman Sachs said Wednesday that it would add 84 partners, more than the 78 designated in 2014 but fewer than the 111 from six years ago. The current class has 19 women, 23 percent of the total, which surpasses previous years. Eighty-two percent of the new partners work in the areas that generate revenue like investment banking and asset management, and the rest come from what Goldman calls its federation, the behind-the-scenes functions like compliance and technology.The ascent to the Goldman Sachs partnership is considered one of Wall Street’s highest honors, opening doors to an exclusive club of financiers. Most other companies promote their top employees to the level of managing director, a designation that also exists at Goldman Sachs. Partners are a notch above that, a mere 1.6 percent of Goldman employees, or roughly 500 people.Achieving that title is an incentive for Goldman workers to stay around rather than bolting for a rival. The class named on Wednesday reflects that staying power, with 75 percent of the new partners having started at Goldman Sachs as either analysts or associates.AdvertisementFamous partner alumni include two former Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin. Goldman declined to give the exact number of partners it has, but it tends to keep fewer than 500 at any point. Many who leave move on to careers in government or elsewhere in business.AdvertisementThe selection process, taking place over months, has changed little since Goldman Sachs was a private firm, according to Edith Cooper, a partner and the global chief of human capital management, who described it in a video on the company’s website. It evaluates individuals on things like how they are performing and what their potential for leadership is.Once the names are chosen, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the bank’s chairman and chief executive, as well as Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer, approve the list and call all the new partners to inform them of their selection.“These appointments recognize some of the firm’s most senior professionals and acknowledge their commitment to our franchise, people, culture and values,” Mr. Blankfein said in a statement on Wednesday. “We congratulate all those selected and look forward to their continued strong performance, contributions and leadership in the months and years ahead.”The partnership notifications come as Wall Street reconciles with another tough year for bonuses. Incentive-based compensation will decline 5 percent to 10 percent this year, according to estimates published in a report on Monday by Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm. That would represent the third consecutive year of declines, because of stricter regulation, a challenging trading environment and broken deals. That has also led to thousands of job cuts across the industry.On receiving the promotion, partners typically get a salary increase and a slice of a special bonus pool. The promotions become effective on Jan. 1, 2017.“Everybody at Goldman Sachs is responsible for the firm’s performance and reputation,” Dane E. Holmes, the global head of investor relations for Goldman Sachs, said in a newsletter on Monday, previewing the partner announcements. “However, the level of accountability for our partners is fundamentally more different given the scope of their reach.”The following individuals were promoted to be a Goldman Sachs partner on Wednesday:Nicole AgnewAndrew BagleyJonathan BarryJonathan BaylissDeborah BeckmannMichael BruunRobert CamachoDavid CasnerPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
