ABERDEEN, Scotland — Even before Craig May, a longtime Chevron executive, moved to this North Sea port city two summers ago, he knew that the oil wealth in Britain’s waters was on the steepening slope of a decades-long decline.Along with other Big Oil players that make Aberdeen their North Sea hub, Chevron had let its aging offshore operations become inefficient. There was still plenty of oil and gas out there. But the rising expenses, Mr. May said, no longer justified the diminishing revenue from the undersea wells.“We recognized we weren’t structured the right way,” said Mr. May, who now leads the company’s exploration and production in northern Europe. “Cost always matters.”And that was when oil was selling for more than $100 a barrel.Now, with oil’s price per barrel down about 40 percent from a year ago, and with some operators shutting down aging platforms, Mr. May and Chevron are in a race against irrelevancy for their North Sea operations.AdvertisementThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets on Friday in Vienna, is unlikely to provide any sort of relief to the North Sea industry by cutting production to prop up prices. Instead, OPEC — which does not include Britain or any other North Sea producer — hopes that a spell of low prices will discourage new investment in high-cost regions like the North Sea, reducing their output.AdvertisementEven before the price of oil began collapsing last summer, Mr. May was taking steps to trim Chevron’s North Sea costs and planning new technologies — including a $3 million integrated operations center in Aberdeen — to wrest renewed efficiencies from 20- and 30-year-old offshore oil and gas rigs.
            As the oil and gas resources in the North Sea wane, companies like Chevron are rethinking the economics of how they operate there.

The efforts are a test of the continued viability of an energy region that, if nurtured, could continue to give Europe a hedge against its reliance on oil and gas from Russia and the OPEC nations.Just as crucially, the techniques that Chevron is experimenting with in the North Sea could lead the way for other oil companies around the world to coax continued life from aging offshore energy operations — wherever they are — and learn from some industry mistakes.In a sense, British waters are a microcosm of the global industry. Costs, especially for offshore operations, have risen across the globe, eating into profits and reducing incentives for new exploration.Despite the global push toward renewable energy and onshore drilling of oil and gas from shale in the United States and elsewhere, the world is likely to require a long-term, adequate supply of undersea oil — if it can be extracted economically. Chevron, for one, has postponed a big Scottish deepwater project called Rosebank, where the North Sea gives way to the North Atlantic just northwest of the Shetland Islands, judging it not feasible under current industry economics.As other large oil companies in the region have, Chevron has turned to layoffs and other cost-cutting moves. While total industry job cuts in the North Sea region have so far been in the low thousands, the management consulting firm Ernst & Young forecasts that as many as 35,000 of the 375,000 jobs related to the oil industry in Britain could be lost over the next four years.“It is a very tough time,” said Alexander Kemp, a petroleum economist at the University of Aberdeen. “Budgets have been cut substantially. At most companies, the effects of that are still working through.”AdvertisementBut Chevron is not simply retrenching. In August, the company opened its new operations center, with digital communications equipment, at an office park in the hills overlooking the gray granite buildings of Aberdeen.The center for the first time puts managers in constant video and voice contact with their counterparts on platforms more than 100 miles offshore. And it lets managers and technicians in Aberdeen monitor the performance of compressors, pumps and hundreds of other pieces of offshore equipment involved in extracting fossil fuels from beneath the seafloor.Industry executives say such innovations are long overdue.“The problem of the industry is not the oil price — it is the efficiency of the industry,” said John Pearson, president for northern Europe at Amec Foster Wheeler, which provides services like platform operations and maintenance for energy companies. “It didn’t work at $100 a barrel,” Mr. Pearson said, so it is even more critical at today’s prices.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

An 18-year-old platform called Captain, for example, ran for 125 days without having to curtail production for maintenance, about four times as long as usual.The wells in the Captain field extract not only oil but also a lot of water — which creates an emulsion that can interfere with the well’s pump over time, slowing production. But with the operations center, technical engineers onshore can detect such problems early and alert the team on the platform to open the pump further or change the settings. Chevron credits this capability for enabling a new well in the Captain field to produce 3,000 more barrels a day than initially planned.As a result of these new efficiencies, Chevron said it saved $31 million in the center’s first eight months.During the heady period from 2011 to mid-2014 — when prices of the North Sea benchmark oil, Brent crude, averaged more than $100 a barrel — industry executives were willing to spend lavishly to make sure their projects took priority. There were bidding wars for skilled labor. And the owners of equipment like drilling rigs and supply boats were able to demand premium rates for their services.Now, with costs and revenue so far out of sync, the situation is particularly dire in the North Sea because production has declined more than 50 percent over the last decade, to about 1.4 million barrels a day.“The issue in the North Sea is existential around the cash cost of operation at the current level of oil prices,” Simon Henry, Royal Dutch Shell’s chief financial officer, said recently while discussing the company’s quarterly results.AdvertisementAnd in the North Sea, no company is an island.The region is a vast web of interconnected fields and pipelines and other infrastructure, with different owners, that transport the oil and gas. If one company closes a node in this network, others might be forced to shut down portions of their own operations. Chevron, for example, lost production for several months from a field called Erskine because its oil flowed through a field operated by the BG Group. That field had been closed since October for an upgrade but recently came back online.“It takes only one field that has exposure to a piece of infrastructure to put the whole system in jeopardy,” said Derek Leith, an energy consultant at Ernst & Young in Aberdeen.Once fields start to shut down, the companies cannot simply abandon them. International laws require the companies to safely and cleanly dismantle the platforms and underwater equipment, a process with considerable costs. The industry is projected to spend about 15 billion pounds, or about $23 billion, in the next decade on North Sea decommissioning — spending the industry can hope to partly defer the longer it can squeeze life from existing operations.Apache, a midsize oil company based in Houston, is considered something of a model. In 2003, Apache acquired a portion of the Forties field, a vast North Sea plot 140 miles northeast of Aberdeen that was discovered in 1970 and once produced about a half-million barrels a day. By the time Apache bought its portion from BP, output had dwindled to 41,000 barrels a day.But Apache has raised production 20 percent, to about 50,000 barrels a day, by investing in new wells and installing more electrical generators to reduce downtime, according to James L. House, the company’s North Sea manager until this month. “We all have access to the same level of technology and hire people with similar educational backgrounds,” he said. “It is how decisions are made and how they are executed.”At Chevron, Mr. May says he is encouraged by his company’s efforts to reclaim the North Sea. Chevron is continuing with development of a new field called Alder. And the giant Rosebank project could yet go ahead, Mr. May said.“We have been here for 50 years,” he said. “We want to stay.”A version of this article appears in print on June 5, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Troubles for Oil Drillers in Scottish Waters.
