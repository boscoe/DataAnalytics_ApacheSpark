WASHINGTON — Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. The upbeat data on Friday added to reports on manufacturing and employment that have suggested economic growth gained at the start of the year.The economic growth outlook was further bolstered by steady consumer sentiment in February despite recent stock market turmoil.“Consumers revved it up a notch and inflation quickened as well at the start of the year,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “Consumers are sending a strong message that the economy is on the right track for continued growth this year.”In addition on Friday, the Commerce Department said that gross domestic product increased at a 1.0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter as businesses were less aggressive in their efforts to reduce unwanted inventory. The economy was previously reported to have grown at a 0.7 percent pace in the quarter.

The agency also said consumer spending increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since March, as households ramped up purchases of a range of goods and the return to normal winter temperatures lifted demand for heating. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, rose by an upwardly revised 0.1 percent in December.AdvertisementA price index for consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in December. In the 12 months through January, the personal consumption expenditures price, or P.C.E., index rose 1.3 percent, the largest increase since October 2014. The index advanced 0.7 percent in December.AdvertisementExcluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3 percent. That was the largest increase since January 2012 and followed a 0.1 percent gain in December.The so-called core P.C.E. price index increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months through January, the largest rise since July 2014. The core P.C.E., the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, rose 1.5 percent in December.Separately, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 91.7 February after slipping to a reading of 90.7 early in the month. It was slightly down from January’s reading of 92.

In January, consumer spending was supported by a 0.5 percent rise in income as the labor market continued to tighten. That was the largest increase since June and added to a 0.3 percent rise in December.Wages and salaries shot up 0.6 percent also as minimum wage increases came into effect in some states. Wages and salaries increased 0.2 percent in December.The Commerce Department said businesses accumulated $81.7 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter, rather than the $68.6 billion reported last month. The largest contributors to the upward revision to inventory investment were retail trade and mining, utilities and construction.As a result, inventories subtracted only 0.14 percentage point from G.D.P. growth, instead of the previously reported 0.45 percentage point. The bigger inventory build is bad news for first-quarter G.D.P. growth, as it means businesses will have little incentive to place new orders, which will continue to hold down production.“The weaker drag from inventories in the fourth quarter means that any rebound in the first quarter could be slightly more modest than we previously expected,” said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. “Nevertheless, it still appears that first-quarter G.D.P. growth is on track to rebound to a very healthy 2.5 percent annualized or higher, which should dampen any concerns about an imminent recession.”A version of this article appears in print on February 27, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Consumer Spending Rose 0.5% in January.
