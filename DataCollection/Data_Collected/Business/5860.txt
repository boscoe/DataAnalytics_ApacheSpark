Net banking income, synonymous with revenue, rose more than 12 percent to €6.4 billion.Crédit Agricole said that its net income in the first quarter rose 2.6 percent to €784 million, as its top-line revenue rose 7.5 percent to €4.4 billion.Both earnings reports were better than analysts had anticipated.The economy of the eurozone appears to have grown in the first quarter, helped by lower oil prices, a boon to households and businesses, and a weaker euro, which bolsters exports. Lending is also slowly improving, helped by the European Central Bank’s quantitative-easing policy, under which it has committed to buying hundreds of billions of euros’ worth of bonds through September 2016.In addition to the tailwinds provided by an improving economy and easier monetary conditions, the global banks benefited in the first quarter from higher volatility, as their business of trading stocks and bonds increased.In a statement, Frédéric Oudéa, Société Générale’s chief executive, highlighted “initial signs of recovery in Europe” and revenue growth across all of the bank’s businesses. French retail banking revenue rose 4.3 percent, while the global banking and investor solutions unit, which includes investment banking and asset management, rose 7.9 percent.Jean-Paul Chifflet, Crédit Agricole’s chief executive, described “strong business momentum across all business lines,” including a 24 percent gain in investment banking revenue.But he noted that profit had been held back by a change in tax accounting rules and the bank’s contribution to the Single Resolution Fund, the pool of capital that is being established by European banks to pay for any future bailouts. Without those items, he said, net income would have been 26 percent higher than the year-earlier figure, instead of the 2.6 percent reported on Wednesday.Société Générale and Crédit Agricole, which are based in Paris, each have a market capitalization of a bit more than half of the nearly €69 billion of BNP Paribas, the biggest French bank. Last week, BNP Paribas reported an 18 percent rise in first-quarter profit, to €1.6 billion.The market value comparison understates Crédit Agricole’s true size, however, since the lender has an unlisted regional banking unit that, were it consolidated, would contribute an additional €4 billion to the group’s revenue and more than €400 million to its net income.Advertisement
