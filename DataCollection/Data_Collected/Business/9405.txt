In the latest round of a long-running battle between the United States government and investors in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the investors have won.A federal judge has ruled that the government improperly withheld documents from investors suing over its decision in 2012 to seize all the profits of the mortgage finance giants, abruptly changing the terms of the companies’ rescue.Investors had contended that the government’s surprise decision to begin extracting all profits from Fannie and Freddie was an illegal taking of private property.In the wake of the 2012 decision, the government argued that it acted to protect taxpayers from future losses because the companies were in a death spiral. But the decision to funnel the profits into the Treasury’s general fund came just before Fannie and Freddie returned to profitability.AdvertisementThe next year, Fairholme Funds, a mutual fund company that holds shares in Fannie and Freddie, sued the government.AdvertisementLawyers representing the government responded to the suit with unusual demands for secrecy, but the ruling decided in favor of Fairholme Funds.Several studies have shown the benefit of having at least one woman on a corporate board, so why don’t more activist investors focus on the issue?Since the beginning of 2011, five of the largest activist funds have nominated 174 directors, but just seven of them were women. About 60 percent of corporate boards have no female directors at all.Men were reluctant to change boardroom dynamics by bringing in women, according to Christine Shropshire, who has done research on the likelihood of male and female executives facing activist investors.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Trump’s antitrade comments were cause for concern.“This introduces an element of uncertainty to the mix, and uncertainty is not great for investors,” Mr. Obstfeld said.• The Supreme Court will hear an insider trading case that prosecutors fear will make it harder to prove the charge when company insiders receive no cash or other tangible benefits for their tips. In an Another View column, R. Foster Winans argues that “The idea that the securities markets should be level is fairy-tale morality.”Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
