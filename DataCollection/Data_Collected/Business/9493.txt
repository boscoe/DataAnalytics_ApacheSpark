But the 2010 legislation that created the consumer bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, gave the bureau’s director — who is now Richard Cordray, President Obama’s pick — an unusual degree of independence. Once nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the director, who serves a five-year term, can be removed only for cause, defined as “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.”The appeals court panel, citing “the threat to individual liberty” posed by an independent agency with a leader with such unchecked power, struck down that structure.But the court stopped well short of the remedy sought by the plaintiffs and other critics of the watchdog agency, who have argued that the bureau should be shut down if its structure was found to be unconstitutional.Instead, the court simply chose to sever the provision saying that the director could only be fired for cause and to leave the rest of the law that created the bureau intact.“The president now will have the power to remove the director at will, and to supervise and direct the director,” the court wrote in its ruling, written by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh. “The C.F.P.B. therefore will continue to operate and to perform its many duties, but will do so as an executive agency akin to other executive agencies headed by a single person, such as the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury.”The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is expected to appeal to the full circuit court, which tilts Democratic. Or, alternatively, the agency could directly ask the Supreme Court to review the case.“The bureau respectfully disagrees with the court’s decision,” said a spokeswoman for the agency, Moira Vahey. “The bureau believes that Congress’s decision to make the director removable only for cause is consistent with Supreme Court precedent, and the bureau is considering options for seeking further review of the court’s decision.”Judge Kavanaugh and the other two judges on the panel that issued the decision on Tuesday, A. Raymond Randolph and Karen L. Henderson, were all appointed by Republican presidents. Judge Randolph concurred with the decision and Judge Henderson concurred in part.Republicans in Congress have consistently wanted to abolish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it represents regulatory overreach. One of the agency’s fiercest critics, Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, said the court’s ruling vindicated his party’s criticism of the bureau’s “bizarre and defective structure.”Mr. Hensarling, who heads the House Financial Services Committee, urged Congress to pass legislation replacing the consumer agency’s sole director with a bipartisan, five-member commission — a structure similar to that used at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and other watchdog agencies.More than a dozen consumer advocacy groups issued statements denouncing the legal decision.Any move to reduce the independence of the consumer bureau’s director “threatens the ability of the agency to be a tough protector of consumer interests,” said Robert Weissman, president of the consumer group Public Citizen.As part of its ruling, the court sided with the case’s plaintiff, the PHH Corporation, a mortgage lender, and threw out a $109 million fine that the consumer bureau levied over what it said were illegal kickbacks. PHH responded with a lawsuit challenging the bureau’s statutory authority to impose the penalty.The court agreed with PHH’s claim that the bureau had overstepped its bounds, and threw out the fine.PHH said in a statement that it was “extremely gratified” by the ruling.As the case wends its way further through the courts, the agency will continue its work. In its five years of existence, the bureau has counted among its major accomplishments stricter rules on mortgage lending and a number of enforcement actions against consumer abuses. The agency recently levied a $100 million fine against Wells Fargo for setting up unauthorized accounts on behalf of its customers.“Congress has charged the bureau with ensuring that the markets for consumer financial products and services are fair, transparent, and competitive and with protecting consumers in these markets from unlawful practices,” said Ms. Vahey, the agency spokeswoman. “Today’s decision will not dampen our efforts or affect our focus on the mission of the agency.”Just hours after the ruling, the bureau announced a new enforcement action: It hit the Navy Federal Credit Union, the country’s largest credit union, with a $28.5 million penalty for making false and illegal threats about collecting on delinquent debts from its members, who include active-duty and retired soldiers.The credit union, which settled the charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing, said it had made “all the necessary changes” to bring its collection practices into compliance.OpinionThe Editorial BoardAdvertisement
