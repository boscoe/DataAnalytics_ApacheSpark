AdvertisementSupported byBy Emily SteelVanity Fair on Thursday updated the account it had published by the NBC News correspondent Richard Engel about his 2012 kidnapping in Syria, stating that he had misidentified his captors.An Editor’s Note posted to the top of the article on the Vanity Fair website said that Mr. Engel, the chief foreign correspondent of NBC News, had “re-reported” his abduction after being prompted by new information, including inquiries from The New York Times. Mr. Engel now has concluded that he was abducted by a Sunni militant group, that “deliberately led their captives to believe they were Shiite militia,” the note said. Mr. Engel previously said that his captors were forces affiliated with the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria.The note linked to a statement on the NBC News website on Wednesday in which Mr. Engel revised the story of his abduction. It also linked to a New York Times article about NBC News correcting its account. Mr. Engel and his NBC News team were kidnapped in December 2012 while reporting in Syria and held for five days. Hours after emerging, they appeared on the “Today” show, with Mr. Engel identifying his captors as militia loyal to the Mr. Assad’s government. Four months later, in Vanity Fair’s April 2013 issue, Mr. Engel’s journal-like entry documenting the kidnapping was published under the headline “The Hostage.” An NBC News spokesman said the network had no comment beyond the statement posted on its website. A spokeswoman for Vanity Fair said the magazine had no further comment.Mr. Engel corrected his account at a difficult time for the news division. Two months ago, NBC News suspended Brian Williams, its nightly news anchor, for six months without pay after he exaggerated an account of a helicopter incident in Iraq in 2003. That controversy led to a management shake-up in the news division and the hiring of Andrew Lack, a former NBC News president, to lead it.Advertisement
