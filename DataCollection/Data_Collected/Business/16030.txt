AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks on Wall Street posted solid gains on Thursday as investors, comfortable that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low, bought up stocks that pay big dividends.Real estate companies rose as investors looked for income, as did telecom stocks, which also typically pay higher-than-average dividends.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 98.76 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,392.46. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 14.06 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,177.18, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 44.34 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,339.52.The newly created real estate component of the S.&P. 500 rose 1.9 percent, far more than any other sector. The group is made up largely of real estate investment trusts, which enjoy certain tax benefits by paying out much of their income as dividends.Telecommunications stocks, which also carry higher-than-average dividends, also rose more than the rest of the market. AT&T rose 54 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $41.11. Verizon Communications rose 48 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $52.35.Trading followed a pattern that has become familiar in the last several months. After hesitating or worrying that the Fed would raise interest rates, investors piled into high-dividend stocks when the central bank decided yet again to stand pat on interest rates. The two best-performing parts of the S.&P. 500 this year are utilities, up 18 percent, and telecoms, up 15 percent.“It’s another example of the issues facing investors right now, particularly pension funds and retirement funds, that they are all chasing yield in the same places,” said Ian Winer, co-head of equities trading at Wedbush Securities.He said he remained concerned about how much more stocks could rise in the short term, with the presidential election coming and third-quarter company earnings reports around the corner.“There’s plenty of data that doesn’t support the market here, but what else are you going to invest in?” Mr. Winer said.The Fed kept its key interest rate unchanged on Wednesday, but signaled that it would probably raise it later this year. The central bank said that the job market had strengthened and economic activity had picked up, but that business investment was soft and inflation too low. The Fed said risks to its economic outlook were “roughly balanced.”The Fed’s decision to keep rates low also caused bond prices to rise and the dollar to fall against other major currencies. This in turn helped support prices of commodities, which are denominated in dollars.The yield on the Treasury 10-year note fell to 1.62 percent from 1.66 percent the day before.Benchmark crude rose 98 cents to close at $46.32 a barrel, while Brent crude, used to price international oils, gained 82 cents to close at $47.65 a barrel. In other energy commodities, heating oil rose 2.5 cents, to $1.45 a gallon; wholesale gasoline rose less than 1 cent, to $1.40 a gallon; and natural gas fell 7 cents, to $2.99 per 1,000 cubic feet.Energy companies followed oil prices higher. Murphy Oil rose $1.14, or 4.3 percent, to $27.55 and Transocean rose 51 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $9.65.Other commodities also rose. In metals, gold climbed $13.50, or 1 percent, to $1,340.40 an ounce. Silver rose 33 cents, to $20.10 an ounce, and copper increased 4 cents, to $2.19 a pound.Freeport-McMoRan, the mining giant, jumped 44 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $10.98.The dollar edged up to 100.79 yen from 100.47 yen. The euro rose to $1.1204 from $1.1184.Advertisement
