With the trading desks of investment banks cut to the bone, the ability to pin a fat fee on a fast-growing pile of assets has become the holy grail for financial firms.Few have proved better at this than the bond giant Pimco and its total return fund, which took in more than $6 billion in fees between 2010 and 2013 — the most profitable run ever for a mutual fund.But as Pimco copes with an exodus of cash from its largest fund after the departure of its co-founder William H. Gross, these fees — and in particular, their composition — are drawing scrutiny.In late 2014, a disgruntled investor in Seattle sued the firm, asserting that the fund’s fees were disproportionately high.AdvertisementAnd last month, in his own lawsuit, Mr. Gross, the man known as the bond king, said that Pimco executives were secretly raising the fees on its most profitable mutual fund in order to enrich themselves.AdvertisementOn Monday, Pimco asked that Mr. Gross’s lawsuit be dismissed, stating that he had “engaged in a pattern of conduct that was incompatible” with Pimco values. The reply rejected Mr. Gross’s claims that he had been unjustly terminated and deprived of money owed to him.At issue in the debate over fees is what Pimco’s total return fund charges investors to oversee and administer its assets.Last year, according to filings, investors in the fund paid Pimco $1.1 billion.Of that number, $467 million was from management fees, which Pimco charges to scour the world for the best bonds to buy.But it is the $442 million that the firm collected in administrative fees that lies at the root of the claim made in each lawsuit, that investors in the total return fund are being disadvantaged.It is quite a sum for what is essentially a back-office function, and it far surpasses what other funds of similar size charge to administer their assets.The fund’s $442 million administrative fee is greater than the combined tally of fees — $400 million — at the two total return funds that compete directly with Pimco.Those two funds, managed by Metropolitan West and DoubleLine, oversee a total of $118 billion in assets compared with the $93.7 billion for Pimco’s Total Return fund.Advertisement“It’s ridiculous and extremely disappointing from a governance perspective,” said Eric Jacobson, an analyst with the fund rating agency Morningstar who has written several critical reports about Pimco’s high administrative fees. “This is the type of thing you farm out to another provider. The cost of the service should not even come close to the cost of investment management.”Pimco executives said the fund’s fees are in line with, if not below, those of its peers. And they cited the fund’s operating expense ratio of 0.46 of total assets, which, according to Morningstar, is “below average.”
                William H. Gross is suing the company to repair the damage that was done to his reputation in the year before and after he was fired.            “This is a misleading apples-and-oranges comparison, because Pimco charges a fixed all-in fee whereas other funds unbundle various fees,” said Michael Reid, a Pimco spokesman. “The appropriate comparison is total expenses.”Nevertheless, not all investors grasp that one half of the fee they pay for investing in a Pimco fund goes to covering overhead. Nor does it does explain why the biggest actively managed bond fund in the world is charging investors the same amount to administer its assets as it does to manage them.Mr. Gross’s accusation zeros in on perhaps the murkiest area of the $15 trillion mutual fund industry: How fund companies account for and disclose the billions of dollars in fees that they charge investors each year for managing their money.In Mr. Gross’s complaint, he blamed the longtime head of Pimco’s mutual funds, Brent R. Harris, for total return’s fees.Mincing few words, he described Mr. Harris as “money driven” and said that the Pimco executive was “particularly proud of his efforts to raise annual fees on various funds, such as the total return fund, through creatively labeling such fees as ‘administrative costs.’ ”As chairman of the trust that oversees Pimco’s 172 mutual funds — a position he has held since 1992 — Mr. Harris has a primary duty to the millions of investors who own Pimco funds.AdvertisementAt the same time, Mr. Harris is a member of Pimco’s executive committee and heads a fee policy group that has oversight for the fees Pimco charges investors.Mr. Gross, in the lawsuit, said that Mr. Harris was more concerned with raking in profits for Pimco than with keeping fees low for investors.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

By law, he said, it is the independent trustees, who make up 75 percent of the board, who approve fees annually in a separate vote.“This fee structure is approved by a large majority of investors because of the price certainty and transparency,” Mr. Reid said.Many of these are sophisticated institutions, which also get a discount: Pimco charges such investors 0.21 percent of their assets for overhead, compared with between 0.25 and 0.35 percent that retail investors must pay.While Pimco’s unified fee structure had been in place for a number of years, it was updated in the summer of 2008.Pimco executives proposed in July that the firm be compensated for undertaking the increasingly complex work of administering the fund’s assets, according to regulatory filings.The case was made that tasks such as pricing securities, communicating with investors and various other back office functions would be more efficiently handled in-house at Pimco headquarters in Newport Beach, Calif., and that a flat fee should be charged to investors for these services.It was an unorthodox request. Mutual funds and the companies that manage their assets are, in effect, separate legal entities.AdvertisementInvestment firms like Pimco sign agreements with their fund families to do what they were set up to do: navigate the markets and produce decent market returns.But the less value-added work of servicing investor assets is often farmed out to companies that specialize in this business.Pimco has said publicly that the service pact — which is automatically renewed each year — is profitable, and the numbers bear that out.As the size of the total return fund approached $300 billion, the administrative fee alone produced $1.3 billion in revenue for Pimco in 2012 and 2013.In a filing in which Mr. Harris and the fund trustees explained why they agreed to the deal, they said it should be seen as “part of total compensation received by Pimco from its relationship with the funds.”While Mr. Gross may have highlighted the fee issue in his lawsuit, it is also true that, in his 40 years at the firm, he was a major beneficiary of the pricing structure, getting paid $300 million at the peak. Still, he had raised the issue of high fees in his 1997 book “Everything You’ve Heard About Investing Is Wrong!” and in his investor outlooks.In his last months at the firm, he says in his suit, he began to warn more persistently that Pimco was focusing too much on fees, at the expense of the investor.At a meeting in August 2014, just a month before he was forced out, Mr. Gross reacted strongly to a presentation by Pimco’s chief executive, Douglas M. Hodge, according to several people with direct knowledge of the presentation.AdvertisementIn the presentation, Mr. Hodge argued that Pimco should “maximize wallet share” and “fend off fee pressures.”In response, these people said, Mr. Gross wrote a memo to his fellow members of the executive committee saying they had become too profit-driven and were ignoring “more critical areas such as fees.”When Mr. Harris objected, Mr. Gross retorted that the longtime head of the firm’s fee group was too accustomed to “driving in fourth gear,” when it came to billing the investor.Mr. Harris, Mr. Gross said, needed “to practice his skills at driving in reverse.”But by then, Pimco executives had had enough of Mr. Gross’ increasingly erratic behavior.While generally a volatile man, he had now begun to lash out at his colleagues who he feared were plotting against him, said people involved in these discussions.For that reason alone, the firm’s leadership concluded, it was time for Mr. Gross to go.A version of this article appears in print on November 10, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Pimco Suit Sheds Light on Murky Investor Fees .
