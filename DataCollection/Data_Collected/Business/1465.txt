Hyundai is recalling about 305,000 of its 2011-12 Sonata models because the automatic transmission could possibly be moved out of park without pressing the brake pedal, allowing the car to roll or drive away, according to a report from the automaker posted this week on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s website.Hyundai attributed the problem to the stop lamp switch. It is the third time since 2009 that Hyundai has recalled vehicles for a malfunctioning brake switch.In this recall, Hyundai said along with the ability to move the transmission out of park without pressing the brake, the brake lights might remain illuminated after the brake pedal was released. It said it was unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem.Hyundai told federal regulators that a switch could become stuck, but the automaker was still trying to figure out why. Hyundai said it became aware of the issue because of an unusual number of warranty claims.The automaker has had a series of problems with brake switches. In 2013, Kia and its parent company, Hyundai, recalled about 1.7 million vehicles, including the 2011 Sonata. Hyundai said the switch malfunction could cause problems such as a driver’s not being able to shut off the cruise control by touching the brake.In 2009, Hyundai recalled about 533,000 for similar problems with the brake light switch.A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Hyundai Cars Are Recalled to Repair Brake Switch.
