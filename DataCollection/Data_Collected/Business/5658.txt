Repeating an all-too-familiar pattern, the American economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter of 2015, weighed down by a weaker trade performance, falling business investment and still-cautious consumers.At 0.2 percent, the annualized growth rate last quarter was better than the winter wipeout in the first quarter of 2014, when the economy contracted at a 2.1 percent rate. But the figures released on Wednesday by the Commerce Department confirm other signals in recent weeks that the economy, which was hit again by harsh weather in large portions of the nation, began 2015 by treading at water at best.“The U.S. economy stumbled badly in the first quarter,” said Scott Anderson, senior vice president and chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. “Modest growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 turned into virtually no growth in the first quarter of 2015.”The anemic showing was led by two areas that were especially weak: net exports and business investment.AdvertisementHurt by the stronger dollar and the lingering effects of a labor dispute that slowed activity at West Coast ports, net exports fell 7.2 percent in the first quarter, which shaved nearly a full point off the overall growth figure.AdvertisementPlunging investment by businesses also weighed on the American economy, a trend some experts attribute to big cuts in spending in the energy sector, as falling oil prices prompted drillers and oil production companies to pull back on new projects.Still, even with the disappointing start to the year, most experts expect growth to rebound later in 2015, much as it did last year.“We believe weakness was grossly exaggerated, and there will be significant catch-up in Q2, but, of course, that remains to be seen,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.One part of the economy that had been expected to help, the public sector, actually hurt overall growth last quarter. State and local government expenditures fell at the steepest rate since the first quarter of 2012.That the economy expanded at all last quarter was mostly because of outlays by consumers, although they spent at a significantly slower rate than in the second half of last year.Consumer spending, which makes up roughly two-thirds of gross domestic product, rose 1.9 percent. That was well below the 4.4 percent gain in the fourth quarter of 2014, and was a sign that shoppers remained cautious, despite the big drop in energy prices.Economists had expected a weak showing before the report. The consensus view called for a 1 percent growth rate in January, February and March, well below the  2.2 percent rate in the final three months of 2014.

The next estimate will come out on May 29.AdvertisementLike Mr. O’Sullivan, Mr. Anderson said he was looking for growth to pick up in the current quarter, predicting a gain of slightly more than 2 percent for the spring, with the rate of expansion rising to just under 3 percent in the second half of 2015. “We’re not throwing in the towel for 2015,” he said.He said that he expected consumers, with more money in their bank accounts from lower oil prices and an improving job market, to spend more aggressively later in the year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Consumers are most likely using the windfall to pay down credit card debt or add to savings. If spending does pick up, so will overall economic growth.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, also expects a rebound in economic activity this year, but he cautioned that some of the headwinds evident last quarter would not immediately abate.The drop in energy-related spending will eventually level out, he said, but it will take some time. Similarly, even though the port problems in California and elsewhere have been resolved, the dollar remains strong compared with currencies like the euro, and no relief for exporters is in sight.“The dollar has strengthened so much that it could restrain the magnitude of the rebound,” Mr. Berger said.Wednesday was a busy day for economists, traders and bankers. In a separate report later in the morning, the National Association of Realtors said pending home sales in March rose 1.1 percent.Pending sales are now at their highest level since June 2013, according to the Realtors’ index, and some experts say the housing market should remain strong in the next few months, especially since the Federal Reserve does not seem to be in a rush to raise short-term interest rates.AdvertisementAbout 2 p.m., the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee will issue a statement after the conclusion of a two-day meeting.Fed policy makers are expected to remain cautious about when they will begin raising short-term interest rates from near zero.After earlier predictions that the Fed might move as early as June, most economists now say the Fed will wait at least until their September meeting, or even later.The latest data “strengthens the argument for a delay by the Fed,” Mr. Anderson said.He continued: “I think September is still likely for the first rate increase, but we need to see better economic data for several months before the Fed becomes confident enough to pull the trigger.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
