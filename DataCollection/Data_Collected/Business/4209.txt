News of its closure was first broken on Twitter by those connected with it, but was confirmed shortly afterward by its founder, the tech journalist and venture capitalist Om Malik. “Gigaom is winding down and its assets are now controlled by the company’s lenders,” he said. “It is not how you want the story of a company you founded to end.”Mr. Malik did not specify a reason for the publication’s closing. But a separate statement, attributed to its management, said that it “recently became unable to pay its creditors in full at this time.”All operations have ceased, it said. “We do not know at this time what the lenders intend to do with the assets or if there will be any future operations using those assets. The company does not currently intend to file bankruptcy.”The site, long known for both its business and consumer-facing technology posts, had been open to experimentation in its business model. Like other media start-ups, Gigaom hosted a series of technology conferences that charged high prices for admission. The company offered a white-paper research business, and also sold advertising.A message to Gigaom seeking more information was not immediately returned, and a person who answered the phone in the company’s San Francisco office said only the word “no.”“This hurts more than I can say,” Mathew Ingram, a senior writer there, wrote on Twitter. “I was just told Gigaom is shutting down — it has run out of money. We tried our best, but it wasn’t enough.”Advertisement
