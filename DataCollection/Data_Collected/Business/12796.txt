The Obama administration has enthusiastically supported these efforts in the hope that energy ties would help build peaceful relations between Israel and its neighbors in the Middle East.Plans to bring Leviathan’s gas to market have been slowed by a series of roadblocks, including a decision in 2014 by Israel’s antitrust commissioner that Noble and its partners would have too much power over the Israeli energy market. That ruling led Mr. Netanyahu to devise a deal under which Noble and its partners would divest part of their Israeli holdings, but now the court has objected to that arrangement.Predictably, the Israeli government reacted with dismay to the court decision.“The High Court of Justice decision severely threatens the development of the gas reserves of the State of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. “Certainly, nobody has any reason to celebrate that the gas is liable to remain in the depths of the sea and that hundreds billions of shekels will not reach the citizens of Israel.”Mr. Netanyahu also said that Israel was “seen as a state with excessive judicial interference in which it is difficult to do business.”In recent years, discoveries by Noble and its Israeli partners, the Delek Group conglomerate, have helped transform Israel from a country heavily dependent on energy imports to one with a growing natural gas industry. The companies currently operate a field called Tamar, whose gas is used to generate roughly half of Israel’s electricity. Leviathan is twice the size of Tamar.For many Israelis, however, the benefits of a surging natural gas industry are outweighed by concerns that Noble and its partners were becoming too powerful.“The judges chose today to protect the separation of powers and the rule of law in Israel, to halt the limitless recklessness for the benefit of the gas tycoons, and to put up a glowing stop sign in order to defend the public and Israeli democracy,” Shelly Yachimovich, a lawmaker from the center-left Zionist Union group, wrote on her Facebook page on Sunday.Isabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Stanley Reed from London.Advertisement
