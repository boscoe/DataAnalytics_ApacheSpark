The company, based in Vevey, Switzerland, estimated similar results for this year, saying it was becoming harder to raise prices in a tough economic environment.Like its rivals, Nestlé, the maker of Nescafé instant coffee and Kit Kat chocolate bars, has had to contend with slower growth and changing consumer preferences in emerging markets, notably in China. Its sales in India have also been dented by a recall of its Maggi brand of instant noodles over reports that some samples contained high levels of lead.The company is changing some of its recipes to appeal to health-conscious consumers and is expanding its offerings for online sales.Nestlé said net profit fell more than expected in 2015, to 9.1 billion Swiss francs, or $9.2 billion, compared with 14.5 billion francs the previous year. The company said the sharp decline was mostly because of its sale of part of its stake in the cosmetics company L’Oréal in 2014.Sales of 88.8 billion francs also missed the average forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters.The company raised its dividend to 2.25 francs per share, as expected, but it did not propose the new share buyback program some analysts had hoped for.Underlying sales, which exclude currency moves, acquisitions and divestments, rose 4.2 percent. It was the third consecutive year that Nestlé fell short of its long-term target of at least 5 percent growth in underlying, or organic, sales.“We anticipate that our trading environment in 2016 will be similar to previous years with even softer pricing,” Nestlé said in its statement. “As such, we expect to deliver organic growth in line with 2015, with improvements in margins and underlying earnings per share in constant currencies, and capital efficiency.”Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich, said the disappointing outlook, and the absence of a share buyback announcement, would weigh on the share price.“Its comment that pricing will be even softer in 2016 versus 2015 will send a chill through the whole space today, and stock is going to take a smack,” he wrote in a note to clients.Nestlé shares fell 3.6 percent in early trading in Switzerland on Thursday.Advertisement
