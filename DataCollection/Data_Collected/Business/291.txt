Finance officials from the world’s 20 biggest economies have committed to toughening laws and increasing cross-border cooperation to prevent multinational companies from avoiding as much as $250 billion a year in taxes. The unanimous agreement was announced on Friday in Peru’s capital on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund’s annual meeting. The plan, to be presented to heads of state for approval next month at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Turkey, seeks to address concerns about whether companies like Apple and Google are paying their fair share of taxes. The 15-point action plan was drafted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in consultation with more than 100 countries. “This isn’t about whether you have high taxes or low taxes, it’s about whether you’re paying your taxes,” said Britain’s finance minister, George Osborne. Ángel Gurría, secretary general of the O.E.C.D., said the plan’s enactment would be crucial given the wide range of resources of tax authorities around the world.A version of this brief appears in print on October 10, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: G-20 Officials Aim at Multinational Tax Avoidance .
