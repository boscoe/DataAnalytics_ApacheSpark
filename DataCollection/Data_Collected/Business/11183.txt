Wells Fargo’s profit was flat in the fourth quarter and its revenue rose only slightly as the bank grappled with the strains on loans in the oil and gas industry.The bank, based in San Francisco, said on Friday that its net income of $ 5.7 billion was about the same as a year ago. Measured on a per-share basis, Wells Fargo’s profit rose about 1 percent, to $1.03.Revenue also barely budged, increasing 1 percent to $21.6 billion from the quarter a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been expecting earnings of $1.02 a share on revenue of $21.8 billion.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            Wells Fargo’s flat quarter shows the new challenges facing a bank that was known for reporting consistent and sizable profit increases every quarter. With the majority of its business focused in the United States, Wells Fargo has benefited from the relative strength of the domestic economy while the rest of the world has been struggling.AdvertisementThe bank said its credit losses were $831 million in fourth quarter, up from $703 million in the third quarter, mainly as a result of $90 million in higher oil and gas losses. But when measured as a percent of total loans, Wells said its losses declined to 1.37 percent from 1.39 percent.The nation’s largest mortgage lender, Wells also wrestled with a sluggish housing market. The bank’s mortgage income decreased 6 percent, to $176 million from $187 million a year ago.AdvertisementAlthough Wells Fargo continued to report among the best returns in the banking industry, those returns slipped slightly. The bank’s return on equity slipped to 12.23 percent in the fourth quarter from 12.62 percent in the third quarter and 12.84 percent in the quarter a year ago.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
