The European Central Bank’s policy-setting committee faces concerns over economic growth in the region, uncertainty over the impact of “Brexit” and questions over whether its own efforts are having the desired impact.With a wide variety of issues troubling the region, the central bank nevertheless held fire during a regular monetary policy meeting on Thursday, keeping its benchmark interest rate at zero.The central bank lowered its forecasts for economic growth for next year and 2018, and it slightly reduced its estimates for inflation in both years. It warned that expansion could slow more and said that it would maintain a program to pump more cash into the financial system to bolster the eurozone economy.“We see that our monetary policy is effective,” Mario Draghi, the bank’s president, said. “Interest rates have to be low today to be high tomorrow.”Economists say the bank is moving slowly because with interest rates already at record lows, traditional monetary policy is at its limits.AdvertisementMr. Draghi and his colleagues have already unleashed an arsenal of unconventional tools, including:■ Negative deposit rates, which effectively require banks to pay to store cash in the central bank’s vaults, giving them an added incentive to lend it out instead.Advertisement■ Quantitative easing, where the central bank buys 80 billion euros, or about $90 billion, of government and corporate bonds each month in an effort to reduce market interest rates to stimulate the economy.■ Flooding banks with cheap money to encourage them to lend to individuals and businesses.Though the central bank has fallen short of its target of pushing inflation to just under 2 percent — it has been hovering at 0.2 percent for the last two months — the bank argues that its policies have averted deflation and encouraged economic growth. Its policies have also helped weaken the euro, which indirectly benefits the economy — a weaker currency typically encourages inflation and makes eurozone exports look cheaper compared with those from rival countries.“The jury is still out on whether this is effective,” said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING-DiBa in Frankfurt. “The E.C.B. likes to say that if they hadn’t done it, the world would look much worse. I believe that’s true, but it’s something we can’t really prove.”If more measures are needed, the central bank could move further into unconventional territory by buying stocks as well as bonds. And it could also provide “helicopter money” — giving cash directly to households to increase spending. But Mr. Draghi will probably need time to prepare public opinion for any such moves, and he said that neither measure was discussed at Thursday’s meeting.“The economic recovery in the euro area is expected to be dampened by still-subdued foreign demand, partly related to the uncertainties following the U.K. referendum outcome.”Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, a move that is expected to have major impacts on the 19-nation eurozone, which, taken as a whole, is Britain’s largest trading partner. Stock markets initially plunged after the vote but have since stabilized, and the European Central Bank has not yet had to adjust its policies because of any direct impact.Much remains unclear about the terms of Britain’s departure from the European Union. Among the possible repercussions:■ Trade with Britain could be affected, depending on the terms of the final deal between London and Brussels. The fall in the value of the pound could also make British exports more competitive, while making Continental European products more expensive in Britain.■ Companies, including ones in London’s prized financial services industry, could desert Britain for the Continent to ensure continued access to the eurozone market.AdvertisementFor the moment, the central bank has not taken any direct measures to address concerns stemming from “Brexit.”
                Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how “Brexit” has affected business so far.            “In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level.”The unemployment rate across the eurozone stands above 10 percent. Household spending is restricted. Demand across the region is weak. And the advice from several officials, including Mr. Draghi, has been clear: Governments must spend more.“In an environment of accommodative monetary policy, the swift and effective implementation of structural reforms will not only lead to higher sustainable economic growth in the euro area but will also make the euro area more resilient to global shocks,” Mr. Draghi said on Thursday. “Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery.”The central bank’s policies can create the conditions for more growth and investment, Mr. Brzeski said, “but they simply can’t force people or companies to invest. That’s why the discussion is gradually moving toward” what role “governments should play.”That may seem to be an unexceptional view, but it is a major departure from the consensus in a bloc dominated by Germany, which has long pushed for balanced budgets. In a sign that times may be changing, even Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, recently suggested the possibility of tax cuts after elections in autumn 2017.Follow David Jolly on Twitter @davjolly.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
