Thermo Fisher agreed in January to pay $14 a share for Affymetrix.Origin also said that it had raised the size of a reverse termination fee payable to Affymetrix to $100 million from $75 million.Affymetrix rejected Origin’s initial bid, questioning the group’s financing. Thermo Fisher quickly weighed in, arguing that Origin’s bid would not survive regulatory review, in part because of its support by SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm.Ultimately, Origin’s executives hope to merge Affymetrix with their current genetics analysis provider, Centrillion Technology Holdings.On Monday, Origin responded, arguing that it could close a takeover of Affymetrix quickly and repeating its contention that any such deal would not require review by the government panel that reviews transactions for national security issues.Shareholders in Affymetrix are scheduled to vote on the Thermo Fisher deal on Thursday, and Thermo Fisher hopes to close that transaction quickly afterward.Advertisement
