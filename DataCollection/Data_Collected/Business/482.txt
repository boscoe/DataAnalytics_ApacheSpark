The company said on Friday that it would hire Christine Hohmann-Dennhardt, 65, as an executive on its top management body in charge of integrity and legal affairs effective Jan. 1. Before working for Daimler, Ms. Hohmann-Dennhardt, a lawyer, was a judge on Germanyâ€™s Federal Constitutional Court and a justice minister in the state of Hesse in southwestern Germany. American officials say Volkswagen programmed diesel engines to improperly evade emissions testing. Advertisement
