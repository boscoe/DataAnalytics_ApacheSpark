PARIS — The European Central Bank on Tuesday got a vote of confidence from Europe’s highest appeals court, which ruled that the bank has the authority to buy quantities of bonds from eurozone countries.The bond-buying program, known as Outright Monetary Transactions, was introduced in September 2012 but has never actually been used. Despite that, it is credited with helping the central bank rescue the euro.The Court of Justice of the European Union firmly backed the central bank, saying on Tuesday that the program “does not exceed the powers of the E.C.B. in relation to monetary policy.” The court, which is based in Luxembourg, also ruled that the central bank initiative did not violate rules prohibiting it from financing the debts of member states.The European Central Bank welcomed the court’s decision. In a statement, Yves Mersch, a member of the Executive Board of the central bank, said it was satisfied that the ruling “confirmed that we have been diligent in ensuring we addressed any perceived risks that we acted outside our mandate.”AdvertisementThe case had been referred to the appeals court by the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, Germany, after a group of German lawyers and academics brought a legal challenge to the central bank’s policy, arguing that it amounted to an illegal sharing of the debt of financially troubled member states.AdvertisementFaced with a sovereign debt crisis that was pushing yields on government bonds in struggling countries to unsustainable levels, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, pledged in July 2012 that the central bank would “do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.”The idea that the central bank was prepared to support two of the most embattled countries, Italy and Spain, with its unlimited firepower effectively put an end to the turmoil that was threatening to destroy the euro currency union and drove down yields across the eurozone.An advocate general of the European court, Pedro Cruz Villalón, had already endorsed the program in a preliminary ruling in January, giving the European Central Bank the confidence to begin a separate initiative, known as quantitative easing, under which it announced in January that it would buy up to 60 billion euros, or about $67 billion, in bonds each month through the end of 2016.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The judges hand cases back to the national courts.Technically speaking, at least, the lawsuit challenging the European Central Bank’s action is not over. Because the case was brought in Germany, the constitutional court there must still give its final ruling.A joint statement on Tuesday from Peter Gauweiler, a former member of the German Parliament who led the group that filed the original lawsuit, and his lawyer Dietrich Murswiek said that for the German court, the ruling was “a declaration of war.”Bernd Odörfer, a spokesman for the Federal Constitutional Court, declined to comment other than to say that its justices had yet to examine the ruling.David Jolly reported from Paris and James Kanter from Brussels.
