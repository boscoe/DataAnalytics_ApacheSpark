The move is likely to reignite speculation about the possibility of another devaluation by Beijing and could fan trade tensions.The People’s Bank of China posted a commentary on its website saying it would calculate and release the value of the renminbi based on a basket of foreign currencies, after many years of relying overwhelmingly on calculations based on the renminbi’s value in dollars.The Chinese central bank did not say when it might make such a move, which could rock global financial markets.The last change in the central bank’s method for determining the renminbi’s exchange rate occurred in August and accompanied an immediate 2 percent devaluation. That was followed by a further slide in the renminbi in the next couple of days of trading, before the Chinese central bank intervened heavily to keep the currency from tumbling further.China’s enormous overseas spending has helped it displace the United States and Europe as the leading financial power in large parts of the developing world.With the American economy expanding while Europe, Japan and many emerging markets languish, the dollar has rallied strongly for the last couple of years, and many economists expect that to continue. Basing the renminbi’s value on a group of currencies would cause it to fall against the dollar if the dollar’s strength persisted in the coming months.“Managing the renminbi’s value relative to a basket of currencies rather than just the U.S. dollar would allow China to make a smoother transition to a more market-determined exchange rate,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist who used to be the head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division. “One consequence of such a shift, given the prospects of further dollar strength in the coming months, would be a further depreciation of the renminbi relative to the dollar.”Mr. Prasad added that “this would certainly be helpful for the Chinese economy, although at best marginally, at a time of slowing growth and weak exports.”The possibility of further devaluation of the renminbi also complicates the Federal Reserve’s decision next week on whether to begin raising short-term interest rates. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, and other top Fed officials strongly hinted last week that they would start pushing rates higher, anticipating that the general price level in the United States would start rising if they left rates near zero.But a weaker renminbi relative to the dollar would make Chinese goods even cheaper in the United States, helping to forestall inflation. Prices in the United States for imported goods have fallen nearly 10 percent in the last year, although partly because of falling commodity prices.The People’s Bank, China’s central bank, clearly pegged the renminbi to the dollar until July 2005. It then allowed a one-time appreciation in the renminbi and said it was starting to peg the renminbi to a basket of currencies. But many statistical analyses by Western economists have shown that the People’s Bank essentially adopted a program of very gradual appreciation to the dollar, with the renminbi showing little correlation with other currencies.As the dollar has strengthened, and as wages in China have risen by double-digit annual percentages, China has found its export competitiveness beginning to weaken. The People’s Bank said in its statement on Friday evening that the renminbi appreciated 2.9 percent against the central bank’s new index during the first 11 months of this year, even as the renminbi weakened slightly against the dollar.As a result, the central bank said, the renminbi “is still a strong currency.”The International Monetary Fund last week added the renminbi to the fund’s special drawing rights, essentially anointing it as one of the world’s leading reserve currencies alongside the dollar, euro, yen and British pound. China had intervened heavily to preserve the value of the renminbi through its many months of campaigning for accession to the special drawing rights, and the I.M.F.’s decision may have reduced the need for Beijing to continue intervening.China has the world’s largest overall trade surplus and consistently runs extremely large trade surpluses with the United States, exporting $4 worth of goods to the United States for every $1 of American goods that it imports. The Commerce Department released trade data last week showing that the American trade deficit in goods rose to $306 billion in the first 10 months of this year, compared with $282.9 billion during the same period last year.That was roughly half the overall American trade deficit in goods. American banks and other service providers have been asking Beijing for greater regulatory permission to do business in mainland China, which could someday begin to narrow the deficit.China needs to run very large trade surpluses because it has considerable overcapacity in many industrial sectors, and domestic consumption has been growing but not fast enough. Investment in China has been weak.Many Chinese families and companies have also been moving huge sums of money overseas, often to invest in real estate. This has tended to weaken the renminbi and has made China more dependent on large trade surpluses to bring in foreign currency and balance the outflow of investment.Advertisement
