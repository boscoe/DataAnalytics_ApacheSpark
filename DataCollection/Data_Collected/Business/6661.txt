LONDON — The agricultural and chemical giant Syngenta said on Monday that it had rejected a second takeover approach from Monsanto, its American rival.Syngenta of Switzerland said it received another letter from Monsanto on Saturday, essentially repeating its prior offer to acquire the company for about $45 billion. Syngenta rejected a takeover bid by Monsanto in May, in part citing potential regulatory concerns.The latest offer added a $2 billion breakup fee if the merger proved unpalatable to regulators, which Syngenta said was “wholly inadequate” and “paltry.”“Monsanto’s second letter represents the same inadequate price, same inadequate regulatory undertakings to close, same regulatory risks and same issues associated with dual headquarters’ moves,” Syngenta said in a news release. “As such, we have reiterated our prior rejection of Monsanto’s proposal.”AdvertisementIn rejecting the prior offer, Syngenta said Monsanto’s bid undervalued Syngenta’s prospects and underestimated “the significant execution risks, including regulatory and public scrutiny at multiple levels in many countries.”AdvertisementOn Monday, Syngenta said that its board, in conjunction with its legal advisers, did not believe that the regulatory concerns would be resolved by “a pre-agreed and pre-announced package of horizontal divestitures, which is Monsanto’s proposed approach.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
