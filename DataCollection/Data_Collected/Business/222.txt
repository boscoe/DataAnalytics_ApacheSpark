The streaming video service Vimeo plans to announce Thursday that it is expanding its push into original content by backing a web series, a short film and a stand-up comedy special.Vimeo’s new offerings include “The Outs,” based on the critically acclaimed web series from Adam Goldman and Sasha Winters about young gay men; “Darby Forever,” a short film from the “Saturday Night Live” cast member Aidy Bryant about a clerk at a fabric store; and a live comedy special from the drag queen Bianca Del Rio.The special will appear in December, while “The Outs” and “Darby Forever” will have their debuts early next year.The new productions come a year after Vimeo first entered the business of original programming by backing the web series “High Maintenance,” about a marijuana dealer who visits customers in New York City. In April, HBO announced that it would produce six new episodes of the series.AdvertisementVimeo, which is owned by Barry Diller’s IAC, has invested about $10 million on content to date for exclusive and original productions. It plans to spend at least $10 million to $12 million in 2016, with a larger share devoted to original programming.While the spending pales in comparison to the $6 billion that Netflix plans to invest in content next year, it shows how Vimeo is trying to distinguish its offerings and spotlight creators on its ad-free, global service.Advertisement“This new slate of Vimeo Originals exemplifies the fresh, unique voices of Vimeo creators who are propelling online storytelling and entertainment to new levels of quality,“ Kerry Trainor, Vimeo’s chief executive, said in a statement.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
