The industry includes efforts to develop new fertilizers and pesticides, Internet-connected devices to help farmers better raise crops, and data services that help food producers analyze their businesses.Financing for agriculture tech start-ups climbed to $4.6 billion last year, nearly doubling what was raised in 2014, according to AgFunder, a crowdfunding platform for the sector.It is a market that Anterra has focused on since being spun off from Rabo Private Equity, an arm of the Dutch bank Rabobank, in 2013. Since then, the investment firm has been backed by Rabobank and Eight Roads, an investment arm of Fidelity.Among Anterraâ€™s portfolio companies are Vestaron, which specializes in creating new insecticides, and Food Freshness Technology, which produces new types of packaging aimed at helping food last longer.Advertisement
