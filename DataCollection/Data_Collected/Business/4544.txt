HONG KONG — The Chinese sports brand Li Ning said Thursday it posted a loss for a third year in a row as it invests in a restructuring plan, and said it has appointed the executive chairman Li Ning as its interim chief executive.Li Ning, which is backed by the U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital and the Singapore sovereign fund GIC, posted a net loss of 781.5 million renminbi, or $125.4 million, for 2014, compared with a 391.5 million renminbi loss a year earlier.The retailer warned in January that it expected to post a loss for 2014, partly because of the costs of its transformation plans, and the result was in line with analysts’ forecasts.Li Ning said full-year revenue rose 16 percent to 6.73 billion renminbi, while its gross profit margin came in at 44.6 percent, compared with 44.5 percent in 2013.The company, which recently teamed up with the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to produce a new generation of “smart” running shoes, operated 5,626 retail stores in China as of the end of December, 289 fewer stores than a year earlier.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
