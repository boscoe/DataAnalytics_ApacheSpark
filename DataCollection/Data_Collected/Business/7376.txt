LONDON — In its effort to woo the reinsurance firm PartnerRe, the Italian investment company Exor has sweetened its unsolicited takeover bid as it takes its case directly to investors.Exor is pressing its attack as part of its monthlong effort to wrest PartnerRe away from its preferred merger partner, Axis Capital Holdings. Exor has bid $6.8 billion in cash for the insurer, insisting that its deal is superior to the Axis transaction.PartnerRe has said that the Exor offer provides “inadequate value” to shareholders and has urged them instead to approve the Axis deal. Shareholders in PartnerRe are set to vote on the Axis transaction on July 24.The move comes amid a frenzy of deal making in the insurance industry. It also marks an ambitious undertaking by John Elkann, Exor’s chief executive and the scion of the Agnelli family that founded and still controls the Italian holding company.AdvertisementThe public exchanges between Exor and PartnerRe have become increasingly testy in recent weeks as the companies have accused each other of misleading investors.AdvertisementAlready, Exor has publicly urged PartnerRe employees to reject the Axis deal. And the company has embarked on a series of meetings with its target’s investors, hoping to sway them to its cause.In its announcement on Tuesday, Exor unveiled a number of revisions to its latest offer, worth about $137.50 a share. Among them: It would be willing to let PartnerRe to seek out potentially higher takeover bids through the end of August.Speaking of the proposed merger of PartnerRe and Axis, Mr. Elkann said at a news conference: “It’s now six months since the offer, and the marketplace is well aware of the company. It shouldn’t be difficult, if there are potential acquirers, to find them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Exor would not do so if PartnerRe was forced to pay the termination fee, Exor said.And Exor said it would both raise the dividend on PartnerRe’s preferred shares, which comprise about 40 percent of the shareholder vote, and would refrain from buying back those preferred shares for another six years.PartnerRe on Tuesday also urged shareholders to seek answers to what it said were crucial questions about the Exor proposal, including the value of its offer, potential execution risks in the transaction and the potential impact on the insurer’s credit ratings.PartnerRe has said that Exor has been unwilling to engage in discussions with PartnerRe’s board to resolve those issues.In a statement, the reinsurer also said that several of its directors, who are also shareholders, had sought to attend the presentation but were denied entry.Mr. Elkann was undeterred by the continued opposition, genially pressing his case on Tuesday.“Have a good day,” he said at the end of Tuesday’s news conference. Referring to the upcoming Axis merger vote, he added, “And if you own PartnerRe shares, vote no. it’s in your best interests.”A version of this article appears in print on July 8, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Exor Adds to Bid.
