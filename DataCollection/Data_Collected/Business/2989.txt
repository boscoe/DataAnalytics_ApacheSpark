WASHINGTON —  Nissan said it would help open about 1,000 high-speed charging stations for electric vehicles between now and April 2016.Days earlier, BMW and Volkswagen announced a joint effort to build 100 high-speed public charging stations along heavily trafficked corridors on the East and West Coasts.Nissan did not disclose where the chargers would be built, but the company will probably focus its efforts on the nation’s largest metro areas, said Brendan Jones, Nissan’s director of electric vehicle sales and infrastructure deployment.High-speed chargers can fill up a vehicle’s battery in roughly 20 to 30 minutes.Mr. Jones also said the new chargers would be compatible with most electric vehicles.AdvertisementThere are two main types of charging connectors for electric vehicles from the major automakers — Tesla has its own — and Mr. Jones said some of Nissan’s 800 chargers around the country already had one of each type. The newly planned stations will, too. BMW said last week it also would feature dual chargers.Nissan has chargers in 13 metro areas, including San Francisco, Dallas and Washington, and plans to expand to 25 cities by the end of the year.AdvertisementUnlike BMW and VW, which will pay to build and operate their new charging locations, many of the Nissan-sponsored locations will be built and run by third-party networks like NRG eVgo.A version of this article appears in print on January 27, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Nissan Plans 1,000 New Stations to Quickly Charge Electric Cars.
