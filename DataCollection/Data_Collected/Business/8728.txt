HONG KONG — Bohai Leasing of China plans to buy the Irish aircraft leasing firm Avolon in a deal with worth $7.6 billion, the companies said.According to the deal, announced late Thursday, Bohai, which is owned by the shipping conglomerate HNA Group, will pay Avolon $31 a share in cash. That is a 31 percent premium to Avolon’s closing price of $23.73 per share before the Bohai approach to Avolon in July. Avolon closed at $28.71 on Thursday.The United States-listed Avolon went public in December at $20 per share. Bohai decided to make a takeover offer after learning of a rival bid. It bumped up its offer to $32 per share in August.Avolon said in a news release that the final price of $31 a share reflected the recent volatility in global markets.Advertisement“Our vision at Bohai is to build each of our transportation finance businesses into global leaders,” Chris Jin, the chief executive of Bohai, said in a news release. “Avalon has delivered remarkable growth over the past five years to become a leading industry franchise with a distinct business model, and the company is a strong complement to our existing investment in the aircraft leasing sector.Avolon’s chairman, Denis J. Nayden, added, “We believe Bohai will enhance Avolon’s profile, positioning and relationships in the Chinese aviation market — a market which we believe offers one of the most compelling growth opportunities in global aviation over the next two decades.”AdvertisementThe deal needs regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the first quarter of 2016.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
