The stock market withstood fierce punishment last year and had almost nothing to show for it. A strong fourth quarter healed some of the damage but as the year closed and 2016 began, the battering in the market began yet again.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended 2015 at 2,043.94, down just 0.7 percent for the year, after a late rally helped the benchmark recover most of the ground lost during a sharp summertime swoon. The 6.5 percent fourth-quarter gain followed a 6.9 percent third-quarter decline.One reason for the flat-but-volatile performance is that there was much to worry about, yet not much happened.“The markets went nowhere all year because there was a lot of noise and we were waiting for the Fed,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.AdvertisementWall Street and the world waited nearly all year for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The central bank obliged at last in mid-December, nudging the target for its main short-term rate up by a quarter percentage point and suggesting that more increases were coming in 2016.As for the noise, “we worried about Greece blowing the euro up, China slowing down and another government shutdown” in the United States, Mr. Kelly said. “We worried about them, but in the end they didn’t become a real problem. They just kept people on the sidelines. Not that these problems have gone away, but we’ve managed to look through them.”Investors lately have done more than look. They have endured another pummeling. A plunge in the Chinese currency, the renminbi, apparently on fears of economic weakness, led to a sharp drop in Chinese stocks in two of the year’s first three trading days that spilled over into markets worldwide. The S.&P. 500 lost 6 percent in the first week of trading, the worst start to a year ever.

That was a departure from the placid and profitable fourth quarter. The average domestic stock fund was up 4.3 percent, according to Morningstar, led by double-digit gains for portfolios that concentrate on technology and health care. International stock funds rose 3.3 percent, as China and Japan outperformed.The fourth-quarter gains alleviated widespread weakness that had been masked by comparative strength in the large companies that dominate the S.&P. 500. The full-year decline in the index still allowed it to outperform shares of smaller companies and nearly all major foreign markets, especially in the developing world. Nearly every other significant asset class fared worse, too, including investment-grade bonds and less creditworthy high-yield issues, foreign currencies and commodities like gold and oil.AdvertisementFor all of 2015, the average domestic stock fund fell 1.3 percent, with specialists in small companies down 5 percent and midsize companies down 4.4 percent. Average losses exceeded 20 percent for portfolios that concentrate on energy and other commodities.International stock funds fell 2.9 percent, as losses in emerging markets, mainland Asia and Latin America more than offset gains in Europe and Japan.For all the turbulence before the fourth quarter and so far in 2016, the markets seemed to take the Fed’s rate increase in stride. The S.&P. 500 closed December almost exactly where it was on Dec. 15, the day before the move, and the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was 2.27 percent on both days.Bond funds were nevertheless weak to poor. The average one fell 0.7 percent during the fourth quarter, hurt by a 2 percent decline in the high-yield niche. For the full year, bond funds in general were off 1.4 percent, with high-yield bonds losing 4 percent.Although Wall Street accepted the rate increase graciously, some investment advisers wish that it hadn’t happened and wonder how markets will perform this year, especially if the Fed keeps raising rates.“They did it because they felt they had to,” said Hank Herrmann, chief executive of Waddell & Reed. “I don’t think the data necessarily supported doing it.”GDPNow, a forecasting tool of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, estimated on Jan. 6 that the economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. The forecast has eroded steadily from nearly 3 percent two months earlier.The Fed has signaled that it will raise rates four times this year, but the markets don’t believe it, and neither does Mr. Herrmann. Based on prices of interest-rate derivatives, two further increases are expected. He anticipates either one or none.Advertisement“Economic data will provide the answer, and I think it’s going to remain something less than robust,” he said. “I don’t think we have an inflation threat. There’s still room for employment to increase and not cause a lift in wages.”Charles de Vaulx, chief investment officer at International Value Advisers, is concerned that inflation will bubble up. He also worries about the opposite problem: deflation. Either could occur, he warned, as the Fed tries to step back from crisis mode and return to normal monetary policy while the world pares excessive debt on the books of governments, businesses and consumers.“It’s a binary outcome. Will deflationary trends stay in place for another 10 years or will there be inflation?” Mr. de Vaulx said. “The outcome is unknown, and investors have to acknowledge their ignorance. They should avoid making a one-way bet,” by overemphasizing government bonds, for example, to safeguard against deflation, or commodities to hedge against inflation.Whichever way it plays out, he foresees anemic long-term performance, or worse, for many investments.“Stocks and bonds will be able to deliver exceedingly low returns for the next five to seven years,” he predicted. “Investors have to plan accordingly.”That means buying a diverse group of assets, stressing ones that appear cheap. For Mr. de Vaulx that includes stocks and bonds in emerging markets; high-yield debt, particularly bonds issued by oil-service companies; and gold and other commodities. He also encourages stockpiling cash, which he called “a critical tool to have in a low-return environment where volatility may be with us for a while.”“The key is to have realistic expectations, then diversify, hold cash, be nimble, be willing to be contrarian,” he advised.Robert J. Horrocks, chief investment officer of Matthews International Capital Management, questions how realistic the Fed’s economic expectations are and what the consequences will be for Asia if growth remains soft.Advertisement“The jury is still out on how strong underlying growth in the U.S. economy is,” Mr. Horrocks said. “Inflation is still well contained. The Fed was pretty fast off the mark, and I suspect that worries some Asian markets.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Looking past the near future, “the underlying elements that support growth and ultimately increase profits are still there in Asia,” he added, including stronger productivity growth than other regions and more rapidly expanding economic output.He recommends high-quality companies that pay healthy dividends and have strong competitive positions within their industries. Of the two big mainland markets, he prefers China to India, but he finds good opportunities at lower prices in Thailand and Malaysia. He would also seek out “middle-class growth stories” in industries like retailing, insurance, health care and consumer staples.Ben Inker, co-head of asset allocation at GMO, likewise finds the short-term economic outlook daunting, and not just in Asia. He pointed out that the value and volume of global trade shrank last year, something that has never occurred outside of a recession.Mr. Inker encourages investors to go cheap and go abroad. His preferred destination is emerging markets, which have suffered from high indebtedness and weak prices in commodities like the oil and industrial metals that they export. Emerging markets took a turn for the worse — funds that focus on them fell 13.4 percent in 2015 — as the dollar grew stronger, reducing the dollar value of their assets and raising the burden of the dollar-denominated debt that proliferates in the developing world.“There’s a lot to be afraid of there, but generally the best money is to be made where people fear to go,” he said. “People have given up on emerging; you can buy good companies at really cheap prices.”Oil prices are bound to recover at some point, he added, but he conceded that it could take a while.“It’s hard to imagine a situation where the price stays at $30 to $40 a barrel for long if the world is producing as much oil as it consumes,” he said, noting that “production activity has come to a screeching halt.”AdvertisementAmong American assets, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities offer better value for safety-conscious investors than conventional Treasury instruments, Mr. Inker said. He also considers it worth taking a chance on high-yield bonds for the long haul, but he cautioned that they “could get worse before they get better.”Mr. Kelly of J.P. Morgan also favors high-yield bonds, even though he expects economic and investment conditions to get better before they get worse now that the Fed has begun to raise interest rates. The first move to raise rates in a tightening cycle can lift the economy by putting more money into the hands of savers, he said, while borrowers on fixed-rates loans often see no change for a while. Home sales can improve, too, as the prospect of higher mortgage rates compel buyers to act.After that initial activity, growth slows and further rate increases can choke off a recovery. That’s what Mr. Kelly envisions.“You want to avoid a situation where you’re raising rates as the economy is slowing down,” he said. Because the Fed waited so long, “there’s a risk of that toward the end of the year. We have the potential for a typical central-bank-induced boom and bust.”Before it happens, Mr. Kelly expects stocks in economically sensitive sectors like financial services and consumer cyclicals to outperform. He also likes emerging markets. The appreciation of the dollar in anticipation of rising interest rates has hurt them, but now that rates are heading up, the dollar may reverse course.“My instinct is if something is cheap and good for long-term investors, don’t wait for a better buying opportunity,” he said.But many investors in 2016 have focused on selling opportunities, especially in assets that took spectacular drops in 2015, like oil and Chinese stocks. Mr. Herrmann wonders if the Fed will be all that eager to tighten credit further. He would stick with safer investments, including Treasury bonds and stocks in sectors that can generate growth in an anemic economy, such as health care, technology and consumer staples. He also advised being prepared for more excitement, like it or not.“It’s a confusing time,” Mr. Herrmann said. “You have to predict the unpredictable now more than ever.”A version of this article appears in print on January 17, 2016, on Page BU16 of the New York edition with the headline: The Party That Wasn’t.
