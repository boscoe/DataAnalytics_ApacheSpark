Claims have now held below the 300,000 mark for 37 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch in years, and are not too far from levels last seen in the early 1970s.Claims below this level are usually associated with a healthy jobs market. Economists say there is little scope for claims to drop further as the labor market approaches full employment.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,000 last week, to 270,750.The claims data covered the survey period for the nonfarm payrolls portion of the November employment report. The four-week average of claims rose 7,500 between the October and November surveys, suggesting a pullback in job growth from October’s robust 271,000 gain.The claims report showed that the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 2,000 in the week that ended Nov. 7, to 2.18 million.The fairly robust labor market underscores the economy’s stamina in the face of a strong dollar, energy spending cuts, an inventory overhang and slowing global growth, which have undercut factory activity.In a separate report, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index increased 0.6 percent last month after dipping 0.1 percent in both September and August. That suggests economic growth will accelerate from the third quarter’s anemic 1.5 percent annualized pace.A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its general activity index rose to 1.9 this month from -4.5 in October. It was the first positive reading in three months for the regional survey. Data on Tuesday showed a healthy increase in United States manufacturing output in October.“The big contraction in manufacturing activity is probably done for now,” said Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.Advertisement
