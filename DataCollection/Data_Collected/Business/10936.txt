Six years after plunging sales during the recession forced automakers into bankruptcies and painful restructuring, the industry has roared back to achieve new heights.Automakers said on Tuesday that strong demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in December had helped the industry set an annual record of 17.5 million vehicles sold in the United States in 2015.The results topped the previous high of 17.4 million vehicles set in 2000, and raised expectations for further increases in the coming months.Most major manufacturers reported solid gains last month because of low gas prices, easy credit and the fact that the month had two more selling days than the previous December.AdvertisementOne notable exception was the German automaker Volkswagen, which posted a decline partly because of an emissions-cheating scandal that has curtailed the availability of certain diesel-powered vehicles under investigation in the United States and elsewhere.AdvertisementIn December, manufacturers sold 1.64 million vehicles, which represented a 9 percent increase over the previous year. For all of 2015, industry sales increased by about 6 percent.Analysts said the seasonally adjusted sales rate for December had slipped from the torrid pace set in the previous three months. But that hardly diminished enthusiasm in the industry for another possible record-setting year ahead.“The strong exit to 2015 bodes well, and we expect the market momentum to continue, with sales projected at 17.8 million in 2016,” said Christopher Hopson, an analyst with the research firm IHS Automotive.General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, reported sales of 290,000 vehicles in December, which was a 5.7 percent increase over the same period a year earlier.The company benefited from strong consumer demand for new truck models like the midsize Chevrolet Colorado pickup, as well as S.U.V.s like the Buick Encore. One surprise was an increase of nearly 29 percent for G.M.’s Cadillac division, which has struggled in recent years to gain share in the ultracompetitive luxury market.G.M.’s chief economist, G. Mustafa Mohatarem, said favorable economic conditions should propel further gains in the year ahead.MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMDEC. 2014SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesDEC.2015 SALES678,154829,1851,507,339DEC. 2014656,261987,0281,643,289DEC. 2015%F-SeriesSilverado1500-3500CamryAccordCivicCorollaRAV4CR-VAltimaEscapeSierraRogueFusionCherokeeSonataFORDCHEVROLETRAMTOYOTAHONDAHONDATOYOTATOYOTAHONDANISSANFORDGMCNISSANFORDJEEPHYUNDAI85,21162,99243,13537,29935,05632,79632,44531,86631,18529,46227,95427,43826,47925,57624,04922,820+14.6+  8.9–  2.5+18.0+11.0+29.4+  7.7+38.6–  3.7–  8.9+  9.2+17.1+78.0+10.4+35.8+27.3–3.2%+19.0%+9.0%CHANGE   17.34ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+78.0%NissanRogueHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDDEC. 2015SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE290,230            238,350237,606                    217,527                                                               150,893                                     139,300                                        63,508        56,274       54,241                                                          52,015   +  5.7+10.8 +  8.3+12.6+  9.9+18.7 –  1.5  +12.7+19.0–  3.4  %17.714.514.513.29.28.53.93.43.33.2%GENERAL MOTORSTOYOTAFORD MOTORFIAT CHRYSLERHONDANISSANHYUNDAISUBARUKIAVOLKSWAGENBIGGESTLOSER–8.9%NissanAltimaJAN. 5, 2016
“The single most important pieces are the ongoing gains in employment and the growth in personal income,” he said. “When you add in lower energy prices, it’s easy to see why consumer spending is strong.”AdvertisementFord Motor, the second-biggest auto company in the United States, said it sold 237,000 vehicles in December, which was an 8.3 percent increase over the same month a year earlier.While sales of Ford’s cars slipped about 5 percent during the month, those of its trucks and S.U.V.s rose nearly 13 percent. Leading the way were two of its biggest sellers: the F-Series pickup, which posted about a 15 percent gain, and the Explorer S.U.V., which increased by 17 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
