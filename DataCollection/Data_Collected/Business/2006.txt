Aron president and chief executive on Tuesday, filling a post vacated by Gerardo I. Lopez in July.The chief executive position had been filled on an interim basis by Craig R. Ramsey, AMC’s chief financial officer, who remains in that post. Mr. Aron, 61, will become AMC’s chief executive on Jan. 4. He is currently the chief executive of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, and had previously been a chief executive and co-owner of the National Basketball Association’s Philadelphia 76ers, among other executive positions.AMC, which operates 348 theaters with about 5,000 screens, primarily in the United States, was acquired by the Dalian Wanda Group of China for about $2.6 billion in 2012.Speaking by telephone on Tuesday, Mr. Aron said he expected AMC to “push the envelope further” in enhancing its theaters with new technology and amenities like dining options.Mr. Aron — who spoke as Los Angeles schools were being closed for the day because of an emailed threat — also acknowledged that theater security would probably receive closer scrutiny in coming months.“All of us in every dimension of our lives are going to be paying more attention to security” after terror attacks in Paris and California, Mr. Aron said.Asked whether he planned to attend next year’s Oscar ceremony, where “Spotlight” — released by Open Road Films, which AMC co-owns with the Regal Entertainment Group — is expected to be in contention for top honors, Mr. Aron said, “Yes.”Advertisement
