Two nongovernment surveys suggested that the economy might be regaining some momentum, and many analysts expected further policy support to ensure a more sure-footed recovery. The preliminary purchasing managers index for China, published by HSBC and compiled by Markit, a data analysis firm, edged up to 49.6 in June. It was the survey’s highest level in three months but still below 50, which would have pointed to an expansion. The final reading for May was 49.2. “The pickup in new orders” — which returned to positive territory at 50.3 in June — “was driven by a strong rise in the new export orders subcomponent, suggesting that foreign demand may finally be turning a corner,” Capital Economics analysts wrote in a research note. “Today’s P.M.I. reading reinforces our view that the economy has started to find its footing.” A report by China Beige Book International, a data analysis firm, painted a rosier picture, describing a “broad-based recovery” in the second quarter, led primarily by China’s interior provinces.Advertisement
