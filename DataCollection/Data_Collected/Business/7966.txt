The company’s second-quarter results beat Wall Street’s expectations on all fronts, just as Facebook’s did on Wednesday and Twitter’s on Tuesday. But the signs behind the headline numbers seem to be worrying investors, enough for shares of all three companies to fall this week. LinkedIn fell 7.7 percent in after-hours trading, but fluctuated widely as investors digested the earnings. Initially, it rose 8 percent. Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial, said that while LinkedIn’s stock price was roughly unchanged since the start of the year, this masked “wild gyrations.” He said the stock had moved over 10 percent on each of LinkedIn’s last four earnings reports. LinkedIn’s adjusted earnings of 55 cents a share were well above the 30 cents that analysts polled by FactSet had expected for the April-June quarter. Revenue grew 33 percent, to $712 million, also above analysts’ expectations of $680 million. Net loss was $67.7 million, or 53 cents a share, wider than last year’s loss of $1 million. The company had warned in April that earnings would be damped by costs related to its purchase of Lynda.com, an online learning company. Advertisement
