Pfizer and Allergan thought up several situations where their blockbuster $152 billion merger agreement could meet resistance, including from shareholders, regulators and lawmakers, and even rival suitors.In their agreement, filed on Monday, the two companies walk through the varying termination fees they will pay each other in the event the deal collapses.The termination amount will be $3 billion if one of the companies’ boards changes its mind about the deal on or before March 1, 2016, other than in response to a “superior proposal,” the filing said. If it changes its mind after March 1, the break-up fee is $3.5 billion.Evercore ISI analysts say the fees, about 2 to 4 percent of the deal’s value, seem in line with customary fees. But Pfizer and Allergan gave themselves a less expensive way out.If one company’s stockholders vote down the transaction and the other side’s stockholders approve it, the company whose stockholders turned down the deal has to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion, according to the merger agreement. The votes are scheduled one day before the planned close, an Evercore analyst, Mark Schoenebaum, points out.Advertisement“This could be read as giving either party the ability to break the deal once all the approvals are in place for a lower break fee,” he said.AdvertisementThe planned merger, announced on Monday, continues to attract outcries from Congress, where lawmakers have pressed for an overhaul of the tax code to prevent so-called corporate inversions.In an inversion, an American company merges with a foreign company and relocates its headquarters abroad to a lower-tax environment. The Treasury Department issued new rules just days ago trying to stop companies from trying the maneuver, though many have done so in the last two years.Pfizer’s combination with Allergan is motivated by lower taxes. But in the case of Pfizer, which is based in New York, it is technically Allergan, based in Dublin, that is doing the buying.
            Pfizer has undertaken a number of huge takeovers and Allergan itself is the product of numerous mergers.        Still, the merger – the biggest in 15 years – has sounded alarm bells in Washington, where regulators and lawmakers are eager to stop the estimated loss of $34 billion in potential tax revenue as American corporations move overseas.Legislation introduced earlier this year by a group of Democratic lawmakers would close tax loopholes to prevent inversions, but it hasn’t gained any traction on Capitol Hill despite calls for reform.“Inversions are a terrible deal for the American taxpayer,” Senator Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat and one of the bill’s co-sponsors, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Large companies use loopholes to get around paying their fair share of taxes, which is something middle-class Americans cannot do.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
