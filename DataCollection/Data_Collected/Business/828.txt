WASHINGTON —  The Federal Reserve wants to make sure that investors understand that it could raise its benchmark interest rate in December; it just is not ready to make any promises yet.The Fed said on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it would keep rates near zero for now, as expected, but it added an unusually explicit statement that it would consider raising rates at its final meeting of the year in mid-December.Fed officials are struggling to decide whether the economy can tolerate higher interest rates, as growth continues to wobble along rather than power ahead on a clear upward path.Some risks to the economy have diminished in recent weeks: Global markets have regained a measure of equanimity, and Washington has averted another fiscal policy showdown. But there are signs that domestic growth has weakened, including a slower pace of job creation.
                Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.            “Everything will come down to the incoming data between now and mid-December,” Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said on Wednesday after the Fed revealed its latest thinking.AdvertisementThe Fed’s message appeared to make an impression on investors who had written off the chances of a December liftoff. The yield on two-year Treasuries, which is closely tied to interest rate expectations, rose to 0.707 percent Wednesday from 0.617 percent Tuesday.AdvertisementEquity indexes dropped sharply after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. but then made up the lost ground and then some. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.18 percent to 2,090.35 on the day.The odds of a December rate increase, derived from asset prices, rose from about 1 in 3 before the meeting to about 1 in 2 by the end of the day. But some investors remained skeptical that the Fed would act, noting that it has been reliably overconfident in its economic forecasts.“The Fed wants us to believe that it did not go in June and September, when the economy had a stronger pulse than it does now, but it is really seriously considering December,” the French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. “We don’t believe Chair Yellen will go along with this in the end,” it continued, referring to the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.
                More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.            The Fed’s decision to delay liftoff until at least mid-December means that short-term rates will remain near zero for a seventh full year. By keeping rates so low, the Fed is encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, which it hopes will translate into faster economic growth. Raising rates, conversely, is likely to weigh on growth by increasing the cost of borrowing.Wednesday’s decision was supported by nine of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted to raise rates, as he did in September.The looming question now is whether the Fed will raise rates at its final meeting of the year, scheduled for Dec. 15 and 16.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have predicted for years — and reiterated in recent weeks — that they expected to start raising rates in 2015.AdvertisementA number of Fed officials have described the decision not to raise rates in September as a close call. Eight of the 12 regional reserve banks voted last month to increase a secondary but symbolic policy rate. And the Fed’s statement highlighted the December meeting.“In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the committee will assess progress — both realized and expected — toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation,” the statement said. The previous Fed policy statement did not include the words “at its next meeting.”The case for raising rates hinges in part on the Fed’s forecast that the economy will continue to add jobs at a healthy pace and that inflation will begin to rise more quickly. Moreover, some analysts argue that maintaining near-zero interest rates is now doing more harm than good by encouraging businesses to invest in things like share buybacks to lift their stock price, rather than long-term investments in equipment and developing new products.Fed officials also want to raise rates slowly, to minimize economic disruptions, and starting early could help.The rebound in financial markets after a rocky late summer has removed one obstacle from the Fed’s path. In the statement issued after its previous meeting in September, the Fed said global economic and financial developments might restrain domestic growth. That language was stripped from the new statement, leaving only an acknowledgment the Fed “is monitoring global economic and financial developments.”But the Fed indicated that it was a little more worried about the domestic economy. The statement said “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,” forgoing the present tense — “is expanding” — that it used in September. And the Fed specifically said that job growth, a primary focus, had weakened in recent months, although the statement added that officials expect a rebound.Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, emphasized the importance of global forces in a recent speech.Advertisement“We should not take the continued strength of domestic demand growth for granted,” Ms. Brainard said. “Although the outlook for domestic demand is good, global forces are weighing on net exports and inflation, and the risks from abroad appear tilted to the downside.”Liberal economists and activists — including some former Obama administration officials — also continue to warn that raising rates in December would be a mistake because millions of Americans are still looking for jobs and there are no signs that inflation poses a threat.New economic data in the coming weeks could determine relatively quickly whether December remains a plausible option. The government is scheduled to release an initial estimate of third-quarter growth on Thursday, followed next week by an even more important indicator, the estimate of October job growth. The Fed policy-making committee will also have the Labor Department’s report on the November job market before it meets again.A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Deferring Action for Now, Fed Signals Openness to a December Rate Increase.
