Increased capital requirements cost large banks billions of dollars and can be thought of as taxes on size and systemic importance, though the American banks say they already meet the board’s requirements.The question is how long regulators in Washington will continue to follow the board’s designations. Not much is making them do so — international financial bodies like the board are ephemeral creatures as a matter of law.The Financial Stability Board is simply an agreement by regulators to agree on what counts as globally risky and on who meets the criteria.It has no staff, no enforcement powers, a tiny budget, and it has not been memorialized in any treaty.It nonetheless has promulgated an annually updated list of “global systemically important banks,” which it recommends be subject to increased capital requirements, since 2011.This year, 30 banks have made the list and seven of them are American. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have been deemed the most systemically significant in the world and so have been assessed the highest capital surcharge. Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were deemed to pose higher risks to systemic stability than last year, requiring enhanced capital requirements.The international collaboration represented by the Financial Stability Board has been thought to be a critical complement to the project of domestic financial supervision.Capital moves easily across borders, but regulators cannot. Arrangements like the Financial Stability Board are meant to ensure that banks are not hiding risk abroad in ways that could undermine the stability of the financial system at home. Done right, the board can take a global view of all of the activities of the largest global banks and make distinctions among them based on the risks they pose to safety and soundness no matter where they are doing business.This sort of international collaboration was endorsed after the financial crisis by the Group of 20 leading industrial nations. The Group of 20 indicated that financial regulatory cooperation would be one its highest priorities.But international cooperation is under fire in Washington.The Financial Choice Act introduced by Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would repeal the parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that encourage regulatory cooperation. It would also require the promulgation of domestic standards before engaging in any form of international collaboration.Congress has introduced similar legislation for insurance supervision.What this means for existing regulatory collaborations like the Financial Stability Board is unclear. If American banks are required in 2017 to hold even more capital by the board, will American regulators comply?On the other hand, these international arrangements serve as a constraint on domestic deregulation.As a matter of law, there is no reason domestic banking supervisors must put into effect the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board and other international regulatory efforts, but the consequences of noncompliance are high.The financial industry has long sought a level playing field when it comes to capital regulation. The idea is that American banks would be subject to the same amount of supervision as European and Asian banks when they are active in those parts of the world. Withdrawal from an international architecture intended in part to produce this level playing field would invite European and Asian regulators to impose discriminatory requirements on American financial institutions.They could do so without having to worry about the treaties we do have to prevent this sort of economic discrimination. Financial stability regulation has been exempted from the disciplines of the World Trade Organization or the various investment treaties to which the United States is a party.So the risk of a trade war could keep American regulators engaged with the Financial Stability Board, even as Congress passes statutes limiting the subjects on which collaboration is permitted.Moreover, banking supervisors have been engaged in this process of regulatory collaboration since the 1970s and interacted with one another regularly before then. They will not want to stop engaging in arrangements on which they have come to depend.I accordingly suspect that the withdrawal of American regulators from the Financial Stability Board’s designation process is unlikely. If you worry about lightly regulated banks, as I do, you will see that as a good thing.But I foresee a decline in new efforts by these international groups. International financial regulation has occasioned blizzards of white papers and rounds of consultations, culminating in agreed-upon principles to address new sources of risk in the financial system.This source of regulatory innovation will surely slow as Congress wields — or simply threatens to wield — the power to prevent collaboration in the future.David Zaring is associate professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement
