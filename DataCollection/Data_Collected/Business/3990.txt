With the 17.1 million shares it already holds, BGC owns 56.3 percent of GFI’s outstanding shares.BGC, which started a hostile bid for the company last year, had offered $6.10 a share in cash, valuing the company at about $778 million. GFI’s shares closed at the offer price of $6.10 in trading in New York on Thursday.“We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming support our tender offer received from GFI stockholders,” Howard W. Lutnick, BGC’s chairman and chief executive, said in the news release. “We believe the combination of BGC and GFI will create a strong and diversified company, well positioned to capture future growth opportunities. “As part of its agreement reached last week, BGC has chosen six new directors to serve on GFI’s eight-member board, three of which are independent directors.After the deal closes, GFI will operate as a division of BGC, reporting to Shaun D. Lynn, the BGC president. BGC and GFI will remain separately branded divisions in the company.GFI originally reached a merger agreement in July with CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange.But BGC Partners emerged in the fall with a competing bid.CME was forced to raise its bid several times under pressure from BGC, and shareholders eventually rejected the CME offer in January.Advertisement
