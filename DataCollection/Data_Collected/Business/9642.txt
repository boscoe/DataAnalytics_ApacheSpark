Williams Jr. (a onetime president of Washington Mutual) to help it challenge more established competitors.The firm has reportedly worked for Palantir Technologies, Dropbox and 23andMe. It wants to compete with the likes of Goldman Sachs and Allen & Company.Alexander Davis, who founded Disruptive Technology Advisers, said he expected money to keep flowing back to private markets, even with 2017 shaping up to be a big year for initial public offerings.“The more that the I.P.O. market opens up from our perspective,” he said, “the more recycled capital that will flow back into the private markets.”The economy grew 6.7 percent in the third quarter compared with a year ago — just as expected.That’s remarkably stable. Unbelievably so.It means that economists have to parse other numbers to see where China is headed.The likely possibilities include:• A financial meltdown, where China gets its own reckoning after creating huge amounts of new debt to cushion the effects of the 2008 financial crisis.• The good times could return if China tries to spend its way out of a slowdown — although it is getting less bang for its buck these days.• It could become Japan and face years of economic stagnation.The last option, according to Charlene Chu, a partner at Autonomous Research, would be a best-case scenario.• Morgan Stanley reports its quarterly results and the bank’s trading business is expected to have helped its quarterly profit.• The Commerce Department reports data on new housing starts in September — economists expect to see the rate of construction increase slightly.“This is an issue of deception. They are cheating Chinese consumers.”— Zhang Sitong, whose Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone caught fire. Samsung had initially said the Chinese version of the phone had a different battery and was safe. It is now paying the price in a country where the treatment of Chinese consumers by foreign firms is a contentious issue.Advertisement
