Conoco, which cut its capital spending plan nearly 30 percent this year, to $11.5 billion, told investors it expected to increase the number of rigs in its Eagle Ford acreage in South Texas to 12 in 2017 from an average of seven this year. In North Dakota’s Bakken, the rigs will double to 10 in the same period. Conoco’s rig forecast is a strong sign that producers believe in the long-term viability of drilling for shale oil, which boomed over the last decade but was scaled back sharply after oil prices tumbled 50 percent since June, to about $50 a barrel. Conoco’s chief executive, Ryan Lance, said that price recovery was likely to be “volatile.” Advertisement
