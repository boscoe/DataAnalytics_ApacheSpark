Mr. Ferro, who also became board chairman, was instrumental in replacing Tribune’s chief executive, Jack Griffin, last month with Justin C. Dearborn, the former chief executive of Merge Healthcare and a close associate of Mr. Ferro.That investment was taken, in part, to enable purchases like that of The Orange County Register and The Riverside Press-Enterprise.The Tribune Company’s financial position remains unclear, however. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week, the company disclosed that it had found “material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting.”Those material weaknesses, it said, “could result in misstatements of the accounts and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated and combined financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.”Advertisement
