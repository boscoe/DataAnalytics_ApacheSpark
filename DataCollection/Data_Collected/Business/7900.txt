During the government’s long crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry, investigators often looked for ties among a loose circle of friends.Now, federal authorities believe that some of the people suspected in last summer’s big online attack against JPMorgan Chase also turned to friends and acquaintances to further their ends.Three of the five men charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan a week ago in two criminal cases that grew out of the continuing investigation into the JPMorgan hacking attended classes at Florida State University at roughly the same time.Two of those men, Joshua Samuel Aaron and Anthony R. Murgio, both 31, belonged to the same fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa, according to records kept by the Florida State fraternity and LinkedIn. A third man charged by prosecutors, Yuri Lebedev, 37, also went to that university with Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron. On his LinkedIn page, Mr. Lebedev describes himself as working for a company led by Mr. Murgio’s brother, Joseph, another Florida State alumnus.AdvertisementBut the circle of connections to the university and fraternity is bigger than the three alumni charged by prosecutors.AdvertisementAt least five of the people whom the authorities contend Mr. Murgio appointed to a small credit union in New Jersey — which he is said to have taken control of last summer — also took classes at Florida State. Others were involved in a number of small companies that Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio formed in Florida over the last decade, most of which are no longer in operation.None of those university friends or past business associates of Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio have been charged with wrongdoing. Those people may also have known nothing about the specific criminal charges against Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio or the hacking of JPMorgan Chase.Still, criminal defense lawyers say the friends and acquaintances could represent a rich source of information for investigators trying to learn more about Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron and their activities.“What the investigators will do is look at people who know each other and have had contact with each other during critical junctures,” said Michael Bachner, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer who has represented a number of people charged with insider trading and stock manipulation. “People who have gone to school or are in business together are expected to speak to each other, and these investigators are going to follow all leads.”The names of Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron surfaced last fall in the early days of a Federal Bureau of Investigation inquiry into the JPMorgan Chase breach that led to the theft of email addresses and contact information for more than 83 million customer accounts, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Federal authorities have not commented on what led them to identify Mr. Murgio and Mr. Aaron early in the inquiry and no one has been charged with the attack against JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank.So far, Mr. Murgio, Mr. Aaron, Mr. Lebedev and two other men also charged by prosecutors are accused of committing crimes that on the surface appear to be unrelated.AdvertisementMr. Murgio and Mr. Lebedev are charged with running an illegal Bitcoin money transfer operation called Coin.mx, which processed transactions for web criminals who plant malicious software, called ransomware, to seize control of computers. The software generally can be removed only by paying a ransom, often in the form of the digital currency Bitcoin.

Mr. Aaron and two Israeli citizens, Gery Shalon, 31, and Ziv Orenstein, 41, were charged with overseeing a multiyear stock manipulation scheme involving largely worthless penny stocks. Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein were arrested in Israel and were being held in custody pending an Aug. 10 hearing.Mr. Aaron, an American citizen who grew up in Maryland but has been living in Israel for the last several years, was not arrested and is believed by the authorities to be in Russia with his wife, Alona Chaim Aaron, an Israeli citizen.Last Thursday, two F.B.I. agents visited Mr. Aaron’s parents’ home in Potomac, Md., and the home of his grandparents in Silver Spring, Md., seeking information about his whereabouts, said one person who was approached by the agents.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It was not clear how Mr. Aaron, who majored in real estate at Florida State but did not graduate, became connected with Mr. Shalon and Mr. Orenstein.People briefed on the matter said they suspect others in Russia may have carried out the actual attack on JPMorgan on the instructions of Mr. Aaron and others. Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio were said to be frequent visitors to Russia.Mr. Murgio was released from the Pinellas County Jail on Friday after posting a $100,000 bond. His brother, Joseph Murgio, speaking by phone, said that Mr. Murgio, who graduated from Florida State in 2007 with a degree in marketing, was now focused on putting together his legal team. He said that his brother wanted to tell his story but would first see what was written about him in the news media.“His main concern right now is his legal representation,” Joseph Murgio said.Prosecutors contend that Anthony Murgio tried to conceal some of the illegal activities of his Bitcoin exchange by taking control of a small credit union in Jackson, N.J., called Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union, which caters largely to lower-income members. The authorities did not identify the “individuals close” to Mr. Murgio who they said had been appointed to the board.But an archived profile page for the credit union filed with the National Credit Union Administration, the industry’s federal regulator, lists the names of five people on the board, all of whom attended classes at Florida State. Mr. Lebedev is listed in the archived filing as vice chairman of the credit union.AdvertisementOne of those people appointed to the board is a lawyer in New Jersey who graduated from Florida State’s law school in 2011. The lawyer declined to comment, as did the two other people with Florida State ties on the credit union board.In November, the credit union regulator forced Mr. Lebedev and the other board members with connections to Mr. Murgio to step down after it became concerned about a sharp increase in the dollar value of transactions being processed by a credit union with less than $300,000 in assets.The federal prosecutors’ criminal complaint said the credit union did not have the appropriate anti-money-laundering procedures in place to “handle such voluminous payment processing.” The complaint also referred to some of the board members as “co-conspirators.”Both Mr. Aaron and Mr. Murgio also had a number of business ventures in Florida, several of which either failed or were discontinued. Mr. Murgio, for instance, operated restaurants in Tallahassee and filed for bankruptcy in 2012.Mr. Aaron, while in Florida, formed two companies with another Florida State classmate and fraternity member. He also formed a venture with Mr. Murgio, according to Florida corporate records.On Tuesday, Mr. Lebedev, wearing a gray suit and gold-patterned tie, appeared before United States Magistrate Judge Frank Maas in the Federal District Court in Manhattan to respond to the criminal charges against him. No plea was entered and he remained free on a $25,000 bond. His lawyer, Mark Barnett, declined to comment after the proceeding.Mr. Murgio is expected to travel to New York in the next few days for a similar court appearance.A version of this article appears in print on July 29, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Extends Bank Breach Investigation.
