He pitched his network as one that can connect with the “completely politically disenfranchised” younger demographic.He met with several high-profile senators, nearly all of them Democrats, and offered his thoughts on them.He was impressed, he said, with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as another Democrat, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. He said that Mr. Booker’s high-profile stunts — such as living on crime-ridden street corners in a recreational vehicle and going on food stamps — had made him “the reality TV star of politics.”The sole Republican the Vice team met with was Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, who Mr. Smith said “was sort of freaked out by us.”But they eventually found common ground on international slavery, he said.Advertisement
