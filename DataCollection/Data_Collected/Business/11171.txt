The budget airlines Spirit and Frontier had the worst on-time performance and highest complaint rates. The department said that flights on the 13 largest airlines arrived on time 83.7 percent of the time, up from 80.6 percent in November. Passengers on five domestic flights were stuck on the ground for more than three hours, and people sat on a Qatar Airways plane in Detroit for more than six hours, all in possible violation of federal rules. Complaints against United States airlines rose 56 percent from a year earlier. Still, only 989 people, a tiny percentage of passengers, bothered to file a report with the government; most take their case directly to the airline. More people — 1,272 — complained about Transportation Security Administration screeners. Advertisement
