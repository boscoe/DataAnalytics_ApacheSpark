The Athens Stock Exchange has been shut since June 29, when the government closed banks and imposed strict limits on withdrawals and foreign transfers. Under a plan approved by the European Central Bank, local investors will be allowed to buy shares with existing cash holdings, but not to withdraw money from Greek bank accounts to buy shares. Officials are concerned that unlimited trading for domestic investors would accelerate capital outflows. Local brokerage firms criticized the limits, saying they would distort the market. Trading in all stocks, including banking shares, will be allowed, and volatility limits will be lowered to 20 percent from 30 percent, the exchange said. Advertisement
