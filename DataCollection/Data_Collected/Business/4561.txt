AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks advanced on Friday, capping a strong week, helped by a recovery in the price of oil and earnings from the Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants and the sportswear giant Nike. The Nasdaq edged closer to the nominal high it reached at the height of the dot-com bubble.Once again, it was the Federal Reserve affecting much of this week’s market movement. The Fed implied at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday that its policy makers were in no hurry to raise interest rates with the economy still growing slowly and inflation extremely low. Friday’s rally was partly an extension of that, strategists said.“The trepidation in the market before the Fed announcement has disappeared,” said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investments.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 168.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,127.65. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 18.83 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,108.10. The Nasdaq added 34.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,026.42, 22 points from the high of 5,048 it hit in March 2000. It has taken the Nasdaq 15 years to recover nominally from the dot-com bubble, while the S.&P. 500 and Dow reached their previous highs, not adjusted for inflation, in 2007 and 2006. Nike was among the biggest gainers on the Dow on Friday, rising $3.66, or 3.7 percent, to $101.98. Nike beat expectations, but investors focused more on foreign sales that remained strong despite the rising dollar and overseas market volatility.The rapid rise in the dollar has been a particular sore spot for investors. The dollar is up more than 8 percent against the major currencies, which makes goods made in the United States more expensive abroad and has had a negative impact on sales. The dollar rose to 120.09 yen from 120.76 yen on Thursday. The euro rose to $1.0809 from $1.0668 the previous day.The latest example was the jewelry maker Tiffany, which cut its full-year profit forecast, saying the higher dollar was making its products less attractive to foreign buyers. Shares of Tiffany fell $3.44, or 4 percent, to $82.93.“The dollar’s appreciation has been rapid and it’s become a problem for many of these companies who have significant exposure to foreign markets,” said Russ Koesterich, BlackRock’s global chief investment strategist.Darden said its same-store sales rose 3.6 percent in the most recent quarter, and lifted its outlook for the full year. Its shares rose $1.88, or 3 percent, to $66.75.Oil also helped the market on Friday. After dropping more than 3 percent on Thursday, the United States benchmark oil for April delivery rose $1.76, or 4 percent, to $45.72 a barrel. Energy stocks rose far more than the rest of the market. The S.&P. 500’s energy sector gained 2 percent.Oil ended a volatile week up 2 percent even after dropping to its lowest level in six years on Tuesday. Oil inventories are at record highs, but the number of rigs drilling for oil is falling fast and a sliding dollar is making oil a more attractive investment to overseas buyers. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 89 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $55.32 a barrel.In other futures trading on the Nymex, wholesale gasoline rose 2.4 cents to close at $1.798 a gallon; heating oil rose 1.2 cents to close at $1.734 a gallon; and natural gas fell 2.7 cents to close at $2.786 per 1,000 cubic feet.Government bond prices rose. The 10-year Treasury note rose by 11/32 to 100 20/32. Its yield fell to 1.93 percent from 1.97 percent late Thursday.Advertisement
