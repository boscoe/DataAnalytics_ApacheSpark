The companies announced this month that they would join to create a giant chemical producer that would eventually be split into three independent companies. At that time, DuPont announced a $700 million cost savings and restructuring program but did not specify how many jobs would be affected. On Tuesday, the chief of DuPont, Ed Breen, sent a letter to employees informing them that approximately 1,700 Delaware positions would be eliminated in the beginning of the year. DuPont, which has been based in Delaware for 213 years, said it would have preferred to let affected employees know of the news first. But it made the announcement during the holidays, because it was legally required to inform the state by the end of the year of the local job cuts. The company, which has about 54,000 employees worldwide, said the restructuring program would ultimately affect about 10 percent of that work force. The combined Dow-DuPont business will have dual headquarters in Delaware and Michigan, where each company is based, until it separates into three independent publicly traded companies focused on agriculture, material science and specialty products. Dow and DuPont expect their combination will cut annual expenses by $3 billion. Advertisement
