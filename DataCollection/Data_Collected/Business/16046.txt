BlackRock has grown to control $5 trillion in assets by emphasizing rules-based, data-driven investments through vehicles like exchange-traded funds.The article drew 125 comments on nytimes.com. The following have been edited and condensed.If BlackRock and similar firms convince all the large and institutional investors to buy E.T.F.s instead of riskier stocks and bonds, who will be left to buy those securities? Will there be a market for E.T.F.s to be based on?William LeGro, Los AngelesI have an inherent distrust of anyone who had a hand in creating toxic mortgage-based securities.TyroneShoelaces, Hillsboro, Ore.I love the writer’s casual reference to Mr. Fink “blowing” $100 million of other people’s money back in 1986. Mistakes of his magnitude would cost anyone else their professional license, but in the financial world it’s more like a coming-of-age milestone.Paul O’Dwyer, New YorkI for one applaud BlackRock’s systematic approach versus that of active investing by individuals — to distance themselves from the volatile human-emotion-gut-feeling-have-a-hunch investment style.Say what you may, but there are far better targets to bash than BlackRock.Wilson1ny New YorkWhy do newspapers use the term “rock star” for someone so far from rock music or vertical stone faces? It’s ridiculous.Dana, TucsonAny institution that manages $5 trillion in assets (your and my money) is too big to fail. Cap the amount any financial institution can manage at a reasonable level.Charlie Fieselman, Concord, N.C.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
