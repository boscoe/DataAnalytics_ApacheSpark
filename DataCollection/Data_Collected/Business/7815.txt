WASHINGTON —  New single-family home sales in the United States fell in June to a seven-month low, and May’s sales were revised sharply down, but the data released on Friday did little to change the belief that the housing market recovery was strengthening.Sales of new homes account for only 8.1 percent of the housing market and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. June’s surprise decline and the May revisions also are at odds with other housing data showing strong momentum.“We should not get too worried about the signal from the new-home sales data at this point,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.New-home sales dropped 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 482,000 units, the lowest level since last November, the Commerce Department said. May’s sales pace was cut to 517,000 units from 546,000 units.AdvertisementDespite two months of declines in new-home sales, they were up 18.1 percent compared with June of last year.

Housing is being supported by a tightening labor market, which has unleashed demand from young adults. Government efforts to ease lending conditions for first-time buyers through mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have helped.AdvertisementA report on Wednesday showed that home resales jumped in June to the highest they had been in eight years. Data last week showed building permits were near an eight-year peak in June, and housing starts were increasing solidly.Stocks on Wall Street traded lower on Friday, while prices for United States government debt rose marginally. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies.“We see no reason to change our view that housing activity is on an upswing,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The strong housing momentum suggests that the economy remains on solid ground despite a surprise drop in retail sales last month and a struggling manufacturing sector, and should be able to absorb an interest-rate increase expected later this year.

The United States economy is on better footing than its global peers. Data on Friday showed that Chinese manufacturing contracted in July to a 15-month low. Business activity in the eurozone slowed this month, with the weakness blamed on the impact of Greece’s debt crisis.United States manufacturing, which has been hobbled by a strong dollar and spending cuts by energy companies, showed signs of stabilizing in July.AdvertisementIn a separate report, the financial data firm Markit said its preliminary United States Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose this month to 53.8 from a 20-month low of 53.6 in June.

Still, manufacturers were cautious about hiring.“The Markit survey confirms that U.S. manufacturing is likely to see only a sluggish pace of growth in the third quarter,” said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.Economists expect that housing will partly offset manufacturing’s drag on the economy this year.A version of this article appears in print on July 25, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Sales of New Homes Fall to 7-Month Low.
