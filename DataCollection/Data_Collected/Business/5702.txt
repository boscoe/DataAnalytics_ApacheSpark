The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health issued four citations this week to SeaWorld that carried nearly $26,000 in fines. According to the agency, the park did not properly train employees or inform them of the dangers posed by orcas, or killer whales, and it required them to sign a confidentiality agreement that discourages trainers from reporting hazards. The park’s safety record has been a matter of public interest since a trainer, Dawn Brancheau, was killed in 2010 by a killer whale. That incident was the focus of a 2013 film, “Blackfish,” that suggested that the treatment of captive orcas provoked violent behavior. Attendance declined after the film was released. SeaWorld said in a statement that the citations showed a “fundamental misunderstanding” of what is needed to care for orcas and that it planned to appeal.A version of this brief appears in print on May 2, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: California Agency Fines SeaWorld Over Safety.
