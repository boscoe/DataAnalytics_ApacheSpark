Faster-growing companies should also fare better should rates eventually rise, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital.While the Nasdaq, which tracks 2,500-plus stocks, has been steadily climbing since 2011, its ascent isn’t the crazed surge that drove it to its dot-com bubble-era highs in 2000. This time the gains are underpinned by solid companies said Stephen Freedman, senior investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management Americas.The average price-earnings ratio of the Nasdaq, a measure of how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of earnings the companies in the index generate, is 21. When the Nasdaq was at its highest, the ratio reached 194.Drug developer BioMarin Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology company Radius Health were among the big gainers in the index on Thursday.
