Kraft Foods on Monday said it was revamping its macaroni-and-cheese meal to remove preservatives and synthetic colors. Kraft is battling sluggish demand as consumers shift to brands that are perceived as healthier. The company has also been targeted by consumer groups that want Kraft to stop using artificial food dyes. “We know parents want to feel good about the foods they eat and serve their families,” a Kraft spokeswoman, Lynne Galia, said in an email about the changes. Kraft said it was replacing synthetic colors with those derived from natural sources, like paprika, annatto and turmeric. Ms. Galia said the changes would take effect in January for Original Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in the United States. Kraft already makes a macaroni dinner, Mac & Cheese Boxed Shapes, without synthetic colors.A version of this brief appears in print on April 21, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Kraft to Drop Preservatives From Its Macaroni and Cheese.
