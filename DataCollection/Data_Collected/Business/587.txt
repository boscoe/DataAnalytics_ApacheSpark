Crédit Agricole, the big French bank suspected of transferring billions of dollars on behalf of Iran and other countries, has agreed to pay $787 million to resolve an array of investigations, state and federal authorities announced on Tuesday.As part of the settlement, the bank agreed to sign so-called deferred prosecution agreements with the Justice Department and the Manhattan district attorney’s office, a deal that effectively amounts to probation for corporations. It also agreed, at the request of New York State regulators, to install an independent monitor and dismiss a midlevel executive suspected of playing a role in the scheme.And yet, no Crédit Agricole employees face criminal charges. That inherent contradiction — a case that features huge financial penalties for the bank and no charges for its employees — underscores a conundrum for prosecutors struggling to pin criminal wrongdoing on individuals, even after the Justice Department recently announced new policies aimed at increasing such prosecutions.The Crédit Agricole case also signals the final chapter of a long-running investigation into sanctions violations across the banking industry, typically involving European banks that provided clients access to the United States financial system through their New York branches.AdvertisementProsecutors and regulators have now penalized about a dozen banks for processing transactions on behalf of Iran, Cuba and Sudan. The largest case was last year when BNP Paribas, the biggest French bank and a rival to Crédit Agricole, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and paid a record $8.9 billion penalty to federal and state authorities. With the Crédit Agricole settlement, only the investigations into Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and UniCredit remain unresolved.Advertisement“With this resolution, as well as previous agreements, my office and our partners are sending a clear message that financial institutions must comply with sanctions against rogue nations,” said Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. His office investigated the case along with the New York State Department of Financial Services, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the F.B.I., as well as federal prosecutors at the United States attorney’s office for the District of Columbia.The sanctions cases are winding down as a political and diplomatic shift has taken hold, with the United States easing its sanctions against Iran as part of a global deal to stunt that nation’s nuclear ambitions. The Obama administration also recently renewed diplomatic ties with Cuba, ending a decades-long stalemate and laying the groundwork for economic expansion there.But that shift will not necessarily prevent prosecutors from building sanctions cases. The Iran nuclear deal, for example, lifts only certain prohibitions on Iranian entities processing transactions in dollars, legal experts say, including the sale of rugs and some agricultural goods.“The fact is, other than some very narrow exceptions, Iran remains closed for business to U.S. companies,” said Polly Greenberg, a former head of the economic crimes bureau at the Manhattan district attorney’s office who is now running regulatory consulting at Duff & Phelps.“It is still a crime to use the U.S. financial system to facilitate nearly any Iranian transaction, and businesses seeking to engage in the Iranian market without understanding the rules do so at great peril,” she said.
                A lack of criminal prosecutions of banks and their leaders fueled a public outcry over the perception that Wall Street giants are “too big to jail.”            Anthony J. Albanese, the acting head of the Department of Financial Services, hinted on Tuesday that other sanctions cases were still working through the pipeline. “Our agency will continue to aggressively investigate and uncover misconduct at banks meant to circumvent U.S. sanctions laws — both past and present,” he said.Channing D. Phillips, the United States attorney in the District of Columbia, said, “Sanctions laws are critical to both our national security and foreign policy interests.”AdvertisementIn a statement, the bank said it was “committed to continue to strengthen its internal procedures and compliance programs regarding sanctions laws.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The illicit transactions occurred between 2003 and 2008. According to the New York regulator, the “vast majority” of employees who were “centrally involved in this misconduct no longer work at the bank.” And Mr. Phillips remarked that “the overwhelming majority of the unlawful conduct occurred at a foreign subsidiary that no longer exists.”Still, the settlement represents an important milestone for Crédit Agricole, ending one of several long-running litigation problems for the lender. It also faces inquiries from authorities in the United States and in Europe over potential manipulation of global benchmark interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.Crédit Agricole has said it is cooperating in those investigations and is in discussions with the Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in those inquiries.The bank telegraphed the outcome of the sanctions case long ago.Crédit Agricole, which is based in Paris, had previously disclosed to investors in its annual report in recent years that it was cooperating with the Justice Department, the Manhattan district attorney’s office and other American authorities in an inquiry into whether financial institutions “made payments denominated in U.S. dollars involving countries, individuals or entities subject to U.S. sanctions.”In August, the French lender said its discussions with American authorities were at “a very advanced stage” and it was confident that those discussions could “lead to a global settlement in the autumn 2015.”At the time, the bank also bolstered its litigation reserves by 350 million euros, or about $397 million, in anticipation of a settlement. As of the beginning of August, the bank had set aside €1.6 billion in total litigation provisions.Shares of Crédit Agricole closed down about 1 percent at €11.05 in Paris on Tuesday.The misconduct, authorities say, unfolded at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank. At that subsidiary, bank employees allowed transactions on behalf of Sudan, Iran, Myanmar and Cuba to flow through the United States — and covered up the deals to hide clients’ identities.Many of the transactions stemmed from Sudan, according to the New York regulatory agency, more than 4,000 in total. One of the bank’s clients, when urging Crédit Agricole to process the transactions, described the humanitarian crisis in the Darfur region of Sudan as “an exaggeration in the media.”With the Iranian transactions, the bank’s compliance staff set up policies to disguise the payments, saying the transfer instructions should come “with no mention of Iran.”A version of this article appears in print on October 21, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: French Bank to Settle Inquiries in U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
