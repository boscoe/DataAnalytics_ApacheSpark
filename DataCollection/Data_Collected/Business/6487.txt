A judge has awarded over 15 billion Canadian dollars ($12 billion) to Quebec smokers in a case that pitted them against three tobacco companies. The case is believed to be the biggest class-action lawsuit in Canada. The Superior Court justice Brian Riordan said in his decision released on Monday that by choosing not to inform health authorities or the public directly of what they knew, the companies chose profits over the health of their customers. The judgment calls on the companies to issue initial compensation of more than 1 billion Canadian dollars in the next 60 days, regardless of whether they elect to appeal. The judge will decide later how to distribute those funds. The tobacco companies — JTI-Macdonald; Imperial Tobacco; and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges — said they would appeal. The case was the first time tobacco companies had gone to trial in a lawsuit in Canada and involved two groups of plaintiffs: some who became seriously ill from smoking and others who said they could not quit.A version of this brief appears in print on June 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: In Canada, Tobacco Companies Will Pay Billions in Damages.
