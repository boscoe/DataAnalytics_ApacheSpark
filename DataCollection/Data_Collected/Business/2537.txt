Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation agreed to buy OnCore Biopharma, based in Pennsylvania, to focus on developing a hepatitis B virus treatment. The implied market value of the merged company is about $750 million, based on Tekmira stock’s closing price of $15.70 on the Nasdaq on Jan. 9, the companies said in a statement. OnCore will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Tekmira; upon closing of the deal, OnCore shareholders will hold about 50 percent of the total outstanding shares of Tekmira. Tekmira’s chief executive, Mark J. Murray, will be the chief of the merged company, and its chairman, Daniel Kisner, will become vice chairman. OnCore’s chairman, Vivek Ramaswamy, will be the chairman. Tekmira said it would continue its oncology and antiviral programs, including treatments for Ebola.A version of this brief appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Tekmira to Buy OnCore and Develop Hepatitis B Drugs.
