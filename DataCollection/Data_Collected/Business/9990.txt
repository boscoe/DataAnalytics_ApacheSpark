With Donald J. Trump gaining in the polls, investors were preparing for some volatile trading days before and after the election on Tuesday. Traders expect markets to fall sharply if Mr. Trump wins, with Mexican stocks and bonds likely to suffer the most. There are some, though, who think that his low-tax policies and his promise to invest in infrastructure would eventually spur market sentiment. A victory by Mrs. Clinton would lift markets in the short term, but there is little certainty that the rally would last, especially if her victory was a narrow one that increased polarization in Washington. Landon Thomas Jr.BANKINGEarnings season is set to draw to a close as the last of Europe’s biggest banks report their third-quarter results. The British bank HSBC and the Italian bank UniCredit are among those planning to update investors on their results. This has been a better-than-expected earnings season for a number of Europe’s lenders, with Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank both reporting profits in the third quarter and most banks meeting or exceeding analysts’ expectations. Chad Bray STEEL INDUSTRYArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel company, is to report third-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts will closely monitor the results for signs of whether Chinese steel exports are still such a dominant force in the market. ArcelorMittal, which is based in Luxembourg, and other companies have in the past blamed a flood of Chinese exports for poor financial results. Both the United States and, of late, the European Union have put through punitive tariffs to deter dumping by Chinese and other steel makers. Stanley Reed BANKINGOn Wednesday, Goldman Sachs is expected to disclose the list of its vaunted new partner class, something the firm does every two years. The distinction — a tradition from when Goldman was a partnership rather than a publicly traded bank — comes with a compensation bump and entrance into a select club: Only about 1.5 percent of Goldman employees are partners. In 2014, Goldman named 78 new partners, slightly more than it did in 2012. But it was a far cry from the 111 names Goldman chose in 2010. Leslie PickerENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRYIt could be a tricky earnings call for senior Walt Disney executives on Thursday. Analysts have predicted an unusually weak quarter, at least by Disney standards — revenue that is essentially flat ($13.52 billion compared with $13.51 billion a year ago) and per-share profits that are slightly down ($1.16 versus $1.20).ESPN is also back in the news, and not in a way Disney would like. Just when investor concern over declines in ESPN subscribers seemed to be abating, new data from Nielsen has suggested that the falloff is accelerating. (ESPN aggressively challenged the data; Nielsen crunched its numbers again and stood by them.) ESPN is also battling a new fire: “Monday Night Football” ratings have plunged by up to 20 percent so far this season, putting tens of millions of dollars of ad sales at risk. NBC, CBS and Fox have also experienced alarmingly light football viewing, and executives at those networks have largely said they were not sure what is going on (competition from presidential debates?) but that they were confident the problem was temporary.How will Disney explain it?
