That data showed consumer spending expanding at a 2.9 percent annual rate and the overall economy growing at a 2.3 percent pace.While the consumer spending data suggest less vigor in the economy heading into the third quarter, any slowdown is likely to be mitigated by a strengthening housing sector and tightening labor market, which are lifting household wealth.Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its index of national factory activity fell to 52.7 last month, from 53.5 in June.In June, spending on long-lasting manufactured goods fell 1.3 percent, with vehicle purchases accounting for most of the decrease, which reversed May’s increase. Outlays on services like utilities rose 0.4 percent.When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending was unchanged after increasing 0.4 percent in May.Inflation pressures remained benign. A price index for consumer spending rose 0.2 percent after gaining 0.3 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3 percent.Excluding food and energy, prices edged up 0.1 percent for the third straight month. The so-called core PCE price index has increased by the same margin every month since January.Advertisement
