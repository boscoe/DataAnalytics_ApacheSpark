A stockbroker has admitted to his role in a five-year insider trading scheme that yielded more than $5.6 million in net profits and had the secretive trappings of a pulp spy novel. Federal prosecutors said that the stockbroker, Vladimir Eydelman, 43, pleaded guilty on Wednesday in New Jersey to conspiracy to commit securities and tender offer fraud. He faces up to 25 years in prison at his Dec. 21 sentencing. They said the managing clerk of a New York law firm stole insider information and passed it to a friend, who gave it to Mr. Eydelman, often during meetings in the middle of Grand Central Terminal. Prosecutors said the friend usually wrote the security’s ticker symbol on a piece of paper or napkin and showed it to Mr. Eydelman. The friend then put the paper in his mouth and chewed until it was destroyed.A version of this brief appears in print on September 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Stockbroker Pleads Guilty in Insider Trading Case.
