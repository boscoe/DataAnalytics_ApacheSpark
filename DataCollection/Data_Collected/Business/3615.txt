LONDON – The German real estate company Deutsche Wohnen is planning a takeover bid for its Austrian rival Conwert Immobilien Invest that values the company at 1 billion euros, or about $1.1 billion.Deutsche Wohnen, which focuses on metropolitan areas in Germany, said on Sunday that the acquisition would be a good strategic fit as about 90 percent of Conwert’s residential property portfolio is in Germany, including holdings in Berlin, Dresden and Potsdam.Under the deal, Deutsche Wohnen said, it would offer €11.50 a share in cash for all the outstanding shares of Conwert, representing a 21.5 percent premium over the volume-weighted average price of Conwert’s shares for the past six months.Shares of Conwert jumped 8 percent to €11.85 in early trading in Vienna on Monday.“After difficult years, Conwert is facing major challenges,” Michael Zahn, the Deutsche Wohnen chief executive, said in a news release. “We want to be a strong partner and reorganize the company financially and operationally. We are making a fair offer to the shareholders, and are pleased to have two biggest shareholders tender their shares into the cash offer.”Conwert posted a net loss of €23 million in the first nine months of 2014, as low interest rates affected its derivative portfolio and it wrote down the value of some properties in Eastern Europe.A Conwert spokesman declined to comment on Monday.Haselsteiner Familien-Privatstiftung, Conwert’s largest shareholder, has agreed to sell a stake of about 19 percent of the company. The investor Karl Ehlerding, as well as other members of the Ehlerding family, plan to tender shares and options equal to about 6.6 percent of the company’s shares.The transaction is subject to Conwert shareholders’ agreeing to sell more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares, giving Deutsche Wohnen majority control of the company. The offer would also be extended for holders of Conwert bonds that can be converted to shares.Deutsche Wohnen also said it intended to make a simultaneous offer for ECO Business-Immobilien, an office property manager that is 95.8 percent owned by Conwert.ECO would be sold after the Conwert transaction is finalized, as Deutsche Wohnen does not see it as a strategic fit, the company said.Goldman Sachs, UBS and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Schönherr Rechtsanwälte are advising Deutsche Wohnen on the transaction.Deutsche Wohnen is one of the largest publicly listed real estate companies in Germany, focused primarily on managing and developing residential properties. As of Sept. 30, the company managed about 146,800 residential units and 2,100 commercial properties.
