The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics said it was working with the Kraft Foods Group to end part of a deal that allowed the food company to use one of the academy’s logos on packages of Kraft Singles.After the deal was announced by Kraft  this month, the organization faced a mutiny among some of the 75,000 registered dietitians and other food professionals who are its members.“The academy and Kraft are in discussions to terminate the contract for our pilot program,” the organization said in its email. “This will take a short period of time to complete.”But the organization said the program was already so advanced that it could not be changed immediately. Kraft Singles with the new logo will begin appearing on retail shelves on Wednesday.Advertisement“We are working with Kraft to limit the time it remains on shelves,” the academy said in its email.AdvertisementRyan O’Malley, a spokesman for the academy, did not comment further.As part of the original deal, Kraft agreed to pay for scholarships, research and public awareness campaigns in exchange for the right to use the academy’s Kids Eat Right label and website address on packages of Kraft Singles.After The New York Times published an article about the deal, some of the nutrition organization’s members expressed outrage that it would lend its imprimatur to a highly processed food.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Some 80 percent of girls and 75 percent of boys ages 4 to 18 do not get enough calcium, while almost half of all children do not consume enough vitamin D.“Although we stand by our decision to work together to shine a light on this issue and not to serve as a product endorsement, we believe misperceptions are overshadowing the campaign,” Jody Moore, a Kraft corporate spokeswoman, said in a statement. “As such, both organizations have agreed it is best not to proceed as originally planned.”Andy Bellatti, a founder of Dietitians for Professional Integrity, a group started by dietitians who questioned the academy’s strong ties to the food industry, said he was pleased that it was working to change its deal with Kraft.“Hopefully, this is the beginning of much-needed and much-overdue dialogue on the academy’s corporate sponsorships,” Mr. Bellatti said. “Dietitians need to continue advocating for an organization that represents us with integrity and that we can be proud of, rather than continually have to apologize for.”A version of this article appears in print on March 31, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Dietitians Group Negotiating to End Labeling Deal With Kraft Singles.
