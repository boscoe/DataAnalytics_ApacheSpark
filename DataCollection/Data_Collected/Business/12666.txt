The Blue Cross-Blue Shield health insurer Anthem is suing the pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts over prescription drug prices. Express Scripts runs prescription drug coverage for Anthem, the nation’s second-largest health insurer. Anthem said on Monday that it wanted to recover damages for drug prices that were higher than competitive benchmarks. Anthem said in a statement that Express Scripts was obligated to negotiate in good faith to make sure Anthem received competitive pricing, but that it had refused to do so. A spokesman for Express Scripts saidthat Anthem’s lawsuit had no merit, and that it had “consistently acted in good faith and in accordance with the terms” of its deal with Anthem.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Anthem Sues Express Scripts Over Cost of Prescriptions.
