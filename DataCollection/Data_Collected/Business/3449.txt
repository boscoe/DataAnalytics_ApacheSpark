Red Bull filed an opposition with the Patent and Trademark Office late last month against trademark registration applications from Old Ox Brewery in Ashburn, Va., arguing that an ox and a bull are “virtually indistinguishable to most consumers.” In response, the brewery compared Red Bull’s action to that of a “corporate wedgie.” Chris Burns, president of Old Ox Brewery, wrote on the brewery’s website on Sunday, “You are a big Red Bully.” A phone message left for a Red Bull spokeswoman seeking comment was not immediately returned.
