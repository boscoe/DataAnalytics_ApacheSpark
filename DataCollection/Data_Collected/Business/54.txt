That puts it behind other publicly traded rivals like Evercore Partners and Greenhill & Company.PJT, which focuses on advising on takeovers, corporate bankruptcies and fund-raising for investment firms, is itself the product of a merger, the combination of the nascent practice created by the veteran deal maker Paul J. Taubman and the longstanding advisory arm of the Blackstone Group.Mr. Taubman, formerly a rainmaker at Morgan Stanley, took over Blackstone’s advisory arm last year, fusing his team with that of the Wall Street giant, then took the newly combined business public. The goal was to free Blackstone’s advice business of potential conflicts with other parts of the investment titan’s operations, including private equity, real estate investing and hedge funds.PJT is entering the public markets at a high-water mark for so-called boutique and investment banks. Such companies now make up about 30 percent of the market for merger advisory fees, according to Thomson Reuters, up from 13 percent in 2000.The company trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PJT.Advertisement
