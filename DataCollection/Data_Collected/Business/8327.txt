The anxiety that rattled markets early this week when Beijing’s surprise devaluation of the renminbi upended stocks, commodities and currencies dissipated on Thursday as China’s central bank sought to calm concerns that its country’s currency would continue to slide. Major markets in Europe and Asia made gains, while the American stock market finished mixed.Officials from China’s central bank defended recent moves to loosen the government’s grip on its currency, saying that the renminbi would rebound from its recent fall. There is “no basis for persistent and substantial devaluation,” said Zhang Xiaohui, a deputy central bank governor. The renminbi was close to “market levels” after two days of sharp drops, Ms. Zhang said.Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede, a money management firm, said, “I think the central bankers have given people a reason to believe they’re not that worried. That’s why we’re seeing some recovery today.”The major American stock indexes spent much of Thursday changing course. Shares fell in the morning, climbed higher in the afternoon and then drifted lower in the final hour of trading.
