The lawyer Gloria Allred introduced the women at a news conference in Los Angeles.Ms. Allred, who represents more than 20 of Mr. Cosby’s accusers, said it was too late for the women to take legal action because the statute of limitations had expired. But, she said, “these three courageous women want Mr. Cosby to be accountable for what they believe was his misconduct towards them.”Mr. Cosby is scheduled to be questioned under oath on Oct. 9 in a case involving accusations that he sexually assaulted a different woman, Judy Huth of California, in 1974, when she was 15. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers said they had filed a motion for a protective order seeking to keep this questioning private. Ms. Huth’s legal team has filed an opposing motion seeking to make the deposition public, and a hearing on whether to allow the protective order is scheduled for Oct. 5, Ms. Allred said.The three new accusers included a former model and Mrs. America, Lisa Christie, who said she appeared on Jell-O commercials with Mr. Cosby and was an extra on “The Cosby Show.” She said she had an encounter with Mr. Cosby at a hotel in Chicago, where he had dinner ready for her and later offered her a drink.Another woman, Pamela Abeyta, said she met Mr. Cosby in Las Vegas in 1979, when she was 25. She said she believed someone put something in her drink.The third woman, Sharon Van Ert, said she had been a waitress at a jazz club in California, where she met Mr. Cosby in 1976.Mr. Cosby, 78, has repeatedly denied the accusations of drugging or sexual assault that have been brought by dozens of women. He has not been charged with a crime. A spokesman for Mr. Cosby, Andrew Wyatt, said Mr. Cosby’s team was “not making any comment” about the new accusations.Advertisement
