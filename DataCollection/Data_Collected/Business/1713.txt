As part of the discussions, Cerberus is expected to buy a minority stake in Avon and may receive seats on the board, according to these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.That would make the private equity firm one of the company’s biggest shareholders.A deal could be reached before year-end, though one of the people cautioned that negotiations over the complex proposed transaction are continuing and might still fall apart.Should the two sides strike an agreement, it would bring Avon a prominent backer at a time the famed cosmetics maker has sought to revive its business. Known for its door-to-door sales representatives, the company has struggled in an era of e-commerce.Cerberus is perhaps best known for its investments in troubled companies, as well as its willingness to dive into waters few others will. The company’s most famous holding is perhaps Remington Outdoor, the gun manufacturer that made the weapons used in the Sandy Hook and the San Bernardino shootings.The private equity firm is no stranger to retailing, having invested in stores like Safeway and Albertsons, the two supermarket chains it eventually merged and took public.Shares of Avon surged 7 percent in late trading on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported on the advanced discussions.More than three years ago, Avon turned down a nearly $11 billion takeover bid from a smaller competitor, Coty. Since then, Avon’s shares have slid some 80 percent, giving it a market value on Thursday of roughly $1.6 billion, as it faced declining volumes and shrinking market share within the beauty industry.Avon has had discussions with a number of potential investors. But it narrowed the discussions to Cerberus over the past several weeks, in part because of the complexity of the deal, according to the people with knowledge of the talks.Avon recently issued a credit agreement with “more onerous lending terms,” making an outright buyout of the entire company more difficult because potential acquirers would have a harder time borrowing at the necessary rates, according to a note by Stifel from September.Selling Avon’s North American business, which represented just 14 percent of sales last year and turned no profit, would give the company the opportunity to reinvest that cash in other areas. Rather than spend management time on turning around that business, Avon would be able to focus on its more lucrative markets like Brazil. Those businesses outside North America would continue to be run under the publicly traded Avon.Avon is not in immediate need of capital, holding about $624 million in cash as of Sept. 30, according to S&P Capital IQ. It also has nearly $2.2 billion in long-term debt.Representatives for Cerberus and Avon declined to comment or were not immediately available.Advertisement
