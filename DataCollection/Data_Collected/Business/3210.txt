THE ROAD TO S.&P.’S SETTLEMENT  |  An overflow crowd of government regulators, including attorneys general from states across the country, spent a day in January ticking off their demands before eventually negotiating a $1.37 billion settlement with the giant ratings agency Standard & Poor’s, Ben Protess reports in DealBook. The settlement, expected to be announced on Tuesday, was the culmination of a heated, two-year fight between S.&P. and the Justice Department, according to an account assembled through interviews. The Justice Department’s case and lawsuits from 19 state attorneys general generated years of animosity, the interviews show, that eased only after management changes at S.&P. and the Justice Department allowed both sides to reconsider their bargaining positions, Mr. Protess writes. S.&P., for instance, agreed to retract its claim that the Department’s lawsuit was “retaliation” for S.&P.’s decision to cut the credit rating of the United States in the summer of 2011. S.&.P. also managed to wring a number of concessions from the government, avoiding, for example, admitting that it had committed fraud.Still, S.&.P.’s payout, which is big enough to erase the rating agency’s operating profit for a year, underscores the risks of not settling in the first place. “If S.&P. had backed down two years ago, when the Justice Department was readying its case and willing to settle for what it called ‘$1 billion plus,’ the rating agency most likely could have paid a similar penalty without accruing tens of millions of dollars in legal fees,” Mr. Protess writes. A last-ditch attempt at the settlement occurred in January at the Justice Department. A compromise eventually emerged, but not without doughnuts and a dish of Hershey’s Kisses.


OBAMA’S TAX REFORM IRKS BUSINESS WORLD  |  Overhauling corporate tax legislation has been a regular refrain from corporate America’s chief executives, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook Column. And on Monday, he writes, “the business world got its wish from President Obama ‒ a proposed overhaul of corporate tax policy in the United States ‒ but not in the way it might have hoped.”
“President Obama’s budget calls for a lower overall tax rate ‒ 28 percent, down from 35 percent. But it also calls for a one-time 14 percent tax on all cash sitting overseas and a 19 percent tax on all foreign profits in the future, minus taxes paid abroad,” Mr. Sorkin adds. The one-time tax would hit hardest the businesses with huge cash piles abroad like G.E. and Apple. Big business greeted the plan, at least privately, with disgust, if not disdain.
Mr. Sorkin writes: “Here’s the rub: While chief executives often give lip service to the need for corporate tax reform ‒ and some believe in it ‒ when it comes right down to it, companies aren’t necessarily interested in a simpler tax system, just one that significantly lightens their tax burden.” The problem is that the true tax rate for cash held abroad is zero because foreign profits are not taxed in the United States unless the money is brought back. This means that any rate higher than zero hits the company’s bottom line ‒ not something big business is likely to cheer.



 PRESSURE RISES AS OIL FALLS  |  As cracks are appearing in the latest energy boom, “the forces of failure and opportunity are stirring again,” DealBook’s Michael Corkery and Peter Eavis write. Among the companies that are hurting is Resolute Energy, a Colorado company that lenders showered with hundreds of millions of dollars during the boom. Similar struggles could take place at scores of other companies, leading to layoffs and losses for banks and investors. But at the same time, Mr. Corkery and Mr. Eavis write, “new fortunes stand to be made.”
“Easy money has abruptly come to an end, mostly because oil prices have plunged, potentially making life much harder for companies like Resolute,” they add. “Many companies, which only a few months ago were the toast of the high-yield debt and initial public offering markets, suddenly cannot raise additional equity or sell bonds. A few lenders have started reining in bank lines and more are expected to tighten loan terms in the coming months.”
“​The latest boom was defined by risk-taking that involved deploying new technologies in oil fields that were once thought not productive drilling sites. As the free flow of credit dwindles, however, energy analysts expect much more caution from an industry that has been willing to bet the farm on increasingly ambitious projects,” Mr. Corkery and Mr. Eavis write. Now, signs of trouble have “brought out Wall Street’s bottom feeders.” But the energy companies, many of which will not face pressure to pay back borrowed money for many months, are not going to give up easily.

ALLY CHIEF STEPS DOWN  |  Michael A. Carpenter, the chief executive of Ally Financial, the former lending arm of General Motors, has stepped down, Michael Corkery writes in DealBook. Mr. Carpenter, a former Citigroup banker, has led Ally since 2009, not long after it was rescued by federal taxpayers as part of a wider bailout of the nation’s auto industry. He will be succeeded by Jeffrey J. Brown, who led the company’s dealer financial services unit.
Analysts and investors said the move was not entirely unexpected because Mr. Carpenter had achieved many of the goals he had set out to accomplish, including improving the lender’s profitability, taking it public and paying back the government. The Treasury Department sold off its last remaining shares in Ally in late December.
