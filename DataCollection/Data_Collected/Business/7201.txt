So far, so good for Lester Holt and NBC.Mr. Holt won in total viewers in his first week as the official anchor of NBC’s “Nightly News.” Mr. Holt brought in eight million viewers compared to 7.7. million for ABC’s “World News Tonight.” Mr. Holt also bested David Muir’s ABC broadcast in the demographics important to advertisers. “Nightly News” had 1.97 million viewers compared to ABC’s 1.93 million viewers in the 25-to-54-year-old category, and Mr. Holt drew 1.43 million viewers among 18-to-49-year-olds, compared to Mr. Muir’s 1.32 million, according to data from Nielsen.It was NBC’s biggest audience since April and its biggest lead in total viewers since March.On June 18, NBC formally announced that Mr. Holt would replace Brian Williams as the chief anchor for NBC’s evening newscast, with Mr. Williams sliding over to MSNBC. Since the announcement, NBC, for the first time in earnest, has been promoting Mr. Holt as the face of its evening news broadcast. The network held off any such promotions during the four months it took to decide what to do with Mr. Williams, who was suspended for fabricating a story about his experience during a helicopter attack in Iraq.Mr. Holt reassured NBC executives during that period, when he mostly held his own in what has been a tight ratings race with ABC.ABC’s Mr. Muir has made strides since he took over the “World News Tonight” chair last September. “World News Tonight” won the period between April and June in total viewers, with 7.85 million compared to NBC’s 7.81. It likewise narrowly defeated NBC in both the 18-to-49 and 25-to-54-year-old demographics.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
