One almost gets to think that every dog and cat in America is a victim of animal cruelty.Similarly, Ms. Walsh’s article shows the face of some of Puerto Rico’s most obscure communities, such as a remodeled schoolhouse now used as a barn. I assure you that is one of a kind. (My old school is fine and dandy, still graduating many National Honor Society students and sending them to Yale, Harvard, Columbia and M.I.T., among others.)The issue of our public debt is a tragedy. However, may I point out, Washington’s recently approved debt-relief legislation calls for no bailout for the island. Puerto Ricans are going to pay the full debt to the bondholders. All we needed were the tools to restructure the terms of payment.What does Ms. Walsh want? To embarrass Puerto Ricans? Publicize the ugliest side of our island’s face? If that was it, I suppose she accomplished it. But I assure you, the other side is quite the opposite and actually quite beautiful. Come visit. You will see.Roberto Santana-AparicioSan Juan, P.R., Aug. 7The writer is managing partner of the Del Toro & Santana law firm.To the Editor:Greece and “failed state” are poor metaphors to describe Puerto Rico’s fiscal mess.As a state, the island would have a contingent of elected officials in Congress who could vote. As an independent country, it could apply for I.M.F. loans.Puerto Rico is neither a state nor an independent country. Fiscal mismanagement in San Juan and political inequality in Washington have pushed Puerto Rico to the precipice.Gene RomanThe Bronx, Aug. 9The writer is a former Massachusetts regional director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
