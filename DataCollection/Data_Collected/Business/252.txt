Michael Horn, the president and chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, spoke in September after the company admitted to cheating emissions tests in the United States.The head of Volkswagen’s American business knew about a potential emissions problem with the company’s vehicles in spring 2014, earlier than previously acknowledged by top management in the United States.Michael Horn, the chief executive of the Volkswagen Group of America, said he was informed at the time of “a possible emissions noncompliance,” but was told that the company’s engineers would work with the Environmental Protection Agency to resolve the issue, according to testimony prepared for a congressional hearing set for Thursday. Later that year, he said, he was told that Volkswagen’s technical teams had a specific plan for bringing the vehicles into compliance.It wasn’t until September 2015 that Volkswagen disclosed at a meeting with regulators that software in certain diesel vehicles contained a so-called defeat device, which effectively lowered emissions for testing purposes. The device could recognize whether a vehicle was being operated in a test laboratory or on the road and emit different levels of pollutants accordingly.The company has not provided a fix. Volkswagen faced a German government deadline of Wednesday night to submit a plan to correct the vehicles.AdvertisementAt the hearing, Mr. Horn is expected to apologize for the company’s trickery and to describe the steps it will take to investigate the episode, including finding remedies for the affected vehicles and adopting measures to prevent this from happening again.AdvertisementMr. Horn, in his prepared testimony, said Volkswagen was “working tirelessly to develop remedies for each of the affected groups of vehicles.” He explained that there were three groups of vehicles involved, each containing one of the three generations of the two-liter diesel engine, and that each would require a different solution. Volkswagen has indicated that it will fix its 11 million faulty diesel vehicles by the end of 2016.As Volkswagen works with American officials to address the issues, Mr. Horn indicated that certain features on future models still needed regulatory approval. With that process incomplete, he said the company had withdrawn the application for certification of the 2016 model vehicles.He also said that the company was examining its internal processes to make sure this kind of deception would not happen again. “Volkswagen knows that we will be judged not by words, but by our actions over the coming weeks and months,” said Mr. Horn.A spokeswoman for Volkswagen noted that Mr. Horn in 2014 “did not know, nor was he informed, that Volkswagen vehicles included the defeat device software.” That information, said the spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan, was “only revealed to Mr. Horn and to U.S. government agencies over the past several weeks.”
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            As the company tries to restore its battered reputation, Volkswagen is trying to limit the culpability.Volkswagen’s new chief executive, Matthias Müller, said in an interview published on Wednesday in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper that only a few employees were involved in the deception. Mr. Müller added that he did not believe that his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, knew of the cheating.“Do you really think that a chief executive had time for the inner functioning of engine software?” Mr. Müller told the newspaper. He said Mr. Winterkorn was so busy that he visited Porsche’s famed research and development center in Weissach, Germany, only once every three years.AdvertisementMr. Müller did say that four people — one more than previously disclosed — had been suspended over the scandal.While Mr. Müller did not name any of the four suspended people, three names are known: Ulrich Hackenberg, Heinz-Jakob Neusser and Wolfgang Hatz. All three held top positions at Volkswagen units and have been involved in engine development.The fourth person, Mr. Müller said, is below the level of top management. Some other employees who may have been involved have already retired, he said.The notion that the issues stemmed from a small group of managers was met with skepticism outside Volkswagen and raised questions on whether the company was committed to changing a corporate culture that might have led to the scandal. And Volkswagen’s supervisory board, which oversees Mr. Müller, appointed an insider as chairman on Wednesday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And Mr. Müller, in the interview, did not explain how top executives could have been unaware that something was amiss even after officials at the E.P.A. in the United States began raising questions last year about big discrepancies between emissions of vehicles during testing and on the road.“It seems unlikely that just a few key individuals knew about this,” said Peter Wells, a professor at Cardiff Business School in Wales who follows the auto industry. “There are clearly problems of communication and flow of information.”Volkswagen has a strong incentive to fix the cars in a way that does not affect performance or fuel economy, to defuse lawsuits from owners complaining that their cars have lost value because of the scandal.Industry experts, though, said it remained unclear how Volkswagen would satisfy drivers, who want peppy performance and good fuel economy, and regulators, who want the cars to meet pollution standards. As Mr. Müller acknowledged in the interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine, the cheating began after people inside Volkswagen realized that a new engine line could not comply with United States pollution limits.The decision to use illegal software took place while Volkswagen was making a transition to a new diesel technology known as common rail, Mr. Müller said. He did not say when that was, but Volkswagen began selling cars with that technology around 2008.Advertisement“The transition to modern common rail motor technology took place at the same time as the decision to return to America with diesel,” Mr. Müller said. “Apparently they were not successful in achieving the strict American emissions regulations.”In 2013, a nonprofit group, in conjunction with California regulators, started testing the on-road diesel emissions from cars, including Volkswagen models. They soon found that the on-the-road performance deviated starkly from the laboratory findings, publishing a study the next year. It was around that time that Mr. Horn, the American Volkswagen executive, was informed of the possible problems.As regulatory scrutiny intensified around the issue, Volkswagen fought back, trying to poke holes in the study. Nonetheless, the company in December 2014 initiated a voluntary recall to fix the issue in certain diesel models, according to the E.P.A. But it did not address the problem.For the last few weeks, Volkswagen has been dealing with fallout of the deception, affecting millions of cars and light commercial vehicles, primarily in Europe. About 480,000 are in the United States.The crisis has claimed the company’s former chief executive, Mr. Winterkorn. Mr. Müller was chief executive of Porsche, a Volkswagen subsidiary, before being named to succeed Mr. Winterkorn late last month.On Wednesday, Volkswagen appointed Hans-Dieter Pötsch, the company’s chief financial officer, as supervisory board chairman. Mr. Pötsch, 64, is an Austrian seen as close to the Porsche family, which owns a majority stake in Volkswagen.The company also named Wolfgang Porsche, who represents the Porsche family, to lead a committee that is investigating the emissions cheating. He will work with the Jones Day law firm, which was brought in by the company to assist in the internal inquiry.Mr. Pötsch, though, warned that it would take time before the company would be ready to make findings public.“Volkswagen faces great challenges,” Mr. Pötsch said in a statement on Wednesday. “We must overcome the current crisis, but we must also ensure that Volkswagen continues to grow, in an industry that is changing and developing at a previously unseen pace.”Melissa Eddy and Aaron M.
