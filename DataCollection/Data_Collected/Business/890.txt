PARIS — Airbus said on Friday that it planned to significantly accelerate production of its best-selling A320 series of jets before the end of the decade, betting that the current boom in aircraft orders will continue amid robust global demand for air travel.Airbus and Boeing, which split the market for large commercial jets, have been riding a sustained wave of orders from fast-growing airlines, particularly in emerging markets, for close to a decade. There has also been significant pent-up demand from American carriers, several of which have recently emerged from bankruptcy and are eager to replace their aging fleets with more fuel-efficient models.Airbus, which on Friday also reported a 42 percent jump in third-quarter net profit, said it would aim to produce 60 of the single-aisle A320 planes a month by the middle of 2019, a record pace for the industry. Airbus currently produces the 150- to 180-seat planes — which include variants of the A319, A320 and A321 models — at a rate of 42 planes a month, and it had most recently set an output target of 50 planes a month by the end of 2017.“The healthy commercial aircraft market, robustness of our backlog and supply-chain capability allows us to raise the single-aisle production rate,” Thomas Enders, the Airbus Group chief executive, said in a statement.AdvertisementThe sheer volume of orders has created significant backlogs, equivalent to several years of production, at both Airbus and Boeing — leaving their airline customers waiting for planes and delaying their expansion plans.AdvertisementAirbus’s target surpasses Boeing’s plans for production of its competing 737 single-aisle model, which it also currently produces at a rate of 42 a month. Boeing, which is based in Chicago, has said it expects to speed output to 52 planes a month by 2018.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

There is also concern that parts suppliers, particularly engine manufacturers, may have difficulty keeping pace.“The question will be whether this is wise, or will happen at all,” Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Agency Partners, a London brokerage, wrote in a note to clients.The planned production increase comes as Airbus said its net profit climbed to 376 million euros, or $411 million, in the three months to Sept. 30 from €264 million a year earlier, on sales of just over €14 billion, a 6 percent increase from 2014.Airbus also said it would buy back €1 billion worth of shares by mid-2016.Airbus builds the bulk of its A320s at factories in China, France and Germany. In September, it formally opened a new assembly line in Mobile, Ala., to serve the North American market, which has enough capacity to produce as many as eight planes a month.However, the company has said that it would add capacity at its largest A320 plant, in Hamburg, Germany, to accommodate the latest production increases.A version of this article appears in print on October 31, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Airbus to Ramp Up Jet Production by 2019.
