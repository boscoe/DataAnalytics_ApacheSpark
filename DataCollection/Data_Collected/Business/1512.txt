Home purchases have advanced 3.9 percent from a year ago, even as buyers have fewer choices because the number of listings on the market has dropped 4.5 percent.But last month suggested the start of a reaction to the strong gains in home-buying. The additional sales have spawned sharp price increases that have outpaced wage growth and left some would-be buyers out of the market.The October sales decrease indicates “the market is treading water,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.Yet other economists said they expected sales growth to return because of the underlying health of the broader economy.“Despite the setback, home sales should resume higher in the face of rising rents, good job growth, improved consumer confidence and still-low mortgage rates,” said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.The median home sale price was $219,600 in October, a 5.8 percent annual increase. Sales fell sharply in the West and South, where prices have risen at the fastest rates this year. Purchases declined 8.7 percent in the West and 3.2 percent in the South, while dipping 0.8 percent in the Midwest and staying unchanged in the Northeast on a seasonally adjusted basis.The 5 percent unemployment rate has helped coax traditional buyers into the market, supplanting the investors who bought foreclosed properties for cash in the aftermath of the recession.Homeowners seeking to upgrade or downsize appear to have accounted for much of this year’s sales gains, as first-time buyers accounted for 31 percent of sales in October. First-time buyers have historically made up 40 percent of all sales.Tight inventories are curbing enthusiasm among some home buyers. Just 4.8 months’ supply of homes is available, well below a balanced market with a six months’ supply.The limited supplies and greater demand propelled higher home values. Home prices have appreciated at more than double the gains in average hourly earnings, requiring buyers to set aside more savings for a down payment or bid more fiercely for the most desirable properties.Low mortgage rates have offset some of the pain from those price gains. But rates have started to rise in anticipation of the Federal Reserve meeting next month, where Fed officials are expected to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.The average, 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen to just under 4 percent from 3.79 percent a month ago, according to the mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.Advertisement
