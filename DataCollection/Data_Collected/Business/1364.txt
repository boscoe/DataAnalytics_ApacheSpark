The European car market expanded 2.9 percent in October, topping 1.1 million units, but growth slowed in all major markets, according to figures released on Tuesday by the European carmakers’ association ACEA. The expansion was the 26th straight month of growth, even if sluggish, with two of the biggest markets, France and Germany, growing by just 1 percent, and Britain contracting by as much. Carlos Da Silva, an IHS automotive analyst, said the slowing growth reflected weaker pent-up demand after six years of crisis. He forecasts registrations will grow 8 percent this year to nearly 13.6 million units, saying the market should “remain on its positive path.” Volkswagen remained the top seller, commanding a quarter of the market, in the first full month of figures since it acknowledged cheating on diesel emissions tests in the United States. Volkswagen-brand sales slipped 0.2 percent, while all of Volkswagen group sales — including the brands SEAT, Skoda, Porsche, Audi and Lamborghini — dropped 0.5 percent. Mr. Da Silva said it was too early to say if VW’s sales had been hit by the emissions scandal. By comparison, competitor PSA Peugeot Citroën saw sales fall 0.9 percent, while Renault sank 0.7 percent.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
