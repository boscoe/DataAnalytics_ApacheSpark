At the National Science Foundation $100 million generates more than 10. At the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering — which finances research in radiology — it produces almost 25 patents. And these patents sparked $578.2 million worth of additional R&D further downstream.“N.I.H. research has helped lower the burden of disease, and people in both parties recognize its importance,” said Jonathan Lewin, chairman of the department of radiology at Johns Hopkins University and head of the academy of radiology. “We decided to look at the economic value of our research to make the argument about this value, too.”Radiologists hope this sort of analysis could help prioritize public funding in a tight budget era: National Institutes of Health budgets are almost 20 percent smaller than they were 10 years ago.But beyond the narrow objective of allocating a shrinking budget, the analysis offered by the radiologists raises another possibility to consider. Taxpayer-financed research can generate large rewards down the road. Perhaps the taxpayer could reap a share? In an era of tight budgets, this could finance the research to power American innovation.The argument has been made most forcefully by Mariana Mazzucato, a professor of economics at the University of Sussex in Britain who specializes in science and technology policy.She argues that the distribution of risks and rewards in the American economy looks nothing like the myth spun by free-marketeers, which posits a nation populated by entrepreneurial risk-takers overcoming the obstacles thrown up by an overbearing, bureaucratic state to produce the innovations that spark economic growth.Her book “The Entrepreneurial State,” published in Britain in 2013, will arrive in the United States this fall. In it, Professor Mazzucato notes that government often takes the biggest risks, financing early scientific breakthroughs and providing early support to companies and organizations that will eventually become champions of innovation.Science is, of course, a public good. It produces better health, first rate universities and a robust economy supporting more jobs and tax revenues. The government’s investment in basic research can be justified by these social benefits. Private companies are unlikely to invest in such risky projects, which at best offer a long shot at financial rewards many years down the road.But with tax rates falling and high technology companies becoming ever more adept at avoiding taxes, a plausible argument can be made that American taxpayers are being shortchanged.“We must change the distribution of rewards to innovation,” Professor Mazzucato told me. “We socialize the risks but privatize the rewards.” This not only contributes to our persistently widening inequality, it undercuts support for scientific discovery.Had the government received an equity share in Tesla in exchange for taxpayers’ financial support, for example, it might have paid for the government’s failed investment in Solyndra.Had it gotten even a minute stake in Google — whose search algorithm was financed by the National Science Foundation — or in GPS, rocket development, touch-screen technology or the many drugs that flowed from its investment in basic science, the government might have a stable, richer pot to finance the next generation of scientific discovery.“SpaceX is free-riding on NASA technology,” Ms. Mazzucato said.It is easy to get this wrong, though. Experts in the economics of innovation warn that sticking the government’s arm into the future in search of profits flowing from its original research might actually slow innovation.A telling illustration of this risk comes from the competition to decode the human genetic blueprint between the public Human Genome Project — which put every gene it sequenced straight into the public domain — and the private company Celera Genomics, which patented the genes it sequenced first for up to two years.Heidi Williams, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that there was substantially less subsequent research and product development based on the genes sequenced by Celera than on genes immediately put up for free public use. Had governments also patented their discoveries, gene science could have been slowed substantially.David Mowery, a professor at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley, raises another question: How can we disentangle the government’s early contribution to a technological product down the pipeline?If the government became more like a venture capitalist — with a stake in the profits of future technologies — might it not become, under political pressure to avoid further Solyndras, as risk-averse as any other private investor, unwilling to bet on the moonshots that might never yield a cent but might also revolutionize our societies or our understanding of the universe?And while the Internet and GPS yielded huge rewards, Professor Mowery points out that the experience of American universities commercializing the fruits of their research suggests there may not be that much money there.“The likely returns are very small relative to the scale of the need for research funding,” he told me. “There are great anecdotes but it may not be sufficiently remunerative to justify the creation of what may be a ponderous auditing apparatus.”And yet Professor Mazzucato’s proposal is worth pondering.Demand for scientific breakthroughs, particularly in matters of great public concern like climate science and health care, is as urgent as it has ever been. And funding alternatives are scarce.Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at M.I.T.’s Sloan School of Management, has suggested dedicated funds to draw institutional investors into supporting biomedical research.Philanthropy is another option. Philanthropy contributes some $2 billion a year to basic research — less than a tenth of the research budget of the National Institutes of Health. But in five to 10 years, Marc Kastner, president of the Science Philanthropy Alliance said, the alliance might “make an impact of about that size.”Perhaps tweaking the rules on executive compensation — extending the vesting period of options, say, if they are to be considered tax-preferred performance-related pay — might encourage companies to take a longer-term view on their investments, encouraging riskier research.Still, the argument that the government has a stake in innovation could be exploited further. At a minimum, why not embed rules into federally funded discoveries to ensure that companies that profit from these ideas reinvest some share of their profits into additional research, rather than use it for stock buybacks?Taxpayers have a large, unacknowledged role in the nation’s innovation. They deserve some credit. And perhaps more, if that’s what it would take to power innovation’s future.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement
