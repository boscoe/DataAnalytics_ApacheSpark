In the latest case, Mazda announced that it was recalling 4.9 million vehicles worldwide, including 1.4 million in the United States, because too much grease in the ignition switch could cause a short circuit and possibly a fire.The automaker knew about the problem seven years ago, according to a filing submitted this week to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It took action only after Japanese regulators opened an investigation this year.Mazda is aware of 36 cases worldwide in which the ignition short-circuited, including 13 in which there were fires, a Mazda spokeswoman, Tamara Mlynarczyk, wrote in an email. No one was reported injured, she added, and none of the reported fires were in the United States.The affected vehicles date back more than 20 years, with some as old as the 1989 model year.In its report to American regulators, Mazda said that it had received its first report of a smoking ignition switch in Japan in 2001 but that it could not obtain the switch to check it and decided to “continue monitoring the field.”The next year, Mazda said, it learned of a fire in an ignition switch, also in Japan. But the automaker decided to continue monitoring the issue, it said, because of what it considered odd circumstances: The ignition key was stuck in the start position after the engine was running.The report did not say how many other fires occurred in Japan, but by March 2008 Mazda had concluded that too much grease was causing short circuits that could result in fires. It did not recall the vehicles.Then, in April, the Japanese government opened an investigation, and Mazda acknowledged that “there is a potential that this situation can result in the switch overheating and possibly resulting in a fire.” It agreed to a recall.The recalled vehicles include the 1990-95 Mazda 323, the 1993-98 Mazda 626, the 1993-95 Mazda 929, the 1989-98 Mazda M.P.V., the 1993-97 MX-6, the 1992-93 MX-3 and the 1990-98 Protégé.There was also a multiyear delay in the second case: Mazda’s recall in July of 193,000 2007-14 CX-9 family vans because rust on a suspension part could cause a loss of steering control.In July 2012, Mazda knew that a ball joint in the front suspension could rust and fail, causing the steering loss, according to its filing with regulators. In January 2014, Mazda began using a new part in assembly plants. But, according to a chronology filed with American regulators, Mazda said a recall was not needed because the driver would be alerted to a problem by a grinding sound.Then, in June, American regulators opened an investigation after some owners complained of steering loss. The next month, Mazda agreed to the recall, saying it “recognized that the failure might occur without customers’ noticing unusual noise.”Under federal regulations, after learning of a safety problem, automakers are required to inform regulators of plans for a recall within five business days or face civil penalties.Such sanctions were for years rarely used by the highway safety agency, which has often been criticized by consumer groups and members of Congress for not being tough enough on automakers. After Mark R. Rosekind took over as head of the agency in December, he promised it would be more aggressive.Automakers have been given a series of fines this year, including last month’s settlement with Fiat Chrysler of up to $105 million over its handling of recalls.“Administrator Rosekind seems to be a lot tougher enforcer,” said Allan Kam, a safety consultant from Bethesda, Md., who worked for the highway safety agency from 1975 to 2000, leaving as the senior enforcement lawyer. And that toughness has made automakers more responsive.“It is the new normal,” he said.Advertisement
