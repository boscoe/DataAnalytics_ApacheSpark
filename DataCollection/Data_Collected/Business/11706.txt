The company is among the many big producers of commodities that has been hit by lower demand from the slowing global economy. But ArcelorMittal is taking pains to lay blame on China.ArcelorMittal said its loss — including a $6.7 billion retreat in the fourth quarter last year — was mainly down to falling steel prices that were depressed by a surge of Chinese exports, and to write-offs in the company’s large mining business. In the fourth quarter of 2014, ArcelorMittal lost $955 million.China’s economic slowdown is upsetting the calculus of just about all commodity producers, including steel makers, but with a twist.Rather than importing steel, China has ramped up its own capacity, which now accounts for about half of all global production of raw steel. With the Chinese economy slowing and domestic producers reluctant to cut production, the remedy so far has been to unleash exports that undercut rivals around the world.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Lakshmi N. Mittal, the company’s chairman and chief executive, called the results “rather sobering” and “disappointing.”In an indication of continuing difficult conditions, Mr. Mittal also forecast that his company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a widely cited financial metric, would be “in excess” of $4.5 billion in 2016, compared with $5.2 billion in 2015.With a steady decline in the company’s share price lately, ArcelorMittal’s stock market value is now about 6.3 billion, or $6.8 billion — less than one-quarter of the nearly €27 billion that Mittal Steel agreed to pay for Arcelor after a bruising takeover battle in 2006.During a call with reporters on Friday, Aditya Mittal, the company’s chief financial officer, said that the Chinese makers had been “exporting at aggressive levels in 2015; this has caused prices to drop in all of our key markets.”Prices of one important type of steel exported by the Chinese, hot-rolled coil, which is used in automobiles and other manufacturing, fell by about 40 percent in 2015.Aditya Mittal, who is Lakshmi Mittal’s son, said the industry was pursuing trade actions against Chinese exports in both the United States and in Europe, although he said that Europe was less effective in protecting its producers from dumping.“Clearly the trade defense instruments that have been developed in the U.S. are better,’’ he said, “They insure a fairer, level playing field.”In addition, Aditya Mittal painted a picture of relatively weak demand for steel this year, with only the market in the United States showing growth. He said that growth in European demand would be weaker this year than last, and that Brazil, a major market for ArcelorMittal, and China would continue to show declines. He added, however, that there were still pockets of strength for the company’s products, including in the automobile industry.The combination of reduced prices and a weakening world economy played havoc with ArcelorMittal’s annual and quarterly results on Friday. The company said it lost $7.9 billion in 2015, compared with a $1.1 billion loss in 2014. Revenue fell about 20 percent last year to about $64 billion.ArcelorMittal, which is based in Luxembourg, has a global reach, but that did not help much toward the end of last year. The company said it had suffered fourth-quarter operating losses in its steel-making units in each of its major markets, including Europe, North America and Brazil.The company is also being hurt by previous investments it has made in mining. Those ventures are turning sour because of declining prices for iron ore and coal, both tied to falling demand in China. ArcelorMittal’s mining unit reported a $3.5 billion operating loss for 2015, compared with a $565 million profit a year earlier. The company also wrote off $3.4 billion on mines, primarily in Liberia and the United States, as lower prices resulted in a revision of its commercial forecasts.Aditya Mittal did predict that late 2015 would prove to have been the most difficult period for the industry in terms of the pressure from Chinese exports, noting that steel prices in China had risen recently.He added, however, that ArcelorMittal thought it prudent to raise new capital to offset debt.The company will seek to raise the capital with a rights issue to shareholders. The Mittal family, the largest shareholders, will contribute $1.1 billion; Aditya Mittal said that the family’s participation showed its confidence in ArcelorMittal’s prospects. The company says it has underwriting commitments from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.ArcelorMittal also said it would sell its 35 percent stake in Gestamp Automoción, a Spanish maker of car components, for 875 million euros, or about $975 million.The sale and the rights issue were expected to reduce ArcelorMittal’s debt to less than $12 billion.ArcelorMittal published its earnings a week ahead of schedule to coincide with the announcement of the plan to raise additional capital.Advertisement
