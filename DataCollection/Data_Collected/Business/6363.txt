Broadcom’s market value as of Tuesday’s market close, before the rumors of a deal publicly surfaced, was about $28.1 billion.If completed, the deal would be the latest in the chip-making industry, which has been swept by a wave of consolidation as companies look to gain scale and negotiating leverage with customers. In March, NXP Semiconductors agreed to buy a peer, Freescale Semiconductor, for $11.8 billion.And earlier this year, Intel, the heavyweight of the computer chip industry, was said to have held talks to buy Altera, whose chips are used in radios, cars and at factories.In late 2013, Avago itself struck a $6.6 billion deal to acquire the LSI Corporation, a manufacturer of networking and storage chips. The takeover was a bet on the rising use of cloud and mobile software and allowed Avago to move into a sector with relatively healthy profit margins.Broadcom was founded in 1991 by a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his student. It initially specialized in digital computer networking semiconductors, and expanded into many other types of communications chips, used in smartphones, high-end televisions and Wall Street supercomputers.Under its current chief executive, Scott A. McGregor, who has degrees in psychology and computer science, the company has produced thousands of different kinds of chips, mostly so-called off-the-shelf items that electronics designers can purchase cheaply and use in new devices. While the explosion of connected devices has made this a good business, most of the chips have relatively low profit margins.Mr. McGregor has said that he is fine with that, hoping to sell some chips in very large volumes.Avago, which specializes in chips for things like fiber-optic lines and lighting, has relatively little overlap with Broadcom’s products, but could combine the two companies’ wares to offer comprehensive products to big communications companies, while negotiating cheaper manufacturing costs from the third-party factories where both companies’ chips are made.Avago was originally a part of Agilent, the former semiconductor arm of Hewlett-Packard, and was spun out by its then-owners, the private equity firms Silver Lake and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2009.The company has been a fairly active acquirer, having bought five companies since 2013, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ. Its most recent takeover was that of Emulex, a networking equipment and services company, this year.Among Avago’s advantages as a corporate buyer are its relatively lower tax rate, thanks in large part to its headquarters being in Singapore. The chip maker said in its most recent annual report that its actual tax rate on income before income taxes in its 2014 fiscal year was about 9.6 percent.Shares of Broadcom closed up 21.5 percent on Wednesday, while those in Avago were up 7.7 percent, after The Wall Street Journal reported news of the talks.Advertisement
