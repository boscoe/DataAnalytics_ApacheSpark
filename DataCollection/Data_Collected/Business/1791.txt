The Federal Reserve said on Monday that consumer borrowing rose $16 billion in October to $3.5 trillion. But the pace decelerated sharply from the $28.5 billion rise in September. Nearly all of the October gain came from the category that covers auto and student loans, while credit card borrowing edged up a mere $200 million. The increase suggests that more Americans are borrowing to improve skills and upgrade vehicles, instead of relying on debt to fund daily shopping and emergency expenses. Many economists expect that consumer spending will be relatively healthy in the coming months because of strong job gains that have bolstered auto and home sales for much of 2015. Advertisement
