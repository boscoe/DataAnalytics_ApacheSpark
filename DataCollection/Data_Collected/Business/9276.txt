Since 2010, Vocus has acquired a range of date centers and so-called dark center fiber providers.M2 provides a range of communication, utility and insurance services.About 80 percent of the combined two companies’ revenue will be generated in Australia, with the remainder in New Zealand, through the sale of voice, broadband, fiber and Ethernet, data centers, Internet, mobile and energy services.Vocus and M2 said their merger would generate cost savings of 40 million Australian dollars a year through network optimization and consolidation that will be fully realized in the 12 months to June 30, 2018.Vocus was advised by Credit Suisse and the law firm Minter Ellison. M2 was advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Allens.Advertisement
