SFX Entertainment brought dance music to Wall Street, but lately the party — at least when it comes to the company’s stock price — has been a bit of a downer.SFX was founded three years ago by the media executive Robert F. X. Sillerman to capitalize on the growth of electronic dance music, a once-marginal genre that now draws millions of fans to outdoor festivals around the world. SFX, which raised $260 million through an initial public offering in October 2013, has added dozens of festivals to its portfolio, including Electric Zoo, Mysteryland and Tomorrowland, as well as Beatport, an online store and music hub.But the company has had regular losses. On Monday, it reported that revenue for its second quarter had increased 48 percent from the period last year to $121 million, but its losses grew to $48 million from $35 million a year earlier. And several moves SFX has made this year have rattled some in the music industry and worried analysts.Mr. Sillerman, the company’s chairman and chief executive, faces a deadline on Thursday to submit financing details for his offer to take the company private. Some analysts are openly speculating whether he will lower his bid to reflect the company’s slipping stock price, which is down more than 50 percent this year and on Wednesday closed at $2.09, down 10.7 percent.AdvertisementIn February, when SFX shares were trading around $3.50, Mr. Sillerman offered to buy all the stock he did not already own for $4.75 a share. That was substantially lower than the $13 a share the company charged in its I.P.O. In May, after complaints from investors, Mr. Sillerman — who controls slightly more than 38 percent of the company, according to recent filings — raised his offer to $5.25 a share, which would value SFX at $774 million, including debt.AdvertisementBut his offer has been met with doubts on Wall Street. A “go-shop” period failed to solicit any alternative bids, and analysts have criticized Mr. Sillerman and his management team for losses when the concert industry is doing robust business. In May, the company adjusted its outlook for the rest of the year after what it said were disappointing ticket sales for Rock in Rio USA, the first Las Vegas edition of the long-running Brazilian event.“We continue to like the industry,” said Richard Tullo, an analyst at Albert Fried & Company. “But these guys aren’t doing anything right. They’re not managing the business correctly.”
                Consolidation in the concert business has resulted in many of the biggest outdoor festivals coming under the control of just a handful of companies. Here is a sampling of some of those events and the promoters that own them, either in full or in partnerships.            On Monday, Live Nation Entertainment, SFX’s much larger rival, reported $142 million in “adjusted operating income,” its preferred measurement of profitability, and nearly $1.8 billion in revenue in the second quarter.A spokesman for SFX declined to comment.Other financial maneuvers by SFX have raised eyebrows. In June, the company sold $10 million in stock to two investors at $4.34 a share, with Mr. Sillerman agreeing to buy the shares back at $5.25, a move analysts and commentators interpreted as demonstrating SFX’s urgent need for cash. (Mr. Sillerman also bought $5 million in stock.) But six weeks later, one of those investors, Virtual Point Holdings, sold the stock back to Mr. Sillerman at $4.34, forgoing its right to the higher price.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Last week, Beatport informed independent record labels that their royalty payments had been “trapped” during the process of going private and would be late. “There wasn’t even a hint of apology,” said Morgan Geist, an electronic musician who owns his own label, Environ, and publicized Beatport’s letter on Facebook.After an uproar in the independent world, Beatport reversed course and said it would pay the royalties on time.“The way we handled this was inexcusable and should never have happened,” Mr. Sillerman said in a statement circulated to record labels late last week. “I am deeply embarrassed, both personally and professionally, by what has happened.”Mr. Sillerman, 67, has had a long and profitable history in entertainment and media, building radio and concert networks and for a time owning the company behind “American Idol.” But his past efforts to take companies private have been criticized, and even in the high-flying world of dance music Mr. Sillerman has cut an unusual profile. Last year, for example, images of him making obscene gestures circulated on social media; he later said his behavior was intended as a private joke within SFX.The financial performance of SFX, and its silence on how Mr. Sillerman will finance his takeover bid, have left some analysts to wonder whether his $5.25 offer will be revised, or completed at all. After SFX’s earnings report this week, Stifel, a financial services firm that tracks SFX, said in a research report, “We view it as likely that on a best-case scenario Mr. Sillerman approaches the company with a lower bid.”AdvertisementSFX did not hold a conference call to discuss its results this week, and in a statement said only that “unless an alternative transaction is reviewed and approved” by a committee of independent directors, the company expected Mr. Sillerman’s takeover to close by the end of the year.A version of this article appears in print on August 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Money Ills Raise Doubts on Plan to Take SFX Entertainment Private .
