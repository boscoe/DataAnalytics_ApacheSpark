Monsanto reported lower-than-expected earnings as slumping corn prices pushed farmers toward other crops, limiting sales of the company’s best-selling biotech corn seeds. The agricultural business giant reported a second-quarter profit of $1.42 billion, or $2.92 a share, down from $1.67 billion, or $3.15 a share, in the previous year period. Sales slid to $5.2 billion from $5.8 billion. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted earnings of $2.96 a share on sales of $5.76 billion. In a conference call, company executives said soybean demand was growing by more than 200 million bushels a year and Monsanto was poised to take advantage with expanding varieties. It expects to penetrate 30 million acres in South America in 2016. The positive outlook for soybean growth in South America and the United States helped push the company’s stock higher, despite the profit miss. Shares of Monsanto, which have declined about 6 percent since the beginning of the year, rose 3.9 percent, to $116.96. Sales of the company’s signature herbicide, Roundup, and other agricultural chemicals fell slightly to $1 billion in the period.A version of this brief appears in print on April 2, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Falling Corn Prices Bring Down Quarterly Profit at Monsanto.
