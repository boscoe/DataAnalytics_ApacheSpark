The children were removed uninjured. Ikea urged consumers to check for a possible gap between the mattress and the frame. The company said five Vyssa crib models sold in the United States between August 2010 and May 2014 were recalled, including those branded Vackert, Vinka, Spelevink, Sloa and Slummer. The government urged anyone with these models to stop using the mattress if there was a gap larger than two fingersâ€™ width next to the frame. Advertisement
