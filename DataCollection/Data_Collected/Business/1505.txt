The 25 members of the bank’s Governing Council have long held differing views, but the blunt public opposition is unusual because Ms. Lautenschläger sits on the six-person executive board, which tends to present a united front. But she dissented, saying that ever looser monetary policy had its limits and that money printing had yet to stabilize sinking price inflation, its formal goal. “I don’t see any reason for further monetary policy measures, especially not for an extension” of the asset purchase program, she said, 10 days before a meeting at which policy makers will set the bank’s course. “It buys time but does not heal the structural causes of a slack economic recovery,” she said. “We should give the numerous and massive monetary policy efforts time to take full effect.” Advertisement
