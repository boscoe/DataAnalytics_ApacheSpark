WASHINGTON — Industrial output in the United States advanced in July at its strongest pace in eight months as auto production surged, another bullish sign for third-quarter economic growth.While other data on Friday showed a dip in consumer sentiment early this month, households were upbeat about their personal finances, a good omen for consumer spending. July employment and retail sales data also struck an optimistic note on the economy."It adds to the steady drumbeat of solid indicators that suggest the economy is getting off to a much better start in the second half of the year," said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.Industrial production rose 0.6 percent last month after a downwardly revised increase of 0.1 percent in June, the Fed said.AdvertisementThe gain in output reflected a 0.8 percent increase in factory production that was spurred by a 10.6 percent surge in motor vehicle output, the largest increase since September 2009.

Auto manufacturers typically shut down production lines in summer for retooling, but economists speculated that they probably had done so for only a short period, leading to the jump in vehicle production. Apart from autos, manufacturing rose 0.1 percent last month.AdvertisementMining production edged up 0.2 percent as oil and gas well drilling output grew for the first time in 10 months, suggesting that the energy industry was starting to stabilize after being undermined by last year's plunge in crude oil prices.Despite the surge in July, industrial production remains constrained by a strong dollar and lower oil prices."We continue to see a stronger dollar and lower energy prices as posing headwinds for industrial output and do not look for a strong rebound in the sector this year," said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index slipped to 92.9 in early August from a reading of 93.1 in July. Still, it was the highest nine-month average since 2004 and consistent with a 3 percent annualized rate of increase in consumer spending.
