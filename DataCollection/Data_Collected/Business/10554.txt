Here’s a look at what’s coming up the week.MONETARY POLICYChristine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, faces a criminal trial starting on Monday in Paris on charges of negligence that date to her time as France’s finance minister, from 2007 to 2011. Her lawyer plans to ask the special, rarely used court that will try her to postpone the hearing, which threatens to overshadow her role at the fund. If the court declines, the trial will run until Dec. 20, and a verdict could be announced at the close. Ms. Lagarde is accused of allowing a French tycoon to receive an outsize settlement in a 2007 arbitration case over a dispute with a state-owned bank. Liz Alderman__________GUN INDUSTRYShareholders of Smith & Wesson Holding Company, one of the United States’ most iconic firearms producers, are expected to vote Tuesday on whether to change the company’s name to American Outdoor Brands Corporation. Executives of the Springfield, Mass.-based company, whose roots can be traced to the mid-1850s, are seeking the change to emphasize “shooting, hunting and rugged outdoor” products. “We believe the name American Outdoor Brands Corporation will better reflect our family of brands,” its chief executive, James Debney, has said. Smith & Wesson’s best-known firearms include a .38-caliber gun once widely used by police officers and the .357 Magnum. Barry Meier__________AGRICULTUREMonsanto shareholders have been invited to converge in St. Louis on Tuesday to vote on Bayer AG’s $56 billion acquisition of Monsanto. The deal is the second-largest signed this year, after AT&T’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. It has received ample criticism in Washington as the agriculture industry continues to consolidate, putting pressure on farmers who are already struggling to sell an abundance of crops. Bayer needs a majority of Monsanto’s shareholders to vote in favor of the deal, as well as regulatory approvals, for the transaction to close. Leslie Picker__________ECONOMYThe Federal Reserve has all but announced it will raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the first time since last December. The more interesting question is what comes next. The Fed on Wednesday will also publish a 2017 forecast, including its predictions for economic growth and the path of monetary policy.AdvertisementThe Fed entered 2016 predicting that it would raise rates four times, which would have amounted to a significant retreat from its stimulus campaign. Instead, the central bank has held steady because growth remained slow and there was little sign of inflation. But the unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in November, about as low as most Fed officials would like to see.AdvertisementPresident-elect Donald J. Trump and congressional leaders, in the meantime, are talking about a round of tax cuts that could increase economic growth. That could mean the Fed starts moving a little more quickly in 2017.

Retail sales are expected to have risen 0.3 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rachel Abrams__________TECH INDUSTRYMr. Trump will meet with a dozen or so members of Silicon Valley’s elite on Wednesday afternoon in New York. During the campaign, Mr. Trump was critical of high-tech. He’ll want to come out of this with a few Twitter-ready announcements, but it’s up in the air whether the executives will play along. David Streitfeld__________ECONOMYThe Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates steady when it announces its latest monetary policy decision on Thursday. In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain’s economy over fears that Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union could hamper growth. The rate had remained steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009. The British economy, however, has performed better than expected since the “Brexit” referendum, causing the central bank to change its view on the need for another rate cut in the near future. Chad Bray__________TELECOMMUNICATIONS European officials are expected to approve new rules on Thursday giving Europeans the right to use their cellphones and other mobile devices across the 28-member bloc without incurring hefty roaming charges. The plans, which come into effect in June, have been praised by consumer advocates, who say people should be able to surf the internet freely beyond their national borders. But cellphone operators say the changes may force them to increase consumers’ monthly bills to offset the potential loss of revenue when people travel outside their home markets.
