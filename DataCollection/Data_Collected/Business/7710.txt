Winters, the new chief executive of Standard Chartered, is moving quickly to put his stamp on the British bank.Mr. Winters, the former head of JPMorgan Chase’s investment bank, unveiled his new management team on Monday and announced changes to simplify the company’s reporting structure as it looks to cut its costs and improve its profitability. The bank has targeted $1.8 billion in annual cost savings by 2017.“The group needs to kick-start performance, reduce its cost base and bureaucracy, improve accountability and speed up decision making,” Mr. Winters said in a news release.Standard Chartered said it would streamline its business lines from four to three: corporate and investment banking, commercial and private banking, and retail banking. The management team will report directly to Mr. Winters.“The new structure will help achieve all of these critical objectives and will be in place as we communicate a comprehensive plan to address the group’s performance by the year end,” Mr. Winters said.The moves announced on Monday were the latest in an overhaul of Standard Chartered’s top management and directors this year in an effort to turn around its business.Mr. Winters replaced Peter Sands as the chief executive in June, and John W. Peace, the Standard Chartered chairman, is expected to leave next year. Three longstanding directors will also step down this year as the bank shrinks its board to 14 members.Standard Chartered, which generates most of its earnings in Asia, has been hit hard in recent quarters by impairments for bad loans and by what it has called “challenging” trading conditions in some business lines, including currency hedging products.As part of the reorganization, the bank will also structure its business around four geographic areas: greater China and North Asia, southern Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and Europe and the Americas.Advertisement
