Cash pay for in-house lawyers dipped over all last year, but not for the very top.Walt Disney’s general counsel, Alan Braverman, leads the pack for the second year in a row. He received $7.03 million in cash compensation last year, according to an annual survey of the 100 highest paid in-house lawyers by the publication Corporate Counsel.The second-highest paid in terms of cash was Thomas Mason, the general counsel of the Dallas-based pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity, who received $6.8 million.Close behind were the general counsels at three media giants. Gerson A. Zweifach at 21st Century Fox received $6.325 million, Lawrence Tu at CBS was paid $3.9 million, and Michael Fricklas at Viacom took home $3.287 million. Their compensation includes salary, bonuses and nonequity compensation, according to the General Counsel Compensation survey.On average, cash compensation slid 2 percent in 2015 compared with the previous year, following a recent pattern of stagnating executive pay levels. Some of the high-level lawyers included in the survey had significant stock awards in 2015 that were counted separately. But the overall average stock award sank by more than 19 percent. Bruce Sewell of Apple stood out with a $20 million stock award, the largest the survey recorded.AdvertisementThe survey is based on 2015 company proxy filings. Mr. Braverman’s pay, the survey found, rose 5 percent from the $6.69 million he took home in 2014. His base salary was $1.5 million, compared with the average $700,000 salary for general counsels at big companies.
