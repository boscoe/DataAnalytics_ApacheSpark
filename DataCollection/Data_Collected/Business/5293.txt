A few consumers have filed a lawsuit against Lumber Liquidators, accusing the company of hiring unaccredited laboratories to prove to customers that its flooring is safe and not contaminated with formaldehyde.The lawsuit, filed Thursday in California Central District Court, claims that the company employed laboratories that did not have the proper credentials to test for formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.In a statement, Lumber Liquidators called the lawsuit “entirely without merit.”After a CBS “60 Minutes” report last month, the company, one of the largest flooring retailers in the country, has maintained that its Chinese-made laminate flooring does not contain high levels of formaldehyde. The report accused the retailer of selling products that far exceeded safety standards set by California’s Air Resources Board, the only agency that has set limits for formaldehyde in wood products.Formaldehyde is commonly used as an adhesive or preservative and can be found throughout the home, in things like furniture, cleaning supplies and cigarette smoke.AdvertisementAs part of its response, Lumber Liquidators said it would offer free indoor air testing kits to concerned consumers. But from the start, the tests posed challenges: Indoor air quality kits can measure overall levels of certain chemicals but generally cannot pinpoint their source.AdvertisementThe suit was filed on behalf of three California residents, Craig Lyznick, Shari Collins and Patricia Cottington, who purchased Lumber Liquidators flooring, then requested testing kits.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A spokesman for Lumber Liquidators, Lou Colasuonno, said that Environmental Diagnostics Laboratory, a subsidiary of Pure Air Control Services named in the suit, used properly accredited laboratories to conduct its testing.Proper testing for formaldehyde should also take into account various factors, like temperature, humidity and square footage, according to David Krause, an environmental consultant at the consulting firm Geosyntec and the former state toxicologist of Florida.The lawsuit contends that Pure Air Control Services is not accredited by the  American Industrial Hygiene Association to test for formaldehyde, and an association spokeswoman, Cheryl Morton, confirmed that. The company holds an accreditation only under the organization’s environmental microbiology laboratory program, which is intended for labs that identify microorganisms, she said.“The analogy is you have cancer, well, we’re going to set you up with a doctor, but they don’t tell you the doctor’s a chiropractor,” said Alexander Robertson, the plaintiffs’ lawyer. “Rather than giving the customers all of the facts, we allege that this is a campaign or a scheme to try and lull the customers into a false sense of security that the laminate floors are safe.”A version of this article appears in print on April 18, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Challenge to Lumber Liquidators’ Tests.
