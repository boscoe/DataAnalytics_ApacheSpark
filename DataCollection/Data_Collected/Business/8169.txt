TOKYO — Takata Corporation, the Japanese company whose airbag inflaters are at the center of a global safety recall, said on Thursday that it had swung to a net profit in the first quarter because of higher overseas sales and that its operating profit forecast had increased by 18 percent.Net profit was 3.1 billion yen, or $24.9 million, in April-June, compared with a ¥38.7 billion loss in the same period last year. Operating profit rose 35 percent to ¥10.3 billion.For the year ending in March, operating profit is likely to be ¥40 billion instead of ¥34 billion, because of the stronger-than-expected first quarter. But Takata kept its net profit projection at ¥20 billion to account for higher recall-related legal fees.Millions of cars have been recalled since 2008 to replace Takata inflaters. Regulators have linked the component to eight deaths, saying it can deploy with too much force and spray shrapnel through vehicle interiors. Automakers are bearing the cost of most recalls while the cause is investigated.AdvertisementTakata has not set aside funds for most of the recalled cars. The company also faces multiple lawsuits and a United States regulatory investigation that could inflict more costs.On Thursday, Takata repeated that it could not reasonably calculate the cost of the recall, lawsuits and any fines.AdvertisementTakata shares closed the day up 4 percent ahead of earnings, while the broader Topix rose 0.5 percent.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
