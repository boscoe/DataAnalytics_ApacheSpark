Viacom, the media conglomerate that owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, said on Monday that it would take a pretax charge of about $785 million for the quarter just ended in March, reflecting the write-down of underperforming programming and job cuts.The charge is part of a broader reorganization at Viacom, which is trying to reposition the company for long-term growth amid persistent declines in ratings and advertising revenue. The restructuring resulted in layoffs across the company, though Viacom did not say how many people lost their jobs.At the same time, Viacom is shifting resources to digital-focused areas, like data analysis, technology development and consumer insights, underscoring how quickly technological changes are upending the media business.Viacom said it expected about $175 million in savings in 2015 and continuing annual savings of about $350 million as a result of the restructuring.Advertisement“This strategic realignment, which is largely completed, will allow us to sharpen our focus on driving long-term growth in a rapidly changing industry,” said Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom’s chief executive. “We will transition rapidly into the future, generate substantial cost savings and continue to increase our investment in original programming to bring our audiences great content in new and groundbreaking ways.”Viacom said it would pause share repurchases under its current $20 billion stock repurchase program because of the restructuring and its plans to spend $400 million on acquisitions, which were announced previously. The company said that it planned to return to its share repurchases no later than October 2015.AdvertisementIn the quarter ended Dec. 31, Viacom reported a 9 percent slide in net income to $500 million.A version of this article appears in print on April 7, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Viacom Sets $785 Million Write-Down for Quarter.
