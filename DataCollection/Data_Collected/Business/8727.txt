Despite disappointing job growth last month, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since early 2008, sharpening the debate within the Federal Reserve over whether to raise interest rates when policy makers meet in two weeks.Friday’s report from the Labor Department — which found that employers added a weaker-than-expected 173,000 jobs in August while the official jobless rate dipped to 5.1 percent — provided fodder for both camps to make their cases.The slowdown in job growth and the absence of any significant wage pressure could strengthen the arguments of those who see little risk in keeping borrowing costs exceptionally low and waiting not just for more encouraging data but also for unruly markets to settle down.On the other side, there were enough positive indicators to keep a September tightening in play, even as Wall Street looks more seriously at the possibility of a Fed move in October or at the central bank’s last meeting of the year, in December.Advertisement“I don’t think it changes anyone’s views,” said Michael Gapen, head of United States economic research at Barclays. “It’s strong enough to keep the September-ists stuck on September and weak enough for everyone else who is looking for a later takeoff.”AdvertisementThe report was hotly anticipated, mainly because it represents the last major piece of economic evidence the central bank will have on hand before its long-awaited meeting on Sept. 16 and 17.The August payroll increase was well below the 220,000 jump economists had predicted. But the unemployment rate’s fall to 5.1 percent from 5.3 percent in July bolstered the case that the job market was returning to a healthier state, similar to conditions before the recession.At that level, joblessness is nearing the threshold that economists and the Fed consider close to full employment; inflation foes worry that allowing the unemployment rate to fall significantly below 5 percent runs the risk of leading to an overheated economy.While millions of Americans are still struggling to find work that pays adequately, there are nascent signs that wages are finally beginning to rise. Average hourly earnings rose by a better-than-expected 0.3 percentage point in August.Most Federal Reserve officials have signaled that they think this year is the appropriate time to raise interest rates from near zero, where they have been since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008.But the exact timing of the decision has become an obsession on Wall Street, which has enjoyed a long period of ultracheap money that helped, until the last few weeks, feed a long bull market.For investors around the world, that sense of anxious waiting is only going to build after Friday’s report, increasing the odds of more stock market swings. At the close of trading in New York, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down just over 1.5 percent, to 1,921.22. Bonds were little changed.AdvertisementWhenever the Fed decides to act, the initial rate increase will be small — a quarter of a percentage point — but it looms large psychologically because it will be the first increase in short-term rates by the Fed since June 2006.All this has contributed to a knife-edge quandary for Federal Reserve policy makers: Raise rates too soon and markets could plunge, economic momentum could fade and long-sought hopes for better-paying jobs could wither. Wait too long, however, and the Fed risks rekindling inflation and fostering speculative excesses on Wall Street.Officials said at the last Fed meeting, in July, that they wanted to see “some further improvement” in labor markets. Stanley Fischer, the Federal Reserve vice chairman, said last Saturday that the Fed was awaiting the results of the August survey to help make that judgment.Not only did the jobs report do little to clarify the situation, the sharp sell-off in global markets recently further complicated matters.SHARE OFPOPULATION 1-MONTHCHANGEAUG.Employed59.4%+Labor force(workers andunemployed)62.6Unch.5.1%‘HIDDEN’UNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGEIn millionsAUG.JFMAMJJAWorking parttime, but wantfull-time work6.5+1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.People whocurrently wanta job§5.9†–4.4%–0.2–0.9pts.pts.9.5+0.4–2.16.6–0.2–0.8UNEMPLOYMENT BYEDUCATION LEVEL1-MONTHCHANGE†††3.4–0.8–1.1AUG.16.90.7–2.5+Less thanHigh school 7.7%–High school 5.5Unch.1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESome college4.4Unch.AUG.Bachelor’s or higher2.5–28.4+0.4%–11.0%12.1+–7.1–9.0TYPE OF WORK1-MONTHCHANGEIn millionsAUG.Nonfarm payroll,12-month changeNonfarm142.3+Goods19.5–Services122.7+Agriculture2.3–AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS Rank-and-fileworkers1-MONTHCHANGEAUG.JFMAMJJA$868.11++UNEMPLOYMENT RATESHARE OFPOPULATION 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.6.5%Employed59.4%+0.1pts.+0.4pts.6.0Labor force(workers andunemployed)62.6Unch.–0.35.1%5.55.0‘HIDDEN’UNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGE4.5In millionsAUG.OSNDJFMAMJJAWorking parttime, but wantfull-time work6.5+2.5%–10.2%UNEMPLOYMENTDEMOGRAPHICS1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.People whocurrently wanta job§5.9†–8.2–7.2White4.4%–0.2–0.9pts.pts.Black9.5+0.4–2.1Hispanic6.6–0.2–0.8UNEMPLOYMENT BYEDUCATION LEVEL1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGE†††Asian3.4–0.8–1.1AUG.Teenagers (16-19)16.90.7–2.5+Less thanHigh school 7.7%–0.6pts.–1.4pts.DURATION OFUNEMPLOYMENT High school 5.5Unch.–0.71-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGESome college4.4Unch.–1.0In weeksAUG.Bachelor’s or higher2.5–0.1–0.7Average28.4+0.4%–11.0%Median12.1+–7.1–9.0TYPE OF WORK1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn millionsAUG.Nonfarm payroll,12-month changeEMPLOYMENTNonfarm142.3+0.1%+2.1%+3%Goods19.5–0.1+1.4Services122.7+0.2+2.2+2Agriculture2.3–1.3+3.5+1AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS Rank-and-fileworkers1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.0OSNDJFMAMJJA$868.11++0.6%%+2.5%UNEMPLOYMENT RATE6.5%6.05.3%5.55.04.5OSNDJFMAMJJAUNEMPLOYMENTDEMOGRAPHICS1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.–pts.White4.6%0.2–0.9pts.Black9.5+0.4–2.1Hispanic6.6–0.2–0.8†††Asian3.4–0.8–1.1Teenagers (16-19)16.9+0.7–2.5DURATION OFUNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn weeksAUG.Average28.4+0.4%–11.0%Median12.17.1–9.0–Nonfarm payroll,12-month changeEMPLOYMENT+3%+2+10SONDJFMAMJJASHARE OFPOPULATION 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.Employed59.4%+0.1pts.+0.4pts.Labor force(workers andunemployed)62.6Unch.–0.3‘HIDDEN’UNEMPLOYMENT 1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn millionsAUG.Working parttime, but wantfull-time work6.5+2.5%–10.2%People whocurrently wanta job§5.9†–8.2–7.2UNEMPLOYMENT BYEDUCATION LEVEL1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAUG.Less thanHigh school 7.7%+0.1pts.–1.4pts.High school 5.5Unch.–0.7Some college4.4Unch.–1.0Bachelor’s or higher2.5–0.1–0.7TYPE OF WORK1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEIn millionsAUG.Nonfarm142.3+0.1%+2.1%Goods19.5–0.1+1.4Services122.7+0.2+2.2Agriculture2.3–1.3+3.5AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS Rank-and-fileworkers1-MONTHCHANGE1-YEARCHANGEAug.$868.11+0.6%%+2.5%SEPT. 9, 2015
“A month ago, this report and the other data on the economy would have created a strong rationale for raising rates at the September meeting,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy. “But the world has changed and our expectation is now for a rate increase in December.”Indeed, some Fed officials are warning that the recent market turmoil hints that the economic picture might turn darker.“In my view, these developments might suggest a downward revision in the forecast that is large enough to raise concerns about whether further tightening of labor markets is likely,” Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said on Tuesday.A minority of officials made up their minds even before the release of the August numbers. Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, delivered a speech on Friday titled “The Case Against Further Delay.” Mr. Lacker, a voting member of the policy committee this year, has indicated he is likely to dissent if the Fed does not raise rates at the September meeting.AdvertisementOn the other side of the debate, Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, argued in a speech on Thursday night that the Fed should not raise rates this year because price inflation remains too low.The longer-term trend for job creation in 2015 has been fairly robust, even if wage gains have been disappointing. Since the start of the year, the average monthly payroll gain stands at 212,000. In addition, payroll gains for June and July were revised upward by 44,000.As has been the case all summer, hiring in blue-collar industries like manufacturing, construction and mining was weak last month, while white-collar sectors like financial activities and professional and business services were relatively strong.In fact, some employers in these fields are picking up the pace of hiring and offering higher salaries.Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That’s well above the 250 to 350 employees it added annually between 2010 and 2014.With average starting salaries of $55,000 to $65,000 for software development and technical roles, these positions pay well, said Debbie Connelly, vice president for human resources at Hyland. But the company needs candidates with specific skills in software development and information management or credentials like an engineering or information systems degree.“Over the last five years, starting salaries have increased as we compete for talent,” said Ms. Connelly, noting that it is not always easy for a company in the Cleveland suburbs to lure workers who might be able to find similar jobs on the coasts.“We hire many of our candidates at the entry level from Ohio colleges and universities,” she said. “If you grew up in Ohio, you’re far more likely to accept a job and stay in Ohio after school.”AdvertisementThere is yet another twist for the Fed to consider. The initial employment reports for August — for largely seasonal rather than fundamental factors — have a long history of coming in below the underlying trend, only to be revised upward later by the Labor Department.In addition, this year’s monthly figures could also be in for a sizable revision because fewer businesses than normal responded to the government’s survey.Only 69.9 percent of businesses reported their payroll change last month, the lowest rate in nearly four years, and well below the 79.4 percent average over the last 12 months.“That’s a big difference,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. As those missing reports for August come in, she said, “it could lift the revision for private sector hires.”In other words, while a monthly gain of fewer than 200,000 jobs the rest of the year might be considered weak, this month is different, said Robin Anderson, senior economist with Principal Global Investors in Des Moines.“The trend is so strong that one number alone won’t derail the Fed,” Ms. Anderson added. “These numbers are prone to revision, and you have to take the first estimate with a grain of salt.”A version of this article appears in print on September 5, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: New Jobs Data Clarifies Little in Fed Debate.
