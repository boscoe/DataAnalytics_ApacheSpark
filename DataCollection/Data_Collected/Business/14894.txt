“If somebody told me the 10-year Treasury’s at 75 basis points, I would not be surprised,” said Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock.BlackRock, the world’s largest publicly traded money manager, reported a small decrease in its second-quarter profit on Thursday, as volatile market conditions and political uncertainty kept many investors on the sidelines.Earnings fell nearly 4 percent, to $789 million, or $4.73 a share, from $819 million, or $4.84 a share, in the quarter a year earlier.Still, even in a fraught investment environment, the company’s assets under management — its most telling financial indicator — grew 4 percent, ending the quarter at $4.9 trillion.As has been the case in past quarters, BlackRock’s fast-growing exchange-traded funds drew the largest investments, taking in $15 billion for the quarter.AdvertisementE.T.F.s track a wide variety of stock and bond indexes. In the last quarter, so-called minimum volatility equity funds that follow a basket of low risk, steadier stocks were popular with investors seeking safe returns.AdvertisementAt $1.1 trillion, the company’s iShares E.T.F. brand represents nearly a quarter of BlackRock’s total asset pile and continues to grow at a more rapid clip than its actively managed bond and equity divisions.Like many other asset management firms, BlackRock saw retail and institutional investors pull out their money from actively managed bond and equity funds.Record low interest rates around the world and political uncertainty in Europe over Britain’s future in the European Union have made investing difficult, and many investors have chosen to minimize risk, keeping money in cash and low-yielding bank deposits.
                Goldman Sachs reported a 78 percent jump in quarterly profit as the Wall Street bank earned more from bond trading and its expenses fell.            “Political and macroeconomic uncertainty, historically low yields and elevated market volatility are leading clients to pause, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits in the U.S., China and Japan alone,” said BlackRock’s chief executive, Laurence D. Fink.But unlike companies that rely solely on their portfolio managers to make stock and bond bets, BlackRock has benefited by having a variety of lower-risk and lower-cost passive strategies, like E.T.F.s, which continue to attract money from investors.The strong showing in equity markets over the last week was the result of investors rushing to put their money back into stocks after many months of withdrawals, Mr. Fink said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
