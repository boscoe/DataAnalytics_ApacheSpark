I think it is incredible that I did my part, took the car to get the recall fixed and was returned a car that was clearly not fixed.”Another Jeep owner told the agency last month that “the sun visor caught fire and flames spread throughout the vehicle.”Fiat Chrysler initially recalled the vehicles — 2011-14 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Durangos — in July because of a wiring problem in the vanity mirror that could cause a short circuit, resulting in fire. The action included about 651,000 vehicles in the United States.The automaker said the problem originated at the assembly plant: If workers had to make repairs to or around the vanity mirror, a screw could penetrate the wiring when workers reassembled the parts. For the recall, the automaker’s repair involved installing plastic to protect the wiring.The safety agency first began looking into the issue in 2013, prompted by 39 complaints from vehicle owners, including three that involved injuries. “In some reports, the fire spread to the front seats and/or door panels of the vehicle,” the agency reported at the time. “In one report the sunroof was damaged, causing the glass to shatter.”Chrysler initially resisted a recall, telling federal regulators there was “no unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety.” But the safety agency insisted.A spokesman for Fiat Chrysler, Eric Mayne, said the company was cooperating with the recall query.Advertisement
