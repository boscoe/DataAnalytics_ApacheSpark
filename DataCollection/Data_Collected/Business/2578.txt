Job openings rose 2.9 percent to 4.97 million in November, the most since January 2001. A second report on Tuesday from the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business group, added to the positive outlook, showing that small-business optimism rose in December to its highest level since October 2006. However, a measure of average hourly pay fell in December, according to Friday’s monthly jobs report. Wages increased only 1.7 percent in the last year, barely ahead of the 1.3 percent rate of inflation. The two reports “suggest that labor market conditions are even stronger than we previously believed and leaves the slowdown in wage growth looking even odder,” said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.
