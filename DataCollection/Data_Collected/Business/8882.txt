She has so far showed a willingness to take a hard line against concentration of economic power in other industries.Earlier in the week, Ms. Vestager’s office said it had approved General Electric’s bid to take over the power business of the French company Alstom — but only after G.E. agreed to sell some of Alstom’s European assets to Ansaldo Energia, an Italian engineering company.The Telenor-TeliaSonera proposal, first announced in December, would have combined the companies’ Danish operations into a joint venture, with each company owning a 50 percent stake. But it also would have reduced the number of mobile telephone providers in Denmark to three from four.In April, Ms. Vestager’s office opened an inquiry into the proposed joint venture, saying it could lead to higher prices for consumers and could reduce innovation because it would leave the Danish market with only two other competitors for cellphone service.By combining their operations in Denmark, Telenor and TeliaSonera had hoped to create what they said would be a more robust competitor to TDC, the largest mobile service provider in the country, giving the new entity about 40 percent of the Danish market for mobile services.When Telenor and TeliaSonera first announced their plan, they cited pressure on revenue growth and profitability in Denmark because of “intense” competition, and that consolidation was “inevitable.”The combined company would have had a mobile subscriber base of about 3.5 million customers and revenue of more than 9 billion Danish kroner, or about $1.35 billion. It would also have dwarfed Denmark’s smallest mobile provider Hi3G, a unit of Hutchison Whampoa, which is owned by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing.Ms. Vestager’s predecessor, Mr. Almunia, had allowed consolidation of that degree within the mobile sector.Previous consolidations included the acquisition by the Spanish giant Telefónica of Germany’s smallest mobile operator, E-Plus, from its Dutch rival KPN. Telefónica combined E-Plus with its existing German mobile business after it received the go-ahead from regulators last year.In a joint statement on Friday, Telenor and TeliaSonera said that the negotiations had reached a point “where it is no longer possible to gain approval for the proposed transaction.”“In the interests of both companies, we felt it necessary to act decisively,” Kjell-Morten Johnsen, a Telenor executive vice president, said in a news release. “Telenor and TeliaSonera will continue to compete and deliver products and services in the Danish market through our respective original, and still fully up-and-running, Danish operations.”The companies had offered concessions, including selling 40 percent of a telecom network that they already share in Denmark to a third party. That would have made it easier, they said, for a potential new competitor to emerge.The companies said at the time that they hoped the deal would help them to save about 800 million Danish kroner by 2019.On Friday, the companies said they would continue to review “strategic options” for their respective businesses in Denmark.“Since the beginning, we have been strong advocates for the need to increase investment levels in Denmark,” Robert Andersson, a TeliaSonera executive vice president, said in a news release. “In our view, creating a market player with the scale and ability to compete and invest would ensure that customers and businesses would benefit from better quality, speed and coverage.”TeliaSonera, which is based in Stockholm, provides telecom services in Europe and parts of Asia. It has 72.8 million subscribers and posted revenue of 101 billion Swedish kronor, or about $12 billion. The company employs more than 26,000 people worldwide.Telenor, based in Fornebu, Norway, offers telecom services in 13 markets in Europe and Asia and another 14 markets through its ownership stake in VimpelCom.Telenor has 189 million mobile subscribers and posted revenue of 107 billion Norwegian kroner, or about $13 billion, in 2014. The company employs about 33,000 people worldwide.Advertisement
