American Apparel suspended Mr. Charney six months before firing him, accusing him of misuse of company funds and a failure to stop a subordinate from posting false blog entries about former employees. The lawsuit says that Mr. Charney has yet to fulfill promises made to the hedge fund. The case stems from a deal that Mr. Charney and Standard General struck in June last year, in which the former chief gave up his voting rights to secure a loan to increase his stake in American Apparel. Standard General says that Mr. Charney put up his original stake in American Apparel as collateral and promised to surrender the new shares he bought, but failed to do so. A lawyer for Mr. Charney, Keith Fink, called the lawsuit a “smoke screen” to distract from a lawsuit Mr. Charney filed in June. Advertisement
