The model Naomi Campbell, wearing a black studded dress, promoted her new show, “I Am Naomi” for Yahoo Style, one of the company’s digital magazines. Later, the actress Michelle Rodriguez — who starred in the blockbuster film “Avatar,” as well as the successful “Fast & Furious” franchise — appeared riding a motorcycle to introduce the show “Riding Shotgun With Michelle Rodriguez” for Yahoo Auto, another digital magazine.Those shows were part of a broad effort by Yahoo to stir interest in its digital magazines, which were unveiled last year. It now has 13 of them, including ones for beauty, politics and technology. The digital magazines, which are filled with so-called native advertising, align with Yahoo’s overall goal to offer more content, particularly for mobile viewing.“We’re proud of our transformation into a mobile-first company,” said Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, at the presentation.Yahoo also introduced a scripted comedy called “The Pursuit,” about a group of friends in their late 20s living in Manhattan.Thirty-three companies will take part in the NewFronts this year, which began on Monday and will take place over two weeks in New York. The goal is to persuade advertisers to spend more on digital video, a medium for ads that is gaining in popularity.One up-and-coming company, Maker Studios, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, tried to impress advertisers at its presentation on Tuesday by showcasing its appeal to the millennial generation and the younger, so-called Generation Z.“Millennials are our core expertise, and we know where to find them,” said Ynon Kreiz, the president of Maker Studios. “In fact, they find us.”Among the shows that Maker introduced were “Party Girl,” a scripted comedy about working as a party princess for children; and “The Taryn Show,” a late-night talk show hosted by Taryn Southern, a star on YouTube. Ms. Southern said the show would include tutorials on topics like “effective strategies for stalking your ex-boyfriend.”Companies are also focusing on technology that makes it easier to measure audience behavior.BuzzFeed, for instance, which held its presentation on Monday in a venue that smelled of stale beer, introduced a product to track how its articles spread online.Advertisement
