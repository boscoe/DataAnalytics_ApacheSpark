From its low in late August, the main Shanghai share index has risen 23 percent.Getting the I.P.O. process right has proved challenging for Chinese regulators, who have suspended and resumed new listings several times in recent years when markets have become too volatile.New listings are a favored target of speculators because, under current regulations, the shares are permitted to rise as much as 44 percent on their first day of trading. Trading on subsequent days is capped at a daily gain or loss of 10 percent, as it is for all other stocks.As part of their increased oversight, financial regulators have been cracking down recently on insider trading, which analysts say is rampant on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets.Suspicions of insider trading were cited this week in the arrest of the owner of one of the country’s top investment firms, Xu Xiang, a billionaire who has been called the Carl Icahn of China.With the resumption of I.P.O.s, the spokesman for the securities regulator, Deng Ge, said on Friday that the agency intended to simplify the approval process for smaller companies and heighten the responsibilities of the brokerages that bring new listings to the market.The new measures would “increase protections for the rights and interests of investors and further reform and perfect the I.P.O. system,” Mr. Deng said, according to Xinhua.In a separate development Friday evening, China’s central bank and securities regulator jointly published long-delayed guidelines for investment firms in mainland China and Hong Kong to gain access to each other’s markets.The initial agreement between the two jurisdictions on so-called mutual access for investment firms had been announced in May. But its application was delayed for months after the summer turmoil in the mainland financial markets.The quota will be capped at the outset at a relatively modest 300 billion renminbi, or around $50 billion, for flows in each direction. But the move is a significant development, giving international asset managers their most direct access yet to mainland investors.The mainland’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, said the publication of the detailed guidelines would allow the pilot program to move forward immediately.The start of the arrangement had been highly anticipated in Hong Kong, where international funds operate freely but have struggled to gain access to the mainland’s still-restricted market for investment products.“The mutual fund recognition scheme has been very high on our agenda,” Julia Leung, an executive director at Hong Kong’s securities regulator, said in a speech last month at an investment forum, according to a Reuters report. “Things are on track, and you’ll see the announcement by the end of the year hopefully.”Advertisement
