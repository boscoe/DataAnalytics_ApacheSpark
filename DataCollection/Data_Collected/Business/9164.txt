Its primary competitor is Business Wire, a similar service owned by Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.The PR Newswire business derives about half its revenue from distribution in the United States and had revenue of 195.8 million pounds, or about $302.6 million, in 2014, according to UBM.“There is no certainty that these discussions will result in a transaction being agreed,” UBM said in a news release.UBM did not name the parties with which it was speaking or the price at which it was looking to sell PR Newswire.Based in London, UBM organizes trade shows, provides marketing services and distributes news releases for companies.The company expanded the size of its events and trade show operations with acquisition last year of Advanstar, a marketer and trade show organizer based in California, for $972 million in cash.UBM said at the time that the Advanstar deal would create the largest events organizer in the United States and make UBM the biggest provider of fashion industry events in America.Trade shows and other events account for about 60 percent of UBM’s business. It posted revenue of $746.3 million in 2014 and employs around 5,000 people in more than 20 countries.Advertisement
