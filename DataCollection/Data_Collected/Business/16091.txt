Instacart, the on-demand shopping start-up, has garnered cash from one of its partners, Whole Foods, that values it around $2 billion, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.And Amazon has continued to expand its AmazonFresh food delivery service to more cities, most recently including Boston and parts of London.Yet the tougher competitive landscape has not worried FreshDirect, according to Jason Ackerman, the chief executive and a co-founder of the company. More rivals have meant wider awareness for the overall business of online grocery ordering and delivery, he said in a telephone interview.Seizing that potential new business has become the game.“The general pressure is in the fight for new customers who haven’t cast their vote yet,” he said.FreshDirect operates in New York City and in Philadelphia, and the fund-raising is meant to help the company expand into new geographic markets and business lines, as well as to improve its distribution capacity.Not all competitors are jumping wholeheartedly onto the grocery delivery wagon. Google disclosed this month that its Express service would expand across the United States but would not include perishable items like milk and eggs.FreshDirect has also moved into new businesses. In January, it unveiled FoodKick, a service that delivers food within an hour. According to Mr. Ackerman, it is meant to cater to “nonplanned instant gratification,” not unlike what Instacart offers.Mr. Ackerman added that one of FreshDirect’s advantages was that it had been profitable since 2010. He said sales had grown every quarter for the last 12 years, with revenue now above $600 million a year.“It’s a fact that we have achieved scale and profitability,” Mr. Ackerman said, adding that any expansion plans would be from a “solid foundation.”In comparison, Instacart’s founder, Apoorva Mehta, said this month that he believed his company could become cash-flow positive by next year.Mr. Ackerman said that FreshDirect began looking to raise additional funds about six months ago and that the company began discussions soon after with JPMorgan, whose asset management unit led the latest investment round.As part of FreshDirect’s fund-raising, two JPMorgan executives — Larry Unrein, the head of the asset management unit’s private equity group; and Ashmi Mehrotra, a managing director — will join the company’s board.“As demand for fresh ingredients delivered to your door continues to rise, high-quality food, produce and packaged goods providers are drawing significant attention from the investment community,” Mr. Unrein said in a statement, adding that FreshDirect was a “forward-thinking leader” in the sector.Advertisement
