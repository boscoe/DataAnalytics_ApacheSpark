Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.1 billion for a new fund focused on investing in infrastructure like roads, water supply systems and energy pipelines.The move highlights the continuing interest of private-sector firms in investing in infrastructure. It also comes at a time when many cash-poor local governments have been unable to do so.For private equity firms and other money managers, such investments offer a potential steady stream of income for years. Political opposition killed some prominent deals in recent years, including some in Chicago and in Pennsylvania. But these investors have focused in large part on somewhat less visible projects, like renewable energy plants.The new fund is K.K.R.’s second devoted to infrastructure; it raised $1 billion in 2012.Among the projects that K.K.R. has invested in are the water and waste systems of Bayonne, N.J., and a gas pipeline platform in western Canada.“A decrease in public funding and weakened economic conditions in many regions are driving tremendous global demand for private investments in infrastructure, and K.K.R.’s differentiated strategy allows us to meet this need with value-added solutions,” Marc Lipschultz, the global head of the company’s energy and infrastructure business, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on July 9, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Investing in Infrastructure.
