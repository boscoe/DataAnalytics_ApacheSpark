The number of private capital funds raising money from investors is on the rise, and the amount they are seeking to raise is a record $946 billion at the beginning of the year. That surpasses the previous high-water mark in terms of fund-raising goals set at the beginning of 2009, according to new data from Preqin.Last year was the fifth-consecutive year of growth in total investments raised for private capital funds, which include private equity, debt, real estate, infrastructure and natural resources funds, the data and research firm said.Blackstone Capital Partners VII closed in the fourth quarter with $18 billion of investor commitments, the biggest private fund that closed last year and the fifth-largest buyout fund ever.In all, 1,061 funds closed last year, with $550 billion of investor assets, though the numbers are expected to change slightly as final data comes in. Preqin said it was likely that 2015 would surpass the $590 billion in money raised in funds that closed in 2014.AdvertisementAnother Blackstone fund, Real Estate Partners VIII, closed in September with $15.8 billion, the biggest closed-end private real estate fund ever.Two funds being shopped around to investors, both of which will invest in infrastructure projects — Brookfield Infrastructure Fund III and Global Infrastructure Partners III — are each seeking $12.5 billion. If they reach their fund-raising goals, they would be the biggest ones of their kind raised to date, Preqin said.AdvertisementTotal fund-raising for private debt funds reached $85 billion last year, short of the record of $98 billion raised in 2008. Investor money in direct lending funds was $33 billion last year, about even with 2014, and direct lending funds made up six of the 10 largest private debt funds to close last year, Preqin said. Goldman Sachs’s GS Mezzanine Partners VI, with $8 billion, was the largest.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
