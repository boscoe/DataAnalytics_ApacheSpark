AdvertisementSupported byBy Sydney EmberDisney has invested another $200 million in Vice Media, doubling its stake just weeks after its first investment, people familiar with the deal said on Tuesday.The cash infusion brings Disney’s stake in Vice to about 10 percent, according to one of the people. The investment does not change Vice’s valuation, the person said, which last month was put in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion.The money will help finance original programming, including TV shows, the people said. Vice is expected to unveil its new cable channel, Viceland, as early as the end of February, and intends to fill it with lifestyle and entertainment programming. Viceland will replace H2, the History channel spinoff owned by A&E Networks.The investment — which brings Disney’s total to $400 million — is the latest show of support for Vice, whose brash voice and ability to attract young male viewers has attracted piles of cash from traditional media companies seeking to reach its core audience. A&E Networks, the television group owned by Hearst and Disney, invested $250 million last year, and 21st Century Fox has invested $70 million.Vice also has a weekly newsmagazine show on HBO and is expected to introduce a daily newscast on the premium cable network next year.Family-friendly Disney and insurgent Vice might seem like strange bedfellows, but one reason for the relationship could involve the challenges facing the cable television business. As subscriber losses and ratings declines hold back growth at some of Disney’s older channels, including ESPN, Viceland could pick up some of the slack. Disney declined to comment on Tuesday.A&E Networks and Vice said last month when they announced the long-awaited deal that the channel would initially be distributed to about 70 million homes in the United States.Despite Vice’s raciness, Disney believes in the fledgling company’s multiscreen approach to delivering news and entertainment and its understanding of young adult audiences, said people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships. Although the odd-couple nature of Disney and Vice carries risks, Disney has come to believe that the Vice brand can be kept entirely separate from its own.Brooks Barnes contributed reportingBrooks Barnes contributed reportingAdvertisement
