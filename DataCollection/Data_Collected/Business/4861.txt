LONDON — Jonathan Lee has spent 30 years in the shipping business. But he was as excited as a rookie over the scene on his screen one recent day here at the international nerve center of his oil tanker chartering and dispatching company.Although petroleum prices are down worldwide, the business of sending two-million-barrel supertankers across the seas has never been brisker — or more global.Mr. Lee, who works alongside colleagues in an office that could pass for a suburban stockbroker’s, pointed to an arrow on his computer screen. It showed the location of the supertanker Leonidas, under charter to a subsidiary of the giant Chinese oil company Sinopec.
            Demand for the largest supertankers, including so-called Very Large Crude Carriers, has risen as China and other Asian economies import more oil from outside the Middle East. Longer trips from oil producers in Africa and the Americas make larger tankers more economical.

Its destination was a port in Gabon in West Africa. There, it would load a cargo of crude oil and head back to China, a round-trip journey of about 75 days.Advertisement“Years ago, you never saw the Chinese chartering in West Africa; now they are the largest charterer there,” said Mr. Lee, chief executive of Tankers International. “You are seeing history change in front of your eyes.”AdvertisementWhat’s happening with prices and distribution is a new chapter in the history of the oil industry. As with most products, the price of oil is based on supply and demand. But rather than any big slump in demand, the plunge in oil prices in the last year is more a result of a growing world supply — mainly from higher output in the United States and OPEC’s reluctance to cut production.The lower price is in many ways stoking demand — particularly in big energy-importing countries like China and India, which are taking advantage of what may turn out to be a bargain opportunity to top off their petroleum reserves.And so supertankers these days are making fewer relatively short jaunts from places like Gabon and Nigeria to the Gulf Coast of the United States, which no longer needs as much of their oil. Instead, the ships are making longer — and more lucrative — trips to India, China and elsewhere in Asia. Staging areas like the Malongo Terminal in Angola and ports as far from China as Venezuela and Brazil are also filling tankers that will deliver oil to Asia.For Mr. Lee’s London firm and the shipping companies it serves, 2015 is shaping up to be a boom time, after a run of lean years for oil shippers. “What we do is sell space,” he said. “If our ships are utilized for considerable periods of time, the remaining ships can be sold at higher prices.”Tankers International is the booking agent for a category of vessels known as Very Large Crude Carriers, state-of-the-art ships that are about 1,100 feet — more than a fifth of a mile — long. Their two-million-barrel capacity is equivalent to the daily output of a midsize oil-producing country like Norway. At current prices, those cargoes would typically be worth around $120 million.There are about 600 supertankers of this class plying the world’s waterways, and Tankers International books jobs for about 40 of them. Many shipowners line up work themselves, but Mr. Lee’s firm is the agent for a group of five companies with shipping interests.As the price of crude oil fluctuates, why some countries are faring much better than others.One is Euronav, a European operator, which holds a stake in Tankers International. Others include Trafigura, a Dutch multinational commodity trader, and Oak Maritime, a shipping business based in Hong Kong.AdvertisementThe computer terminals at Tankers International provide the 17 agents here with extensive intelligence on the ships of competitors, including not only where they are but when they will reach their next destinations and how much money they are making or losing. The information is an algorithmic mash-up of GPS data, intelligence on the financial details of chartering transactions and even the results of safety inspections.While Tankers International is wary of disclosing information on the ships it manages, it makes available a free mobile app with data on competing vessels called VLCC Fixtures.“We used to trade on gut feeling,” said Henrik Sick, the firm’s vice president for chartering. “Now we have better information than other people.”And, oh, by the way: Cheaper oil means big savings for the shipowners, whose supertankers are powered by a heavy, petroleum-based fuel that is cheaper than it has been in years. That makes those longer trips all the more feasible.“A glut of oil has to be good for the tanker industry,” said Simon Toyne, a maritime analyst at Genscape, a market research firm.Not only do the longer distances and times earn more money for tanker owners, but ships that are tied up on lengthy voyages cannot be used elsewhere like the Persian Gulf — further tightening the market, which in turn lets the owners charge higher rates.According to Evercore ISI, an investment banking advisory firm based in New York, spot rates for chartering very large crude carriers have risen sharply in recent months. In January, when heating season in the Northern Hemisphere was keeping the supertankers especially busy, they were able to command charter rates as high as $69,000 a day. Recently they have eased off to the range of about $40,000 a day in anticipation of the second quarter of the year, which is almost always weak.But even that is richer than the average rates of $22,000 last year and about $12,000 in 2013.With an estimated break-even for shipowners of around $25,000 a day, Jonathan Chappell, a shipping analyst at Evercore, says he expects all of the nine publicly listed tanker companies he covers — which includes Euronav and two Bermuda-based companies, Teekay Tankers and DHT Holdings — to be profitable this year. Last year, four of the companies that Mr. Chappell tracks lost money; two were only marginally profitable.AdvertisementMr. Chappell says the tanker industry is “still in the early innings of a recovery.” That comes after a grim few years after the global financial crisis and economic slump, when shipowners were caught with a glut of ships that they ordered during the previous boom years in the early 2000s.There is also a potentially lucrative side business for some tankers — one that perked up briefly early this year. The especially steep plunge in oil prices in January prompted commodity traders to take options on about 20 ships, with plans to use them as floating storage tanks. A few ships like the Alsace, which spent most of February and March fully loaded and anchored off Scotland’s Orkney Islands, have been put to this use.Lately, considering a recent spike in oil prices because of Middle East tensions, this buy low, sell high storage strategy has looked less appealing.Executives like Patrick Rodgers, chief executive of Euronav, one of the largest tanker companies, say they hope interest in using tankers for storage will return this year. Supply will continue to exceed demand, the thinking goes, and storage on land, which is already tight in the United States, will continue to fill up, depressing prices. “We will see there being real demand and stimulus for storing oil and that where it will be stored is on ships,” he recently told analysts.But for now, the real money will continue to be made on those slow boats to China.An article on Thursday about a boom in business for tanker ships because of a glut of crude oil misstated the equivalent length in miles of a typical Very Large Crude Carrier, a supertanker made for shipping oil. The ships are about 1,100 feet long, or more than a fifth of a mile, not “almost one-fifth of a mile.”A version of this article appears in print on April 2, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Oil Glut Benefits Those Who Ferry It.
