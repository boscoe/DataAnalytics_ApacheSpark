Domestic volume rose 5.2 percent last year to 20.4 million cases. “We’re living the dream,” said Chris Morris, master distiller at Brown-Forman, producer of Jack Daniel’s, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. Bourbon and Tennessee whiskey revenues and volumes outpaced the overall distilled spirits sector, the council said in its annual report, and exports topped $1 billion for the third straight year despite a strong dollar. Over all, American spirits exports have more than doubled in the last decade, to a projected $1.56 billion last year from $743 million in 2005. Advertisement
