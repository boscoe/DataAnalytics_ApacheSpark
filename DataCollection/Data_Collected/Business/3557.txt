The Four Seasons Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip is known for its steakhouse, its palm tree-decorated rooftop pool bar and its quick access to the sprawling gambling floors at the Mandalay Bay casino, just downstairs.But late last month, it became a showcase of a different sort, serving as the venue for a lobbying campaign by Trinity Industries, the Texas-based manufacturer of highway guardrail systems.Representatives from Trinity approached at least four attorneys general at the event, sponsored by the Democratic Attorneys General Association, in an attempt to knock down claims that its guardrail system has a design flaw that can in certain accidents turn it into a deadly spear.The appeals, separately confirmed by several of the attorneys general targeted, are just the latest example of how this once low-profile company has mounted an increasingly aggressive lobbying campaign in recent years as concerns over its guardrails have grown. More than 30 states have suspended their installation.Advertisement“Opening up communications with parties, either friendly or adverse, is always productive, period,” said Tony Troy, a former attorney general from Virginia, who attended the Las Vegas event along with two Trinity executives. He was retained by Trinity to help in its legal and lobbying effort.AdvertisementVirginia’s attorney general, Mark Herring, raised the stakes in December, when he became the first state attorney general to file his own legal action against Trinity, accusing the company of fraud for “selling the Commonwealth of Virginia thousands of unapproved, improperly tested and potentially dangerous pieces of highway guardrail equipment.”Even before that suit, Trinity had opened its checkbook, becoming one of the nation’s top donors to attorney general political causes. In the last two years, it has contributed $300,000 to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and the Republican Attorneys General Association, after not donating in the two previous years, campaign finance records show.The flow of money started only after federal and state officials, in 2012, became aware of possible defects in the guardrail design, after a whistle-blower lawsuit was filed.The company separately has made direct campaign donations to the 2014 political accounts of attorney general candidates in Oklahoma, Ohio, Alabama, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina and South Dakota, among other states, according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in State Politics.And it has dispatched its own lobbyists and lawyers to make appeals in states around the country, an effort that has included face-to-face meetings with Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida and Attorney General Mike DeWine of Ohio, among others, officials in these states confirmed.A company spokesman, in a statement, said that Trinity’s actions were entirely appropriate.“Trinity Industries routinely participates in a wide variety of political and industry trade groups and interacts with public officials at various events as well as offices,” said Jeff Eller. “We offer the opportunity to all elected officials to meet with Trinity Industries in order to inform them about our businesses and their constituents.”But the donations have bought Trinity and its legal and lobbying team access to closed-door events like the meeting in Las Vegas.AdvertisementFor example, Trinity donated $50,000 last year to the Democratic Attorneys General Association, earning the company a spot on the association’s Attorneys General Roundtable, reserved for the organization’s biggest donors. These donors, in exchange for their large contributions, are offered the “unique opportunity for focused conversation with specific AGs in a small setting,” a membership brochure says.Trinity representatives — including Mr. Troy and Lynne Ross, a former head of the National Association of Attorneys General, who both now work at the Pittsburgh-based Eckert, Seamans law firm retained by Trinity — wasted little time approaching attorneys general during the kickoff cocktail party, lawyers who were at the event said.
                Since 2012, when allegations surfaced that there might be a safety flaw in a highway guardrail system manufactured by Trinity, the company has significantly expanded its lobbying of state attorneys general, who have the power to investigate and possibly sue the company. Here is a look at parts of that effort.            Mr. Troy said he took the opportunity during these conversations to explain a just-completed series of crash tests of Trinity’s guardrails, which had been mandated by the Federal Highway Administration this past October, after a jury in a federal whistle-blower case found that Trinity had defrauded the government by not informing the agency of a crucial design change it made to the rail units in 2005.“The various attorneys general are interested in the ongoing testing that is being conducted,” Mr. Troy said.Appeals were made to attorneys general, including George Jepsen from Connecticut and Bill Sorrell from Vermont, who were also asked to make a commitment to meet with company representatives for a more detailed briefing once they returned to their offices.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I will certainly take one if they are back in touch.”Trinity’s lobbying and legal team, which included two executives from the company’s Dallas headquarters, also approached attorneys general Ellen F. Rosenblum from Oregon and Tom Miller from Iowa, although Mr. Miller said that in his conversations with Trinity’s representatives he did not discuss any specifics related to the guardrail investigation.Mr. Miller, like other attorneys general contacted by The New York Times, said he welcomed input from the company, to better understand the issues.Advertisement“I want to make all my decisions based on the merits,” he said in an interview.Similar appeals have been made to Republican attorneys general, as Trinity last year became a Platinum sponsor to the organization, one of its top levels, which secured for company officials invitations to “V.I.P. dinners” with the attorneys general and for certain donors an opportunity to lead a “private briefing” with Republican attorneys general at one of their political events.Email records obtained by The Times show how the routine typically plays out. In Florida, after a lawsuit was filed on behalf of a resident who lost his leg in a 2010 car crash involving a Trinity guardrail, Trinity hired Richard Doran, a former Florida attorney general, who approached Ms. Bondi to propose a briefing that would include the top executives from Trinity’s highway guardrail division, its in-house lobbyist and one of the lead lawyers defending the company in guardrail claims.“The general was kind enough to offer to meet when I saw her in Washington,” Mr. Doran wrote in an email to Ms. Bondi’s staff, asking for the meeting, which took place in June 2013, state records show.A spokesman for Ms. Bondi, Gerald Whitney Ray, said that the office was “very aware” of the concerns raised over the guardrails. “This matter is under active review, and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time,” he said.Ohio officials separately confirmed that Trinity executives scheduled a February 2013 briefing for Attorney General DeWine and his staff, a gathering that addressed a 2011 patent dispute that had led to the federal whistle-blower lawsuit. Trinity had sued Joshua Harman, a competitor who manufactures and sells guardrails, for infringement and, in the course of that case, he learned of the undisclosed design changes and brought them to the government’s attention.Trinity made campaign contributions to Mr. DeWine and Ms. Bondi, following these meetings, records show.The lobbying cuts both ways. The Times reported in December that a former attorney general from the District of Columbia, Linda Singer, now a plaintiffs lawyer, had pitched offices of multiple attorneys general with a laundry list of possible litigation topics, including Trinity’s guardrails.Arlene Violet, a Democrat and a former Rhode Island attorney general, said that a company like Trinity was certainly entitled to set up meetings. But she added that appeals like this should not be taking place at fund-raising events held at resort hotels, like the Four Seasons in Las Vegas.“It is just another example of what erodes confidence in our public officials,” Ms. Violet said. “That money ought to be returned.”A version of this article appears in print on February 13, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Troubled Guardrail Maker Goes on a Lobbying Blitz .
