The agreement allows nations to set aside radio frequencies so that airplanes can be tracked by satellite — not just from the ground. Under current radar-based systems, the movement of planes is monitored by land-based systems, leaving around 70 percent of the world’s surface uncovered, according to the United Nations communications agency, the International Telecommunication Union. Modern planes that can send what are known as Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, signals to the ground are now on track to send signals to satellites, too; the satellite tracking is expected to be in effect by 2017. The accord was reached at the World Radiocommunication Conference, an international gathering organized every four years by the telecommunications group. The March 2014 disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people on board exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems. Debris from the Boeing 777 was found on the island of Réunion in July. Advertisement
