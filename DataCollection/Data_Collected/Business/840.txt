LONDON — The Lloyds Banking Group said on Wednesday that its profit had declined slightly in the third quarter as its results were again dragged down by provisions for a contentious loan insurance product that has cost the banking industry billions of dollars.The British bank said it had set aside an additional 500 million pounds, or about $767 million, in the third quarter to potentially compensate customers who were improperly sold so-called payment protection insurance. Lloyds has set aside £13.9 billion in total to cover potential claims for compensation.Lloyds was one of the biggest providers of the loan insurance in Britain and was fined £117 million in June for its handling of customer complaints related to the product. António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, has called payment protection insurance the lender’s biggest “legacy issue.”For two decades, through 2010, British banks sold 45 million payment protection policies to people applying for credit cards, taking out mortgages and seeking other loans. The insurance was intended to cover monthly payments on mortgages or credit cards if a customer were unable to make those payments for reasons like a debilitating illness or the loss of a job.AdvertisementBut regulators said the complex pricing and terms of the policies made the insurance inappropriate for many consumers.AdvertisementBanks in Britain have been pressing regulators to set a time limit on filing complaints related to the loan insurance: Requests for compensation have far outpaced the industry’s original estimates.Since 2011 through the end of August, banks in Britain have paid out £21.1 billion in claims to customers, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the industry.This month, the regulator said it might soon set a deadline for people to seek redress for improperly sold policies, with the earliest deadline likely to be spring 2018.George Culmer, the Lloyds chief financial officer, said in a news release that “the current provision continues to assume a significant decrease in reactive complaint volumes over the next 15 months, compared with trends in recent quarters.”If the volume of customer complaints did not decline as forecast by the bank, he said, the lender might decide to set aside even more funds.For the three months ended Sept. 30, Lloyds reported a profit of £690 million, compared to £693 million in the same period a year earlier.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Lloyds agreed in March to sell its remaining stake in TSB to Banco Sabadell of Spain.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, rose nearly 1 percent to £2.86 billion in the third quarter, from £2.84 billion in the same period a year earlier.Operating expenses declined 2 percent to £1.92 billion in the period, from £1.97 billion in the third quarter of 2014.Lloyds said that impairments it had set aside for bad and underperforming loans declined 33 percent to £157 million in the third quarter, from £236 million in the same period a year earlier.The news came as the British government was preparing to wind down its holdings in the lender, after a huge bailout seven years ago.During the 2008 financial crisis, Lloyds received a £17 billion bailout from the British government, and its British banking rival Royal Bank of Scotland received £45 billion.The state owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds after the bailout, but it has reduced its holdings since September 2013 as the bank’s prospects have improved.The government reduced its stake in Lloyds to just below 11 percent in the third quarter, as part of a prearranged trading plan managed by Morgan Stanley. This month, it also announced plans to sell a £2 billion stake to retail investors in the spring.A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Lloyds Lags.
