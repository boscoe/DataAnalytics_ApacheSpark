The Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú’s holding company Inversora Carso said on Friday that it would start a full takeover bid for the Spanish building and infrastructure company FCC at a price of 7.60 euros ($8.36) a share.Inversora Caros, which already owned 27.4 percent of FCC, said its stake had increased to 36.6 percent after it bought into a 709.5-million-euro rights issue, which ended last week. Under Spanish law, a shareholder that increases its stake in a company above 30 percent is required to make an offer for the company.The offer, disclosed in a statement to the Madrid stock market regulator, represents a 15 percent premium to FCC’s closing share price on Friday of 6.59 euros. The deal faces obstacles, not the least of which is that many shareholders bought shares at a much higher price. FCC, founded 70 years ago, has been struggling with high debts and sluggish business since a property bubble burst in Spain in 2007.A version of this article appears in print on March 5, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexican Tycoon Opens Bid to Take Over FCC of Spain.
