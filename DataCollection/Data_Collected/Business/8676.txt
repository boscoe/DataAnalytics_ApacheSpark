While that was below economists’ expectations for a gain of 201,000 jobs, it was a step up from the 177,000 positions created in July and in line with the trend for the first seven months of this year.The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody’s Analytics, was published before the government’s more comprehensive employment report for August, which is set to be released on Friday.“Businesses are still hiring, but it is not clear if Friday’s report will give the Fed either an ‘all clear’ or a ‘let’s go slow’ signal,” said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls most likely increased by 220,000 jobs in August after rising 215,000 in July. There is, however, a risk of a lower number because the first report of August payrolls has tended to be weaker in the last several years before being revised higher.But some economists were encouraged by the ADP report, which showed job gains in all sectors except the energy industry.“ADP does not show the same initial underreporting bias in the initial release of the August data as payroll data from the government appear to display,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.“This apparent consistent trend in ADP payroll gains,” Mr. Ryding said, “would reassure us that the trend in employment was little changed in August in the event that payroll growth drops noticeably below 200,000 in Friday’s report.”The unemployment rate is forecast to tick down one-tenth of a percentage point to a near seven-and-a-half-year low of 5.2 percent. The August employment report will be released less than two weeks before the Fed’s policy meeting, set for Sept. 16 and 17.The chances of an interest rate increase this month have been diminished by a global stock market sell-off after the release of poor economic data from China. In addition, factory activity in the United States slowed to a two-year low in August, with some economists citing the financial markets’ turbulence as a factor.However, the Fed’s vice chairman, Stanley Fischer, told CNBC last week that it was too early to decide whether the stock market rout had made a rate hike this month less likely.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, while prices for United States Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street rebounded from Tuesday’s sharp losses. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 293.03 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 16,351.58. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 35.01 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,948.86.In August, manufacturing payrolls increased 7,000 after growing by only 1,000 in July, the ADP report showed. The construction industry added 17,000 jobs in August on top of 15,000 jobs in July. Service industry employment increased by 173,000 jobs in August after a gain of 170,000 in July.Separately, the Fed survey of economic conditions known as the Beige Book showed that the economy continued to expand from July to mid-August, though some manufacturing companies said that slower growth in China was having a modest effect on activity.“Outside of manufacturing, the domestic activity data is very strong,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. “But Fed officials are clearly worried about an economic slowdown in China, commodity prices are lower, and there is little evidence of any marked pickup in either wage growth or core inflation.”In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity increased at its strongest pace in a year and a half in the second quarter, keeping wage inflation subdued for now.The government revised productivity to show it rising at a 3.3 percent annual rate, the quickest since the fourth quarter of 2013, instead of the 1.3 percent pace reported last month.But the trend in productivity remains weak. Productivity rose 0.7 percent from a year ago instead of the 0.3 percent increase reported last month.Growth in productivity is an important determinant of the economy’s noninflationary speed limit. Though the second-quarter bounce back is damping wage pressure for now, the weak trend in productivity suggests the economy’s growth potential could be lower than the 1.5 to 2 percent pace that economists have been estimating.That would imply the spare capacity in the economy is being squeezed out more quickly than thought and that inflationary pressures may take hold a bit faster than had been anticipated.Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, fell at a 1.4 percent rate in the second quarter, rather than increasing at a 0.5 percent rate as was previously reported. Unit labor costs rose 1.7 percent compared with the second quarter of 2014.A fourth report, from the Commerce Department, showed new orders for United States factory goods rose for a second straight month in July on strong demand for automobiles, which could help keep manufacturing supported as it deals with the buoyant dollar and softening global demand.Advertisement
