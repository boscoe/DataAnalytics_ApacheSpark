He was flanked by two crashed vehicles and four of the new, more humanlike dummies.“We ultimately want to eliminate crashes altogether,” he said.The rating system, with origins that date from 1978, allows the agency to award as many as five stars to vehicles based on crash protection and rollover safety. Ratings can be a powerful government seal of approval for automakers, which have used them in advertising.The system came under fire last year after a New York Times  investigation revealed that in recent years nearly all vehicles were awarded four or five stars.The investigation found that, for models from 2011 through 2015, 92 percent of the overall safety ratings were four or five stars. And notably, the percentage of four- and five-star overall ratings increased each year, from 83 percent for 2011 models to 96 percent for 2015 models, even though the standards had ostensibly been toughened in 2011.In the case of Chevrolet, six of the eight cars it had trumpeted as having five stars in early 2014 — more than any other brand, it said — would later be recalled for various safety defects, some more than once.The day after The Times article was published, lawmakers criticized the agency and its acting administrator at the time, David J. Friedman, over the rating program at a hearing held by a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. “You see five stars. You think that is the Good Housekeeping seal of approval,” Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said at the hearing. “The consumer is misled.”During the hearing, Mr. Friedman defended the five-star system and objected to the article, but acknowledged that officials at the agency had talked internally about how to make it clearer to consumers that vehicles rated under the program could be recalled.Now, safety regulators are taking a different view.Mark R. Rosekind, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that achieving a five-star rating would be tougher than ever.The agency said it had been considering changes to the program for nearly a year. Mr. Rosekind took over as the agency’s administrator last December.The agency will also add half-star ratings to give consumers more discriminating information about vehicle performance.Recalls on cars would not affect their ratings under the new plan, but the agency noted that consumers who search for ratings on safercar.gov can already see recalls, consumer complaints, investigations and technical bulletins for each model.The agency said that it would add a new crash test to measure how well vehicles protect passengers in an angled crash from the front. In its 195-page plan detailing the changes, the agency said this crash type continues to “result in deaths and serious injuries despite the use of seatbelts, airbags, and the crash-worthy structures of late-model vehicles.”A pedestrian rating will be based on tests that determine how well cars minimize injuries and fatalities to pedestrians. In 2013, the most recent year for which complete information is available, 4,735 pedestrians were killed in traffic-related crashes, according to the agency.A rating for crash avoidance will be based on whether a car has one or more technological systems, including, for example, systems to prevent rear-end crashes, improve night visibility and detect blind spots. In September, 10 automakers pledged to make automated braking systems, which use sensors to detect potential collisions, standard equipment on vehicles, though they did not say when.Congress recently passed a transportation bill requiring crash avoidance information to be included on new vehicle window stickers — just as the government fuel economy ratings are. The measures won broad support from lawmakers, safety specialists and automakers.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, applauded the regulators’ move to include crash avoidance technology in its rating system.“This update is a win both for consumers and innovators — highlighting a vehicle’s advanced safety systems will allow consumers to make informed purchasing decisions, and in turn spur greater use of these potentially lifesaving technologies,” he said in a statement.John O’Dell, a senior editor and vehicle safety specialist at Edmunds.com, a car shopping and research website, said the new measures were overdue.“This is a big step and it is a needed step,” he said, adding that the changes indicated auto safety regulation was being taken more seriously than in the past.Mr. O’Dell said that automakers had over the years become savvy about the safety regulator’s requirements and had learned to design their cars to do well in the ratings. He added that this would still happen, but it would take a while for car manufacturers to adapt. And, in the meantime, vehicles may become safer in the areas where the agency bolsters the tests.The Auto Alliance, a trade group representing automakers, said it welcomed the agency’s embrace of new safety technologies. “We will provide constructive comments on the agency’s proposal” as more evaluations and data become available, it said in a statement.Ron Nixon reported from Washington, and Danielle Ivory from New York.Advertisement
