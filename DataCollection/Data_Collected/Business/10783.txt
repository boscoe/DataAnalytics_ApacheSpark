Investors will need to wait until Tuesday to see if the Dow Jones industrial average reaches 20,000 for the first time — a nice, round, psychologically satisfying number that nevertheless represents only 30 companies and has been heavily affected by the performance of Goldman Sachs. At the close on Friday, the Dow achieved no zeros whatsoever, making it to 19,933.81. With that number, it tallied a year-to-date gain of 14.4 percent. Four more days remain for 2016 to claim the 20,000 milestone — otherwise, assuming it comes to pass, it will be officially credited to 2017. Phyllis Korkki__________U.S. ECONOMYThe Conference Board will release its December consumer confidence report on Tuesday. After a slump in October, the index achieved pre-recession levels in November, with survey respondents expressing optimism about the economy. Last month, the percentage who said they thought that business conditions were “good” rose to 29.2 percent, from 26.5 percent in October. This month’s report will include the effects of the presidential election, as most consumers last month were surveyed before Nov. 8.  Zach Wichter__________JAPANThe Bank of Japan on Thursday will release minutes from its meeting last week that should shed light on how the country’s central bank is handling the prospect of rising interest rates. Given statements from the Federal Reserve and the proposed plans of President-elect Donald J. Trump to increase infrastructure spending, interest rates in the United States are almost certain to rise. That will put pressure on the Bank of Japan to relax its support for low and even negative interest rates — a key part of the country’s efforts to jolt its economy out of its doldrums. Carlos Tejada__________GERMANYOn Saturday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany will deliver her traditional New Year’s speech. Once regarded as a somewhat tedious ritual, the event has taken on more significance because of the rise of the right in the past two years and an influx of migrants. In her last New Year’s address, Ms. Merkel argued that refugees were good for the economy. But that may be a harder sell this year, as she faces criticism that her refugee policy has allowed terrorists to enter Germany undetected. Jack EwingAdvertisement
