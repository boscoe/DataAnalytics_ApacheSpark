LONDON — Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, a maker of drugs and medical devices, said on Monday that it had agreed to buy Therakos from the American private equity firm Gores Group for about $1.33 billion.The deal for Therakos, a maker of immunotherapy treatment devices, is expected to broaden Mallinckrodt’s specialty segment and to expand its business in hospitals, giving it a larger presence in pain management and critical-care respiratory therapies in neonatal intensive care units.Therakos is the maker of the Cellex treatment system, which provides immune cell therapies using a process known as extracorporeal photopheresis.The company’s flagship device is approved in the United States for use in the treatment of a blood cancer that affects the skin for patients who have not been responsive to other forms of treatment. It is being used by physicians abroad for the treatment of other conditions, including Crohn’s disease.AdvertisementThe Gores Group, based in Los Angeles, acquired Therakos from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, a former unit of Johnson & Johnson, for an undisclosed amount in December 2012. The acquisition of Therakos is the latest in a deal-making binge by Mallinckrodt.AdvertisementLast year, Mallinckrodt acquired Cadence, a biopharmaceutical company in San Diego, for $1.3 billion and bought Questcor Pharmaceuticals, which is based in Anaheim, Calif., for $5.6 billion. It also acquired Ikaria, a maker of treatments for critically ill infants, for $2.3 billion in March.Mallinckrodt is under a bit of pressure because the growth of its biggest product, HP Acthar Gel, seems to be slowing, only a year after Mallinckrodt obtained the ultraexpensive, immune-modulating drug in its acquisition of Questcor. Shares of Mallinckrodt fell last week after the company lowered sales expectations for Acthar in announcing quarterly earnings.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Gores, the chairman and chief of the Gores Group.Mallinckrodt, which has executive offices in Chesterfield, England, manufactures drugs and medical imaging equipment, including therapies for autoimmune and rare diseases. The company posted net sales of $2.54 billion in 2014 and has its United States headquarters in St. Louis.An article on Tuesday about Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of Therakos, a maker of immunotherapy treatment devices, misidentified the ailment that Therakos’s flagship device treats. It is a blood cancer that affects the skin, not skin cancer.Andrew Pollack contributed reporting from New York.A version of this article appears in print on August 11, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Drug Company Buys Medical Device Maker.
