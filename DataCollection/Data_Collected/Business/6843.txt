Greenberg continues to hold a stake in the American International Group, said on Tuesday that despite persuading a judge that the government overstepped its bounds in its 2008 bailout of A.I.G., it planned to appeal his decision not to award any monetary damages. Judge Thomas C. Wheeler of the United States Court of Federal Claims found on Monday that the Federal Reserve acted illegally when it demanded a 79.9 percent equity stake in A.I.G. as a condition of the bailout. But he also found that A.I.G. shareholders had not been damaged and had in fact been saved from bankruptcy. While Mr. Greenberg, the former A.I.G. chief executive, had been demanding as much as $40 billion on behalf of shareholders, Judge Wheeler awarded nothing. “We respectfully disagree with the trial court’s legal conclusion that, under applicable appellate cases, there is no remedy for the government’s illegal conduct,” Starr said in a statement on Tuesday.Starr said that the Fed’s illegal conduct had improperly enriched the government by more than $23 billion at the expense of shareholders. “Plaintiffs will appeal the ruling that there is no remedy for the government’s illegal conduct and ask the court of appeals to confirm that the government is not entitled to keep billions of dollars of citizens’ money in its pocket,” Starr said in the statement.Advertisement
