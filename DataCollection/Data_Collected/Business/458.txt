Raj Rajaratnam, who is serving 11 years in prison for insider trading, and his hedge fund, the Galleon Group, have been sued by his younger brother for $13.5 million, a sum the brother says he is owed in unpaid commissions and legal costs. The brother, Rengan Rajaratnam, who in 2014 was cleared of criminal insider trading charges after his older brother’s 2011 conviction, filed the lawsuit on Wednesday in New York state court. In the suit, Rengan Rajaratnam, 45, said Galleon failed to pay him $8.3 million on profits of $83 million that he made as a portfolio manager, and up to $1 million for stock recommendations. Lawyers for Raj Rajaratnam, 58, and Galleon did not respond to requests for comment.A version of this brief appears in print on October 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Founder of Galleon Group Is Sued by Younger Brother.
