LONDON – Banco Santander of Spain reported on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 69 percent as it continued to benefit from a decline in provisions for bad loans.For the three months that ended Dec. 31, Santander said profit rose to 1.46 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, from €864 million in the same period a year earlier. That was slightly below analysts’ expectations, according to Reuters.The company’s fourth-quarter results for 2013 were restated to reflect several accounting changes, including in how it recognizes contributions to deposit guarantee programs in Spain and in Britain.Santander, one of Europe’s largest banks, wrote down billions of euros in mortgages in 2013 amid a weak economy in Spain, its home market, but saw its provisions for bad loans improve over the course of last year.In the fourth quarter, provisions for delinquent and defaulted loans fell nearly 12 percent, to €2.45 billion, from the period a year earlier.The quarter marked a positive start for Ana Patricia Botín, a longtime Santander executive who was named executive chairwoman in September after her father, Emilio Botín, died of a heart attack at the age of 79. Mr. Botín ran the bank for three decades.Since taking the reins, Ms. Botín has replaced the bank’s chief executive and dramatically reshaped its board of directors. The bank also boosted its capital in January by €7.5 billion and cut its dividend sharply in order to ease investor concerns about the strength of its balance sheet.For the full year, Santander said its profit rose 39 percent to €5.82 billion.Net interest income, or what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, rose nearly 12 percent, to €7.71 billion in the fourth quarter, from €6.93 billion in the period a year earlier.Santander’s nonperforming loan rate was 5.19 percent in the fourth quarter, about 0.09 of a percentage point lower than in the third quarter.Operating expenses rose 3 percent, to €5.22 billion in the fourth quarter.Santander’s full-year earnings in Spain nearly tripled to €1.12 billion, up from €466 million in 2013, as economic conditions improved and provisions for bad loans continued to decline. For the fourth quarter, Santander posted profit of €299 million in its Spanish operations.In Britain, the bank’s profit rose 37 percent, to €1.58 billion in 2014, up from €1.15 billion in 2013. In the fourth quarter, the bank posted a profit of €391 million in its British business.In Santander’s operations in Latin America, profit declined to €3.15 billion for the full year, down from €3.18 billion in 2013. In the fourth quarter, Santander posted a profit of €853 million in its Latin American business.The bank’s fully loaded Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of its ability to weather financial disturbances, rose to 9.7 percent at the end of December from 8.3 percent at the end of the third quarter.
