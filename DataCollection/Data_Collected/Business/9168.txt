Another decline for raw-material producers and oil companies tugged the stock market to a slight loss on Wednesday as concerns grew about global economic growth.Dow Chemical and Chevron each lost 2 percent.The news Wednesday was hardly encouraging. A private measure of manufacturing in China hit its lowest level in six years, a result of weaker factory production, new orders and hiring.That, along with plunging oil prices, could have led to a much bigger sell-off, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. But that is hardly encouraging for investors looking for a signal that the worst is over. The market has finished lower in four of the last five days.
