His trades are being wound down and liquidated, she added.Mr. Kaufman ran a portfolio for investors that placed bets on currencies, interest rates and sovereign bonds around the world. Those trades included complex and nuanced wagers on the direction of interest rates. He also oversaw a team of 18 managers within the Global Fixed Income Fund, which manages $4 billion.When the market turned against Mr. Kaufman’s trades last year, there was little he could do to stanch the losses, said a person briefed on the investments but not permitted to speak publicly. Over all, the fund gained 0.75 percent in 2014, the person said.Citadel’s two flagship funds, Kensington and Wellington, gained 18 percent in 2014, the person added. The two funds, which use a multistrategy approach, have a combined $16 billion of assets under management.Hedge fund managers who use global macro strategies try to exploit the market effects of unexpected economic news and central bank moves.Citadel hired Mr. Kaufman from JPMorgan Chase in 2008. He worked at JPMorgan for 11 years, according to his LinkedIn profile. A small team of senior managers who worked under Mr. Kaufman will now report to Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire founder of Citadel. This year, Citadel hired two directors away from Goldman Sachs to work within the Global Fixed Income Fund.Separately, Citadel announced on Thursday that it had hired Ben S. Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, as a senior adviser.Mr. Kaufman’s departure from Citadel was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.Advertisement
