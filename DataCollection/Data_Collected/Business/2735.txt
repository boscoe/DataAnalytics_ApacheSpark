Express had a market capitalization of about $1.2 billion as of Friday.Sycamore, which opened its doors in 2011, quickly made a name for itself in fashion, with deals to buy the womenâ€™s wear chain Talbots for about $400 million and the retailer Hot Topic for about $600 million. It later acquired the Jones Group, whose brands include Nine West and Anne Klein, in a deal worth $2.2 billion.The firm said last year that it paid $106.2 million to buy its stake in Express. The retailer, a former division of Limited Brands, had been experiencing declining profit.After ending its buyout effort, Sycamore said it was now bound by disclosure restrictions until June 15.A version of this article appears in print on 01/21/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Ending its Pursuit.
