KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, which fired its chief executive Martin Shkreli this month after he was arrested in connection with charges of securities fraud, said it had requested an appeal of Nasdaq’s decision to delist its shares. The embattled drug maker said last week that it had been notified by Nasdaq that its stock would be delisted using the exchange operator’s “discretionary” authority. A hearing on the appeal has been scheduled for Feb. 25, the company said on Tuesday. Mr. Shkreli gained notoriety after raising the price of a drug used to treat a dangerous parasitic infection when he was the chief of the privately held Turing Pharmaceuticals. He stepped down as Turing’s chief on Dec. 18. KaloBios named Mr. Shkreli as its chief on Nov. 20, after he and a consortium of investors bought a 70 percent stake in the company. Shares of KaloBios have not traded since Thursday.A version of this brief appears in print on December 30, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: With Shkreli Out, Kalobios Asks for Appeal of Delisting.
