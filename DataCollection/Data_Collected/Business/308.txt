The stock market closed out its best week this year with a modest gain on Friday, helped by airlines and industrial companies.Investors now turn their focus to corporate earnings, which will start to pick up next week.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,084.49. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.46 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,014.89; and the Nasdaq rose 19.68 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,830.47.The S.&P. 500 ended the week up 3.3 percent, its best week since mid-December. Global markets also had a strong week, with markets in Germany and France rising more than 5 percent. In Asia, markets in Japan, China and Hong Kong are up roughly 4 percent each.Most of the gains this week came immediately after the release of last week’s disappointing jobs report, which sent a signal to investors that the Federal Reserve would hold off on raising interest rates at least for several more months.AdvertisementThat signal was reinforced on Thursday, when the minutes from the September Fed meeting showed that policy makers were too concerned about low inflation and the slowdown in China to raise interest rates.“In short, we found little to change our view that the first Fed hike will not occur in 2015,” Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of fixed-income at Barclays, wrote in a report, and the “market has reached the same conclusion.”AdvertisementOne sector that did push higher was airlines. The companies said they flew nearly full flights last month, an important profit driver for the industry. United Continental flew flights on average 82.9 percent full; American Airlines reported its flights were 82.7 percent full.United Continental rose 6.6 percent, American rose 6.7 percent, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines added 3 percent each.Shares in the commodities group Glencore rose strongly after the company said it was slashing its zinc production by a third and cutting jobs in response to a sharp fall in the price of the metal.The move, which will involve a cut in annual zinc production by 500,000 tons in Australia, South America and Kazakhstan, is the latest response by the Switzerland-based company to the slide in commodity prices that has raised concerns over Glencore’s underlying business model.Investors responded positively and Glencore shares closed up 7 percent in London at 129 pence.One industrial company that did not do well was Alcoa, the aluminum company, which fell 75 cents, or 7 percent, to $10.26. The company reported a steep drop in profits for its third quarter, citing lower aluminum prices and a strong dollar.
