As a debate swirls over whether a widely used guardrail system is safe, more than 30 states have been waiting for the results of crash tests before deciding whether to continue to use the guardrails or, possibly, have them removed.Now those tests have been completed by the manufacturer, Trinity Industries. Some earlier tests were described by federal officials as unremarkable, but the eighth and final test, conducted on Tuesday, appeared to be different. While federal officials would not draw conclusions until a full analysis is completed, a review of the test video shows that there may have been more extensive damage to the car than in earlier tests. One guardrail safety expert said that the test suggested the system posed a risk to a car’s occupants.The Federal Highway Administration ordered in October that crash tests be conducted after a federal whistle-blower case found that Trinity had defrauded the government by not informing the agency of design changes it made to the guardrails in 2005. The guardrail system, called the ET-Plus, may jam when hit from the front, causing the metal rail to spear the passenger compartment instead of snaking away from the vehicle.In Tuesday’s test outside San Antonio, a 1998 Geo Metro traveling about 60 miles an hour was driven into an ET-Plus guardrail. The car spun out, and the driver’s-side door struck a bent piece of the metal guardrail, according to video of the test shot from a San Antonio news station’s helicopter.AdvertisementThere appeared to be substantial damage to the driver’s-side door, which collapsed inward and, in the aftermath, hung open, revealing the test dummy. There was also damage to the front of the car.AdvertisementFederal officials said that they needed to analyze the results of the test before drawing any conclusions, and that could take several weeks.
            A sequence from video footage of a crash test in San Antonio in January, in which a compact car collided with a Trinity ET-Plus guardrail head. The car spins out and the metal guardrail bends to form a sharp “elbow,” which the vehicle then strikes on the driver’s side.        But Dean Sicking, a guardrail expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who participated in the recent federal fraud case against Trinity, said after viewing the video that the guardrail had “clearly failed” the crash test. The damage to the door, he said, indicated that the guardrail would have posed a serious injury risk to the occupants of the vehicle.“When you take an elbow into the door at the speeds this is at, it’s a no-brainer — it’s a failure,” said Mr. Sicking, who has been critical of the ET-Plus.More than 30 states have banned the ET-Plus and Trinity has halted sales pending the outcome of the tests. Federal officials estimate that 200,000 of the guardrails have been installed nationwide.Jeff Eller, a spokesman for Trinity, said in a statement that “until all the data is completely analyzed, it would not be appropriate to comment or speculate on individual aspects of any test.”Federal officials said they believed that the guardrail did not penetrate the vehicle. Still, the large dent in the driver’s side door may raise concerns since the federal testing guidelines say that “deformations of, or intrusions into, the occupant compartment that could cause serious injuries should not be permitted” and that fragments or other debris from the device should not “show potential for penetrating the occupant compartment.” Mr. Sicking said that in his view such potential was evident in the video.Jane Mellow, a spokeswoman for the Federal Highway Administration, said the agency would not disclose details from the test, but it would evaluate the data.A 1999 crash test video by the Texas Transportation Institute shows how rail heads, or end terminals, are meant to push guardrails away from a car on impact“Although we don’t consider today’s test to be unremarkable, we have not reached a conclusion on the extent of the damage to the driver-side door,” Ms. Mellow said on Tuesday.AdvertisementShe said that the agency “will need to review the data once it arrives in order to make a judgment on the performance of the device.”The agency has not set a date when its full analysis will be completed, and it has not ruled out further testing or other requirements.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At one point in 2012, agency officials drafted a letter asking the manufacturer to conduct additional testing, but the letter was never sent. Though the federal whistle-blower lawsuit was filed on the agency’s behalf, it chose not to participate.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, has criticized the federal highway agency’s testing methods as too favorable to Trinity, a contention the agency disputes. After viewing video of the final test, Mr. Blumenthal said on Friday that the outcome was “very disturbing.”Mr. Sicking and Trinity have questioned each other’s motives since the federally mandated crash testing has begun. Mr. Sicking previously worked with Trinity to develop the predecessor to the ET-Plus and earned millions of dollars in royalties from the work. .Mr. Sicking worked as a paid consultant for the plaintiff in the federal whistle-blower lawsuit against Trinity that went to trial, twice, last year. The first trial ended in a mistrial in part over allegations that a Trinity executive had threatened Mr. Sicking if he cooperated with the plaintiffs. Trinity has denied the allegations.A version of this article appears in print on January 31, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Assessment of Guardrails May Hinge on Final Test.
