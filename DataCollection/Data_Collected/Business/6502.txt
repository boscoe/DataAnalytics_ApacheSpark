Walmart said on Tuesday that it would raise the starting wage for more than 100,000 managers in the United States, the second time this year the retail giant has announced wage increases for its store workers.Starting in August, managers of store departments that are more complicated to run, like electronics, will receive at least $13 an hour and as much as $24.70 an hour, compared to a previous range of $10.30 to $20.09 an hour. In February, the minimum for these managers will reach $15 an hour, according to a Walmart spokesman, Kory Lundberg.Managers of departments that are less complex, like consumer products, will be paid at least $10.90 an hour and as much as $20.71 an hour, compared to $9.90 to $19.31 previously.Walmart, the nation’s largest private sector employer with about 1.3 million workers in the United States, has long been under pressure from labor groups to increase the pay and benefits for its lowest-paid wage workers.AdvertisementIn February, Walmart said that it would increase wages for a half-million entry-level store workers to at least $9 an hour by April and at least $10 by next February.The retailer said at the time that it would also raise wages for its store managers. The Associated Press first reported on the details of the managers’ wage increases early Tuesday.AdvertisementWalmart has said it is spending $1 billion to raise wages, offer its employees better training and make work schedules more flexible yet predictable. The company says it is taking these steps in the hopes of reducing staff turnover, improving customer service and reviving sales that have slowed at its 4,540 stores in the face of intense competition from online retailers like Amazon.A version of this article appears in print on June 3, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Walmart to Raise Starting Pay for Some Managers.
