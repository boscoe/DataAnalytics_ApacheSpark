AdvertisementSupported byBy Daniel VictorAndrew Sullivan, a pioneer in political commentary during the early days of blogging but an infrequently heard voice in the current election cycle, has joined New York Magazine as a contributing editor.Mr. Sullivan will write features on “politics and the larger culture,” the magazine said. He will also blog about the Democratic and Republican national conventions, but will otherwise focus on long-form journalism, he said on Facebook. His new role began on Friday.His personal blog, The Daily Dish, was published at a prolific rate beginning in 2000 and was later hosted by Time magazine, The Atlantic and The Daily Beast before he started his own subscription-only version. He retired from blogging in 2015, saying he was “saturated in digital life.”“The year off was revelatory,” he wrote Friday on Facebook. “It’s only when you stop being pathologically attached to each ripple in the web-stream that you see most clearly how ephemeral so much of it is, how emotionally and nervously draining it can be and how our discourse can be fatally distorted as well as deeply informed by the onslaught of the social web.”Mr. Sullivan said on Facebook that he had begun working on an essay about Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner in the 2016 presidential race.He hasn’t tweeted since 2014 and stuck to his intention to stop blogging with one exception: a reflection on the Supreme Court’s ruling in June on same-sex marriage.“I just had to write today,” he told The New York Times that day in an interview.In a statement, New York Magazine’s editor in chief, Adam Moss, called Mr. Sullivan “a true innovator — one of the first and best political writers online.”“Since he stepped away from his blog in 2015, his voice has been greatly missed in our national dialogue,” Mr. Moss said. “I’m grateful that he will return to writing at New York.”Advertisement
