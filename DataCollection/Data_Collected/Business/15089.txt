WASHINGTON — Teva Pharmaceutical Industries won United States antitrust approval to purchase Allergan’s generics business after agreeing to sell 79 generic drugs to rival firms, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.The $40.5 billion deal, which was announced in July 2015, solidifies Teva’s position as the world’s largest maker of generics while freeing Allergan to focus on branded drugs.Teva will sell rights and assets related to the 79 pharmaceutical products to 11 firms, which the Federal Trade Commission said would be the largest drug divestiture order in a pharmaceutical merger case.There has been a wave of deals in the health care sector since early 2014. Generics, or drugs whose patents have expired and typically retail at cheaper prices, have made headlines over the last year as some drug makers sharply raised prices on medications with few competitors.Debbie Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission’s Bureau of Competition, said in a statement that the settlement “safeguards the competitive availability of these medications for patients across the country who depend on them.”The acquirers of the divested drugs are Mayne Pharma Group, Impax Laboratories, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Cipla, Zydus Worldwide, Mikah Pharma, Perrigo Pharma International, Aurobindo Pharma, Prasco, and 3M, according to the Federal Trade Commission.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
