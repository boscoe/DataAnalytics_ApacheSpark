WikiLeaks said it was justified in posting the material because it chronicles the inner workings of an international corporation with extensive business and government connections.Mr. Boies had warned news organizations about possessing or reproducing the stolen material; but he appears so far not to have filed lawsuits against those who ignored his warnings.In his new letter, Mr. Boies cited federal copyright and computer fraud laws in warning against use of the material, now posted by WikiLeaks. “Many other countries have similar, if not more stringent, laws applicable to this situation,” the letter added.Since the WikiLeaks post, Gawker, The Wrap and others have posted accounts of material freshly culled from the Sony files.Advertisement
