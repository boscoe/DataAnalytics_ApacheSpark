AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedValueAct Capital Management, a prominent activist hedge fund, has taken a significant stake in American Express, which is grappling with a number of recent challenges.Should ValueAct press forward with an activist campaign, American Express would be its latest prominent target. ValueAct has pressed for change at Microsoft, among others, in recent years.Shares of American Express jumped more than 6 percent after Bloomberg News reported that the hedge fund had assembled a position worth about $1 billion. While a significant amount, that holding would still rank the activist investor below American Express’s top 10 shareholders.Over the last year, American Express has faced several setbacks, including revenue that has fallen short of analysts’ expectations and the loss of a longstanding partnership with Costco.The credit card company was also forced to rearrange its leadership after the death of Edward P. Gilligan, its president and heir apparent, in late May.“ValueAct is a well-respected firm,” Marina Norville, a spokeswoman for American Express, said in a statement. “We have been speaking with them, as we do with other investors, and look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue. At American Express, we are focused on building long-term value for shareholders, and are always open to the views and perspectives of our investors.”A representative for ValueAct was not immediately available for comment.Advertisement
