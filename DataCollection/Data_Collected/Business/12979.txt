Andrew Caspersen violated a circle of trust that included colleagues, a Princeton classmate and even his wealthy family when he raised tens of millions of dollars for what authorities have called a fraudulent investment scheme that has rattled Wall Street.Among the victims to emerge from Mr. Caspersen’s alleged scheme are members of his own family, who invested more than $3 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Another was a college classmate, James McIntyre, an executive at the hedge fund Moore Capital, who personally invested $400,000. Mr. McIntyre then recommended that a charitable trust affiliated with Moore Capital put in $25 million of its money.A former Blackstone Group managing director, Mr. Caspersen was well respected on Wall Street. He came from a world of privilege, attending Groton, Princeton and then Harvard Law School — credentials that allowed him to move easily within the world of high finance.AdvertisementMr. Caspersen’s charmed life was thrown into turmoil on the afternoon of March 26, when he, his wife, their two young children and his in-laws were returning from a vacation in Florida.AdvertisementWaiting for Mr. Caspersen, 39, at La Guardia Airport were federal agents with an arrest warrant.Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged him in a criminal complaint with securities and wire fraud in what they called a “brazen” scheme to defraud investors of up to $95 million.Mr. Caspersen’s circle extended beyond the corridors of Wall Street. Even Kimba M. Wood, the federal judge initially assigned to a related civil fraud lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Mr. Caspersen, has had to recuse herself from the litigation because of unspecified family connections to the former Wall Street executive.Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bacon to promote conservation — on losing options in a personal brokerage account.But the authorities also said that in November, Mr. Caspersen used some of the money to cover his tracks after making separate unauthorized wire transfers of $8.1 million and $770,000.Mr. Caspersen worked as a partner at Park Hill Group, a division of PJT Partners, until he was fired last week. It was there that he was said to be able to exploit a client billing system that allowed him to siphon money into his own personal account.These transfers represent fees paid by two clients of Park Hill that Mr. Caspersen had diverted to a bank account that he controlled instead of having that money sent to Park Hill, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation. The invoices that the clients received had indicated that the money was being directed to what appeared to be a bank account held by Park Hill.AdvertisementMr. Caspersen, however, had taken advantage of the firm’s payment process that allowed him to personally send out invoices to clients, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation.The Park Hill clients were unaware of what Mr. Caspersen did and his employers learned of the improper wire transfers only about a week before his arrest because they appeared legitimate.No client money went missing and it was not clear what Mr. Caspersen may have done with the money that was misdirected to the bank accounts he controlled.
                The S.E.C. said that Andrew Caspersen, a partner at Park Hill, solicited $95 million to invest in a shell company.            It could not be determined when Mr. Caspersen sent the invoices to his clients.Park Hill is now reviewing its procedures that allow some executives to send invoices directly to clients, said the person with direct knowledge of the situation. The person added that Mr. Caspersen took advantage of the firm’s policies that were intended to foster a close relationship between clients and the executives working on their business matters.Park Hill, which said last week that it was “stunned” to discover the charges, is cooperating with the authorities. The firm held off on terminating Mr. Caspersen until he was arrested, at request of the authorities.Much remains unknown about Mr. Caspersen’s possible motivation and the details of his scheme, which the authorities said began in July, when he incorporated an investment vehicle called Irving Place III SPV L.L.C. in Delaware.The Irving Place investment vehicle had a name similar to a legitimate investment vehicle that Park Hill and Mr. Caspersen had raised several hundreds of millions dollars for last year — a confusing situation that he exploited when approaching friends and family for money.The unauthorized wire transfers suggest that Mr. Caspersen had incurred money woes, even though his family’s wealth was considerable and both he and his wife had well-paying jobs.AdvertisementLast year, Mr. Caspersen earned a $3.68 million salary from Park Hill. His wife, Christina, also a Princeton graduate, is an investor relations representative for Anheuser-Busch InBev. Earlier this year, she went on an extended leave of absence from the brewing behemoth, before her husband’s arrest.The couple bought a multimillion-dollar home in Bronxville, N.Y., in 2015, not far from his in-laws’ home. They also own a co-op apartment in Manhattan.A review of court documents does not reveal any outstanding judgments or liens against Mr. Caspersen or his known assets.A child of privilege, Mr. Caspersen was a beneficiary of family trusts and businesses that his father, Finn M. W. Caspersen, a noted financier and philanthropist, left behind.The elder Mr. Caspersen was chairman and chief executive of Beneficial Corporation, a consumer finance company, for nearly two decades before selling it for $8.6 billion to Household International.Mr. Caspersen’s father killed himself in 2009 at the age of 67; he was at the time suffering from kidney cancer. A year before his death, he pledged $30 million to Harvard Law School, which later named its student center in the family’s honor. Mr. Caspersen and all four of his sons, including Andrew, also graduated from Harvard Law.Soon after Mr. Caspersen’s death, The New York Times and other news organizations reported that his name had surfaced in connection with a federal investigation into the misuse of offshore bank accounts to avoid taxes. The Internal Revenue Service began an audit of some of offshore accounts tied to his name.But neither Mr. Caspersen nor any of his family members were charged by federal authorities with wrongdoing. Last year, a tax lawyer retained by the Caspersen family conducted a review of the I.R.S. audit and said in a letter, which was reviewed by The Times, that the investigation was completed in 2013 and did not impose any penalties for failing to report holdings in a foreign bank account.AdvertisementA representative for the Caspersen family provided a copy of the letter to dispel any impression that the elder Caspersen had killed himself under a cloud of suspicion.The letter said the I.R.S. reviewed tax filings by Mr. Caspersen and his wife, Barbara, for a five-year period beginning in 2005. The only blemish tax officials found was an underpayment of taxes in 2008 for which the I.R.S. assessed a penalty of nearly $14,000 that was paid by Mr. Caspersen’s estate.Like their father, all of Mr. Caspersen’s sons, including Andrew, the youngest, pursued careers in finance. Finn Jr. is the chief operating officer and general counsel of Peapack-Gladstone Bank in New Jersey and Erik Caspersen is a former executive with Polygon Investment Partners. Sam, a former Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer, is now a managing director of Brock Capital Group, a boutique investment bank.A version of this article appears in print on April 6, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Family’s Charmed Life Is Thrown Into Turmoil.
