A number above 50 signals that the economy is continuing to expand, while a figure below that suggests contraction.Intriguingly, the report also suggested that hiring was picking up, which would be a welcome development in a region weighed down by unemployment that has hovered at or above 11 percent for more than three years. Still, the Markit data have previously suggested budding growth in the labor market that has failed to cut into the jobless rate.Low oil prices, a weak euro and monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank have recently helped lift the eurozone above the feeble growth it had been experiencing since emerging from recession in early 2013.In fact, a report last week showed that the bloc’s economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2015, sharply outpacing the 0.2 percent growth in the United States in the same period.Chris Williamson, Markit’s chief economist, said the data so far this year pointed to 2 percent growth in the eurozone economy in 2015, the fastest since 2010. But that forecast might have to be revised downward, he added, unless business orders, which have lost momentum in recent months, begin to pick up.The purchasing manager indexes do not correlate perfectly with official data, but they are welcomed by economists as a snap preview; the official reports compiled by Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, tend to lag.Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, said in a research note that the data reinforced his opinion that the eurozone remained “fragile.”“Nearly 40 percent of the eurozone economy still remains in a dire state,” he wrote, pointing to the weak pace of growth in France and Italy. “The recovery in the eurozone as a whole can best be described as sluggish and hesitant.”Advertisement
