FRANKFURT — Greece on Tuesday added its name to a roster that includes some of the world’s poorest and worst governed nations, including Iraq, Sudan, Somalia and Zimbabwe.Those are a few of the countries that have missed payments to the International Monetary Fund — as Greece did Tuesday, when it failed to make a loan payment of about 1.5 billion euros, or $1.7 billion, to the fund.The International Monetary Fund does not use the term default. It instead places countries that miss their payments in so-called arrears. But the failure by Greece to meet its obligation to the fund will prompt other lenders to conclude that Greece has defaulted.Those lenders include bond holders and the European Central Bank, which now may be less willing to continue emergency loans that have been propping up Greek banks for the past several months. .AdvertisementCredit rating agencies will not consider Greece to be in default based on missing the I.M.F. payment, for the technical reason that the I.M.F. is not considered a commercial borrower.AdvertisementBut the ratings agency Standard & Poor’s said in a statement Tuesday that it would designate Greece as being in default if the country cannot make payments to private creditors, like €2 billion in Greek Treasury bills that are due on July 10.And once found in arrears, Greece is barred from receiving any more money from the I.M.F. until it settles the debt. That is a big problem, because the I.M.F. has been a crucial partner with the European Union in dealing with Greece, providing not only money but financial and economic expertise.The I.M.F. confirmed that Greece had failed to make the payment, after a 6 p.m. Washington deadline came and went.“We have informed our executive board that Greece is now in arrears and can only receive I.M.F. financing once the arrears are cleared,” said Gerry Rice, a spokesman for the fund. Mr. Rice said the I.M.F. board would consider Greece’s request, made Tuesday, to extend the loan payment deadline.The development came as, separately, Greece’s European creditors rejected an eleventh-hour attempt by Athens to extend the country’s international bailout program.
                European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.            It is the clearest signal yet of the political and financial dysfunction in Greece, which on Sunday announced that it would close its banks for at least a week to prevent panicked depositors from withdrawing their money.Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said delinquency would put Greece in ignoble company.Advertisement“They are joining countries we would normally regard as failed and failing states,” Mr. Kirkegaard said. “The symbolism is quite dramatic.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And the missed payment is the largest in fund’s history. Sudan still owes about $1.4 billion from loans acquired in the 1980s, according to the fund.Countries that have fallen behind more recently include Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan. All three later settled their obligations to the fund.The European Central Bank, which has kept Greek banks on life support during the debt negotiations, is allowed to finance only solvent banks. Because Greece’s banks and the government are tightly linked, it would be hard to consider Greek banks solvent when their government is not paying its bills — which is perhaps the biggest implication of the missed I.M.F. payment.A last-minute bailout proposal that the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made on Tuesday to its European creditors was said to exclude the I.M.F.’s involvement.But as Mr. Kirkegaard pointed out, countries like Germany are unlikely to approve more aid for Greece without I.M.F. participation.By stiffing the I.M.F., Greece is also challenging the fund’s status as the most preferred lender — a hierarchy of creditors in which private bondholders should theoretically lose their money before the I.M.F. does. But because Greece is in no position to pay any of its major creditors, the order may not matter much.According to Greece’s agreements with other eurozone countries, failure to pay the I.M.F. will also allow members of the currency bloc to demand faster repayment of the €131 billion they lent to Greece.The other eurozone creditors would probably not take that step immediately, analysts said. But failure to make the I.M.F. payment will oblige Klaus P. Regling, chief executive of the eurozone’s bailout fund, to advise the eurozone countries of their options, according to people familiar with the way that fund is managed.Greece’s deeply troubled relationship with the rest of Europe will become even more fraught.And Greece will be even further away from the accord it needs to restore the flow of aid and repair its economy, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said. “They’re going deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole.”Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and James Kanter from Brussels.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
