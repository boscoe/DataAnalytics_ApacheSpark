But some of Citigroup’s problems lingered longer than they did at the nation’s other largest banks.Last year, Citigroup failed the Federal Reserve’s stress test after regulators cited the bank’s failure to properly project potential losses in times of extreme stress. It was the only one of the nation’s five largest banks to fail the test, setting off a scramble inside Citigroup to pass this year’s test — which it did.In a note to his staff on Thursday, Mr. Leach said that when he became chief risk officer there were “many questions about the future of our franchise.” But he said the bank’s success in passing this year’s stress test showed how much the bank had improved.“The bookends of these events show, as well as any, how far we have come,” Mr. Leach wrote. “You have all been a part of that journey and our company is stronger for it.”Mr. Leach said in his note that he has not decided what he plans to do next.Advertisement
