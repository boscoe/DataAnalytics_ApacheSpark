Donald E. Graham, the longtime publisher of The Washington Post who sold the newspaper to the Amazon founder, Jeffrey P. Bezos, in 2013, is stepping down as chief executive of Graham Holdings, which houses a collection of businesses, effectively immediately.Mr. Graham, 70, will be succeeded by his son-in-law, Timothy O’Shaughnessy, 33, now the company’s president. Mr. Graham will remain chairman of the board of directors.“Tim O’Shaughnessy will be an outstanding C.E.O.,” Mr. Graham said in a statement. “He has good ideas and he can execute. With the help of a remarkable board, the company is poised to take advantage of an unusual range of opportunities. I have worked at the company since 1971, and I feel very lucky and grateful to every co-worker at every one of our businesses since then.”The move ends decades at the head of his family’s companies for Mr. Graham, most famously at The Post, where he succeeded his mother, Katharine, as publisher and eventually engineered the sale of the newspaper to Mr. Bezos.Graham Holdings includes the education company Kaplan, the media companies Slate and Foreign Policy and local TV stations in Houston and Orlando, Fla., among other cities.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
