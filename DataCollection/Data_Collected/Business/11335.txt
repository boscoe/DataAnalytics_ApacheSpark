Britax Child Safety is recalling about 71,000 child car seats in the United States because the carrying handle may break, allowing the infant carrier to be dropped, the company reported on Thursday in a regulatory filing.The company says the problem affects some B-Safe 35, B-Safe 35 Elite and B-Safe 35 Travel System models manufactured between Oct. 1, 2014, and July 1, 2015.The company said in a report to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it had one report of an infant being injured, suffering a bruise and bump to the head. But it said the seat owner never returned it for inspection because a store gave the customer a replacement.Britax told federal regulators it received its first complaint about a handle fracturing last May and in subsequent months received additional complaints, though it did not say how many.AdvertisementOn June 1, the company changed the design of the handle, saying the change was “consistent with the standard product development protocol” based upon “market feedback.” One improvement was to make the handle more durable.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

An additional 3,900 seats will be recalled in Canada.The problem with the handle does not compromise the seat’s protection in a crash, Britax said in a statement on its website.A version of this article appears in print on January 22, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Car Seats for Infants Are Recalled.
