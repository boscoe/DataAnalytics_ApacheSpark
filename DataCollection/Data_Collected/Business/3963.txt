TOKYO — The governor of the Bank of Japan, Haruhiko Kuroda, said Thursday there was no limit to how much the central bank would expand its balance sheet relative to the size of the country’s gross domestic product.“We don’t have any particular ceiling,” Mr. Kuroda said.Mr. Kuroda said a median forecast of the bank’s nine board members produced in January, which is for core consumer inflation to hit 2.2 percent in fiscal 2016, showed that members of the board also expected inflation to hit the central bank’s 2 percent target by the end of that year in March 2017.When the central bank adopted its stimulus program in April 2013, it pledged to hit 2 percent inflation in about two years through aggressive asset purchases.“There isn’t a time frame set in stone when we say roughly two years,” Mr. Kuroda told Parliament, when asked by a lawmaker which specific years the Bank of Japan had in mind in setting the two-year time frame.AdvertisementCore consumer inflation has slowed, largely because of weak domestic demand and slumping oil prices. It stood at 0.5 percent in the year ending in December, well below the central bank’s target nearly two years ago in adopting the asset purchase program.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
