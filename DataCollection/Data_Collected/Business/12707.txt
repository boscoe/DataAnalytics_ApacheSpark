Four weeks ago, two New York plainclothes police officers were shot by someone using a Ruger .357 revolver, she said in the letter.Sturm, Ruger is vulnerable to additional public scrutiny, litigation and regulatory attention, all things potential investors would want to know, she said.Another activist group, Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, is pressing the sporting and outdoor goods retailer Cabela’s to stop selling weapons that can fire more than eight rounds without reloading. The church is asking Cabela’s shareholders to vote on the proposal at their annual meeting; the retailer has been fighting to keep the proposal off its shareholder proxy.An earlier campaign by Trinity Church resulted in Walmart agreeing to remove some weapons from its shelves last August, but only after a court battle between the two over Walmart’s attempt to block Trinity’s shareholder proposal from its proxy.In recent months, Ms. James has also called on TD Bank to stop financing Smith & Wesson, which is based in Springfield, Mass. Last summer, she convinced New York’s largest pension fund to explore selling its holdings of gun retailers such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods.Advertisement
