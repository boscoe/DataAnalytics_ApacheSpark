Micrel, a semiconductor maker based in San Jose, Calif., said on Tuesday that its board had decided to “undertake a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to enhance value for shareholders.”That is usually Wall Street code for exploring a potential sale, although the company said its stand-alone plan was among the options that would be considered.Three independent directors – Robert Herb, John Bourgoin and Daniel Heneghan – will lead the review. “There can be no assurance that the company’s review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction,” the company said.Micrel has a market value of $754.7 million. It has more than $100 million in cash on hand, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.The activist investor Starboard Value is the company’s second largest shareholder, with a stake of 11.97 percent. Raymond Zinn, who has been the company’s chairman and chief executive since its founding in 1978, holds a 20.67 percent stake.Credit Suisse and the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell are advising Micrel on the strategic review.
