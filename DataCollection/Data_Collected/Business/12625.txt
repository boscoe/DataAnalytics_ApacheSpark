WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose from a five-month low last week, but it remained below a level associated with a strengthening labor market.Other data on Thursday showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region expanded in March for the first time in seven months, the latest sign of stability in the distressed manufacturing industry.In addition, job openings hit a six-month high in January, and a gauge of future economic activity increased in February after two straight months of declines.“The labor market is tight as a drum,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.AdvertisementInitial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 265,000 for the week ended March 12, the Labor Department said. Claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 54 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.

The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 750 to 268,000 last week.AdvertisementThe claims data covered the survey period for March nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average of claims fell 5,250 from the February to March survey periods, suggesting further payrolls gains. The labor market added 242,000 jobs in February.The labor market’s resilience was underscored by a second report from the Labor Department showing that job openings increased by 260,000 to a six-month high of 5.5 million in January. While hiring fell in January, that was very likely because employers are having trouble finding qualified workers for open positions.In a third report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region jumped to 12.4 this month, the first positive reading in seven months, from a reading of minus 2.8 in February.The survey’s gauge of new orders surged 21 points to 15.7, with almost 37 percent of companies reporting an increase in new orders this month. The shipments index jumped 20 points to 22.1, and unfilled orders and delivery times also improved.In addition, factories continued to report declining inventories, which bodes well for future production. But factory employment in the region remained weak.

Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the United States economy, has been hurt by the dollar’s strength, lower oil prices and efforts by businesses to reduce inventory.Advertisement“The improvement supports our view that we are moving past the weakest period for the manufacturing sector,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase in New York. “It is likely that we are now past the biggest drags from the stronger dollar and inventory correction.”A fourth report on Thursday, from the Commerce Department, showed that the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell 3.6 percent to $125.3 billion in the fourth quarter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The fourth-quarter current account deficit represented 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.9 percent in the July-September quarter.“The outsize surge in the dollar and weakness in emerging market economies has prompted a pullback in exports that has more than offset improvement in the petroleum balance,” said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colo.A version of this list appears in print on March 18, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Jobless Claims Rise, but Job Openings Hit 6-Month High.
