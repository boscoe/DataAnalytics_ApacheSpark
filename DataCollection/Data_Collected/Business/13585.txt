The economic outlook, however, was dimmed by another report on Wednesday showing that last month, private employers hired the fewest number of workers in three years.The Institute for Supply Management said its nonmanufacturing index rose 1.2 percentage points to a reading of 55.7 in April. A majority of industries expressed optimism about the business climate and the economy.A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the American economy. Services industry activity was last month buoyed by a 3.2 percentage point surge in new orders.A gauge of services sector employment rose to 53.0 last month, from a reading of 50.3 in March. Construction firms reported “severe” shortages of unskilled labor.Companies in the energy sector said recent oil price increases had slightly improved the outlook for the industry, but the gains had not been enough to initiate hiring or spending.The rise in services sector employment last month eclipsed the slightly weak private payrolls report from ADP, which showed an increase of 156,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since April 2013. The number rose 194,000 in March.The step-down in private sector hiring is at odds with other labor market indicators, like first-time applications for unemployment benefits, which are near four-decade lows.The services industry data and the ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody’s Analytics, came before the government’s more comprehensive employment report for April, which scheduled for release on Friday.The labor market has so far weathered the sluggish economy, which has been slammed by weak exports as a result of the lingering effects of the dollar’s rally last year and tepid global demand.Growth has also been eroded by relentless aggressive spending cuts in the energy sector in the aftermath of last year’s plunge in oil prices, as well as efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.In another report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit fell 13.9 percent to $40.4 billion in March, the smallest since February 2015, as imports of goods plunged to a more than five-year low.Weak imports potentially signal slackening domestic demand, but could also be related to the continuing inventory drawdown. Lower oil prices and increased domestic energy production are also helping to keep the import bill in check.Imports of goods tumbled 4.3 percent to $175.3 billion, the smallest since December 2010. Imports were held down by industrial supplies and materials, which fell to a near 12-year low. Petroleum imports were the lowest since September 2002, even as oil prices rose to an average $27.68 per barrel.Exports of goods also fell last month, slipping 1.6 percent to $116.8 billion. Exports of food were the lowest since September 2010. Industrial supplies and materials exports fell to a six-year low, while consumer goods exports were the lowest since March 2013.In a fifth report, the Labor Department said productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, declined at a 1.0 percent rate in the first quarter after shrinking at a 1.7 percent pace in the fourth quarter.Weak productivity helps explain the divergence between lackluster economic growth and the fairly robust labor market.Advertisement
