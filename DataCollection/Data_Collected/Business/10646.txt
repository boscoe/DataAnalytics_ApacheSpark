Previously, Mr. Lord worked as a human resources executive at NBC News and General Electric.“His long and impressive track record in this arena will be a valuable addition to our management team, and we look forward to him implementing key programs reflecting his core vision for employees,” Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine, co-presidents of Fox News, said in a joint statement.In July, Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, filed suit against Roger Ailes, the former chairman at Fox News, saying that she was forced out of the network after she refused his sexual advances. A subsequent internal investigation found more than 20 claims of inappropriate behavior involving him, including that he offered to help advance women’s careers in exchange for sexual favors.Mr. Ailes, who has denied the charges of sexual harassment, left the network in July.Current and former Fox News employees have said that they did not bring complaints of sexual harassment, including requests for sexual favors, to the network’s human resources department because they feared retaliation.Mr. Lord’s role is new at the network. Denise Collins, Fox News’s senior vice president of human resources, will now report to Mr. Lord.Advertisement
