The first criminal trial in the United States of traders accused of manipulating a global interest rate benchmark got underway in Manhattan on Wednesday.Two Britons, Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, both former London-based traders at the Dutch bank Rabobank, are accused of conspiring to submit fraudulent rate reports for the benchmark known as Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, in order to help colleagues profit on trades.The New York trial follows one this summer in London, where Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, was convicted of conspiring with others to manipulate Libor. Mr. Hayes, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison, is appealing. A separate trial of six former brokers who are accused of assisting Mr. Hayes began in London last week.In the Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan, Carol L. Sipperly, a federal prosecutor, said in her opening argument that the two bankers “were cheating” and that they gave themselves and their bank “an unfair advantage.” Their scheme spanned from 2006 to 2011, according to the indictment.AdvertisementMs. Sipperly said the government case rested partly on emails and messages and partly on testimony from three other former Rabobank traders, who have each pleaded guilty to similar charges. Those three former traders, with trading-desk nicknames like “Pookie” and “Ambassador,” feature prominently in more than 40 different instances cited in the indictment.AdvertisementBut defense lawyers argued that their clients’ rate submissions were made honestly in good faith, and that the wrongdoing of those who pleaded guilty was centered on separate submissions for Libor rates denominated in Japanese yen.One defense lawyer argued that the government had “cherry-picked” emails that appeared to show the traders agreeing to requests for high or low submissions when the appeals were just as often ignored.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            “His submissions were the truth,” said Michael S. Schachter, who is representing Mr. Allen. He noted that his client wasn’t compensated based on the other traders’ profits and that Mr. Allen would sometimes “ignore the request completely.”Mr. Conti’s lawyer, Aaron K. Williamson, said his client “always made honest submissions.”In the emails, some Rabobank traders pressed Libor rate-setters like Mr. Conti, a money-markets trader in London, and Mr. Allen, his supervisor as global head of liquidity and finance, for higher or lower rates on dollar Libor that could raise the profits on the other traders’ interest-rate trading books.For example, on Aug. 13, 2007, one Rabobank trader asked Mr. Conti where he thought the six-month Libor would be the next day, and Mr. Conti replied, “Where do you like to see it, is more the question?”On Nov. 15, 2007, Mr. Conti, after referring to one-month Libor, told another trader, “The ambass had big fixing so we help him today.”On July 10, 2008, another trader asked Mr. Allen if Libor rates would remain the same that day, and Mr. Allen replied, “Where do you want ’em?” The trader replied, “Smidgen lower?” Later, Mr. Allen concluded, “Maybe a smidge lower, smidge lower.”AdvertisementLibor rates are set daily just before noon London time after a tally of submissions by 16 banks, with the four highest and lowest excluded and the remaining eight submissions averaged. The resulting benchmarks are supposed to represent rates at which banks can borrow from one another for short periods ranging from overnight to three, six or 12 months.Questions about the accuracy of the rates emerged just before the financial crisis erupted in 2008, as interbank lending froze up when fears arose about banks’ survival. Defense lawyers argued in court that this made their clients’ submissions more like educated guesses.More than a half dozen major banks, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Barclays, have agreed to pay more than $10 billion to regulators globally to settle Libor-rigging charges. But the judge overseeing the trial, Jed S. Rakoff, has ruled that prosecutors can’t mention a $1 billion settlement by Rabobank, which cost its chief executive his job in 2013.On Tuesday, the government and defense battled over how the significance of Libor could be portrayed. Judge Rakoff ruled against prosecution efforts to allow its expert witness, Lawrence E. Harris, former chief economist of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to testify on how Libor influences rates on credit cards and mortgages.But Judge Rakoff also sharply scolded Mr. Schachter, Mr. Allen’s lawyer, when during cross-examination Wednesday he mocked Mr. Harris’s answer to a question that suggested that Libor submission procedures weren’t well understood even by bank traders and experts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Justice Department recently vowed a renewed effort to prosecute individuals, and not just their employers, for corporate wrongdoing. It has brought in two lawyers who once led efforts to prosecute accounting fraud at Enron after an earlier market crisis starting in 2000.One is Andrew Weissmann, who was named earlier this year to head the fraud section. Mr. Weissmann was in the Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday, when the jury was selected.A jury consultant, Roy Futterman, said that it might be difficult for the prosecution to make the charges stick because of the complexity and subjectivity of the Libor submission procedures.The jurors, he said, might be “more upset with the financial system than with the defendants.”A version of this article appears in print on October 15, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Libor-Rigging Trial Begins in Manhattan for Two Traders Formerly of Rabobank.
