Both companies have accused the other of making “misleading statements” about their discussions.Exor, which is controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, has offered to pay $6.8 billion in cash for the company, but PartnerRe has said that it is worth “materially more” and offered on Wednesday to engage in further discussions in hopes of securing a more favorable bid.On Thursday, Exor said it would be willing to negotiate if PartnerRe’s board declared its offer “reasonably likely to be a superior proposal” than the Axis transaction.“By demanding that we declare their offer ‘reasonably likely to be a superior proposal’ as a precondition to any negotiations, Exor has effectively rejected our board’s good faith offer” to engage in further discussions, PartnerRe said in a news release on Friday. “We have made it very clear that Exor’s price and terms are unacceptable.”PartnerRe will proceed to shareholder approval of the transaction with Axis; its board is recommending that shareholders approve the Axis deal.Exor said Friday that it welcomed a vote on the Axis transaction and was confident that it would ultimately prevail, saying its offer “provides superior value and certainty.”PartnerRe and Axis, which are both based in Bermuda, agreed in January to a so-called merger of equals that would create a new player in the specialized field of reinsurance with a combined market capitalization of more than $11 billion.But Exor made an unsolicited offer this month and raised its bid last week in hopes of wresting PartnerRe from Axis.After the first Exor offer, the deal with Axis was revised so that PartnerRe’s shareholders would receive a one-time special dividend of $11.50 a common share, in addition to shares in the combined company.Shares of PartnerRe closed at $133.50 in New York on Thursday.Advertisement
