AT&T said it would record $10 billion in charges in its fourth quarter, including a $7.9 billion pretax loss related to accounting adjustments for gains and losses on pension and benefit plans. The company is also recording a $2.1 billion noncash charge as it abandons some copper used for landlines. AT&T said on Friday that the copper, which was typically used for wiring, is not needed as consumer demand declines for its older voice and data services, like landlines. Consumers are opting for cellphones and Internet-based phone service. AT&T has plans to shut off its copper landline network by the end of the decade. AT&T stock slipped 40 cents to $33.40 in extended trading.A version of this brief appears in print on January 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: AT&T; to Take $10 Billion Charge in 4th Quarter.
