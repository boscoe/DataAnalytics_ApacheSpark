Also not revealed: what the software maker’s stock ticker will be or on which stock market it will trade.SunGard’s filing is the latest instance of private equity firms seeking to take advantage of buoyant stock markets to sell some of their long-held investments. For at least the last three years, these firms have at times been more occupied with selling their holdings and cashing out than with paying what executives have called expensive prices for new acquisitions.An initial public offering will give the private equity firms that bought SunGard — Bain Capital, the Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs’s buyout arm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, Providence Equity Partners, Silver Lake and TPG Capital — the chance to exit their investment.They banded together in 2005 to buy the company, which makes software for banks, insurers and asset management firms, for about $10.8 billion.The deal helped set the stage for even larger leveraged buyouts like those of Hilton Hotels, the hospital operator HCA and the Texas utility TXU. Hilton and HCA have since become public again through I.P.O.s, while TXU, now known as Energy Future Holdings, filed for bankruptcy protection.Some other companies acquired during the debt boom remain privately held, like Toys “R” Us, Clear Channel Communications and Univision.Being private has not meaningfully improved SunGard’s financial performance, at least not since 2010. The company’s revenue has been roughly flat for the last five years, while it has posted annual losses more often than profits during that time. Last year, the company lost $222 million on $2.8 billion in revenue.JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse will oversee the initial offering. Advertisement
