Zica.That was before a like-named viral outbreak linked to thousands of birth defects became an international public health emergency and a daily topic in news reports. On Tuesday, Tata sought to defuse the unfortunate association with the mosquito-borne Zika virus, saying it would rename its car, just as it was to be unveiled this week at an automobile show outside New Delhi.Tata, based in Mumbai, said in a statement, “Empathizing with the hardships being caused by the recent ‘Zika’ virus outbreak across many countries, Tata Motors, as a socially responsible company, has decided to rebrand the car.”The lead-up to the car’s unveiling has coincided with news coverage of the growing Zika crisis across South and Central America. Tata appeared to place big hopes on the Zica, even enlisting one of the world’s biggest soccer stars, Lionel Messi, as a pitchman. The automaker said a new name would be announced in a few weeks.A similar branding problem has vexed companies and individuals named Isis, which was the name of an Egyptian goddess long before it was connected to the Islamic State terrorist organization. Some, after holding out for months, eventually gave in to pressure to go by something else.Advertisement
