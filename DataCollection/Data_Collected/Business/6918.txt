Arianna Huffington, a founder of The Huffington Post, has signed a new four-year contract to remain chairwoman, president and editor in chief of the publication, ending speculation that she might leave now that its parent company, AOL, was acquired by Verizon.Ms. Huffington’s contract had expired this year, and she had not signed a new one amid misgivings that Verizon might not provide the level of support and editorial independence that she wanted.“After all my meetings and conversations with Tim and the Verizon leadership,” she said in a memo to staff members on Thursday, speaking of the AOL chief executive, Tim Armstrong, “I am convinced that we will have both the editorial independence and the additional resources that will allow HuffPost to lead the global media platform shift to mobile and video.”The site plans to continue a global expansion, she said, and invest in video production and distribution — a priority for Verizon, which wants more content to offer its customers. It will also invest in technology, and in its newsroom as it stops running news articles from The Associated Press.Ms. Huffington added that the company would be “seeking out smart acquisitions and strategic investments that will bring in top talent and cutting-edge technologies to help accelerate our goals.”A version of this article appears in print on June 19, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Huffington Gets New Deal to Lead Site.
