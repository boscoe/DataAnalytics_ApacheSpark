Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of $1.38 a share.The earnings gain was not achieved by simply cutting costs, as has happened at several of the big banks recently. Instead, JPMorgan increased revenue 4 percent, to $24.8 billion from $23.9 billion in the quarter a year earlier.Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with investors on Tuesday morning that the bank experienced “broad strength in underlying performance.” The conference call was dominated by detailed questions about relatively technical elements of the company’s financial results, a sharp contrast with a similar call last quarter when JPMorgan executives were forced to defend their business model in heated exchanges.The increase in the headline numbers was driven by improved performance across the bank’s trading desks, which have been struggling in recent quarters. Revenue at the bank’s enormous bond-trading operations jumped 61 percent from the previous quarter. The bank said this was driven by activity in interest rate products, emerging market bonds and currencies.Ms. Lake said that market activity had dropped off somewhat at the beginning of the second quarter, but was likely to continue to be higher than it had been in recent years.Other parts of JPMorgan’s investment bank also did well. The teams that advise companies on mergers and acquisitions experienced the biggest jump from the period a year earlier, with revenue climbing 42 percent.On the consumer side of the bank, mortgage lending, which had been lagging, grew significantly from both a year ago and the previous quarter.The strong results from the quarter provide the company with ammunition to use against critics who have said the bank would be better off broken into smaller parts.In a statement that accompanied the results, JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: “We have an outstanding franchise which is getting safer and stronger, and is gaining market share over time. We continue to build the company for the long-term, we are investing in controls, infrastructure, systems, technology, new products and bankers. We will continue to navigate challenges and deliver for our clients, shareholders and communities.”Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.Advertisement
