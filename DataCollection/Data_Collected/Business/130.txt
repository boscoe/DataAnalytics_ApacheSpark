Every day there are scores. Every year there are tens of thousands, so numerous they may seem routine.They are not. Datelines mean that The New York Times is on the scene. They catalog the reach of our journalists, who seek to witness what they write about, probe deeply into events and capture the most memorable images.In an age of instant posts and pundits, we believe more than ever that going there makes our journalism distinctive, richer, more personal and more reliable.Articles this week highlight The Times’s journalism since digital subscriptions began. To celebrate this milestone, we compiled a list of our best work, and asked readers what The Times means to them.This week, The Times is celebrating a milestone: We recently passed one million digital-only subscribers. They join another 1.1 million print-and-digital subscribers.AdvertisementWe now have more subscribers than at any time in our 164-year history. With their support, we are able to travel to more places to help our readers make sense of the world.AdvertisementThis year alone, our journalists in more than 30 international news bureaus worldwide — from Seoul to Senegal, Bangkok to Rio — have reported from more than 150 countries and territories. (Not to mention four nautical datelines: off the Antarctic Peninsula; in the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic; in the Persian Gulf; and in the South Atlantic.)They have fluency in a dozen languages, like Chinese, French, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, German and Portuguese.The Times has more than a dozen bureaus across the United States, and our reporters have already filed stories from every state and Puerto Rico this year.And, of course, we have hundreds of reporters in our headquarters in New York City, and dozens in our Washington bureau.SeattleWASH.Me.N.H.N.D.PortlandMont.Vt.Minn.Ore.Wis.IdahoBostonNewYorkMich.MinneapolisS.D.Mass.DetroitConn.Wyo.ClevelandIowaChicagoNew YorkSalt Lake CityN.J.Pa.Neb.OhioPhiladelphiaDesMoinesSan FranciscoInd.DenverWashingtonDEL.UtahW.

One entered a disputed area of war-torn Iraq to report on women enslaved by the Islamic State.Our reporters have traveled to Austin, Ind., a small town with an H.I.V. epidemic, and to Porterville, Calif., which was stricken by a drought. They have driven the length of Interstate 35 in the center of the country to tell the story of how immigrants and established residents are getting along.Our investment in firsthand reporting is a major reason we deliver stories, photos and videos that no one else has.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Other times, they’re downright surprised.Only because we had a reporter on the ground in Liberia’s capital did the world first learn about the chaos caused by an ill-fated Ebola quarantine.Our goal with every dateline is to take our readers with us — to be your eyes and ears in an ever-changing age.Joseph Kahn is an assistant masthead editor who oversees international coverage; Alison Mitchell is national editor.
