At least $550 million of that would most likely be paid in shares.The transaction includes the assumption of about $2 billion in debt.“This is a terrific opportunity for the shareholders of both companies,” Tony Will, the CF Industries president and chief executive, said in a news release.The new holding company would operate under the CF Industries name and would be led by CF Industries’ existing management team.As part of the deal, the holding company has also agreed to buy a 45 percent interest in Natgasoline, a methanol production complex being developed by OCI in Texas, for about $500 million in cash. That project is expected to be completed in 2017.CF Industries and OCI first confirmed in July that they were in preliminary talks regarding a potential merger.The transaction requires shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close in 2016.As part of the agreement, Nassef Sawiris, the OCI chief executive, and members of the Sawiris family, which are OCI’s founding and controlling shareholders, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction.The Sawiris family would own 15 percent of the combined company; CF Industries shareholders would own 72.3 percent, and OCI about 27.7 percent. OCI expects to distribute most of the shares it receives to its investors.The new company, while based in Britain, would have its principal executive offices in Deerfield, Ill., where CF Industries is based, and would be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.OCI produces nitrogen fertilizers, methanol and other natural gas-based chemical products for the agricultural and industrial sectors. The company spun off its construction arm, Orascom Construction, in March.Based in Amsterdam, OCI posted revenue from its fertilizer and chemical operations of $2.69 billion in 2014 and had about 3,000 employees at plants in Algeria, Egypt, the Netherlands and the United States.After the deal, OCI’s business would consist of a portfolio of industrial chemicals and nitrogen fertilizers. The company would also gain financial flexibility to “fully unlock the potential of its ongoing businesses and pursue new investment opportunities,” said Mr. Sawiris, the chief executive, said in a news release.CF Industries said it expected to achieve about $500 million in annual cost savings as a result of the merger.The deal came after CF Industries and Yara International of Norway shelved discussions in October on what would essentially have been a merger of equals and would have united two of the world’s largest producers of nitrogen fertilizer.That Yara deal would have created a stronger competitor to the Potash Corporation of Canada, the world’s largest fertilizer producer.Those merger talks collapsed in October shortly after Yara dismissed its chief executive, and his intended successor backed out of the job a few days later.In July, CF Industries acquired Yara International’s 50 percent interest in GrowHow, Britain’s largest fertilizer producer, for $580 million.CF Industries was founded as a fertilizer broker in 1946 but later expanded into production. CF posted sales of $4.74 billion in 2014 and had about 2,200 full-time employees.Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom are advising CF Industries, while Zaoui & Company, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan Chase and the law firms Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and Allen & Overy are advising OCI.Allen & Company is advising the Sawiris family.Advertisement
