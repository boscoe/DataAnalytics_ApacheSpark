Under a federal law that stood for more than 30 years, airlines at Love Field could fly only to other places in Texas or a few nearby states unless they used very small planes. Those limits expired in October, setting off a rush by airlines wanting more gates for new flights. Southwest Airlines controls 18 of 20 gates at the city-owned airport. Delta Air Lines operates five flights a day from one of those Southwest gates, but that deal expires July 6. Delta wants to add eight new flights, but Southwest wants the gate back. In a letter to the city this week, the federal Transportation Department’s top lawyer said Delta had the right under federal law to stay at Love Field. On Wednesday, the city sued the Transportation Department, the Federal Aviation Administration and six airlines that now or once operated at Love Field, saying it was “in an impossible situation.” Advertisement
