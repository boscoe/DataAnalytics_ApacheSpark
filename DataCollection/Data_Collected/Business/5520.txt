To the Editor:In the article “A Drug Trial’s Frayed Promise” (April 19), Katie Thomas describes borderline personality disorder as “intractable.” I have specialized in the treatment of borderline personality disorder for 30 years, and though it is difficult to treat, research shows specialized psychotherapies such as dialectical behavior therapy have a reasonably good efficacy rate. If what Ms. Thomas means is that we don’t yet have a pill for it, she is right.Nonetheless, I appreciated Ms. Thomas’s article, as it exposes the pharmaceutical companies’ relentless attempts to market drugs for the condition whether they work or not. I can say from clinical experience that antipsychotics such as Seroquel usually make the patient worse, inducing weight gain, sedation, cognitive dulling and a loss of drive and energy, which is why so many subjects dropped out of the clinical trial, as Ms. Thomas points out. The sad reality is that this article will do little to stop business as usual.John GartnerTowson, Md., April 18The writer is a part-time assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.A version of this letter appears in print on April 26, 2015, on Page BU6 of the New York edition with the headline: A Difficult but Treatable Illness .
