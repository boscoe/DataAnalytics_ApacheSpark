The bank-driven slowdown recalls the zombie lending cycle that Japan entered in the 1990s, leading to its own lost economic decade.Then, instead of biting the bullet and taking losses, large Japanese banks kept credit lines open to borrowers even when they had slight chance of making good on the loans.“Europe has not learned anything from Japan — it has just repeated the same mistakes,” said Tim Eisert, a German economist at Erasmus University in the Netherlands who participated in the study. “Mario Draghi may have saved the euro, but we still have undercapitalized banks in Europe.”In their report, the economists calculate that if European banks were subjected to a scrubbing similar to what United States banks experienced, they would need to raise €125 billion in new capital.At a time when investors across Europe have become deeply skeptical of investing in banks, and governments are loath to offer bailouts, achieving such a number borders on the impossible.Moreover, since the onset of the debt crisis, Europe’s leaders have been slow to address their banking problems. In the regulators’ latest stress test, only one European bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena of Italy, came out as needing more capital.Feltrinelli is just one example of a number of highly indebted Italian companies receiving loans at below-market interest rates over the last three years, a period when aggressive policies by the European Central Bank freed extra cash for European banks to dole out credit.Other companies cited in the paper include the clothing retailer Benetton, which has lost €240 million since 2012, yet also received a below-market-rate loan in that year, according to data collected by the economists.Massimiliano Tarantino, a public relations executive at Feltrinelli, said that the company had suffered during the recent crisis and was now shifting its strategy, making new investments in television, electronic publishing and book sales over the internet.In their paper, the researchers found that of the €540 billion in syndicated European Union loans that they tracked, 8 percent went to companies that they classified as zombie institutions.In Italy, however, the proportion of new loans that have gone to struggling companies like Feltrinelli over the last three years is much higher at 17 percent.Italy is not the only country in Europe plagued by dud loans. In Greece, Yannis Stournaras, head of the country’s central bank, said recently that nonperforming loans were still on the rise and had reached a level of €108 billion — roughly one half the size of the overall economy.In his speech, Mr. Stournaras said that 67 percent of the loans made to small and medium-size companies, the life blood of the Greek economy, were nonperforming, a statistic that explains in blunt terms why the Greek economy continues to stagnate.As with Greek banks, Italian banks are similarly exposed to small private companies, many of which have been hit hard by the sluggish economy.According to a paper on troubled Italian loans put out by the I.M.F. last month, three-quarters of the €360 billion bad loan figure are owed by Italian companies — most of which are small or medium-sized.While such an amount, about 18 percent of total Italian loans outstanding, is certainly arresting, Italian government officials argue that sufficient steps have been taken to address the problem.They say that banks have set aside cash to cover nearly half of the loans and that all of the exposures are backed by sufficient collateral.They also point to the recent formation of a €4 billion fund that will buy some of the bad loans from the banks.Still, €4 billion does not rise to the level of a bazooka that would give the markets confidence. And as the I.M.F. report lays out, Italian banks are among the least profitable in Europe, which gives them little incentive to write off their loans, especially when there are tax incentives for bankers to not take such a step.Banks also have little incentive to pursue debtors in Italy’s courts. The I.M.F. study says that liquidations of troubled Italian companies last, on average, eight years, with preferred creditors likely to claw back just 29 percent of their claim.So, instead of taking a hit, many Italian banks have decided to keep the liquidity flowing in the hope that a company might turn its fortunes around. But with growth averaging about 0.3 percent for the last two decades and now threatening to dip back into negative territory, a spate of corporate recoveries seems unlikely.And the lesson for global regulators is a powerful one, the economists involved in the study argue.Before using unconventional measures to inject cash into lending markets, central bankers must ensure that their large banks are sufficiently capitalized — as was the case in the United States, when one of the first steps regulators took was to force banks to increase their capital cushions. Without this extra layer of security, banks have little incentive to write down bad loans and focus on healthier companies.“These zombie loans are just bad for the economy,” said Viral V. Acharya, one of the report’s authors and a specialist in European debt at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “The problem is that Europe never injected capital into its banks like TARP in the U.S.”Advertisement
