Halliburton lost $641 million as it took charges of $823 million in asset write-downs and other items. It posted a $616 million profit in the year-ago quarter. Revenue, which fell 4 percent to $7.05 billion, beat analysts’ expectation of $6.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, helped by strength in the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Adjusted income from continuing operations excluding the charges also beat analysts’ expectations, coming in at 49 cents a share, surpassing forecasts for 37 cents. Besides coping with the slide in oil prices, Halliburton has been divesting businesses to get regulatory clearance for its planned $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes. Halliburton also forecast a fall in current-quarter revenue in North America. The company, which has cut over 10 percent of its global head count in the last two quarters, said it would cut capital spending about 15 percent, to $2.8 billion this year. Advertisement
