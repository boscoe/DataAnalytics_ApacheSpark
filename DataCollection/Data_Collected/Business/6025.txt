The central bank trimmed its economic growth forecast for the year to 2.5 percent, from an earlier estimate of 2.9 percent. But the revision reflects the low growth in the first quarter — 0.3 percent — which was short of the bank’s estimate of 0.6 percent. The inflation rate will rise to 0.6 percent by the end of 2015, the bank predicted. Its policy target is an annual inflation rate of 2 percent, which is deemed a healthy sign of economic growth.
