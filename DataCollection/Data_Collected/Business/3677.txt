LONDON – Local prosecutors in Switzerland conducted a search of the offices of HSBC’s Swiss private bank in Geneva on Wednesday as part of a new investigation into potential money laundering.The Geneva prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Wednesday that it had opened a criminal inquiry into possible aggravated money laundering against HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), but it did not provide additional details.Depending on the results of the inquiry, the process is likely to extend to individuals who would be suspected of committing money laundering or participating in those acts, the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.The latest inquiry comes amid recent media reports providing new details about efforts by HSBC, a British bank, and its Swiss private banking arm to help wealthy clients avoid taxes. The activity at issue dated back to 2007.By CHAD BRAYDocuments stolen by a former employee in Switzerland in 2007 show bankers helping clients avoid paying taxes on billions of dollars in their home countries.In a report earlier this month, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, an organization based in Washington, along with several news organizations, said secret documents showed that bank employees had reassured clients that HSBC would not disclose details of their accounts to tax authorities in their home countries and discussed options to avoid paying taxes on those assets.The report was based on documents that were taken from HSBC by a former employee in Switzerland in 2007 and given to French authorities, who in 2010 shared them with officials in the Britain, the United States and other nations.“We have cooperated continuously with the Swiss authorities since first becoming aware of the data theft” and the bank continues to cooperate, a HSBC spokeswoman said on Wednesday.The former employee, Hervé Falciani, is facing criminal charges in Switzerland over breaching that country’s bank secrecy laws. He now lives in France and has not returned to Switzerland to face the charges.HSBC has said that its Swiss operations ‘‘have undergone a radical transformation’’ in recent years and that its Swiss banking client base has shrunk by about 70 percent since 2007.On Sunday, the bank published a full-page advertisement in newspapers in Britain, in the form of an open letter from its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, apologizing to its customers and saying the recent media coverage has been a “painful experience.”“We have absolutely no appetite to do business with clients who are evading their taxes or who fail to meet our financial crime compliance standards,” Mr. Gulliver said in the letter.In addition to the new Swiss inquiry, HSBC itself is facing tax investigations in France, Belgium and Argentina and has paid fines to the United States related to those disclosures.The information taken from HSBC also has been used by governments to seek back taxes and penalties from individuals. For example, the British government said it had recovered more than 135 million pounds, or about $207 million, in back taxes and penalties as a result.And, the United States, as part of a broader inquiry into efforts by Americans to hide assets overseas, has prosecuted dozens of individuals criminally who have failed to come forward regarding their undisclosed assets and pursued criminal charges against several Swiss bankers who assisted them.But, the latest disclosures regarding HSBC has set off a political firestorm in Britain ahead of this year’s general election.The opposition Labour Party has accused Prime Minister David Cameron and his Conservative Party of not doing enough to investigate the matter and called for renewed inquiries into the matter, namely into potential money laundering crimes.Conservative politicians have repeatedly noted that the activity at issue at HSBC occurred when a Labour government was in power and has said the current government has bolstered penalties for tax evasion.At a hearing in Parliament last week, Lin Homer, the chief of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, said her agency would meet with other law enforcement agencies to discuss the data, which she said was originally provided by French authorities with certain restrictions. Those restrictions have now been lifted, she said.Shares of HSBC rose less than 1 percent to £6.06 in mid-morning trading in London on Wednesday.A version of this article appears in print on 02/19/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: HSBC Searched.
