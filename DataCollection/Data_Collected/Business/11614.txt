DETROIT —  Sales of new vehicles dropped in the United States in January from a year ago, partly because of the snowstorm that shut down dealerships across the East Coast.Over all, the industry reported selling about 1.15 million vehicles during the month, a decline of 0.3 percent from January 2015, according to the firm Autodata. That was better than analysts expected, particularly because January had two fewer selling days than last year because of a quirk in the calendar.The major auto manufacturers reported mixed results as demand continued to tilt more toward sport utility vehicles and pickups and away from traditional passenger cars.One of the poorest performers was the German automaker Volkswagen, which is mired in crisis for cheating on diesel emissions tests in the United States and elsewhere. The company reported a decline in sales of nearly 9 percent for its collection of brands, including VW, Audi, Bentley and Lamborghini.AdvertisementSeveral of the major car companies on Tuesday reiterated earlier predictions that the industry was likely to exceed last year’s record annual sales of nearly 17.5 million. But analysts cautioned that the market was still vulnerable to a downturn.Advertisement“The month’s performance does not mean that 2016 is guaranteed to outdo the record sales of this past year,” said Jack Nerad, an analyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book.Mr. Nerad said stagnant wages in the United States and fluctuations in the stock market could have a negative impact on consumer demand. Other analysts said that any appreciable increase in gas prices could slow the pace of sales for sport utility vehicles.According to Autodata, car sales fell 8.2 percent in January from the same period a year ago. By comparison, S.U.V. and truck sales grew 6.5 percent.“Low gas prices are making larger vehicles more appealing, to the detriment of smaller cars,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the auto research website Edmunds.com.The continued surge in sales of more expensive trucks and sport utility vehicles raised the average industrywide transaction price. Kelley Blue Book said the average price paid in January was $34,112, which was 2.8 percent higher than the year before.MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMJAN. 2015SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesJAN.2016 SALES529,696621,4271,151,123JAN. 2015486,245661,8121,148,057JAN. 2016%F-SeriesSilverado1500-3500CamryCivicCorollaAltimaRAV4AccordFusionRogueEscapeCR-VEquinoxExplorerSentraFORDCHEVROLETRAMTOYOTAHONDATOYOTANISSANTOYOTAHONDAFORDNISSANFORDHONDACHEVROLETFORDNISSAN51,54037,86329,93826,84826,74122,36222,15621,55420,76519,87719,76219,21919,20818,57416,61416,144–  5.2+  4.9+  4.6+  0.3+43.0–18.3–16.1+  8.7–  1.2+  0.9+26.3–  4.2–17.2–  5.0–  2.5+12.2–8.2%+6.5%–0.3%CHANGE   17.58ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+43.0%HondaCivicHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDJAN. 2016SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE203,745            172,478161,283                    155,037                                                               105,734                                     100,497                                        45,011        41,101       38,305                                         32,076     +0.5–2.8 –4.7+6.9+1.6–1.7 +1.1  +0.7Unch.–8.9 %17.715.014.013.59.28.83.93.63.32.8%GENERAL MOTORSFORD MOTORTOYOTAFIAT CHRYSLERNISSANHONDAHYUNDAISUBARUKIAVOLKSWAGENBIGGESTLOSER–18.3%ToyotaCorollaFEB. 2, 2016
