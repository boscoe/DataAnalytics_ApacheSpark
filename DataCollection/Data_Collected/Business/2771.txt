New York State’s top law enforcer has claimed that Barclays made a false statement in court documents and that it defied subpoenas seeking the testimony of two executives, a move that builds on a previous lawsuit over the bank’s private stock trading platform.Barclays’ assertion in a court filing last fall that it had instructed a high-frequency trading firm to cease trading on the platform was false, according to an amended complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court on Wednesday by the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman.In addition, in the face of subpoenas, Barclays has failed to produce William White, the head of electronic trading, and David Johnsen, the head of product development, for questioning, according to the complaint and officials in the attorney general’s office who spoke on the condition of anonymity.In a statement, Barclays said the amended complaint “merely repackages the same flawed arguments that were in the original complaint,” which it has sought to have dismissed.“While we continue to seek to cooperate with the New York attorney general in this matter, we will continue to defend vigorously against these allegations,” the statement said.In a court filing on Wednesday  evening, Barclays sought to have the subpoenas quashed, arguing that the attorney general lacked the legal authority to pursue them. Barclays asked the court to halt all discovery until a ruling on the bank’s effort to dismiss the case.The latest action stems from a lawsuit originally filed by Mr. Schneiderman last June, in which he claimed that Barclays lied about the concentration of high-frequency traders in the trading platform, or dark pool, known as LX. Barclays said it would protect other investors from predatory trading behavior, but it largely failed to do so, the attorney general claimed.In that complaint, Mr. Schneiderman challenged a June 2012 presentation by Mr. White, in which he said, “Where we see suspect activity we’ve gone out proactively to sit down with clients and we’ve actually shut them off from the firm.”The attorney general now says Barclays erred in how it responded to that challenge.In a court filing in October, defending itself against the lawsuit, Barclays said Mr. White’s statement was true and that it referred to “a specific client interaction.” The bank added, “Ten days prior to the presentation, Barclays detected abnormal order flow patterns from a client and instructed the client to stop trading on LX.”But on Wednesday, the attorney general gave a different version of what happened in 2012.Ten days before the presentation, the amended complaint says, Barclays determined that GTS Securities, a high-frequency trader, was putting stress on the dark pool’s computer systems with a high volume of orders. The bank then asked GTS to “see what you can do” to lower the volume, and GTS responded by promising to reduce its traffic by a third on the next trading day, the complaint says.But GTS was never barred from trading in the dark pool at any time, according to the complaint, and it continued to trade millions of shares a day. The attorney general also cited a May 2014 letter from Barclays stating that the bank “has not prohibited any firm from participating in LX.”A spokesman for GTS said in a statement, “GTS is confident that its trading activity is and has been fully compliant with regulatory rules and policies.”In the complaint, the attorney general challenged Barclays’ assertion that it was cooperating with the inquiry, saying the two executives who were the subject of the subpoenas “were directly involved in, and oversaw, much of the fraud alleged.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/22/2015, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Growing Lawsuit.
