But economists also pointed to a sharp increase of all types of anti-trade measures in recent years, with last year recording the largest number of restrictions.As it always does, fund economists pushed for a globally coordinated strategy to increase output, with the focus being on open trade, economic reform and government investments.“Growth has been too low for too long,” Mr. Obstfeld said at a news conference on Tuesday. Mr. Obstfeld said that across all regions, economies were underperforming their “long term growth potential” and that as a result, consumers and investors were stuck in a mode of excessive caution.In his comments, Mr. Obstfeld urged countries with the capacity to invest in large infrastructure projects to do so, a not-so-indirect reference to Germany, which has been frequently criticized by fund leadership for not doing enough to stimulate growth in Europe.“The policy response has been unbalanced, relying too much on central banks,” he said.Asked what the impact would be on the global economy if the Republican presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, won the election, Mr. Obstfeld parsed his words carefully but suggested that some of Mr. Trump’s anti-trade commentary had been cause for concern.“There has been a lot of discussion about changes to trade policies,” Mr. Obstfeld said. “This introduces an element of uncertainty to the mix, and uncertainty is not great for investors.”Advertisement
