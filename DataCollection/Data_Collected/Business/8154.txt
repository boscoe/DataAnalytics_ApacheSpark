McDonald’s is cutting about 225 corporate jobs as part of a push intended to revitalize its flagging business. The fast-food chain said the cuts include about 135 positions at its corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., where it says it has about 2,100 employees. An additional 90 positions are being cut overseas, the company said. The company’s chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, has said he would target $300 million in cost cuts by 2017 and reorganize the company so it can react more quickly to the changing fast-food industry.
