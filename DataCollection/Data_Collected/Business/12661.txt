Children living with a single parent tend to do worse in life than those who grow up in a stable two-parent family.  The United States has one of the highest percentage of children living without a father among advanced countries, as well as one of the highest shares of children living in poverty.

In 1968, about 8.3 million children in the United States lived with only one parent. By last year that number had more than doubled to almost 20 million, or 27 percent of all children under 18. Those living with two parents fell to 69 percent, or to 51 million from 60 million.
