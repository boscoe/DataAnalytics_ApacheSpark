DETROIT —  Automakers on Tuesday reported that sales of new vehicles in May exceeded forecasts and reached the highest seasonally adjusted rate in nearly a decade.Sales in the United States for the month increased 1.6 percent from a year ago, to 1.64 million vehicles, and the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual selling rate was 17.8 million vehicles — the highest since July 2005, according to the research firm Autodata.A combination of easier credit for consumers, stable gasoline prices and a constant stream of new models kept demand strong. And as they have all year, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles lifted market-share gains by individual car companies.Analysts said automakers had achieved steadily rising sales without adding production capacity or relying on heavy discounts and other incentives.Advertisement“Not only are new vehicle registrations approaching the record levels of the early 2000s, but now registrations and production capacity are much more closely aligned,” said Tom Libby, an analyst with IHS Automotive.AdvertisementCarmakers are also benefiting from higher prices for their products, particularly trucks and sport utility vehicles. The average sticker price of a new model topped $33,000 in May, about 4 percent higher than a year ago, according to the car-buying guide Kelley Blue Book.General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, said it sold 293,000 vehicles last month, a 3 percent increase from the previous May.The company said that sales of its Chevrolet pickup trucks rose 30 percent, and that both the Silverado full-size pickup and the smaller Colorado model showed big sales gains.MOST POPULAR CARS AND TRUCKSLIGHTTRUCKS CHANGEFROMMAY 2014SALESTOTALCARSFigures for theUnited StatesMAY2015 SALES794,084814,6091,608,693MAY 2014764,697870,3931,635,090MAY 2015%F-SeriesSilveradoCamry1500-3500CorollaCivicAltimaAccordCR-VFusionEquinoxEscapeRAV4RogueFocusCruzeFORDCHEVROLETTOYOTARAMTOYOTAHONDANISSANHONDAHONDAFORDCHEVROLETFORDTOYOTANISSANFORDCHEVROLET61,870 51,602 43,837 39,952 36,768 34,472 33,630 32,373 32,090 31,325 29,456 29,248 28,808 25,901 23,934 23,752 –  9.7+10.6–11.6+  7.6+  0.4–  4.5–  6.7–18.3–  1.0–  7.5+29.8–  8.3+22.8+38.3+  1.1–26.7–3.7%+6.8%+1.6%CHANGE   17.79ANNUAL SELLING RATE (MILLIONS)BIGGESTGAINER+38.3NissanRogueHOW THE AUTOMAKERS FAREDMAY 2015SALESCHANGEMARKETSHARE293,097           250,086                  242,579             202,227                                                              154,593                                    134,779                                        63,610        62,433      53,522                                                         49,561        +  3.0–  1.3 –  0.3+  4.0+  1.3–  0.8 –10.3 +  3.9+  9.1+12.2     %17.915.314.812.49.58.23.93.83.33.0%GENERAL MOTORSFORD MOTORTOYOTAFIAT CHRYSLERHONDANISSANHYUNDAIKIAVOLKSWAGENSUBARUBIGGESTLOSER–26.7%ChevroletCruze“Our market share is growing and our strategy is to retain these customers,” said Kurt McNeil, G.M.’s head of sales in the United States.G.M. said sales of its GMC brand, which focuses solely on trucks, sport utility vehicles and crossovers, increased 12 percent.
