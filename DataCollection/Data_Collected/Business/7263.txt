The editorial staff of the online magazine Salon plans to unionize, according to a letter posted on a union website on Thursday, the second major web publication to do so in recent weeks.The move comes a month after employees at Gawker Media voted to unionize, and Salon, which was started in 1995, has opted to work with the same union, the Writers Guild of America, East. The decision represents an embodiment of Salon’s progressive values, the 26 members of the editorial staff who signed the letter said, and provides “an opportunity to help establish standards and practices in Internet journalism. It’s an exciting moment for our field, and we want Salon to be at the forefront of change.”The Salon employees, said Lowell Peterson, the executive director of the Writers Guild of America, East, “can make a real difference in their own lives, and in the standards of digital media generally, by negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with their employer.”At Gawker, staff members have described the decision to unionize as a push for better pay and benefits and an effort to improve haphazard communications between management and the staff, as the site grew from a scrappy start-up to an established media site.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
