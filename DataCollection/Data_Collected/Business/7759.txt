AdvertisementSupported byBy Christopher DrewBoeing on Wednesday lowered its profit guidance for 2015 and said that a pretax $835 million charge to cover problems developing a refueling plane for the Air Force had helped drag down second-quarter earnings from core operations 14 percent.The company, based in Chicago, expects its airplane and military businesses to earn $7.70 to $7.90 a share this year, excluding pension costs, from its earlier forecast of $8.20 to $8.40 a share.Boeing bid much lower than its rival Airbus to win the refueling tanker contract in 2011. In the second quarter of 2014, it took a $425 million charge over snags with the tankers. The latest charge brings the total pretax overruns to $1.26 billion on the project, making it clearer how much risk Boeing took in its bid.Fixing the problems, which involve the plane’s complicated fueling system, also leaves Boeing with little margin for further mishaps if it is going to meet the Air Force’s deadline to deliver the first 18 tankers by August 2017.The latest tanker charge amounted to $536 million, or 77 cents a share, after taxes. As a result, Boeing’s core operating earnings slipped to $1.71 billion, or $1.62 a share, in the latest quarter from $2 billion, or $2.42 a share, a year earlier.Still, aviation analysts said the rest of the company’s results were positive, with a continued increase in deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner passenger jets and a significant increase in cash flow.Boeing’s revenue rose 11 percent to $24.54 billion, from $22.05 billion a year earlier, as its deliveries of commercial planes hit a record 197 in the quarter, up from 181 a year earlier.Over the last couple of years, analysts have been watching to see when Boeing will start generating cash from sales of the Dreamliner, an innovative jet that has used new engines and lightweight materials to cut fuel costs.After accounting for capital spending costs, the company’s free cash flow fell to a negative $486 million in this year’s first quarter, adding to the concerns. But that rebounded to a positive $2.61 billion in the second quarter, Boeing said on Wednesday.Boeing executives also told analysts on Wednesday that they still expected to start making a profit on each Dreamliner delivery this year.The company said the deferred production cost for the 787 program rose 2.9 percent to $27.7 billion in the second quarter. That measure accounts for the gap between what it costs the company to build each plane and the average cost it has projected for the first 1,300 aircraft.Boeing executives reiterated that as they increase the production rate for the jets to 12 each month in 2016 from 10 now, the deferred cost total should begin to decline fairly rapidly.Boeing said it delivered 34 of the Dreamliners in the second quarter, up from 30 a year earlier. The planes were introduced to great fanfare in 2011 after several years of production delays, and Boeing is also building larger models that promise to be more profitable in the long run.The new tanker, the KC-46, is crucial for the Air Force, which is desperate to replace a fleet of aging tankers that includes many planes over 50 years old. When Boeing beat Airbus for the contract after a decade-long fight, Airbus questioned then how Boeing could profitably develop the tankers at the price it bid.A need to reroute wiring on the planes led to the $425 million pretax charge last year. Since then, the first test flight of a fully equipped tanker has been delayed, and the Air Force has put off a decision on when to start production.The latest problems also involve wiring and other parts of the fuel system, and will force Boeing to make costly retrofits on two planes it has already built. It will also have to build major sections of additional planes as the flight tests continue, adding to the risk of further costly changes.Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s new chief executive, told analysts on Wednesday that Boeing officials “have our arms around the problem” and are confident they can still meet the Air Force deadline of August 2017 to deliver the first 18 planes.The Air Force would like to buy 179 of the tankers by 2027. That would amount to about $50 billion in business for Boeing. The company believes it can sell an additional $30 billion of the tankers to foreign countries.Advertisement
