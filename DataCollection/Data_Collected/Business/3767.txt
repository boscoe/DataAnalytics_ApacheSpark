At least three of the directors will be independent directors chosen by BGC.BGC also extended the deadline, which had been Thursday, for GFI investors to tender their shares until Feb. 26. Investors agreed to sell 43.3 million of their shares to BGC through Thursday, BGC said. Together with 17.1 million shares held by BGC, that represents nearly 48 percent of GFI’s outstanding shares.“We are thrilled to welcome the world-class people from GFI into the BGC family,” Howard Lutnick, the BGC chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “We have an extraordinary opportunity ahead to grow with BGC’s strong financial position coupled with both companies’ extraordinarily talented brokers and market leading technology.”The announcement is the latest turn in a saga that kicked off last fall when BGC Partners announced plans to start a competing bid for the company.GFI reached a merger agreement in July with the CME Group, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange.CME was forced to up its bid several times under pressure from BGC and shareholders eventually rejected the CME offer in January.Following the acquisition, GFI will operate as a division of BGC, reporting to Shaun D. Lynn, the BGC president. BGC and GFI will remain separately branded divisions in the company.Advertisement
