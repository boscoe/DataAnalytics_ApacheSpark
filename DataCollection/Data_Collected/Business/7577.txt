Canada’s central bank cut its key interest rate on Wednesday as it slashed its economic outlook and predicted a pullback in the second quarter because of the impact of lower oil prices and weaker demand for exports. The Bank of Canada cut its target for the overnight rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.5 percent. In response, the Canadian dollar plunged to a postrecession low of 77.29 United States cents Wednesday afternoon, down 1.2 cents from the previous close. This is the second time this year the bank has reduced its target for the overnight rate. In its monetary policy report, the bank said it expected that the economy contracted at an annual pace of 0.5 percent in the second quarter compared with its April forecast for growth at a pace of 1.8 percent.A version of this brief appears in print on July 16, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Canada Cuts Interest Rate and Outlook on Economy.
