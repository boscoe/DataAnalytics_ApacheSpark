WASHINGTON —  The Agriculture Department announced Monday that an outbreak of avian flu had been confirmed in what could potentially be millions of chickens at an Iowa egg producer, the largest outbreak yet in an epidemic that has also hit turkey farmers in Minnesota.Officials said the outbreak was at a farm in Osceola County in northwest Iowa that has about 25 barns with total of 5.3 million birds. Officials at the Agriculture Department said birds in three of the barns had been killed to stop the spread of the disease.“But so far we don’t know how many barns are affected,” said Cullen Schwarz, a spokesman for the department, in an email.The farm has nearly 10 percent of the state’s egg-laying hens. Iowa, the nation’s largest egg producer, has about 59 million hens that lay nearly 20 percent of the eggs consumed in the nation.AdvertisementAlso on Monday, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency because of the outbreak and authorized the National Guard to help local officials in affected counties.Several Midwestern states have been affected by the outbreaks, costing turkey and chicken producers nearly 7.8 million birds since March. The epidemic has wiped out nearly 5 percent of Minnesota’s turkey industry, about 1.7 million turkeys on 28 farms. Hormel Foods, the nation’s second-largest turkey processor, said that bird flu outbreaks in Minnesota and Wisconsin — where the company raises and buys many of its turkeys — were causing a shortage.AdvertisementThe Centers for Disease Control consider the risk to people from the disease in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry to be low.A version of this article appears in print on April 21, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bird Flu Spreads to a Farm in Iowa With 5.3 Million Chickens.
