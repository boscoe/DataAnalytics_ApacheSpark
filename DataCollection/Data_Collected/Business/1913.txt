A large mutual fund specializing in risky, high-yielding bonds has blocked investors from getting their money back, citing difficult trading conditions for its securities.The move, announced Thursday by Third Avenue Management funds, was a troubling sign of the recent deterioration in junk bonds, a category that has been hurt in particular by the debt of energy companies struggling with the slump in oil and gas prices. Energy debt accounts for roughly a sixth of the market.More important, the action by Third Avenue highlights a longstanding fear among regulators and economists that too many investors have piled into risky areas of the bond market, like leveraged loans and emerging-market debt, as well as junk bonds.As funds in these areas have grown in size, the ability of portfolio managers to buy and sell these securities in a reasonable amount of time has been curtailed as investment banks have stopped making a market in these areas because of regulatory constraints.AdvertisementThis is what apparently happened to Third Avenue’s Focused Credit Fund, which not long ago was about $2.5 billion in size and had recently shrunk to $788 million as investors rushed to redeem their shares because of weakness in the junk bond market.AdvertisementHigh-yield bonds have had some of the worst returns among bonds this year. A benchmark Merrill Lynch index is down 3.7 percent for the year and a basket of higher-risk junk bonds has lost 13 percent.Trouble in the junk bond market can be a harbinger of tougher times to come in terms of the broader economy.With no sign that selling pressures were abating, Third Avenue, which manages a total of $8 billion in customer assets, has decided to stop fulfilling investor sell orders and liquidate the fund.The remaining assets in the fund will be put into a liquidating trust and sold off gradually, the company said, the idea being to not drive down prices too sharply. This process could last more than a year, which means current investors in the fund may have to wait at least that long to get their money back.In a statement explaining the decision, Third Avenue’s chief executive, David M. Barse, said that investor requests for redemptions, along with a “general reduction of liquidity in the fixed-income markets” made it impracticable for the fund to “create sufficient cash to pay anticipated redemptions without resorting to sales at prices that would unfairly disadvantage the remaining shareholders.”The interest rates on junk bonds, riskier bonds that companies with higher debt loads are able to sell to yield-hungry investors, have spiked over the past month in the face of concerns that a slowing economy would push many of these companies into default.Moody’s Investors Service, the credit rating agency, expects corporate defaults to increase to 3.8 percent next year from 2.8 percent this year. While that may not seem like a large figure, it is the upward trend that worries investors, and the fact that such a large amount of investor money has poured into these funds since central banks began aggressively purchasing fixed-income assets in 2009.Advertisement“This confirms many of the fears we have had about high levels of corporate debt and the lack of liquidity in the marketplace,” said Hung Tran, a senior executive at the Institute of International Finance, which has been warning about this issue. “It should also be seen as a powerful motivation for mutual funds to review their liquidity management strategies.”What is surprising about the fund’s failure, analysts say, is that it had not taken more precautions to have cash on hand in case this type of situation arose. Of late, many funds investing in these less-than-liquid niches of the market have increased cash levels and even taken out credit lines from banks in order to be prepared for a selling wave.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Whitman, a vocal proponent of investing in value stocks, seems to have been caught short in this regard.In addition to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s, which trade like securities on an exchange and track a wide array of bond, equity and commodity baskets, have drawn many billions of dollars into their junk bond funds.To date though, these funds — which promise instant liquidity to investors — have not experienced major problems despite a tremendous pickup in buying and selling activity.By definition, a high-yield fund will invest in companies that are more at risk of going bust than a fund that buys the bonds of blue-chip companies like General Electric or JPMorgan Chase. But the Third Avenue fund seemed to have a particularly large share of companies that were either bankrupt or on the verge.Among its top holdings were Clear Channel Communications, the highly indebted radio broadcaster; Energy Future Holdings, a Texas electricity provider now in bankruptcy; and Liberty Tire Recycling, which is in talks to restructure its debts.But while the yields on these securities may have been appealing, their liquidity was not.Even in good times, these types of securities are hard to buy and sell, meaning a seller has to search out a buyer before he can dispose of his position.Before the financial crisis, large investment banks were the primary market-makers of these kinds of securities. Since 2009, however, they have slashed their inventories of corporate debt to $1.5 trillion from $9 trillion.AdvertisementAt the same time, there has been an explosion of bonds issued by companies, with the result being more bonds than ever in issuance and an increasingly limited number of firms to trade them.In a May interview with Barron’s, one of the fund’s managers, Thomas Lapointe, said that the fund had been focusing on the beaten-down bonds of oil companies.Explaining why the investor panic in this area was appealing, he said, “There’s nothing better than people running out of a building with their hair on fire.”A version of this article appears in print on December 11, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Junk Bond Fund Will Liquidate, and Reimburse Investors Slowly.
