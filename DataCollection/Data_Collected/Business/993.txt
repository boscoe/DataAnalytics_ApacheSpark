Before computers were even invented, the company was making meat and cheese slicers; these days, it’s a $140 billion technology solutions behemoth.But IBM is enduring a pivotal time, with 14 consecutive quarters of declining sales and a strategy geared toward new fields, like data analytics and artificial intelligence, to compensate for the erosion of some of its traditional software and services businesses.At the DealBook conference on Tuesday in New York, where the focus was long term versus the short term, Virginia M. Rometty, the chief executive of IBM, said that to survive, companies must be able to change.“What’s important is that we grow in the right areas,” said Ms. Rometty. “Tech is littered with areas that you can have high growth and make no money. That’s not us.”IBM certainly throws off plenty of cash and has spent billions in recent years on stock buybacks. But Ms. Rometty has been criticized for not deploying that capital by investing in her business, which is undergoing a substantial shift.“My job is to steward capital for the long term,” she said. “Why do we do share buybacks? Because we can, but it’s not in place of other things.”Most recently, IBM acquired the digital assets from the Weather Company, including its weather.com website. IBM is looking to combine it with Watson, its artificial intelligence system that can sift through data and make decisions.Ms. Rometty said on Tuesday that Watson, and the ability for systems to think, was the “most disruptive and transformative” trend out there.Advertisement
