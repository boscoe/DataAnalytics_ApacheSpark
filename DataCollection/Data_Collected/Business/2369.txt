About two weeks after resolving a shortage of French fries in Japan, McDonald’s said Venezuela’s more than 100 franchises had run out of potatoes and were instead serving deep-fried arepa, a flatbread, or yuca, a starchy South American staple. The burger giant blamed the same thing that held it up in Japan: a labor dispute in ports on the West Coast of the United States. But Sonia Ruseler, an Argentina-based spokeswoman for Arcos Dorados, which operates McDonald’s restaurants in Latin America, declined to say why Venezuela’s neighbors were not dealing with similar problems. Venezuelans are no strangers to shortages, which are often driven by tight currency controls. But the socialist government was quick to say its policy had “nothing at all to do” with the shortage. Burger King, meanwhile, tweaked its rival on social media, noting that its Venezuelan restaurants were still offering fries.A version of this brief appears in print on January 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: No French Fries to Be Found at McDonald’s in Venezuela.
