SNAPCHAT REACHES FOR $19 BILLION VALUATION  |  Snapchat, the start-up with disappearing photo messages, is said to be raising a round of venture capital that could value the company at up to $19 billion, Mike Isaac writes on the Bits blog, citing a person with knowledge of the discussions. Snapchat could raise up to $500 million in the round of financing, the person said. If the round closes, Snapchat’s value will have nearly doubled since last year, when the company was in talks to raise money at a $10 billion valuation.If Snapchat closes the round, it would join an elite class of privately held companies that are valued at tens of billions of dollars. Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, recently raised a round of financing valuing the company at $40 billion. The Xiaomi Corporation, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer, is valued at $45 billion. In 2013, Evan Spiegel, one of Snapchat’s founders and its chief executive, rejected a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive.

  HEDGE FUNDS PLACE BETS ON ENERGY  |  A number of hedge funds sought to profit on the turmoil in the energy sector in the final three months of 2014, while others reduced their holdings of technology stocks, including Apple and Alibaba, William Alden and Matthew Goldstein write in DealBook, citing regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “The filings, submitted by a Tuesday deadline, shed some light on which companies and sectors are attracting the affection ‒ or the skepticism ‒ of the so-called smart money,” they add.
Daniel S. Loeb’s Third Point, for instance, acquired five million shares of Phillips 66, a stake worth $384.5 million as of Tuesday. And Leon G. Cooperman’s Omega Advisors acquired a 2.1 million-share position in Laredo Petroleum and a 652,500-share position in Sanchez Energy. At the same time, Omega sold about 29 percent of its big stake in Sandridge Energy, ending the quarter with 32.2 million shares. ValueAct Capital Management, an activist hedge fund, acquired big new positions in Halliburton and Baker Hughes, two oil field services companies that agreed to a $34.6 billion merger in November. 
In the technology sector, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital reduced his fund’s stake in Apple by about 6 percent, to 8.6 million shares, a stake worth more than $1 billion as of Tuesday. Another hedge fund, Coatue Management, which focuses on technology, reduced its Apple holdings by about 15 percent, to 8.9 million shares, as of the end of 2014. Appaloosa Management, David Tepper’s hedge fund, sold its entire 1.2 million-share stake in Apple, as well as its stakes in Facebook and the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba.

 GREEK BAILOUT TALKS DRAG ON  |  As Greece battles its European creditors over a debt deal, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has insisted that a first step must be removing many of the austerity measures that previous governments agreed to starting in 2010 as conditions for bailout loans totaling about $274 billion, Liz Alderman writes in The New York Times. But without many of the other economic changes that Mr. Tsipras and his finance minister, Yannis Varoufakis, say they intend but need time to make, removing austerity may not be nearly enough to restore economic stability and reinvigorate growth.
“Whether the government can buy that time is the multibillion-euro question that now hangs over the ultimatum that European officials set on Monday in Brussels, insisting that Athens agree by the end of the week to continue honoring the current bailout rules while negotiations proceed or risk a cutoff of funds that could soon cause a default,” Ms. Alderman writes. The Greek government confirmed on Wednesday that it would request an extension of its loan arrangements with the eurozone, expected to be for up to six months.
With hopes that a deal will be reached soon, investors across the globe sent markets higher. In Asia, stocks closed up across the board, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index rising 1.18 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index up 0.19 percent. Markets in Europe were also up in early trading on Wednesday.
What’s really behind this big mess? Longstanding economic imbalances between Northern and Southern Europe seem finally to be approaching a breaking point, Neil Irwin writes on The Upshot. “Either Northern European governments will accept bigger fiscal transfers and higher inflation than their citizens want, or the Mediterranean nations with economic challenges will have to accept falling wages and high unemployment as they try to restore competitiveness, which their citizens very much do not want,” he writes.
