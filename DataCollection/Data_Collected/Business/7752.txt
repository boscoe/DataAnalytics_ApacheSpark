Three fires in Chile resulting in one “minor” injury prompted the automaker’s investigation, a spokesman for Chrysler, Eric Mayne, said in an email. He said eight vehicles in the United States have had the problem, but while there was heat damage, there were no fires. The recalled vehicles are the four-cylinder models of the 2011-15 Dodge Journey, and a sibling sold outside North America as the Fiat Fremont. Advertisement
