The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week to a two-month low, pointing to labor market strength that could pave the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by December.On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged but strongly signaled it could raise them by the end of the year, citing a recent pickup in economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended Sept. 17, the Labor Department said, the lowest level since mid-July.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 2,250, to 258,500, last week.AdvertisementIn a second report on Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home sales slipped 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million units in August. The organization said a dearth of properties, which had been keeping prices elevated, was largely to blame for the slump in activity.The stock of homes for sale dropped 3.3 percent to 2.04 million last month, leaving inventory down 10.1 percent from a year ago. At August’s sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.7 months in July. A six-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance.AdvertisementThe median price for a house rose 5.1 percent to $240,200 last month from a year ago.A version of this article appears in print on September 23, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fall in Weekly Jobless Claims Raises Odds of Rate Increase.
