OAS and other construction giants are laying off workers, and the country’s largest driller, Sete Brasil, has halted payments on $25 billion worth of contracts to build its rigs.The central bank estimated in December that Petrobras’s engineering subcontractors together had 130 billion reais ($40 billion) in debt to local banks and suppliers.And with nearly every major engineering and construction company under investigation, the government’s plan to attract billions in foreign investment to upgrade the country’s dilapidated infrastructure may also face difficulties.The Car Wash investigation is proving a watershed for the country’s justice system, which is showing a new appetite for punishing corruption and other white collar crime.The courts have kept 11 executives from six of the companies — among them OAS’s chief executive, José Aldemário Pinheiro Filho — in jail since November.The federal prosecutor’s office is also suing six companies, including OAS, for damages caused by corruption.Despite the company’s legal problems, OAS’s creditors are likely to get at least some of their money back. If Petrobras resumes payments, OAS will have a strong cash flow, and the company also has valuable assets. Its owns several sports stadiums and a 25 percent stake in Invepar, the company that runs Latin America’s busiest airport and the Rio de Janeiro subway system.The private equity giants Advent International and GP Investments have been reported to be interested in buying OAS’s stake in Invepar.But Omar Zeolla, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company, noted that OAS’s stake in Invepar is now the subject of a legal dispute, and he said that “bankruptcy courts in Brazil can be unpredictable and very slow.”OAS has long been famous for its political connections. The company’s founder and controlling shareholder, César Mata Pires, is married to the daughter of Antônio Carlos Magalhães, who was a three-time state governor, a two-time senator and a national power broker until his death in 2007.And OAS took advantage of Brazilian laws that permit companies to make generous donations to political campaigns.According to figures from the national electoral tribunal, OAS donated over 20 million reais to President Rousseff in 2014 — nearly 6 percent of her re-election campaign’s official budget. OAS also donated 4 million reais to Ms. Rousseff’s opponent, Aécio Neves.Police searching OAS’s offices in November found lists of presents, including luxury watches and fine wines, given to leading politicians.OAS has 60 days to present the court with its restructuring plan. The company said on Tuesday that its plan would include sales both of assets and of several subsidiaries that were not included in the request for court protection.The consulting firms G5 Evercore and McKinsey are advising OAS on its restructuring, according to a local newspaper, Folha de São Paulo.Advertisement
