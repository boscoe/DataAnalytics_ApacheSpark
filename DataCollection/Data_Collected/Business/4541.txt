LONDON — Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said on Thursday that it planned to spin off its lighting business through an initial public offering next year.The announcement is the latest move by Philips to restructure its operations and focus on growth. In September, Philips, based in Amsterdam, said that it planned to split itself into two companies: one focused on health care and technology, and the other on lighting.The company said in a shareholder circular that it would most likely offer only a minority interest in the I.P.O., “followed by one or more secondary offerings, or by one or more other transactions, with the aim of full divestment of the Lighting Solutions company over time.”Shareholders are expected to consider the spinoff at the company’s annual meeting in May.Philips said that it expected the I.P.O. in the first half of 2016, and that it would use the proceeds from the sale in part to fund growth in its HealthTech business, which is hoping to capitalize on the growing convergence of the health care and consumer sectors.The lighting business will include three divisions that cover offerings like traditional light bulbs and complete lighting systems. The business had about 37,000 employees and posted sales of 1.98 billion euros, or about $2.1 billion, in the fourth quarter.The spinoff is not expected to include the company’s automotive lighting and LED components businesses, which Philips said last year would be combined into a stand-alone company. Philips said it was in discussions with potential buyers and expected to complete a sale of those businesses in the first half of this year.A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Philips Spinoff.
