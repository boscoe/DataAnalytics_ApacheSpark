Despite finding “probable cause” to believe G.M. committed a crime or fraud by hiding the defect from regulators and the public, Judge Jesse M. Furman of United States District Court found no showing that the automaker and King & Spalding produced the documents with an intent to further such misconduct. Most of the documents related to the law firm’s advice from 2010 to 2013 on three crashes involving Chevrolet Cobalts. Vehicle owners said the deception justified a waiver of attorney-client privilege. Wednesday’s decision is a victory for G.M. as it prepares for a Jan. 11, 2016, bellwether trial over an ignition switch defect that could cause engines to stall and prevent airbags from deploying in crashes.
