AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe stock market endured its worst day in three weeks on Tuesday as investors fretted over Greece’s debt crisis and contended with a surge in the dollar.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 190.48 points, or 1 percent, to close at 18,041.54. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 21.86 points, also 1 percent, to 2,104.20. The Nasdaq composite fell 56.61 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,032.75. Two factors fed the selling. Investors remained concerned about Greece’s ability to repay its debts. And the value of the dollar surged on Tuesday, causing reverberations in several markets. Oil, gold and other commodities, priced in dollars, dropped. That pushed down the stocks of companies that do business in those commodities, such as copper and gold miners, or do most of their business outside the United States. Industrial, oil and gas, and material sector companies were broadly lower.Aside from the uncertainty over Greece, another big question for investors is when the Federal Reserve will make its first interest rate increase in almost a decade. Many expect that to occur later this year or early next year.“If you think Greece is actually in its last throes in the eurozone, it’s better to be safe and park your money in U.S. dollars and deal with the Fed’s interest rate increase down the road,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. Investors seeking safety bought United States government bonds, sending prices up sharply.
