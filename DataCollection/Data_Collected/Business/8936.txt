On the other are those who argue that with scant public or political appetite for sharing more sovereignty, Europe just has to keep muddling through with modest, incremental change.The heads of five European Union institutions proposed in June a series of steps over the next two years to reinforce the bloc’s banking union; better integrate its capital, energy and digital markets; foster economic competitiveness; and counter macroeconomic imbalances — all without changing the European Union treaty.Even those relatively low-key proposals face resistance, notably in Berlin, where opposition to any further sharing of liability at a European level is deeply ingrained.More ambitious ideas are also blossoming in Paris and at the European Central Bank’s headquarters in Frankfurt. Within days of the eurozone’s clinching a deal to keep Greece in the currency area with a third bailout, a French minister and a senior central banker called for creation of a eurozone treasury with its own budget and the power to oversee national economic and fiscal policies.The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, said Paris and Berlin would have to shed inhibitions about sovereignty and risk-sharing to “reinvent” Europe and make the eurozone work. “For the French, this means we must carry out reforms that break old habits once and for all. It also means the Germans will have to break taboos,” Mr. Macron told The Süddeutsche Zeitung. “If the member states are not ready for any form of financial transfer in the monetary union, as is the case today, then you can forget the euro and the eurozone.”Mr. Macron, a business-friendly young reformer in the French Socialist government, said a European economic government led by a supercommissioner should be able to borrow on the markets and have a separate budget — a bigger budget than the European Union now has, at about 1 percent of member states’ gross domestic product.A member of the European Central Bank’s Executive Board, Benoît Coeuré, has called for the creation of a European finance ministry with oversight by the European Parliament. The ministry would be responsible for preventing economic and fiscal imbalances, managing crises and running a eurozone budget, as well as representing euro area governments in international economic and financial institutions.The response from Germany, the eurozone’s leading economic and political power, has been cautious but not dismissive. Chancellor Angela Merkel said strengthening the euro area was likely to be an incremental process, since few governments were keen to change the European Union’s founding treaty.Berlin and Paris have been working on improving a European banking union, building a capital markets union and developing more effective governance to promote economic competitiveness, she said, and some extra financial resources could be then considered to help countries reform.It remains unclear whether France will be more willing than in the past to pool more sovereignty in fiscal and economic policy and whether Germany would then be willing to share more risk through a common eurozone budget or debt mutualization. For now, Berlin is balking even at a modest proposal for joint reinsurance of national bank deposit insurance programs.The rise of anti-euro populist parties in countries including France makes closer integration of the eurozone more politically risky, though not yet impossible. Working out what to fix is made harder by disagreement among economists and politicians still don’t agree on what caused the crisis.The standard German narrative blames profligate governments and bloated labor costs in southern countries. Hence Berlin’s prescribed solution is austerity to shrink deficits and lower wage costs to restore competitiveness. But many economists say Germany’s export boom and wage restraint opened imbalances in the eurozone, along with a surge of private debt in peripheral countries after a construction boom fueled by low interest rates and reckless lending.In that case, the solution would lie in improving domestic demand in Germany and finding ways to write off or mutualize some of the debt overhang in the crisis-stricken countries.In his first state of the union address last week, the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, acknowledged that eurozone economies had diverged during the debt crisis, with unemployment and inequality rising and growth potential shrinking, fueling public doubts about the currency.Mr. Juncker, one of the architects of the euro, promised to work on creating a eurozone treasury, built on the bloc’s existing bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, to underpin the economy.Such changes, along with making European oversight of economic and fiscal policies more binding, would require changes to the Union’s treaty that neither Germany nor France wants to raise before national elections in 2017.Economists like Paul de Grauwe of the London School of Economics worry that the modest recovery now underway will cause complacency, discouraging the architectural changes needed to correct the design flaws of the monetary union. He advocates pooling existing national debt under a common eurozone fiscal authority to reduce countries’ exposure to market swings, and creating an insurance mechanism to counteract economic shocks within the euro area.Other ideas raised at a conference hosted by the Austrian central bank on completing the monetary union included a common eurozone unemployment insurance program in crisis times, giving Brussels more power to make countries correct macroeconomic imbalances, and even — heretically — borrowing from the E.C.B. to fund public investment in infrastructure.The Austrian central bank governor, Ewald Nowotny, who hosted the event, welcomed new ideas to address the institutional flaws of the euro area but warned against “alarmism” and “dramatic undertones.”“It’s especially dangerous to say that we have to have radical change, otherwise everything will die,” he said. “We know we will not have radical change in the near future.” Paul Taylor is a Reuters correspondent.
