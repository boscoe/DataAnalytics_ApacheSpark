The stock market bounced back on Friday as investors picked up companies that had dropped earlier in the week. Major indexes recovered nearly all their losses from a sharp sell-off the day before.“It’s an odd day in the markets,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. He said the economic news out Friday was mostly disappointing, and big corporations’ earnings reports were not all that good.Expedia was an exception. The online travel company turned in sales that topped Wall Street’s estimates, driving its stock up $7.46, or 8 percent, to $101.69.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 22.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish at 2,108.29. That is after dropping 1 percent the day before.AdvertisementThe Dow Jones industrial average gained 183.54 points, or 1 percent, to 18,024.06, while the Nasdaq rose 63.97 points, 1.3 percent, to 5,005.39.AdvertisementCharlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group, cautioned against reading too much into a day with light trading. “The rally is fun,” he said, “but it doesn’t mean much.”The Nasdaq lost 1.7 percent for the week as investors sold many of the technology companies that have fared well this year. Last week, strong gains for Apple and other tech stocks helped the Nasdaq reach a nominal high. So what changed?Mr. Smith said Apple’s earnings had something to do with it. Apple is big enough that its moves can swing the Nasdaq higher or lower. Last week, investors bought Apple’s stock in anticipation of another blowout earnings report on Monday. In the three days afterward, Apple’s stock lost 6 percent.LinkedIn plunged after the online networking service warned of weaker earnings in the months ahead, a result of the stronger dollar and the company’s pending purchase of Lynda.com, an online learning company.Twitter continued a slump started earlier in the week when the company turned in disappointing sales and cut its revenue outlook. Twitter dropped $1.12, or 3 percent, to $37.84, while LinkedIn lost $46.92, or 19 percent, to $205.21.Yum Brands closed up 7 percent after Daniel Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund said it had taken a stake in the company, the parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.Charter Communications, a cable company, was up a fraction of a percent after it reported a wider-than-expected first-quarter loss on costs related to the failed Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

To some investors that is not such bad news: Weak economic growth could lead the Federal Reserve to postpone its plans to raise a key borrowing rate. Record-low interest rates have helped the stock market soar since the financial crisis.“Economic data has recently been disappointing, but that keeps the Fed offstage,” Mr. Ablin said.In Europe, the only major market open for trading was in Britain, where the FTSE 100 finished with a gain of 0.4 percent.Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.1 percent, and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4 percent.
