In an aging bull market, when investors worry that a downturn may be near, safety often trumps speculation.At that stage, “the playbook says you want stable companies with reliable earnings,” said Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer for Westwood Holdings Group. Those companies tend to be multinationals, not small companies, which tend to dominate early in a bull market.Six years after this bull market’s start, it might seem that we are already at that advanced stage.Yet as talk of a Federal Reserve rate increase began heating up this spring, shares of small companies somehow found a second wind.AdvertisementThe average fund that specializes in small, growth-oriented stocks gained 1.9 percent in the quarter that ended June 30. By contrast, the typical growth fund that focuses on blue-chip shares gained just 0.7 percent. Over the last 12 months, the average small-cap growth fund has returned nearly 10 percent. Many small stocks are up much more, including the biotech firm Immunogen; Sequential Brands Group, which recently announced the acquisition of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia; and the shoe company Skechers.AdvertisementIt’s not just in the United States; funds that focus on small and midsize companies abroad gained nearly 4 percent in the second quarter, more than twice the gains for international blue-chip stock funds.Is this a sign of renewed greed and euphoria among investors who believe the bull market is still in its infancy? Not exactly, market strategists say.Overseas, the catalyst for small stocks seems obvious. Unlike the Fed, many central banks overseas are still cutting rates and the foreign small-cap rally is a response, Mr. Freeman says. He added that this was similar to what drove small stocks higher domestically in 2009 and 2010, after the Fed began its first round of so-called quantitative easing to jump-start growth.In the United States, the reasons behind the small-stock resurgence are a bit more complicated. Part of it is psychological.“The rotation back into small caps reflects, among other things, a sense that while the Fed may start to tighten monetary policy a bit, it’s not in any rush,” said John Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer at Osterweis Capital Management. This explains why the fear of last year — when small stocks gained 5 percent, less than half what the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of blue-chip stocks returned — was dissipating, he said.

But emotions aren’t the only drivers. “In this slow-growth economic environment, investors seem to be gravitating toward those areas that have been showing stronger earnings,” said Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist for S&P Capital IQ. And small stocks have been the winners when it comes to profit growth.The consensus forecast is that profits among blue-chip companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index will grow less than 1 percent in 2015, down from 8 percent in 2014. Yet corporate earnings for companies in the S.&P. 600 index of small companies are expected to climb 13 percent this year and 32 percent in 2016.Advertisement“Large stocks collectively have a greater exposure to energy and less in financials” compared with small-cap shares, Mr. Freeman said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

This is a headwind that small companies — such as Investors Bancorp, a regional bank, or HealthSouth, a health services provider — aren’t facing to the same degree.But even if the fundamentals are sound, aren’t these shares expensive?Some strategists think so. Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, looks at valuations based on the last five years of averaged, or “normalized,” profits. By that measure, he says, small stocks are trading at a 24 percent premium to large stocks even though they’ve historically traded at roughly the same five-year normalized P/E ratios.To be sure, just a year ago the P/E of small stocks was a record 41 percent higher than for blue chips, Mr. Ramsey said. So compared with then, small stocks look more attractive today.“It’s not like there’s a speculative, frothy thing going on,” said James R. Margard, co-manager of the Rainier Small/Mid Cap Equity Fund. He added that small and large stocks have posted near identical gains over the past two years.Also, Mr. Margard noted that small stocks tended to outperform blue chips when interest rates rose. Since 1979, small caps beat the S.&P. 500 in seven of 10 periods in which yields on 10-year Treasuries have risen consistently for six months.So far this year, 10-year Treasury yields have been climbing for about five months.Mr. Margard’s confidence is rooted in his belief that the economic recovery still has legs.He added: “This has been a slower economic recovery, which points to a longer bull market.”The performance of small stocks for the next several months may tell us whether Mr. Margard is right.A version of this article appears in print on July 12, 2015, on Page BU16 of the New York edition with the headline: Small, but Still Strong.
