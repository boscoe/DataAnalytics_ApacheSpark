LONDON — The Portuguese lender Banco Internacional do Funchal will be split into a “good” and “bad” bank, with its healthy assets sold to Banco Santander of Spain as part of a state-backed rescue, Portugal’s central bank said on Sunday.The need for the rescue came after Banco Internacional do Funchal, known as Banif, had trouble repaying an injection of 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion at current exchange rates, from the Portuguese government in 2013. That deal involved the government taking a majority stake in the lender.It is the second bailout of a bank in Portugal in a year and a half. The government rescued the troubled lender Banco Espírito Santo in August 2014.Banco Internacional do Funchal will receive an injection of €2.26 billion for future contingencies as part of the new bailout, which was approved by European authorities on Monday. The Banco Espírito Santo rescue included €4.9 billion in capital.AdvertisementThe Bank of Portugal, the central bank, said the rescue and sale of the healthy assets would protect Banco Internacional do Funchal’s depositors and senior creditors and would allow “normal operation of service.”AdvertisementThe solution is the “one that best protects the stability of the Portuguese financial system,” the central bank said in a news release.The Portuguese government will contribute about €1.77 billion, and the remaining €489 million will come from a resolution fund, which is bankrolled by financial institutions.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It had about €12.8 billion in assets at the end of June, according to Portugal’s central bank.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
