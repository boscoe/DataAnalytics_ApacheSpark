AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStock indexes spent Friday drifting between tiny gains and losses, but the small moves were enough to nudge the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to its second closing high in two days.Shares of utilities were among the biggest gainers as investors weighed a mix of American economic data and corporate earnings news. The price of oil fell slightly, ending a second consecutive week nearly flat just under $60 a barrel. In contrast to Thursday’s big rally, it was a mostly listless day on Wall Street.“Often, in fact, there’s a bit of selling pressure in these situations as many people want to book some profits after these days,” said JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade’s chief strategist.The Dow rose 20.32 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,272.56. That’s within 16 points of its record set on March 2. The S.&P. 500 index gained 1.63 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,122.73. The Nasdaq slipped 2.5 points, or 0.05 percent, to 5,048.29. The three indexes remain up for the month and year.Netflix was among the big gainers in the S.&P. 500, climbing 4.5 percent after a published report said that the video streaming service is in talks to begin doing business in China. The stock rose $26.40 to $613.25.Companies reporting better-than-expected quarterly earnings or outlooks were among the big gainers on Friday. Darling Ingredients climbed $1.55, or 11 percent, to $15.64.Others failed to live up to expectations, however. Dillard’s reported weak first-quarter financial results, which pulled the department store’s shares down 7.04 percent. The stock fell $8.74 to $115.46. Keurig Green Mountain sank 8.55 percent as investors worried that the company’s new cold-drink machine is priced too high. The stock fell $8.81 to $94.26. Separate reports on Friday offered a mixed assessment of manufacturing in the United States. The Federal Reserve said factory activity in New York increased slightly in May, suggesting that manufacturers are beginning to adapt to the challenges caused by a stronger dollar, lower oil prices and restrained consumer spending. United States industrial output fell for the fifth straight month in April. The trend suggests that weakness in manufacturing and mining are weighing heavily on the economy.Other reports this week have also shown diverging trends for the American economy. The Commerce Department’s retail sales report for April fell short of Wall Street’s forecasts. But the latest figures on applications for unemployment aid and inflation were more encouraging.“This week, on balance, the economic reports have been a little soggy,” said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. “We’re muddling through, and the market is just fine with that.”Investors are gauging how well the economy is doing as they try to anticipate when the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates for the first time in more than six years. Many economists don’t expect the central bank to increase rates before September.Seven of the 10 sectors in the S.&P. 500 index rose, led by utilities, though that sector remains down 6.7 percent this year.
