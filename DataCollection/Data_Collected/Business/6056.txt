Here is a sampling of some of those events and the promoters that own them, either in full or in partnerships.Mr. Zachary was most recently a managing director at the Raine Group, the merchant bank that specializes in advising and investing in technology, media and telecommunications companies.While there, he advised Live Nation on transactions like its acquisition of C3 Presents and a partnership with Vice, the upstart media empire. (He is a director of C3 and is an observer on the board of Vice.)He previously worked at Lehman Brothers and UBS.“As we continue to drive our global market share, bringing on Jordan who has deep expertise in the live music and media industries will help us accelerate the growth of our concerts flywheel and find additional ways to build our high-margin on-site, advertising and ticketing businesses,” Michael Rapino, Live Nation’s chief executive, said in a statement.Advertisement
