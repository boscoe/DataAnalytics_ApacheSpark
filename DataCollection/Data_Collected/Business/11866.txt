Oil prices were steady on Monday, holding last week’s gains on speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries might agree to cut production to reduce a supply glut that has pushed prices to the lowest in over a decade. Nigeria’s oil minister said there was a growing consensus within OPEC that a decision must be reached on how to prop up prices. Russia, which is not an OPEC member, said Monday it was in talks on coordinated output cuts with individual OPEC members, mainly Venezuela.

United States crude oil futures rose 29 cents to $29.73.A version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Oil Prices Hold Steady as OPEC Weighs Next Move.
