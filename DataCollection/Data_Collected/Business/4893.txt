The official account of the European Central Bank’s last policy meeting shows top officials expressing determination to stick with the full 1.1 trillion euros, or $1.2 trillion, of their planned stimulus — even though the 19-country eurozone economy shows signs of finally picking up. The minutes of the March 5 meeting of the bank’s governing council in Cyprus, released Thursday, showed that “all the members” agreed there was “no room for complacency.” Members emphasized that the stimulus, which involves buying €60 billion in government and corporate bonds each month with newly created money through September 2016, “had to be fully implemented and supported by appropriate communication.” The stimulus started March 9 and has sent the euro plunging against the dollar, which helps eurozone exporters but hurts earnings for American companies doing business in Europe.A version of this brief appears in print on April 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: European Central Bank Firm in Backing Stimulus.
