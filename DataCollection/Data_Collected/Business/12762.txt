AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe U.S. stock market capped a week of mostly light trading Thursday with its first weekly loss since mid-February.A slide in banks and other financial services companies pulled the market broadly lower for much of the day. By late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite recaptured losses from earlier in the day.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, a broad measure of the stock market, stayed in the red. Oil prices fell.Trading was relatively quiet ahead of the Easter holiday weekend. U.S. markets will be closed Friday for Good Friday.“Volume is very light today, probably the lightest that we’ve had in a month,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “That can skew markets in either direction.”The S.&P. 500 index slipped 0.77 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,035.94. The Nasdaq added 4.64 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,773.50. The Dow rose 13.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to 17,515.73.Coming into this week, the stock market had mounted a five-week string of gains that helped reverse some of Wall Street’s hefty losses from the market’s stumbling start to 2016.The market’s rebound gained momentum last week, when the Federal Reserve announced that it would slow the pace of interest rate increases this year, citing worries about the global economy.But this week, some Fed bank presidents made public comments that suggested the pace of rate hikes might not be slowed after all.One Fed official, James Bullard, president of the St. Louis Fed, pointed to a broadly unchanged economic outlook and said a case could be made for a possible rate hike next month if the next round of jobs data exceed official targets.The remarks drove up the value of the dollar against other major currencies, pushing down commodity prices. It also helped point stocks lower from the get-go on Thursday, as investors fretted over the impact on U.S. exports.“It makes the market nervous and it suggests that perhaps there’s dissent at the Federal Reserve,” Mr. Krosby said.A government report indicating that orders to U.S. factories for long-lasting manufactured goods fell 2.8 percent in February didn’t help.Financial stocks took the biggest hit. The sector pared some of its early losses, but still ended the day down the most among the S&P 500 index’s 10 sectors, 0.7 percent.Prudential Financial lost $2.07, or 2.8 percent, to $70.76, while Morgan Stanley shed 34 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $24.93.

The natural gas producer fell the most among stocks in the S&P 500 index, tumbling 91 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $15.35.Several companies also moved on earnings news. Sportsman’s Warehouse sank 11.3 percent after the company released a disappointing forecast. The stock shed $1.56 to $12.23.Others fared better. Signet Jewelers rose 2.9 percent after the retailer posted solid quarterly results and its annual profit forecast was better than expected. The stock added $3.41 to $121.42.KB Home also reported strong first-quarter results. The homebuilder gained 83 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $13.93. And PVH, owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, rose $6.66, or 7.6 percent, to $94.29 after it reported better-than-anticipated quarterly profit and revenue.Meanwhile, Office Depot and Staples vaulted on mounting optimism that a court will allow the office supply competitors to combine even though regulators oppose the deal.
