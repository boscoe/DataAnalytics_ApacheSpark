TaubWhen a consumer wants to end a car lease early, and the leasing company isn’t willing to budge, brokers like Swapalease.com may provide a way out.The company, and others, like Leasetrader.com, will try to match lease sellers and buyers.Swapalease typically has about 5,000 vehicles listed around the United States, and it typically takes 30 to 40 days to find someone to take over a lease, said Scot Hall, the company’s executive vice president.Potential sellers pay $60 to Swapalease for a standard listing, which includes a single photo. If the lease is successfully transferred, there is an additional $150 charge.Higher-price packages include 12 photographs, eliminate the success fee and put the vehicle in a higher listing position on the Swapalease website.It is not a surefire method. For one thing, the makers of some vehicles, including Land Rovers leased through the Land Rover Financial Group, and Volvos leased through Volvo Car Financial Services, do not allow transfer of leases.Even if the company does allow a lease transfer, the original lessee may remain liable for the new lessee’s payments if that person defaults, damages the vehicle or drives over the allotted mileage.And many finance companies do not allow leases to be transferred during the first or last months of a lease. Swapalease maintains a list of vehicle manufacturers’ leasing policies.There may be additional costs. To increase the likelihood of finding someone to take over a lease, it is often necessary to offer some sort of cash incentive.In addition, the auto financing company may charge a lease transfer fee, which is typically paid by the person unloading the lease. That fee varies by state and can be as much as $595 in the case of a Fiat Chrysler, General Motors or Mercedes vehicle leased from the companies’ financing arms, or as low as $75 in the case of Ford.Advertisement
