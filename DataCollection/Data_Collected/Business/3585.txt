And a surprisingly strong growth figure for Germany suggested a possible turning point for a region still seeking to shrug off the hangover from the financial crisis.The combined gross domestic product of the 19 nations in the eurozone grew 0.3 percent in the October-December period from the previous quarter, said Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency. That was slightly more than the 0.2 percent economists had expected.On an annualized basis, the eurozone’s 1.4 percent expansion was well behind the 2.6 percent posted by the United States economy for the same period, though even that figure is not particularly strong by American standards.Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, said it appeared that “domestic demand was the main growth driver” in Germany, where growth came in twice as fast as many economists had expected — at a 0.7 percent quarterly rate, or 2.8 percent annualized.While the breakdown of the data will not be available for two weeks, the report is “a clear sign that lower oil prices have found their way into consumers’ pockets,” Mr. Brzeski said.The latest figures were met with a sense of relief, with the news sending the Dax index in Frankfurt over 11,000 for the first time, though it eased back in afternoon trading. The European blue-chip index was up 0.9 percent. The euro was little changed against the dollar, at $1.14.Despite a downbeat G.D.P. report for Greece, markets rallied in Athens on hopes of a compromise in the debt standoff between the government and its international creditors, possibly ending a serious threat to the euro.Clemente De Lucia, an economist at BNP Paribas, said that over all, the data on Friday showed that things were looking up for the eurozone. He pointed in particular to a report showing that retail sales in December rose by a solid 2.8 percent from a year earlier, and were “particularly buoyant in Germany and Spain.”The available information “suggests that the recovery is definitely strengthening,” Mr. De Lucia wrote in a note.Reinhard Cluse, an economist at UBS in London, said the danger now was of an “upside surprise,” where the eurozone grew much more in 2015 than the 1.2 percent he had been anticipating.Germany’s growth figure on Friday was matched by Spain’s, which had already been reported. As expected, the Italian economy was stagnant, and France eked out quarterly growth of just 0.1 percent. The economies of only three eurozone members, Cyprus, Finland and Greece, contracted.Germany is the largest eurozone economy, and its consumers have the most untapped purchasing power, so a sustained increase in spending could help to provide the demand that Europe has been lacking.The reasons for optimism include the strength of the United States economy and the weak euro, both of which help European exports, as well as the European Central Bank’s easing monetary policy, and the impact of falling oil prices on consumer spending.For a region that has not regained its footing since the 2008 financial crisis, a pickup would be welcome news.The jobless rate in the eurozone has been hovering above 11 percent for months, and there is little hope that the labor market will turn around in the near term, economists say.Perhaps more worrying, inflationary pressures are absent. Consumer prices have fallen for two consecutive months, raising fears that Europe may be slipping toward a phase of declining prices. Though economists note that a decline in crude oil has weighed on prices, the danger of a self-reinforcing, growth-destroying period of deflation cannot be ruled out.That concern led Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, and his colleagues on the bank’s Governing Council last month to announce that they would begin a program of large-scale bond purchases in March, vacuuming up 60 billion euros, or about $68 billion, in debt each month, including government bonds.The program, known as quantitative easing, is meant to bolster the economy of the currency bloc by restoring credit and encouraging investment.The eurozone makes up around 17 percent of the global economy, according to World Bank data, but its failure to recover from the 2008 financial crisis has made it the sick man of the world economy.Economists warned that there remained substantial clouds over the eurozone in the form of the Ukraine crisis, as well as Greece’s high-stakes negotiations over its debt repayment.Greece was among the disappointments in the G.D.P. report. Its economy shrank by 0.2 percent in the quarter, defying expectations of a modest increase after three straight quarterly gains.More than six years after the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek economy is now 28 percent smaller than it was at the end of 2008, and unemployment remains at depression levels. Still, it did grow in 2014, expanding by 0.8 percent for its first annual growth in six years.Finance ministers from the 19 countries using the single currency were scheduled to meet Monday in an effort to narrow their deep differences with Greece, trying to assess whether there was room for a compromise between the troika of bailout monitors — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — and the new Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis.James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels, and Niki Kitsantonis from Athens.Advertisement
