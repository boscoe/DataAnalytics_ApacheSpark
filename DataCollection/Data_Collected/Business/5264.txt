WASHINGTON — Housing starts in the United States rose far less than expected in March and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region grew modestly this month, suggesting the economy could struggle to rebound from a soft patch in the first quarter.The economy stumbled at the start of the year under the weight of a harsh winter, a resurgent dollar, weaker global growth and a labor dispute, which has been resolved, at the West Coast ports.There are expectations that growth will rebound in the second quarter, but the lukewarm data on Thursday suggested the momentum would probably not be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates before September.“The economy’s tepid recovery in March makes it very unlikely the Fed signals a June rate hike at the April meeting,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York. “If housing doesn't recover enough this spring, a September rate hike likely becomes equally improbable.”

A measure of orders for manufactured goods fell to its lowest level since May 2013, while shipments remained in contraction territory despite some improvement.
