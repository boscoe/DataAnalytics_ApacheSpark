Dos Equis is replacing the gray-haired spokesman known as the “Most Interesting Man in the World” with another actor. The Mexican beer brand said on Wednesday that the Most Interesting Man commercials would continue this year without Jonathan Goldsmith, the 77-year-old actor who has appeared in the ads since 2007. “I feel terrific, I really do,” he told The Associated Press. “I’ve had a great time in the last 10 years.” In Mr. Goldsmith’s last commercial, he is shipped off in a rocket on a one-way trip to Mars. He utters the beer brand’s slogan — “Stay thirsty, my friends” — as the rocket takes off. Andrew Katz, the brand’s vice president for marketing, says Dos Equis is making the change to attract younger drinkers. A successor has been chosen, but Mr. Katz declined to identify the person. Dos Equis is owned by Heineken, based in Amsterdam.A version of this article appears in print on March 10, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Dos Equis Is Replacing Actor in ‘Most Interesting Man’ Ads.
