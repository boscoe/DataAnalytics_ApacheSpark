Until recently, awareness of the Zika virus was largely limited to readers of infectious diseases guides who made it to the last page.That group did not include Jennifer Durst Lussier of Indianapolis, who bought plane tickets for $1,300 with her husband last autumn for a one-week vacation starting Feb. 27 in Antigua. She also spent $98 for travel insurance from Allianz Global Assistance.It didn’t do her much good.As the trip approached, the Lussiers began hearing about the mosquito-carried virus that can harm pregnant women — and their unborn children. The condition is most prevalent in South America.“Then it blew up in the news media,” said Ms. Lussier, whose daughter is due on Aug. 5.The World Health Organization declared Zika a public health emergency and urged expectant women to avoid visiting affected areas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention echoed the recommendation and declared its highest level of alert on travel — only the fourth time it had issued such a warning for health reasons.AdvertisementWhen their obstetrician implored them to reconsider, the Lussiers canceled the trip and sought payment from Allianz. They were denied.Advertisement“When you start reading the fine print,” Ms. Lussier said, “it doesn’t cover hardly anything unless you died.”The couple discovered what many others with travel insurance have also learned.Standard policies usually do not include coverage for calling off a trip even if the traveler is at heightened risk from a disease outbreak. Even a letter from a patient’s doctor might not sway the providers.“If you are going to buy a policy, take a look at it,” said Jim Grace, chief executive of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison website that advises customers on policies that fit their specific needs or concerns and matches them with providers.“There’s a reason,” he added, if a plan does not cost much.The safest bet, experts say, is to buy a more comprehensive package, known as cancellation for any reason. But those policies typically cost about 20 percent more than other policies and will cover only 75 percent of your cancellation penalties, said Dan Skilken, the president of Tripinsurance.com, which sells policies from four of the largest insurance underwriters in the United States.He added that travel insurance had not covered past outbreaks of global viruses or even epidemics, from the SARS case in Asia in 2002 to Ebola in West Africa two years ago.Natasha Wiest of Slidell, La., supplemented the $1,912 she paid for three tickets for her family of three to travel this month for her best friend’s wedding in Belize with a $123 policy from Transamerica Casualty Insurance.At her recent 20-week ultrasound, Ms. Wiest mentioned the trip to her obstetrician, who responded, “Can you go to California instead?”AdvertisementShe canceled the trip, and has yet to receive a refund.“They didn’t flat-out say no,” Ms. Wiest said, but she was told that pregnancy alone was most likely not grounds for accepting a claim that she still intends to file.“They don’t specifically say in their plan, yes or no, that they are going to cover this specific disease,” Ms. Wiest said. “It’s kind of written vaguely.”Mr. Grace agreed with her view. “These are not user-friendly policies to read,” he said.A spokesman for Transamerica said that plans vary and that not all of them include pregnancy as a coverable condition. The company offers a refund for any transaction within 10 days of the purchase.Adding to the misunderstandings is that many policies are obtained on an airline’s website or on a site like Expedia when the plane tickets are acquired and that buyers do not devote time to pore over what is covered.The for-any-reason plans generally charge 10 to 12 percent of the cost of the trip, according to Mr. Grace, while lesser options run about 4 to 8 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Their claim for a refund was turned down, he said, because the policy was written to pertain only to the days for their ticketed flights.
                Why scientists are worried about the growing epidemic and its effects on pregnant women, and how to avoid the infection.            “They are not in the business of willingly paying claims,” he said.Travel policies are available that cover medical costs, but those generally are purchased separately from policies that refund the cost of a trip.AdvertisementSome 20 to 25 percent of travelers obtain trip refund insurance, according to Mr. Grace, with transactions spiking on occurrences like the terrorist bombing in France last November. The Zika virus has not generated quite the same reaction, but he said that inquiries to InsureMyTrip have jumped 20 percent in the last several weeks.His company offers 300 policies, including some tailored to pregnant women, through 30 insurance providers.Countless vacations — including many “babymoons” by couples before the birth of a child — have been waylaid by worries over the virus.The website BabyCenter, which caters to expectant women, posted a question on whether planned travel would be called off because of the virus. Of 1,137 responses, 582 (51 percent) indicated they would cancel and another 249 (22 percent) were undecided.Kristin Fisher of Cypress, Tex., was trying to get pregnant when she and her husband in January arranged a delayed honeymoon to St. Lucia for this month. Her physician advised her not to travel. She tried to collect on insurance but was told by the insurer, Allianz, that nothing less than being quarantined would meet the policy’s stipulations.“Now I know insurance is a joke,” said Ms. Fisher, who is now pregnant and has no intention of buying insurance again. “I wasted $256 on something that was completely worthless.”A spokesman for Allianz said that some policies allowed for cancellation if a physician advised a traveler to do so. The policy would have to have been purchased before Jan. 19, before the Zika virus became what is called a known event, and the destination should generally be included on the C.D.C.’s list of affected countries.AdvertisementSome travelers expressed surprise that, after being turned down on insurance, their appeals for refunds to the airlines were approved. As a whole, the airline industry has become less reluctant to grant refunds.Ms. Lussier voiced relief that Delta returned the entire amount of her family’s outlay for tickets.The Lussiers have transferred their babymoon to late April in Italy, where the virus has created no alarm.She is shopping for travel insurance.Julie Creswell contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Travel Insurance Unlikely to Cover Zika Risk.
