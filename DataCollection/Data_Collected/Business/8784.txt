Lufthansa failed in a legal bid to halt a pilots’ strike planned for Wednesday that has resulted in about 1,000 flights being canceled, as the airline’s dispute with crews escalated. The pilots’ union Vereinigung Cockpit staged a strike on long-haul routes on Tuesday and called another walkout for Wednesday on short-haul flights. “We cannot rule out further strikes this week,” a union spokesman, Markus Wahl, said on Tuesday. “Strikes are possible in the following weeks as well.” The strike, the pilots’ 13th in the last 18 months, forced the main Lufthansa brand to cancel 84 of about 170 long-haul flights on Tuesday and about 1,000 flights — or two-thirds of its schedule — on Wednesday. It drew a defiant response from Lufthansa, Germany’s largest airline, which said it would not take on any new pilots under current German collective labor agreements. Lufthansa’s bid to stop the strike via a temporary injunction, however, was rejected by a Frankfurt court on Tuesday.A version of this brief appears in print on September 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Court Rejects Lufthansa’s Bid to Stop Strike by Pilots.
