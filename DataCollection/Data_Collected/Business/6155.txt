His firm, X2, which has raised $5.6 billion in capital, may now be in a prime position to swoop in if South32’s shares slide. But he would have to borrow around $10 billion to be able to snare South32, including a premium.“That’s a big, risky bet,” Mr Walsh said.South32, named after the line of latitude joining its main assets in Australia and South Africa, fills a gap between the mega-miners and minnows, and offers a diverse suite of assets.“We believe that our regional model will enable us to improve our productivity and performance in a sustainable way,” Graham Kerr, South32’s chief executive, said in a statement.South32 shares began trading at 2.13 Australian dollars, or $1.70, compared with a range of 2 dollars to 3 dollars forecast by analysts. The shares ended their first day of trading at 2.09 dollars.BHP Billiton shares fell 7.3 percent, the biggest loser on the Australian stock market, which was lower overall, with miners leading the drop because of a firmer Australian dollar.“There is appetite for that real good size, midtier, just below the BHP’s and Rio’s,” said Matthew Keane, a resources analyst at Argonaut Securities in Perth, Australia. “For that reason it’ll attract interest.”South32 will also trade on the London market and Johannesburg stock exchange. Trading could be volatile in the first few days as British institutions that cannot hold the stock because it won’t be included in FTSE indexes may be forced to sell.Advertisement
