Tuch, an associate professor at the School of Law of Washington University in St. Louis, said that the ruling rejected the lower court’s characterization of investment bankers as “gatekeepers.”“It is a nuanced opinion in which the court affirms the lower court decision, sends a powerful message to disloyal investment banks, but also provides investment banks with comfort, provided they act transparently and forthrightly,” he said.Still, the case does highlight the close relationship that Wall Street investment bankers have with the private equity firms they court for business.At issue is the lower court’s ruling last year that found RBC Capital Markets, a part of Royal Bank of Canada, liable for its role advising the board of Rural/Metro, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., in the company’s sale to Warburg.Wall Street has been closely watching the case. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an industry trade group, filed a brief in support of RBC. It said the case injected an “unprecedented level of uncertainty” in the merger market.The class action was filed in 2011, after Rural/Metro’s all-cash sale to Warburg for $438 million. The Delaware Court of Chancery concluded that RBC persuaded Rural/Metro’s board to accept the offer from Warburg without telling the board it was trying to win a role in Warburg’s financing of the transaction.Joel Friedlander, a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs, said on Monday “the court properly found liability on the illicit manipulation of the board’s deliberative process for self-interested purposes,” reflecting the language in the higher court’s decision.Randall Baron, another lawyer for the plaintiffs, said, “This is a phenomenal result for former Rural/Metro shareholders, as well as all shareholders of public corporations going forward.”A spokeswoman for RBC said in a statement, “We are disappointed with the court’s determination but respect its decision.”Delaware has taken bankers to task on conflicts before. Barclays was criticized in 2011 for advising Del Monte in a sale while helping to finance the buyer’s purchase. And Goldman Sachs was rebuked in 2012 for its role as adviser to El Paso Corporation in its sale to Kinder Morgan, in which Goldman’s buyout unit held a significant stake.Advertisement
