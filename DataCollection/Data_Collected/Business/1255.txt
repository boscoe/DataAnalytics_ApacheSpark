KFC said it would start delivering its buckets of fried chicken to customers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It will be the first time the chicken chain has delivered in the United States. KFC said it expected to expand the delivery service into Houston by the end of this year, and more cities may come later. Customers make orders through the online delivery company DoorDash’s app or website. The chicken won’t come cheap: There’s a delivery fee of between $4.99 and $6.99, depending on a customer’s location, and prices of some items will be higher than those in the restaurants. All menu items at the restaurant will be available to order, the companies said.A version of this brief appears in print on November 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: KFC to Offer Home Delivery for Those Willing to Pay More.
