SFX Entertainment, the concert company founded by the media mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman to capitalize on the electronic dance music craze, may go private, less than a year and a half after its initial public offering.Wednesday morning, SFX disclosed that Mr. Sillerman had made a proposal to the company’s board to pay $4.75 in cash for each outstanding share of the company that he did not already own.Mr. Sillerman’s offer on Tuesday came after a punishing run for SFX’s stock, which went public in October 2013 at $13 a share. Since then, it has trailed downward, lately hovering around $3 a share. It closed up 29 percent Wednesday, to $4.78.The company has quickly grown to be a major player in the concert business, with full or part ownership of a range of events like Tomorrowland, Disco Donnie Presents and Rock in Rio, which will make its American debut in Las Vegas in May after 30 years of putting on huge events in Brazil and Portugal. SFX also owns Beatport, a digital store and online hub for electronic music, which recently introduced a free streaming version to compete with outlets like Spotify.AdvertisementYet SFX has also struggled with losses. In its most recently reported financial quarter, which included summertime, when many of its biggest events take place, the company had $2.7 million in net losses on $143.6 million in revenue. SFX’s major competitors include Live Nation Entertainment, whose portfolio of festivals includes Electric Daisy Carnival and Lollapalooza, and AEG Live, which has Coachella.The scale of Mr. Sillerman’s offer was not immediately clear. In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he reported that he owned about 40 percent of the company. SFX’s shares were up about 25 percent in morning trading on Wednesday in response to the news.AdvertisementWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
