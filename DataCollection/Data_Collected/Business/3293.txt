LONDON – Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund and Brookfield Property Partners said on Thursday that they had received enough support from investors to move ahead with their $3.9 billion offer for the owner of the Canary Wharf office and retail development.Investors holding more than 94 percent of the outstanding shares of Songbird Estates have agreed to accept the offer, including a 28.6 percent stake held by the wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority. Songbird Estates is the controlling owner of Canary Wharf Group, which operates the complex in the east of London.The Qatar fund, Songbird’s biggest shareholder, and Brookfield now plan to proceed with a compulsory buyout of the Songbird shareholders who have not accepted their offer, Brookfield said on Thursday in a news release.The announcement marks the culmination of a fight over Songbird that has lasted months.Brookfield and the Qatar group first approached Songbird about a takeover in November, but were rejected by its board of directors.They ultimately began a hostile bid for the company, offering to pay 3.50 pounds a share in cash, a proposal that valued Songbird at 2.6 billion pounds, or about $3.9 billion.Songbird’s board repeatedly asserted that the company’s adjusted net asset value was an estimated £3.81 a share. But last Friday, the board recommended that investors accept the offer after it became apparent that no competing bids were coming and that Brookfield and the Qatar fund had received enough support from major shareholders for the bid to probably succeed.Shares of Songbird were unchanged at £3.49 a share in early trading in London on Thursday.The Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield said on Thursday that they also planned to make an offer for the shares of Canary Wharf Group not held by Songbird.Songbird acquired a controlling stake in the Canary Wharf Group in 2004 and delisted its shares. It holds a 69.37 percent stake in the company, while Brookfield has a 22.1 percent interest in the group.Franklin Mutual Advisers, which owns about 7 percent of Canary Wharf Group, indicated it would be willing to accept a cash offer for its holdings, Brookfield said.The Qatar fund and Brookfield have offered to pay £6.45 a share in cash for each outstanding share in Canary Wharf Group.The Canary Wharf development, built in a district once known for its docks, has 34 office buildings and nearly 700,000 square feet of retail space.It is the London home of some of the world’s biggest banks, including Barclays, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. More than 100,000 people work there.
