LONDON – A trader who reportedly once spent more than $300,000 on drinks on a single night out was sentenced to seven years in prison after he was convicted of fraud in an investment scheme that authorities say took in 5 million pounds, or about $7.55 million, from investors.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain said that the trader, Alex Hope, promised large returns for investors from foreign exchange trading from March 2011 to April 2012 but suffered heavy losses and spent more than £2 million on himself.Mr. Hope was convicted of a single count of fraud in London this month after pleading guilty in April 2014 to operating a collective investment scheme without authorization.“Alex Hope presented himself as a trader with a flair for trading on the foreign exchange markets when in reality he spent a good deal of his investors’ money on himself,” Georgina Philippou, the F.C.A. acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a statement on Friday.The Daily Mirror, a tabloid newspaper, reported in 2012 that Mr. Hope spent more than £200,000 on Champagne during a night out in Liverpool, including £125,000 on a single bottle.He was arrested about a month after running up the large bar tab.Mr. Hope, who represented himself, couldn’t be located for comment on Friday.The F.C.A. accused Mr. Hope of improperly using investor money on designer watches, foreign travel and nights out, including more than £600,000 in bars and nightclubs in London, Miami and New York. He also spent more than £1 million in a casino, the F.C.A. said.Despite telling his investors that he would trade their money successfully in the foreign exchange markets, Mr. Hope used only about 12 percent of the money invested with him for trading and lost most of the money he did trade, the F.C.A. said.
