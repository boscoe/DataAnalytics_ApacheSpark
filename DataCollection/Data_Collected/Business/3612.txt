LONDON – SNS Reaal, a state-owned Dutch financial services company, said on Monday that it had agreed to sell its Vivat Verzekeringen insurance arm to a unit of Anbang Insurance Group of China.The Chinese company will pay 150 million euros, or about $172 million, for all of Vivat’s shares, SNS Reaal said.Anbang would also inject €770 million to €1 billion into Vivat and assume €552 million in debt, according to NL Financial Investments, which manages the Dutch state’s investments in SNS Reaal and other companies nationalized during and after the financial crisis.“We welcome the investment of Anbang in the Dutch insurance sector,” Gerard van Olphen, the SNS Reaal chairman, said in a news release. “Through the sale, Vivat will fulfill an important role in further expanding the insurance activities of Anbang in the Netherlands.”The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year.SNS Reaal also said it would reshape its SNS Bank unit into a stand-alone business, most likely by transferring it to the Dutch government at the time of the Vivat transaction.In a news release, Anbang said it was confident it could “provide a solid foundation for Vivat, its customers and its staff,” and that the Chinese company could “benefit from the ongoing consolidation in the Dutch insurance sector.”SNS Reaal was nationalized by the Dutch government in February 2013.
