That means borrowing costs will remain low for a while, a prospect that has typically helped stocks. But some investors, expecting the Fed would be confident enough to nudge rates up by at least a quarter of a point, interpreted the stand-pat stance as a sign that the global economy was dangerously weak.“If growth in the strongest economy — the United States — isn’t strong enough to raise rates even a quarter of point, what does that say about the prospects for global growth?” said Bill Strazzullo, chief strategist at market research firm Bell Curve Trading. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 290.16 points, or 1.7 percent, at 16,384.58.

Gold also gained.Julian Emanuel, a UBS strategist, said a mix of other factors also may have fed the selling Friday, including a slowdown in China, an expected decline in third-quarter earnings and the prospect that a dispute in Congress next month over funding for Planned Parenthood could lead to a government shutdown.“When you add up the Fed, China, the cloudy earnings outlook and possibly a government shutdown, it’s not a surprise that the market has had a defensive reaction,” Mr. Emanuel said.In Europe, Germany’s DAX fell 3.1 percent while the CAC-40 in France dropped 2.6 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 ended the day 1.3 percent lower.Among United States stocks making big moves, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.71, or 2.7 percent, to $60.94 as investors judged that extending lower interest rates meant banks would not be able charge more for loans.
