James B. Lee Jr., the vice chairman and top deal maker at JPMorgan Chase, received a call about six weeks ago. Could he meet with General Electric’s top management?Both he and Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief executive, went to meet with Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive; Jeffrey S. Bornstein, its chief financial officer; and Keith S. Sherin, the chief executive of GE Capital, its finance arm.Along with Centerview Partners, they received a bombshell assignment: the divestiture of most of GE Capital. And it would be a sprint.The ambitious campaign will be led primarily by only two firms, both in line to claim large fees and great prestige. Both JPMorgan and Centerview have been longtime G.E. advisers, having played prominent roles on some of its biggest deals.AdvertisementShrinking GE Capital is no small task. G.E. has said that it plans to reduce the size of the lender, one of the biggest in the country, to roughly $90 billion in assets from the $363 billion it was valued at last year.AdvertisementThe campaign will include a huge number of business sales, including prime businesses like GE Capital’s enormous commercial lending arm, one of the largest servicers for middle-market companies. Soon after G.E. announced its plan on Friday, calls from prospective bidders eager to put their names in for particular assets flooded the advisers’ phones.The idea of selling parts of the lender is nothing new. Mr. Immelt has said for years that shrinking his company’s financial arm was a priority. Various plans have existed under various code names for at least the last three years, according to people briefed on the process. (What was announced on Friday was given the project name “Hubble,” these people added.)For JPMorgan, which was named global coordinator for the disposition plan, the shrinking of GE Capital will be the latest in a long string of assignments. It advised G.E. on its sale of NBC Universal to Comcast, and last year it helped lead the spinoff of GE Capital’s retail finance arm, now known as Synchrony Financial. Mr. Lee led the bank’s team, which eventually swelled to about 50 bankers.And for Centerview, a boutique investment bank whose client list includes big names like 21st Century Fox and PepsiCo, the GE Capital plan will be another plum assignment. Leading the charge for the firm was one of its co-founders, Blair Effron, who advised on G.E.’s $13 billion takeover of the energy assets of the French conglomerate Alstom.Both JPMorgan and Centerview had already been performing well in the rankings of deal advisers, having advised on some of the biggest deals of the year. JPMorgan now ranks third on Thomson Reuters’ league tables for the year to date, while Centerview ranks sixth, above larger rivals like Credit Suisse and Citigroup.No single event served as a catalyst for G.E.’s move, according to the people briefed on the process. Instead, the company had worked to shore up its mainstay businesses — manufacturing things as varied as jet engines and complex medical devices — which now grow at a steady clip. But executives felt that such work, as well as previous asset sales that included the once-iconic appliances unit, were lost on the market.Moreover, the company felt increasingly constrained by its financial arm, which like other lenders has suffered from far less growth than in the past. Significantly increasing its earnings meant expanding GE Capital’s balance sheet and taking on more risk, as well as asking the industrial businesses to keep bolstering their performance.

And the company was ready to take advantage of a way to shed its designation as a “systemically important financial institution” — the official name for a lender deemed by the government as too big to fail. The so-called SIFI status imposes additional restrictions and requirements upon companies, potentially limiting their earnings growth.AdvertisementBut selling off GE Capital became enticing as what one person involved in the process called an “off-ramp,” bolstering G.E.’s argument to financial regulators that it should lose the SIFI classification.Over the years, Mr. Immelt and his board held off pursuing what they thought would have been a “fire sale” of the financial businesses. But with potential buyers constantly popping up with reasonable offers, as well as improvements in the main business and the possibility of removing the SIFI designation, now was the time to move.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The conglomerate’s executives — “the two Jeffs,” Mr. Sherin and Daniel Janki, the treasurer of G.E. and GE Capital — led the process, including daily meetings that stretched for hours, the people briefed on the matter said.“They’re a SWAT team,” one of these people said.Helping make the process easier was both the huge amount of work that G.E. had put into various versions of a GE Capital divestiture and its detailed information on all its operations spread out across 175 countries.With G.E.’s mind made up, one of the first potential deals that came up was the disposal of most of the finance arm’s real estate holdings. The most obvious buyer was the Blackstone Group, one of the biggest buyers of properties on Wall Street.The deal team, which included Bank of America and Kimberlite Advisors, called the head of Blackstone’s team, Jonathan D. Gray, and offered him the opportunity to buy exclusively, as long as he was willing to move fast and pay up.“We told him, ‘If you can hit this bid on an exclusive basis, it’s yours,’” Mr. Sherin told DealBook on Friday.Mr. Gray responded quickly, setting up what became the $26.5 billion worth of real estate deals announced on Friday.AdvertisementMore sales will come. While G.E. has allowed itself two years to carry out the plan, the company’s executives and advisers anticipate that a huge portion of the deals — particularly for assets in the United States — will be finished by sometime next year.The company is also confident that subsequent sales will generate attractively priced offers. Even before Friday, according to the people briefed on the disposal process, the biggest private equity firms around the world have asked whether the GE Capital division that lends to leveraged buyouts would ever come up for sale.Other potential buyers include financial institutions around the world, including big American lenders and Canadian, European and Japanese banks eager to snap up businesses as they go up for auction.“It’ll be a food fight,” one of the people briefed on the process said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
