And among the region’s larger banks, the Tier 1 capital ratios of the Italian lender UniCredit, Barclays of Britain and Deutsche Bank of Germany would all fall below 8 percent in the hypothetical crisis.The tests, by the European Banking Authority, were conducted at a pivotal time for the region’s lenders.Financial markets, and bank stocks in particular, have been rattled at times in recent weeks by the uncertainty stemming from Britain’s vote on June 23 to leave the European Union.The European Union said on Friday that the growth in the economy in the eurozone slowed in the second quarter, an unwelcome sign for banks that are already grappling with a decline in trading revenue.Concern is growing about the ability of Italy’s banks to deal with hundreds of billions of euros in problem loans.And one of Europe’s largest banks, Deutsche Bank, has been under pressure from investors as its chief executive, John Cryan, tries to turn it around.The latest tests examined the balance sheets of 51 European banks, representing about 70 percent of the region’s banking industry.Unlike tests in previous years, this round did not have a minimum capital threshold that lenders had to meet to pass. As a result, no bank could actually fail, or pass, the examination. But the higher the capital ratio, the stronger the bank.Local banking supervisors like the Bank of England and the European Central Bank will use the results to determine whether banks need to take additional action, such as raising capital.“While we recognize the extensive capital-raising done so far, this is not a clean bill of health,” said Andrea Enria, the chairman of the European Banking Authority. “There remains work to do, which supervisors will undertake.”Under this year’s examination, bank balance sheets were tested against the impact of a macroeconomic downturn over three years, in which real gross domestic product would decline by 1.2 percent in the European Union in 2016, fall by a further 1.3 percent in 2017 and recover slightly in 2018.The banks examined this year had an average capital ratio of 13.2 percent as of the end of December 2015.The ratio declined to 9.4 percent by 2018, the third year of the hypothetical crisis.By comparison, European banks in the European Banking Authority’s last stress test two years ago had a Tier 1 ratio of 11.1 percent at the end of 2013.The biggest impact came from credit losses; banks across the region suffered cumulative losses of €349 billion. The results also forecast market risk losses of €148 billion and a cumulative loss of €105 billion from so-called conduct risk.The examination also found that the average return on regulatory capital for banks in the test sample was 6.5 percent at the end of 2015, which is below the cost of equity and return on equity that banks consider sustainable long term, the regulator said.“This data shows that profitability remains an important source of concern and a challenge for the E.U. banking system, in a context of continued low interest rates, high level of impairments linked to large volumes of nonperforming loans, especially in some jurisdictions, and provisions arising from conduct and other operational risk related losses,” the European Banking Authority said in its report.In 2014, the regulator examined the balance sheets of 123 of the region’s lenders, identifying 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and that would need additional buffers to be prepared for an economic downturn.This year’s tests involved a much smaller number of lenders, though the regulator said it covered 70 percent of the banking sector in Europe.No banks from Greece or Portugal were included, and many of Italy’s smaller lenders were spared.The stocks of Monte dei Paschi and other Italian banks have been under pressure in recent months over concerns about the sheer size of nonperforming loans on their books, some €360 billion.According to the Bank of Italy, about €210 billion of those loans are held by insolvent borrowers, and an additional €150 billion are loans that are considered unlikely to be repaid, past due or in breach of an overdraft ceiling. Some of those loans could ultimately be repaid.After write-downs, the amount of bad loans falls to €87 billion. Some €50 billion of those are backed by assets with a value estimated at €85 billion, the central bank said.New European rules, adopted after the financial crisis, have made it harder for the government to step in and devise a solution.Those rules require bondholders to shoulder much of the losses before a government-backed bailout can be put in place, a process known as a bail-in. That could have a major impact on the confidence of investors in Italy, as many small investors there hold bank bonds.This year, Italy’s government helped orchestrate the creation of Atlante, a private fund intended to help shore up the capital in Italy’s banks and buy nonperforming loans.Advertisement
