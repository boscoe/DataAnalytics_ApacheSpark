The story of Gawker versus Hulk Hogan — or, perhaps more accurately, Peter Thiel — has some asking whether press freedom in the United States is in peril if a scorned billionaire can help deliver a crippling blow to a media company.But since Mr. Thiel spoke to The New York Times on Wednesday about his reasons for funding the lawsuit against Gawker, the debate surrounding the dispute has expanded to encompass ideological battles in media, technology and politics.A variety of observers, including other billionaires and figures involved in GamerGate, have entered into the fray to address themes like Mr. Thiel’s political motivations, and the wider issue of Silicon Valley power players and their involvement with the news media.Several journalists felt that Mr. Thiel’s political views and connection with Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, could be worrisome based on Mr. Trump’s previous comments about changing libel laws to make it easier to sue media outlets.AdvertisementJane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota and the former executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that the Gawker case may raise the stakes for press freedom.Advertisement“It’s often the scrappy, unconventional news outlets that challenge conventional wisdom, and in doing so, they serve an important purpose,” Ms. Kirtley said. “But they are also very vulnerable financially. It’s expensive to defend suits like this.”Clara Jeffery, the editor in chief of Mother Jones, a left-leaning political magazine that recently won a long and costly defamation case filed by Frank VanderSloot, an Idaho billionaire and major Republican donor, said that the case was unsettling. (Mr. VanderSloot said, in a statement made last October at the time of the court decision, that he would “help pay for the legal expenses of people who have been defamed by Mother Jones,” pledging a million dollars to the cause.)“Combined with press consolidation, or ever-greater influence among the 0.0001 percenters, it is a little unnerving,” she said in an interview.“The circumstance that brought on the lawsuit could not be more dissimilar,” Ms. Jeffery said, referring to her magazine’s case. “But what is similar is the pattern of press intimidation.”Many New York Times readers debated what the case meant for the news media in the 21st century.“It sends a message to other media outlets to watch who and what they’re writing stories about,” Superamerickson of Minneapolis wrote. “Don’t investigate rich people or you’ll get shut down.”
            Peter Thiel, who secretly funded the lawsuit against Gawker, is a delegate for Trump, who wants to change libel laws to sue more journalists        
            A billionaire secretly suing a publication into oblivion is a million times bigger threat to free speech than 'safe spaces'        
            Peter Thiel, "primary supporter of the Committee to Protect Journalists," tries to destroy online news site. Can't make this stuff up.        Well-known figures in Silicon Valley began to dissect Mr. Thiel’s political motivations publicly and debate whether it was appropriate for outside parties to fund lawsuits like the one brought against Gawker.Nick Denton challenged the financier, Peter Thiel, who has bankrolled lawsuits against Gawker, to a debate about journalism.Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote on Twitter that “Greenpeace and Sierra Club, among many other progressive groups, routinely fund other plaintiffs’ lawsuits,” and linked to a post from the economics blog Marginal Revolution.AdvertisementPierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay who in 2013 created First Look Media, a studio and digital media company, drew a connection between Mr. Thiel’s actions and past comments from Mr. Trump.
            So Thiel agrees with Trump's plan to muzzle press that criticizes government, obviously. That's why he supports him? https://t.co/YsYFSV7emR Jack Doppelt, a media ethics professor at Northwestern University, called Mr. Trump a “great example” of a wealthy figure who has used the civil legal system to his advantage, and added Mr. Thiel to that group.“Donald Trump knows that if he sues somebody for something, it will drown the other side,” Mr. Doppelt said. “He’s got the resources to be able to do that. It’s a real distortion of what we want our civil legal system to be about.”Some New York Times readers argued that the case was the latest example of a flawed justice system.“This is nothing short of terrifying,” a reader identified as CL wrote. “Gawker has definitely crossed the ethical line at times ... but the idea that powerful billionaires can essentially launch a crusade against a media outlet they don’t like is not good.”Hugh Nations, a reader in Austin, Tex., wrote that the case “starkly illustrates the most fundamental flaw in our ‘system of justice.’”“Whether the case is civil or criminal, the key to the courthouse door is the dollar bill.”Mr. Thiel’s involvement in the Gawker case and his apparent support of Mr. Trump place him at an extraordinary intersection of American political currents.The Hogan case had become a cause for online groups like GamerGate, a loose movement that started in opposition to perceived problems in video game journalism but has since become a broad and often aggressive campaign against the news media and what members refer to as “social justice warriors.”Disdain for the media, but especially for Gawker, is a theme in online communities supporting Mr. Trump, less for controversial reporting than for perceived promotion of an agenda of social justice and “political correctness” — a subject Mr. Thiel has written about extensively.(Mr. Thiel wrote a book with David O. Sacks, a former PayPal colleague and now chief executive of Zenefits, titled “The Diversity Myth,” about his time at Stanford University.)AdvertisementMr. Thiel has written extensively about his particular brand of libertarian politics, giving new supporters a rich array of material to engage with. “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible,” he wrote in a 2009 essay. In a 2012 interview with Francis Fukuyama, author of “The End of History and the Last Man,” Mr. Thiel said, “Properly understood, political correctness is our greatest political problem,” citing the writings of the political philosopher Leo Strauss.
            Thiel supports wrong candidate - attack his freedom of speech! Thiel supports plaintiff against Gawker - he's attacking freedom of speech!
