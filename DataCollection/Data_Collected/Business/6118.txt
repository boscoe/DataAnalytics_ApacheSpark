When Mortimer B. Zuckerman paid $36 million in cash to rescue The Daily News from bankruptcy in 1993, he was convinced that he could make the paper successful. “I’m not suicidal,” he said.Maybe not, but he appears to be at least a little bit masochistic. Over the last 20-plus years, Mr. Zuckerman has watched circulation and advertising plummet, turning a marginally profitable asset into a big-time money loser. All the while, he has been engaged in a bruising asymmetrical newspaper war with a rival press baron, Rupert Murdoch, owner of The New York Post. In the face of all this, Mr. Zuckerman, 77, has been criticized, repeatedly, for taking The Daily News down-market in an effort to attract readers.Mr. Zuckerman, who earned his fortune in commercial real estate, decided recently that enough was enough. This year, he put the paper up for sale, retaining the Wall Street firm Lazard to help advise him in the process.Final bids are due this week, though this is less a bidding war than a matter of how much liability a potential buyer is willing to assume. Interest seems light. Wealthy people are typically drawn to media properties as a means to expand their influence. But as the influence of a property diminishes, so does its appeal to prospective owners.AdvertisementOnly 25 years ago, The Daily News had more weekday readers than any other newspaper in America, with a daily paid circulation that easily exceeded one million. As of March, that number had dropped to 312,736.
                The Daily News has been a fixture of New York City life for almost a century.            These days, a struggling newspaper hardly qualifies as news; dozens of papers around the country have shut down in recent years. But the fate of The Daily News carries a unique symbolic weight. The News is the model of the big-city, elbows-out tabloid, a local paper with a national profile. Superman worked there, or Clark Kent did, anyway: The lobby of the Daily News Building on 42nd Street, with its massive, rotating globe, was the basis for the headquarters of The Daily Planet in the movie “Superman.” The paper was the inspiration for “The Paper.”So who wants to buy this journalistic institution? For years, the most likely candidate appeared to be Mr. Murdoch, the assumption being that he would simply shut it down. But Mr. Murdoch, 84, already loses tens of millions of dollars a year on The Post. And judging from the most recent acquisitions of the Murdoch-controlled media company News Corporation — a real estate listings site and a romance novel publisher — his interest in newspapers is limited.AdvertisementLast week, Reuters reported that James Dolan, the head of Cablevision and Newsday, had withdrawn his $1 bid for the paper. (A Daily News spokesman said Mr. Dolan never made a formal bid, so there was nothing to withdraw.)That leaves three likely bidders: John A. Catsimatidis, the supermarket magnate; Jimmy Finkelstein, a New York entrepreneur; and Jon Peters, a hair stylist-turned-Hollywood-mogul. None have ever run a daily newspaper. The closest is Mr. Finkelstein, the owner of The Hill, which reports on Congress.Mr. Zuckerman declined to be interviewed for this article, and the sales process for The News is secret, making it tough to handicap. It is clear that Mr. Catsimatidis, the owner of the New York City grocery store chain Gristedes, is not afraid of expensive, quixotic quests. He spent $11 million on a long-shot mayoral candidacy in 2013, proposing, among other things, an alternative to extending the city’s subways, a monorail system he called the Aboveway.Mr. Catsimatidis is the only bidder to publicly acknowledge his interest in The News, and the only one to take or return a call seeking comment. What sort of appeal does a money-losing newspaper hold? “Maybe I want to be Walter Cronkite when I grow up,” he said.Discussing the future of The Daily News, he conjured images of what he described as a “virtual newspaper.” And he didn’t mean a smartphone app.“Let’s say you wake up in the morning and it’s snowing,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. “You don’t want to run down to the newsstand and buy a newspaper. So you press a button and you get a virtual two-page image in front of you, the complete paper with the advertising.”The idea is maybe not so much more fanciful than that of a tabloid newspaper when The News first hit the streets of New York in 1919. At the time, it was one of 18 newspapers in the city, but between its subway-friendly size, image-heavy design and punchy copy, it was soon a first-read for many New Yorkers.A strike in 1945 made it impossible for The News to deliver papers to newsstands, so people came to The News to get them. Over the course of the 17-day delivery stoppage, more than 4.4 million copies were bought at the News Building, according to a 1961 history of the paper, “Tell It to Sweeney.” On Saturday night, after the Sunday paper had been printed, the line of buyers, four abreast, stretched 17 blocks. Sunday circulation peaked in 1947 at 4.7 million.The front-page headline — “the wood” in tab-speak — became a disposable form of pop art, the day’s biggest story boiled down to a few perfectly chosen words. The News called itself “New York’s Hometown Newspaper,” and for many years, few would have disputed the claim. “If there is a quintessential New Yorker,” former Mayor Edward I. Koch once said, “it would not be a human being, it would be The Daily News.”AdvertisementThe News’s commitment to the city’s working class was quite literally written in stone. Etched above the entrance to the News Building, which was built in 1930 at a cost of about $150 million in today’s dollars, is the second half of a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln, “God must have loved the common man, he made so many of them.” The quote is still there, but The News moved out of the building as a cost-cutting measure some 20 years ago.Over the decades, the paper’s populist spirit has been manifest in its aggressive coverage of the city — always delivered with the maximum amount of drama — and channeled by a chorus of columnists like Jimmy Breslin, Pete Hamill and Michael Daly.“When The News was really trying to do stories that resonated with the great middle class of New York, they could do it better than anybody” said Tom Robbins, a longtime investigative reporter at the paper. “You felt a visceral connection with your readers, and that was a precious thing to have.”The News has not abandoned hard-hitting journalism; when it lands a punch, it is still felt in the corridors of power. Last year, a series on the low wages of airport workers prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to demand raises on their behalf. In more recent years, though, Mr. Zuckerman has imported a series of British-style tabloid editors to spice up the paper, which has struck some News veterans as a betrayal of its legacy.If the paper has at times seemed conflicted about its identity, the Daily News website has shown no such ambivalence about fully embracing Fleet Street sensationalism. (“Magazine in hot water over sexy pic of ‘YouTube Sensation,’ ” read one prominent headline on Saturday.)This has been a boon for web traffic, bringing in as many as 40 million visitors in one recent month, according to The News. But it has not solved the paper’s economic problems. The Daily News will not discuss its finances, but it is said to be losing about $20 million a year. It has not helped matters that Mr. Zuckerman made a costly gamble on print in 2007, committing to spend more than $150 million on new high-speed presses that started operating in 2009.It is a tense time at The Daily News, but the paper has been on the brink before. In 1991, it was rescued from a 21-week strike by the British press baron Robert Maxwell. (“ROLL ’EM,” read the wood on the day the paper resumed publication.) In a matter of months, Mr. Maxwell had become a tabloid story in his own right; his body was found floating in the Atlantic after he had disappeared from his yacht. It soon emerged that he had plundered more than $1 billion from his companies’ pension funds.The paper was put into bankruptcy protection. It continued publishing, but before Mr. Zuckerman came along, things were looking dicey. A group of reporters had buttons printed: “Daily News: Too Tough to Die.”AdvertisementThey might come in handy in the coming weeks.An earlier version of this article misstated the role of John A. Catsimatidis in the grocery store chain Gristedes. He is the owner, not the founder.A version of this article appears in print on May 18, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: The Daily News Still Awaits a Savior .
