RADIOSHACK FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY  |  RadioShack has filed for bankruptcy, but is poised to live on in a diminished form, Rebecca R. Ruiz and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook. The Chapter 11 filing, in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware on Thursday, had long been expected for the 94-year-old electronics retailer, which has not been profitable since 2011. Sprint and the hedge fund Standard General agreed to buy 1,500 to 2,400 of RadioShack’s 4,000 company-owned stores in the United States. Sprint is expected to run special “store within a store” departments in up to 1,750 of those stores. As so-called stalking-horse bidders, Sprint and Standard General will have to compete with potential rivals in a court-supervised auction. The remaining company-owned stores will then be closed.RadioShack, which once sold one of the first mass-market computers, has been rocked by the digital revolution. With hopes of a turnaround, the retailer hired Joe Magnacca ‒ a former president of Duane Reade ‒ as chief executive in 2013. But the decline continued. Last year, the company closed 175 stores and scrambled to refinance its debt last fall. Standard General, its biggest shareholder, provided $120 million in liquidity, which helped keep the retailer solvent for the 2014 holiday season. The electronics chain listed $1.2 billion in assets and nearly $1.4 billion in total debt.

 ALLY AIMS FOR PROFIT  |  Despite booming auto sales, which could signify a great year for banks that make auto loans, some investors seem glum about Ally Financial, one of the nation’s largest such lenders, DealBook’s Michael Corkery writes. The bank’s share price is down 16 percent since it went public in April. And on Monday, its chief executive, Michael A. Carpenter, retired abruptly.
“The shake-up at Ally is the latest phase in the company’s seemingly perpetual state of reinvention,” Mr. Corkery writes. Recently, Ally, formerly GMAC, has been vowing to bolster its auto lending business, the latest turn for the company after separating from General Motors and paying back the last of the Treasury’s $17.2 billion investment. In recent months, it had become clear that Mr. Carpenter was not the best leader for the future, according to people briefed on the board’s thinking. The board had become frustrated that the company had stagnated, one of these people said, and Mr. Carpenter seemed to lack the vision to guide Ally out of its current challenges.
Mr. Corkery adds: “One of the company’s shortcomings under Mr. Carpenter is something that taxpayers and regulators might consider a virtue: Its lending practices have been too conservative.” The board is now allowing the company to increase its number of nonprime auto loans, which can be more profitable than the prime, lower-interest-rate loans that Ally focuses on. Although they may result in a higher profit, Ally’s plans to increase riskier lending come at a time when regulators are raising concerns across the industry about the boom in subprime auto loans.



PFIZER BETS ON NEW GENERICS  |  With its bid to acquire Hospira, announced on Thursday, Pfizer is making a $15.2 billion bet on the drug industry’s new, more elite class of generics, David Gelles and Katie Thomas write in DealBook. In its offer, for $90 a share, or $17 billion including debt, Pfizer is paying for what it believes will be a lucrative source of future revenue, drugs known as biosimilars ‒ generic drugs seeking to copy expensive and more complex drugs called biologics that until now have largely been immune from competition in the United States.
Although biosimilars have been available elsewhere for years, including in Europe, they have not arrived on the market in the United States because the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any. But that may be about to change. As a result, Mr. Gelles and Ms. Thomas write, “Pfizer is wading deeper into a market that is seen as potentially lucrative because biosimilars, while offered at a discount from the expensive drugs they are mimicking, are expected to sell for higher prices than their traditional generic cousins.”
Analysts question whether the drug lines will fit into Pfizer’s business model, particularly given Hospira’s high share price and the steep premium Pfizer is paying on top of it. Still, the deal comes at a critical time for Pfizer. Some of Pfizer’s best-selling drugs lose patent protection soon, and the company will have to make up for lost sales. This is also the company’s first big move since last year’s failed attempt to buy AstraZeneca for more than $100 billion. Pfizer is looking toward Hospira to increase its earnings per share. But in the end, the deal may lead to an eventual breakup of Pfizer.



IT’S JOBS DAY  |  Economists expect the unemployment rate to fall to 5.5 percent when the Labor Department releases its January figures at 8:30 a.m. The consensus expectation on Wall Street is for employers to have added 235,000 jobs last month, but some optimists are looking for a considerably bigger number if the momentum from 2014 carried over into 2015.

BOARD STRIFE AT GFI  |  Dysfunction at the GFI Group goes on, with open warfare appearing to break out on the New York brokerage firm’s board, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column, citing a filing on Thursday in a Delaware court. The filing comes on the heels of two GFI news releases, on Jan. 30 and on Feb. 2. GFI had been trying to sell itself to the CME Group before GFI shareholders rejected the deal in favor of a higher offer from Howard W. Lutnick’s BGC Partners.
The court filing indicates an apparent schism among GFI’s independent and management directors after shareholders rejected the CME takeover. An email exchange disclosed in the filing seems to be saying that, with respect to the Jan. 30 news release, the directors knew about it, and may have discussed it at a board meeting, but did not authorize it. “As for the Feb. 2 release, the two directors were not even given the courtesy of participating in the deliberations over whether to issue it,” Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. 
“No doubt, GFI will respond to this filing, but in the meantime it is losing the public relations battle, if not the actual one,” he adds. “GFI shareholders are left to sit and wonder what is going on, questioning whether they are being kept in the dark, and possibly misled, by their own management.”
