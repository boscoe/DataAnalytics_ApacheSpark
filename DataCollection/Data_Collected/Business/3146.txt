The stock market capped a rough month on Friday, delivering its third loss in five days and extending its declines for the year.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3 percent in January, its worse monthly performance in a year. While the economy continued to show signs of strength, energy companies suffered from a sharp drop in oil prices. The earnings of some big multinational companies were dented by a stronger dollar.On Friday, investors also weighed the consequences of a report showing a slowdown in growth, and how further strength in the dollar could affect corporate profits.“The real issue still is the confusion, the uncertainty around the speed of decline in oil prices and what that means, and the rise in the dollar and what that means for earnings,” said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.AdvertisementThe concerns about a surging dollar intensified after Russia’s central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to 15 percent from 17 percent to help the weakening economy.
