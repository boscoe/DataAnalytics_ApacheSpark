Malone, over exchanging assets between the companies.The announcement is the first time that Vodafone, the world’s second-largest operator by subscribers after China Mobile, has confirmed discussions with Liberty Global. Market speculation about a potential deal has circled the two telecom companies for months.Just as in the United States, where the cable and wireless industry is undergoing a new round of consolidation, Europe has also experienced a number of multibillion-dollar takeovers, as the region’s companies like Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Telefónica of Spain have jockeyed for position.Vodafone has been at the center of this deal-making, but it has come under increased pressure to bolster its limited cable and broadband offerings across its main European business. Its rivals like BT, the former British telecom monopoly, have started to offer so-called quadruple-play services of fixed-line phone, mobile phone, high-speed Internet and pay TV.On Friday, Vodafone said that it was talking with Liberty Global about potentially exchanging assets, though it declined to say which units may be part of any deal. The company added that it was not in talks to combine all of its assets with those of Liberty Global, and that the talks might not lead to a deal.Vodafone’s share price fell 1.9 percent in early trading in London.The announcement came weeks after Mr. Malone, whose American cable business Charter Communications has agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $56 billion, told Bloomberg News that there could be “substantial synergies” if Liberty Global combined its European units with those of Vodafone.Both companies have significant operations in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain. Antitrust regulators, however, may force Liberty Global and Vodafone to sell off assets if they agree to a deal, to ensure customers’ choice is not reduced.Vodafone’s assets in Europe are primarily in wireless, which would complement Liberty Global’s broadband services in the region. But analysts said it was unlikely that Mr. Malone would want to gain control over Vodafone’s sizable operations in emerging markets like India and South Africa. That is because Liberty Global does not have operations in those countries and could not benefit from the cost savings and other advantages of combining local units.Vodafone reported a 4.7 percent drop, to 25.9 billion pounds, or about $39.6 billion, in its European service revenue in the 12 months through March 31, as Vodafone responded to the region’s continuing economic malaise and to low-price offerings from rivals. Service revenue refers to sales from voice, data and messaging services.In contrast, service revenue for Vodafone’s emerging markets division rose 5.8 percent, to £12 billion, over the same period, as the unit benefited from the increasing use of smartphones to access the web.Advertisement
