AdvertisementSupported byBy Danielle IvoryVirginia has decided to begin replacing certain roadside guardrails, including some made by Trinity Industries, a company that has been accused of making a defective rail.A series of crash tests of Trinity’s ET-Plus guardrail that were overseen by Virginia’s Department of Transportation included one conducted at a shallow angle that the agency said had raised concerns.The agency expects to begin replacing at least some, if not all, guardrails no later than fall 2016, targeting places where crashes could be more severe, like high-speed roadways. The agency said it may also be replacing some guardrail units that were not made by Trinity.“We’re taking action to reduce the severity of crashes and save lives,” said Charles Kilpatrick, the department’s commissioner.Jeff Eller, a Trinity spokesman, said the ET-Plus was still accepted for federal reimbursement, and that the company supported Virginia’s move to “crash-test the current version of all guardrail end terminal products using its nonstandard criteria.”Installation of any new ET-Plus guardrails remains banned by Virginia. The state has been replacing the guardrails when damaged, about 270 so far. According to the state’s transportation department, there may be between 11,000 and 15,000 ET-Plus guardrails on state roads. Replacing a guardrail costs about $5,000 to $7,500, the state said.Only one guardrail has been tested and approved so far under newer, more stringent guidelines. It too is made by Trinity. Another company’s product has been tested, but not yet approved.More than 30 states, including Virginia, suspended purchase of the guardrails last year after a jury in a 2013 whistle-blower case decided that Trinity had defrauded the federal government when it failed to disclose potentially hazardous design changes.Trinity, which had voluntarily stopped shipping the guardrail, said in October that it would resume sales. The Justice Department and the Transportation Department have begun a joint criminal inquiry into Trinity. At issue is the guardrail’s end terminal, a flat piece of steel at the front that, on impact, is meant to glide along the rail, pushing it safely out of the way.In 2005, Trinity narrowed the channel behind the head, possibly causing the system to jam, state officials have said. When that happens, the rail may ram through the vehicle itself, potentially injuring occupants.Advertisement
