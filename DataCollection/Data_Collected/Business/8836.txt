A strong morning rally for stocks turned into an afternoon sell-off on Wednesday, reminding investors that the market has not smoothed out recent volatility.Stocks started the day with sharp gains on optimism that policy makers in Asia would do more to help bolster growth in the region. Japan’s stock market logged its biggest advance in almost seven years after comments from the country’s prime minister raised expectations of more measures to shore up economic growth.The stock market then drifted gradually lower after a classic good-news-is-bad-news moment. A government report released at midmorning showed that the number of available jobs jumped 8 percent in July to the highest level in 15 years. That added to evidence that hiring remained strong and might prompt Federal Reserve policy makers to raise interest rates at their next meeting later this month.By the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had swung more than 400 points from its peak of the day. The index surged a day earlier, logging its second-best day of the year.AdvertisementThe report “poured a bit of cold water on the market,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, a senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management. “We will definitely have some more volatility, but that’s part of a normal market.”
