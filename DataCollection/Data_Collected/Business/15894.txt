United States markets wavered toward the end of the day on Wednesday, and closed slightly lower. As Apple led technology companies higher, energy companies were trading lower as the price of oil continued to slip. Trading was fairly calm after three days of big, erratic moves.KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 0.2 percent lower and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.4 percent.MARKET SWINGS Investors have sent stocks in different directions as they wonder if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week and speculate about the health of the global economy.Bond prices also reflected that confusion as they changed direction again, with yields falling and prices rising. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.68 percent. A day ago, it rose to 1.73 percent, the highest point in almost three months.AdvertisementThe fall in bond yields helped high-dividend utility companies, which became more appealing to investors seeking income. Consolidated Edison stock added 1.2 percent, and shares of Duke Energy gained 40 cents to $79.09.AdvertisementPLANT A SEED After four months of public negotiations, the seed and weed killer maker Monsanto agreed to be bought by the German drug and farm chemical company Bayer. Bayer’s latest offer is worth about $57 billion in cash. Bayer makes a wide range of crop protection chemicals that kill weeds, bugs and fungus, while Monsanto is known for its seeds business and the weed killer Glyphosate. Bayer’s share price was up 0.3 percent and Monsanto shares gained 0.6 percent.TECH TIP TOP Apple stock picked up 3.5 percent for its second day of big gains. Apple shares rose on Tuesday after T-Mobile said it was getting strong preorders for the new iPhones. Apple receives most of its revenue from the iPhone, and those sales, while still enormous, have finally started to decline in the last year. That has hurt Apple stock, which traded above $130 a little more than a year ago.Other gainers included shares of the customer-management software developer Salesforce.com, which added 1.3 percent.
