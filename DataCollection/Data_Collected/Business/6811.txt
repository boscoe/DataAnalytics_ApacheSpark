WASHINGTON —  American factory output slipped in May, hurt by a decline in oil refining that overshadowed solid gains by automakers.The Federal Reserve said on Monday that manufacturing output declined 0.2 percent last month, as productivity has basically been flat since January. Manufacturing has been hurt by the stronger dollar, higher oil prices reducing equipment orders and activity at refiners, and previously by cold winter weather at the start of the year.“Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar’s rise for some time yet,” said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.Overall industrial production — which includes utilities and mining — fell 0.2 percent in May. Mining activity that covers oil and natural gas drilling tumbled for the fifth consecutive month, while output at utilities increased slightly.AdvertisementIn the manufacturing category, fossil fuel refining and chemical production dropped last month, as did the food, beverage and tobacco sector. The declines reinforced the possibility of a prolonged slump, as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York separately reported Monday that its Empire State manufacturing index fell to negative 2 in June. Any reading above zero indicates expansion.

Shipments grew, but at a slower pace. A gauge of hiring ticked up as manufacturers in the state added jobs at a faster pace.AdvertisementThe dollar has risen 18 percent against a basket of international currencies in the last year. That makes American goods more expensive overseas and makes imports cheaper, hurting sales in the United States and internationally. This puts more of the pressure on consumer spending to increase economic growth.In a sign of consumer strength, auto production rose 1.7 percent, according to the Fed’s industrial production figures. The third consecutive monthly improvement at auto plants is among the signs of a broader factory comeback.“We are not surprised by the sluggishness of manufacturing, and it does not change our view that the consumer will be at the forefront of the economy over the next year,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.More people are buying autos. Cars and trucks sold last month at an annual pace of 17.8 million — the fastest monthly rate since 2005, according to the industry analyst Autodata. The greater demand could keep assembly lines humming at auto plants.

Its index of manufacturing activity rose to 52.8 last month from 51.5 in April. That is the highest reading since February.

Measures of current sales conditions and traffic by prospective buyers surged.
