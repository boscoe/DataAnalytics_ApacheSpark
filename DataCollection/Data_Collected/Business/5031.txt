AdvertisementSupported byBy Jad MouawadAmerican Airlines and US Airways received their single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday, an important step in the integration of the two airlines.The merger between the airlines closed in December 2013, but the carrier still operated separate American and US Airways flights.The approval, which took 18 months, means that American and US Airways flights will use the same maintenance, dispatch and operational procedures across their fleets.The call sign used by US Airways pilots to communicate with air traffic controllers – “Cactus” — was also retired. All flights will now operate under the call sign “American.”Passengers will not see much change. Flights will still be operated under the American and US Airways brands until the carriers merge their reservation and passenger ticketing systems this year. Once that is done, the US Airways brand, ticket counters and website will change to American.Advertisement
