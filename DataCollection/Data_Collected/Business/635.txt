AdvertisementSupported byBy Liz MoyerFoundations and endowments are considering making private investment deals on the side rather than committing additional money to funds run by big private equity firms, according to a new survey by NEPC L.L.C., a Boston consulting firm that advises institutions on their investments.The survey found that foundations and endowments believe these so-called co-investments will improve returns and give them better access to top fund managers.In a co-investment, the investor puts up money alongside a private equity firm where the investor also invests in one or more funds. Co-investments in a sector of interest or specialty are typically offered by private equity firms to their better customers.Institutional investors are saying “I can get more juice out of my private equity investments if I go in on a manager’s best ideas through a co-investment,” says Kristin Reynolds of NEPC.Popular co-investment options include buyouts, because they can be researched extensively, NEPC says. Growth companies or turnaround situations are less common, it said.While only 23 percent of foundations and endowments surveyed currently use co-investing strategies, another 12 percent said they were considering it, a number that has been rising in recent years, Ms. Reynolds said.Co-investing fees are about half that of investing in a private equity fund, NEPC research says. Typically a big private equity fund charges investors a 2 percent annual management fee and 20 percent of profits, and a midsize one will charge 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent annually and 20 percent. A co-investing arrangement would be 1 percent/10 percent, NEPC says.Managing expenses seems to be important, as 48 percent of the survey respondents said they expected lower returns from investments in private equity in the foreseeable future. Some 38 percent said they thoughtcurrent private equity valuations were higher than the historical average. The survey was conducted online from late September through early October and had 58 respondents.Advertisement
