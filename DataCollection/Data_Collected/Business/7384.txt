But it said that Depomed, a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on products to treat pain and other conditions of the central nervous system, had rejected its approaches.The offer of $29.25 a share represents a 42 percent premium to Depomed’s closing price of $20.64 on Monday.“We have elected to bring this proposal to the attention of Depomed’s shareholders, who we expect, given the opportunity to understand the financial, strategic and operational benefits of this transaction will support it and will encourage their board and management to begin constructive discussions with us promptly,” Timothy P. Walbert, the Horizon Pharma chairman, president and chief executive, said in a news release.If completed, the transaction would add to a string of deals by Horizon Pharma in the past two years.Depomed confirmed that it had received an “unsolicited, highly conditional, non-binding” proposal to acquire the company, which was identical to previous takeover approaches by the Horizon Pharma.“The Depomed board, after careful consideration and in consultation with its financial and legal advisers, unanimously determined that it was not in the best interests of Depomed or its shareholders to pursue the prior proposal,” the company said in a news release. “The board is confident that continuing to execute on its strategic plan is the best path forward for the company and its shareholders at this time.”In 2014, Horizon Pharma agreed to acquire Vidara Therapeutics International for $660 million in cash and stock, and Hyperion Therapeutics of California for $1.1 billion in cash in March.Horizon Pharma said that the strategic and financial benefits of a deal for Depomed were “highly compelling” and would create “substantial long-term value” for Depomed’s shareholders.Depomed, based in Newark, Calif., makes products including Nucynta, which helps manage severe pain. The company posted sales of $114.2 million in 2014 and has about 450 employees.The health care sector has drawn numerous mergers and acquisitions this year, particularly among pharmaceutical companies.Horizon Pharma, based in Dublin, makes rare-disease drugs such as Actimmune, which is used to help reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with chronic granulomatous disease. It reported sales of $297 million in 2014 and has more than 630 employees.Advertisement
