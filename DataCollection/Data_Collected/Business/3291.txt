IDEA OF FORGIVING GREEK DEBT RETURNS  |  Talk of slashing the government debt loads of European countries, beginning with Greece, is back, DealBook’s Peter Eavis writes. “For all the opposition, the idea has resurfaced with a vengeance in recent days as the new government in Athens, facing a cash squeeze and aiming to make life easier for its citizens, looks for immediate ways to reduce what it owes,” he adds.Debt forgiveness remains an explosive issue. But with Europe grappling with staggeringly high unemployment and stubbornly low growth, showing some mercy on debt may yet gain ground. Writing down debt allows governments to spend less money servicing their obligations, freeing up funds for more stimulus spending. “It may also bolster overall confidence in a nation, laying the groundwork for more investment,” Mr. Eavis writes.The pressure on Greece increased on Wednesday when the European Central Bank decided that it would no longer accept Greek government bonds as collateral for loans, saying that it was not confident the country could meet its bailout requirements. The move jarred markets in the United States late in the trading day. European markets were little changed on Thursday morning, halting a three-day advance. The Greek stock market tumbled as bank shares fell. Asian stocks finished the day mostly lower.So how big a deal is the E.C.B.’s decision?Lorcan Roche Kelly of Bloomberg Business writes: “All together, the move from the E.C.B. should have very little immediate effect on the Greek banks ‒ provided there is not a complete loss of confidence in the Greek banking system in the coming days ‒ and should be viewed as what it is: The E.C.B. is pressuring the Greek government.”“The E.C.B. is flexing its muscles,” Karl Whelan, a professor of economics at University College Dublin, writes on Medium, and giving notice that it is “very close to pulling liquidity from Greece but no funds have been withdrawn yet.”

 SPLIT AT S.E.C. OVER WAIVERS  |  After Oppenheimer & Company’s latest regulatory infraction on Wednesday ‒ one of at least 30 over the last decade ‒ some regulators are questioning whether the government has enabled a cycle of misbehavior, DealBook’s Ben Protess reports. The regulators, Kara M. Stein and Luis A. Aguilar, Democratic members of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized their own agency for allowing Oppenheimer to avoid certain repercussions for its actions.
Although Oppenheimer settled a case last week that set off a so-called bad actor ban, which automatically disqualified it from most private offerings of securities, the S.E.C. issued a waiver from that ban. Ms. Stein and Mr. Aguilar voted against the waiver. The commission’s three other members, including two Republicans and the chairwoman, Mary Jo White, voted to support it. The dissent “delivered the latest salvo in a fight over the S.E.C.’s waiver policy, a once-obscure debate that now hangs over most every enforcement case, often presenting an obstacle to settlement,” Mr. Protess writes.
“The issue has pitted the commission’s liberal wing, which has channeled a populist uproar over Wall Street misdeeds, against the two Republican commissioners,” he adds. It also creates a conundrum for the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary Jo White, the deciding vote, “whose reputation as a tough-on-crime former federal prosecutor helped her sail through Senate confirmation.”

CAESARS CHIEF TO STEP DOWN  |  Gary Loveman, the longtime chief executive of Caesars Entertainment, the casino operator whose biggest unit recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, plans to step down from that role, the company said on Wednesday. His successor, Mark P. Frissora, the former chief executive of Hertz, will join the board of Caesars immediately and take the reins of the company on July 1. Mr. Loveman will continue to serve as chairman of Caesars and of Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, the unit now in bankruptcy.
Mr. Frissora joined Hertz in 2006 after the rental car company was acquired in a private equity buyout. He stepped down from his post there in September, citing personal reasons, after the company came under scrutiny by the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn, who said he lacked “confidence in management.”
