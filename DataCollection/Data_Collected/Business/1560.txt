Shares were up 4 percent. The company’s chief financial officer, Rajesh Kalathur, told analysts in a conference call that while the company forecasts its third straight year of declines in sales of agricultural equipment, its main business, in fiscal 2016, it also expects to remain “solidly profitable.” Deere expects total equipment sales to drop about 11 percent in its first quarter, which began on Nov. 1, and fall about 7 percent for the year. Deere also forecast net income attributable to the company at about $1.4 billion for fiscal 2016, down from $1.94 billion in 2015 and better than expected. Market fundamentals largely remain weak. The company relies on the United States and Canada for the bulk of its revenue, but sales of high-powered two-wheel-drive tractors in those countries fell 34 percent in October, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers said. In the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, net income attributable to Deere fell 45.9 percent to $351.2 million, or $1.08 a share, from a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 75 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Advertisement
