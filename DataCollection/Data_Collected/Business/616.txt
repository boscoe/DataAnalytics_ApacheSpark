JPMorgan will offer only deals it worked on as the lead underwriter. The shares available will depend on the deal, but are expected to range about 5 percent or less of the total offering, at least at first. In addition, the company issuing the I.P.O. must agree to participate.Being “lead left” underwriter is not always a given. So far this year, JPMorgan has held that lead spot in 27 stock debuts, including Shake Shack’s $121 million offering in January and Blue Buffalo’s Pet Products’ $778 million deal in July, according to Dealogic. That is out of 60 deals in which the bank had a book-runner role and 995 I.P.O.s globally so far this year, Dealogic said.Motif, a firm known for selling bundles of up to 30 stocks and exchange-traded funds for $9.95 each, is offering the I.P.O. access to anyone who pays at least $250 to buy shares in an I.P.O. The trades are free of commission.TechCrunch earlier reported the program.Motif’s site will include the offering prospectus and related documents so would-be investors can decide whether to get in on a coming deal, says Hardeep Walia, Motif’s co-founder and chief executive.There is no word on what Motif’s first I.P.O. offering will be, Mr. Walia says.videoAdvertisement
