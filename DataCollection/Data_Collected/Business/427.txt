Delta Air Lines on Wednesday said it would put the brakes on its expansion of flight capacity in 2016 in a move to fill more planes and sell more seats at higher fares. Delta, the third-largest American airline, said its capacity — or total mileage flown by its planes’ seats — would grow zero to 2 percent next year, compared with a nearly 3 percent rise this year. Wall Street analysts, noting stagnant foreign demand for United States carriers, have pushed them to shrink international service so fewer discount fares are necessary to sell out flights. For the fourth quarter, the airline said it would keep capacity flat compared with a year earlier to slow the decline in passenger revenue per available seat mile to between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. That gauge fell 4.9 percent in the third quarter. Net income was $1.32 billion with an operating profit margin of 21 percent.A version of this brief appears in print on October 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Delta Says It Will Keep Flight Capacity Growth Flat .
