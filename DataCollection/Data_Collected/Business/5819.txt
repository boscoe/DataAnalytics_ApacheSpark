McDonald’s, which this year bragged in advertisements that it would never serve kale on a hamburger, said on Wednesday it would add kale to breakfast bowls as part of a trial at nine Southern California restaurants. The company, which is testing a variety of new foods as part of a vast turnaround effort, plans to offer breakfast bowls for about $4, one of which is made with turkey sausage, egg white, kale and spinach. Also Wednesday, the company said it would revive the Hamburglar, above, a character that has not been seen in television advertising since 2002. The Hamburglar, now a young suburban father, coincides with McDonald’s limited-time sirloin one-third-pound hamburger. Separately, an analyst for Janney Capital Markets, Mark Kalinowski, said in a client note that McDonald’s restaurants in Canada would soon begin offering three salads made with kale. Early this year, McDonald’s showed a burger ad that advised: “All vegetarians, foodies and gastronauts kindly avert your eyes. You can’t get juiciness like this from soy or quinoa.” The ad then flashed to the lettuce on the burger, with the announcer saying: “Nor will that ever be kale.”A version of this brief appears in print on May 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: While It’s Not on the Burger, McDonald’s Adds Kale.
