Energy Transfer Equity said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire the Williams Companies for $37.7 billion, including the assumption of debt, concluding a monthslong saga to make the combined company one of the largest in the energy industry.Energy Transfer has agreed to acquire Williams for $43.50 a share. Williams shareholders can choose to receive Energy Transfer stock or cash in exchange for the transaction. Both companies’ stocks traded slightly lower before the market opened.The deal is a coup for Energy Transfer, built by billionaire Kelcy L. Warren, whose earlier $48 billion takeover bid for Williams was rejected in June. At the time, Williams said the bid was too low and it was focused on acquiring its subsidiary, Williams Partners, for $14 billion.Monday’s deal terminates the acquisition of Williams Partners, meaning the Williams Companies will pay a $428 million breakup fee, and the subsidiary will keep its name and headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma.AdvertisementEnergy Transfer and Williams, when combined, will operate more than 100,000 miles of oil and natural gas pipelines. The larger scale could help the company better deal with a plunge in energy prices that has plagued the stock of both companies.”As a combined company, we will have enhanced prospects for growth, be better able to connect to more diverse markets, and have more stability in an environment of low commodity prices,” Alan Armstrong, the chief executive of Williams, said in the statement.AdvertisementThe companies expect the transaction, which was approved by both boards, will be completed in the first half of 2016. Energy Transfer said the deal would be accretive to cash flow.A version of this article appears in print on September 29, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: In the Pipeline.
