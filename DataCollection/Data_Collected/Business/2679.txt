Then it rolled toward the giant work shed where until March it will be cleaned, repaired and painted in a makeover costing 2 million euros, or $2.3 million.Though yachting’s high season is still months away, winter is a busy time in this picturesque town in southeast France that is Europe’s largest yacht-maintenance and refitting seaport, as measured by revenue.Many of the world’s biggest, most expensive private yachts may be built elsewhere: Germany and the Netherlands are the leaders in that business. Other ports — including Barcelona, Spain, and Genoa, Italy — do a brisk business in yacht servicing. And some of the greatest yachts never make their way to Monaco or the Côte d’Azur, or other playgrounds for the rich and seaworthy.AdvertisementBut by dint of geography and history, La Ciotat is special.“Being close to the center of the yachting hub in the Mediterranean is very important,” said Philip Joyner, the captain of the M/Y Sky, explaining why he and other skippers preferred to have yachts refurbished at La Ciotat. (He would not disclose the owner of the boat, which is registered in the Cayman Islands.)AdvertisementThe M/Y Sky belongs to a category known as superyachts — usually defined as boats whose hulls at the water line measure longer than 24 meters, or 79 feet, or more broadly, private yachts that require a professional crew to operate. The biggest might cost $100 million or more, and measure nearly 460 feet from stem to stern. Experts estimate that 5,000 superyachts are in operation worldwide, and that more than one-fifth of those were purchased in the last five years.To emerge as a global leader in superyacht repair represents a remarkable economic comeback for La Ciotat, a town of 34,000 people.For more than a century, dating to the early 1800s, commercial shipbuilding provided the seaport’s economic lifeblood. During the glory days, well into the second half of the 20th century, most of the population would turn out to watch the launch of massive seabound vessels. When a ship slid down the wooden ramps and entered the water, it would create waves so big they often breached the protective sandbags and flooded the surrounding cafe terraces, sometimes even upending parked cars.“It was always a great spectacle,” said Alain Champeau, a retired school principal who jokingly claimed to be the only person his age in La Ciotat who was never employed by the yards.But in the decades after World War II, other parts of the world, particularly Japan and South Korea, were able to undercut European shipbuilders. The industry drifted away from places like La Ciotat, whose main commercial shipyard, Chantiers Navals de La Ciotat, closed in 1986, putting about 6,000 people out of work.Dockworker protests and social unrest became staples of news reports in France, with La Ciotat held up as yet another example of how globalization was hurting the country.But by the 1990s, La Ciotat had begun coming back to maritime life, as a small and eclectic group of international shipwrights, mast builders and other craftsmen specializing in custom sailboats and leisure motorboats started arriving. They were drawn to the seaport’s spacious docks, nautical infrastructure and low rents.AdvertisementBen Mennem, a British shipbuilder, was a co-founder of Compositeworks here in 1998, at first building small sailboats, starting with the 12.8-meter sloop Julia.BRITAINNETH.FalmouthBEL.GERMANYFRANCEAUSTRIASWITZ.Bay ofBiscaySLOVENIAGenoaITALYLa CiotatSPAINBarcelonaPalmaMediterranean SeaALGERIATUNISIA“Back then, the largest sailboat was 30 meters,” he said. “Now we frequently have boats over 100 meters that we work on. The dimensions have changed tremendously.”Although Compositeworks continued to build boats into the last decade, the company eventually shifted its focus purely to refitting and conversion.Nowadays, most of the yachts that heave up to La Ciotat for their beauty treatments are motorized craft. Many come for the periodic, thorough dry dock inspections required for insurance verification, which usually entail repair and reconditioning. More extensive jobs, which might cost an owner tens of millions of euros, involve more overhauling, updating or outright rebuilding.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the local industry is dominated by Monaco Marine — the company refurbishing the M/Y Sky — and its larger friendly rival, Compositeworks, which said it had revenue of €35 million last year.Together, the shipyards employ about 700 people full time and work with another 700 subcontractors, with expectations of adding hundreds more in the coming years if brisk growth continues.An important draw is the underwater elevator, installed in 2007, which is capable of hauling up boats that weigh up to 2,000 tons. Nothing of its type is found closer to the luxury destination ports of the Mediterranean. The elevator and an adjoining yacht parking deck cost €42 million, paid for by the government agency and Monaco Marine.A new crane, capable of lifting boats weighing up to 330 tons onto another parking deck, was installed and paid for by the agency and Compositeworks in 2009. Both Monaco Marine and Compositeworks have built their own cavernous painting sheds and maintain their own specialized carpentry and machine shops.AdvertisementThe port’s modernization is paying off. In 2007, 44 boats were hauled onto land for refitting, repair or conversion. Last year, nearly 220 yachts were lifted onto the docks. At any one time, as many as 50 yachts might be getting work done.As part of La Ciotat’s comeback, the waterfront has been redeveloped over the last five years, with the addition of new hotels and long-term accommodations for crews and seasonal workers. Restaurants have replaced the many sketchy bars that once lined the harbor. The Eden theater, the world’s oldest public cinema and the site where the Lumière brothers showed their early films, was reopened in 2013 after extensive renovations.Mr. Boré, now in his third term, has a plan to restore the town’s historic district, whose narrow streets, ancient houses and port-side charm is increasingly attracting visitors. At the Maison de la Construction Navale, a meeting and museum space run by retired shipyard personnel, grainy films of ship launchings capture the excitement and pride of the past.Mr. Mennem, of Compositeworks, remembers out-of-work former shipyard hands picketing the gates when he and his team started working in the late 1990s.“Eventually, it turned into a place where billionaires’ yachts go, so there’s a certain irony — but it’s created employment, so everyone is happy,” he said.Even now, workers at Monaco Marine or Compositeworks are not part of any larger union, although as French companies they have worker representatives, as required. The companies contend that they are not anti-union, but that the highly technical and international nature of the work they do is not conducive to organized labor.Michel Chatail, who was a technical drafter at the former shipyards, was asked by a visitor if he missed the old days of La Ciotat. He did not pause in replying: “We are actually happy now. The young have jobs, and we are all retired.”A version of this article appears in print on January 17, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Superyachts to the Rescue.
