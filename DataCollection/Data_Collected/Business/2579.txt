The federal deficit for the first three months of the budget year is up slightly from the same period a year ago, reflecting the absence of a special payment from the mortgage company Freddie Mac in 2014. The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that the government ran a deficit of $176.7 billion for the first three months of this budget year, which began Oct. 1. That is up 2.4 percent from $172.6 billion for the year-earlier period. Last year, Freddie Mac paid $24 billion for support it received during the financial crisis. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the deficit for the 2015 budget year through September will fall to $469 billion from $483.3 billion in 2014, or a 3 percent improvement for the full year.A version of this brief appears in print on January 14, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Federal Deficit Up Slightly in First Fiscal Quarter.
