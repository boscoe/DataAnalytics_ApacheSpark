Verizon Communications is adding Vice Media’s youth-oriented entertainment content to its roster of programs that will be available on its mobile-first video service that is expected to start this year.The multiyear deal, announced Tuesday, includes Vice shows that will be exclusive to Verizon as well as Vice offerings about topics like food, travel and technology. One feature is the coming Vice original series “Autobiographies,” an interview show that spotlights celebrities and notable personalities.
                Here are some prominent services offering live TV, à la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.            The partnership unites the companies at a moment when they are both aiming to expand their scope.For Verizon, the development is its latest step to bolster its new service, which is expected to include live content like National Football League games and other sporting events — as well as 200 hours of scripted and original series from the media company AwesomenessTV. Last month, Verizon completed its $4.4 billion acquisition of AOL, which Verizon pitched as a way to augment its content offerings and ad technologies.“Vice is connecting with an entire generation in a way that no one else is. And Verizon will connect consumers to Vice in a way that no one else does by combining Vice’s storytelling with the most compelling mobile video platform,” Terry Denson, Verizon’s vice president for content strategy and acquisition, said in a statement.Vice has struck a series of media partnerships since landing two investments last year — from Technology Crossover Ventures, the venture capital company, and the television group A&E Networks — totaling $500 million, including deals with HBO for a new daily half-hour newscast, the music streaming service Spotify and the messaging service Snapchat.“It’s part of our commitment to push the boundaries of video distribution across all platforms. Mobile is key to the emerging brave new world of video distribution, and with deals like this, we are making sure we are staying at the bleeding edge of innovation in that space,” said James Schwab, Vice’s co-president.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
