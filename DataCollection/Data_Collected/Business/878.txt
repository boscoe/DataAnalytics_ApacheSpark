The settlement involves a type of device that detects and treats extremely fast, life-threatening heart rhythms, called fibrillations, by delivering a shock to the heart, the Justice Department said. Doctors are not supposed to implant the devices in patients who have recently had a heart attack or procedures like a bypass. Hospitals hit with the largest fines were Ascension Health in St. Louis ($14.9 million), Catholic Health East in Newtown Square, Pa., now part of Trinity Health Corporation ($11 million), and Catholic Health Initiatives in Englewood, Colo. ($7.8 million). Advertisement
