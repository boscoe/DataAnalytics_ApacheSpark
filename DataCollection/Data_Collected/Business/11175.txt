WASHINGTON —  Industrial production in the United States fell last month, and the Labor Department’s Producer Price Index slipped.The reports released on Friday followed weak figures on construction, manufacturing and export growth that suggested a significant cooling of domestic growth in the last quarter of 2015.Business inventories were also weak, posting their biggest drop in slightly more than four years in November.

Despite a strong labor market, prospects for consumer spending are not encouraging against the backdrop of the stock market sell-off. While a separate report showed the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 93.3 early this month from 92.6 in December, household perceptions of conditions weakened.AdvertisementThe economy has been hammered by a strong dollar and sluggish global demand, which have undermined manufacturing and export-oriented industries. Spending cuts in the energy sector and business efforts to cut an inventory overhang have also been drags.Advertisement“The economy got hit from all sides in December,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “If these weak data keep going into 2016, the outlook is going to grow even dimmer given the recent financial market turbulence and the fears over what a slowdown in China means for the rest of the world.”Businesses stepped up efforts to reduce the merchandise bloat. A report from the Commerce Department showed that inventories fell 0.2 percent in November, the largest drop since September 2011. Inventories dipped 0.1 percent in October.

The Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.4 percent in December, primarily as a result of cuts in utilities and mining, after declining 0.9 percent in November. For the fourth quarter, industrial production fell at an annual rate of 3.4 percent.The weakness could prompt economists to lower their fourth-quarter estimates of gross domestic product, which range from an annual rate of 0.5 percent to 1.4 percent. The economy grew at a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.The Labor Department’s report said the Producer Price Index slipped 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in November. In the 12 months through December, the index declined 1.0 percent, after falling 1.1 percent in November. Producer prices fell 1 percent in 2015, the weakest since the series started in 2010, after rising 0.9 percent in 2014.After a report on Thursday showing a steep drop in import prices in December, weak producer prices suggest that an anticipated increase in inflation will probably fall short of the Fed’s 2 percent target.Inflation, which has been tamed by dollar strength, tepid wage growth and cheaper oil, is expected to rise this year as 2015’s weak figures fall out of the calculation. The inflation outlook will most likely determine the timing of further interest rate increases by the Fed, which last month imposed the first rate increase in nearly a decade.A version of this list appears in print on January 16, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Manufacturing and Producer Prices Decline .
