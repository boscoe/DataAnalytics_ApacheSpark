Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said the company would start next year using German data centers in Magdeburg and Frankfurt that are managed by T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. “These data centers will ensure that customers’ data remains in Germany and that a German company controls access to data in accordance with German law,” Mr. Nadella said at a presentation in Berlin. In practice, this would mean that authorities in the United States trying to obtain access to a German customer’s data would have to work through authorities in Germany, where privacy laws are strict.
