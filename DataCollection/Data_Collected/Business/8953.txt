WASHINGTON —  Data released on Tuesday revealed the uneven economic recovery in the United States. Figures on retail sales and business inventories showed modest gains, but a measure of industrial production recorded its biggest decline in more than a year and a half, highlighting one of the economy’s weak spots a day before a crucial Federal Reserve meeting.Americans stepped up their spending on cars, restaurant meals, groceries and clothing in August, suggesting that consumers continue to drive economic growth in the United States despite a broader global slowdown.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month, after advancing 0.7 percent in July. Sales have increased 2.2 percent over the last 12 months, as solid hiring has translated into surges in spending at auto dealers and dining establishments.

“There was more spending on ‘wants’ last month,” such as eating out, sporting goods and electronics, said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ”These are areas that suggest consumers are ready and willing to splurge a little on items outside of the basic necessities.”AdvertisementThe drop in overall industrial production was led by automakers that cut back sharply on production in August, which largely contributed to a 0.5 percent fall in manufacturing production; it was the largest decline since January 2014, the Federal Reserve said. Production of computers, airplanes and furniture also fell.AdvertisementFed policy makers will begin a two-day meeting on Wednesday to decide whether or not to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nine years. Slowing overseas growth and the strong dollar, which are holding back factory output, could cause them to delay a rate increase.

“Looking through the swings in auto assemblies, the ongoing weakness in manufacturing is evident,” Michelle Girard, an economist at RBS Securities, said in a note to clients. “Manufacturing is now the weakest sector of the U.S. economy, faced with headwinds of a stronger dollar and weaker global growth.”Overall industrial production, which includes mining and utilities, dropped 0.4 percent in August, after a 0.9 percent rise in July. Auto production plunged 6.4 percent, its steepest fall in more than three years, after an outsize gain of 10.6 percent in July.Those swings partly reflect difficulties in seasonally adjusting the data and are most likely to be temporary. For example, United States carmakers typically close their plants in July to retool for new models. Those shutdowns were much shorter this year, increasing production in July and leading to a corresponding drop in August.

The rise in retail sales has been fueled this year by solid and steady job gains. The hiring — 2.9 million additional jobs over the last 12 months — has translated into a surge of spending at auto dealers and restaurants.For instance, carmakers are on pace to top vehicle sales of 17 million for the first time since 2001. Nearly a fifth of all retail sales tracked by the government come from the auto industry. Sales at dealerships and parts stores have risen 5.7 percent during the last 12 months, as many Americans replace their older vehicles. Auto retailers reported a 0.7 percent increase in sales during August.Purchases at restaurants and bars increased 0.7 percent in August and have soared 8.2 percent this year. And dining establishments have added more than 372,000 workers over the last year. Sales also improved last month at grocers, clothiers, sporting goods stores, electronics outlets and online retailers.A separate report showed that United States businesses increased their stockpiles by a tiny amount in July while sales also showed a slight gain.AdvertisementBusiness inventories increased 0.1 percent in July compared with June when stockpiles were up 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department said. The July gain was the smallest since a 0.1 percent increase in March.A version of this article appears in print on September 16, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: In Uneven Recovery, Bright Spot Is Retailing .
