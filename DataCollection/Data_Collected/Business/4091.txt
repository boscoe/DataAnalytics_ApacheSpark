AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael CorkeryCitigroup is selling its subprime consumer loan unit to Springleaf Holdings, another large subprime lender, for $4.25 billion. The sale of the unit, OneMain Financial, which Citigroup had contemplated for years and announced on Tuesday, is expected to net the giant bank a $1 billion profit, Citigroup said.Not long after the financial crisis, Citigroup started looking to sell OneMain, which lends at high interest rates to people with tarnished credit who need to pay medical bills or address other financial difficulties.In recent years, the business was highly lucrative for Citigroup, which could borrow money at low interest rates, then charge double-digit rates on the loans.But the business did not fit with Citigroup’s long-term plan to focus on providing banking services to more affluent customers in the United States.“While this business didn’t fit our strategy, it serves customers who deserve and need credit,” Citigroup’s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, said in a statement on Tuesday.OneMain had been housed in a unit at the bank called Citi Holdings, with many assets that soured in the mortgage crisis. As part of an effort to simplify its business, Citigroup has been selling billions of dollars’ worth of those assets since the bank was rescued in 2008 by taxpayers as part of a broad bailout of the financial system. Citi Holdings’ assets now total roughly 5 percent of total Citigroup assets, down from a high of more than 30 percent, the statement said.The sale of OneMain also highlights a broader trend of subprime lending migrating to nonbanks like Springleaf. A former unit of the giant insurer American International Group, Springleaf is now one of the largest subprime consumer lenders in the country.When the deal closes, the combined company is expected to have 1,967 branches across 43 states.Advertisement
