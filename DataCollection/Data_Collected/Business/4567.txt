LONDON — TSB Banking Group, the lender spun out of the Lloyds Banking Group last year, said on Friday that its directors had agreed to recommend that investors accept a takeover offer from Banco Sabadell of Spain that values it at 1.7 billion pounds, or about $2.5 billion.The Lloyds Banking Group said it had agreed to sell Sabadell a 9.99 percent stake in TSB as of March 24 and to enter an irrevocable agreement to sell its remaining 40.01 percent stake in the lender as part of a tender offer by Sabadell to shareholders.Under the terms of the offer, Sabadell would pay £3.40 in cash for each share of TSB, representing a 29 percent premium to TSB’s closing price on March 11, the last day of trading before the companies announced they were in talks.Shares of TSB rose 1.8 percent to 333 pence in early trading in London on Friday.“We see the U.K. as an attractive market with a strong regulatory framework, sound macroeconomic fundamentals and exciting prospects for growth,” Josep Oliu Creus, the Sabadell chairman, said in a news release. “TSB is a well-established brand, which shares our culture of focusing on our customers and local communities.”AdvertisementLloyds, which is partly owned by the British government after a bailout during the financial crisis, spun off TSB in an initial public offering in June, but the brand dates back 200 years.AdvertisementSabadell said that it planned to build on the TSB name in Britain and that it would support its expansion of lending to small- to medium-size businesses.Despite its former association with Lloyds, TSB is considered a so-called challenger bank to the larger, traditional lenders in Britain. The British government has pushed for the creation of competitors in the banking sector since the financial crisis, particularly lenders to small businesses.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
