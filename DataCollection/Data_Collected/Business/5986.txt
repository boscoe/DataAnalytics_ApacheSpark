The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that the April budget surplus was $156.7 billion, up from $106.9 billion a year earlier, the largest surplus since April 2008. Government receipts totaled a record $471.8 billion. Receipts for the first seven months of the budget year that began in October came to $1.89 trillion, the biggest seven-month total. Receipts have climbed because an improving economy has increased tax payments. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts a full-year deficit of $486 billion, roughly on par with the previous year.A version of this brief appears in print on May 13, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: $157 Billion Budget Surplus in April, Treasury Reports.
