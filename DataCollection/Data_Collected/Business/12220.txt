Studies show the insecticide harms species at the bottom of aquatic food chains in streams and ponds, which affects fish that feed on them. Flubendiamide is used on more than 200 crops, including soybeans, tobacco, cotton and numerous varieties of lettuce, fruits and nuts. The agency asked the companies to voluntarily withdraw products containing the chemical in January. After they refused, regulators moved to cancel the government registration required to manufacture the product. Bayer said the methods used by the E.P.A. exaggerated the environmental risk. Nichino America did not comment. The EPA said crops already treated with flubendiamide or that may be treated with existing supplies can still be sold.Advertisement
