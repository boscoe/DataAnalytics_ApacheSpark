Worldpay is preparing for a potential initial public offering this year.In response, Barclays said on Wednesday that Mr. Rake would continue serve as its deputy chairman and senior independent director until “at least the end of 2015.”On Thursday, the British bank said it wanted to “make clear” that Mr. Rake would continue to serve in his positions at Barclays until a new chief executive was in place and his replacement as senior independent director was appointed.“This is to ensure that the highest standards of corporate governance are maintained,” Barclays said in a news release. “Any conflict of interest which may arise in respect of his chairmanship of Worldpay will be managed in the normal manner.”The bank has not given a timetable for how long it expects a search for a new chief executive to take, but says it plans to look at internal and external candidates.On July 8, Antony Jenkins was ousted as the Barclays chief executive, a move that the bank said was orchestrated at the behest of its independent directors, including Mr. Rake.Mr. Jenkins was forced out last week after directors lost confidence in his ability to improve returns to shareholders.John McFarlane, who replaced David Walker as the Barclays chairman this year, will assume the role of executive chairman on Friday. Mr. McFarlane will serve as the bank’s top executive until a new chief executive is in place.Mr. Rake has been a Barclays director since January 2008 and its deputy chairman since July 2012. He is the chairman of the telecommunications company BT Group.Advertisement
