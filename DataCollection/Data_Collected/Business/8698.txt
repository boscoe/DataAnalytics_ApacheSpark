Volkswagen said on Thursday that its chief financial officer, Hans Dieter Pötsch, was set to become its new chairman, filling the position that Ferdinand Piëch, the company’s longtime patriarch, vacated in April. The automaker said that Mr. Pötsch, 64, would be proposed for election to its supervisory board in November. Berthold Huber, the acting chairman and previously Mr. Piëch’s deputy, praised Mr. Pötsch’s “strategic vision, comprehensive knowledge of the automotive industry and considerable expertise in the financial markets.” Mr. Piëch resigned in April after losing a power struggle with the company’s chief, Martin Winterkorn.A version of this brief appears in print on September 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Volkswagen Moves to Elevate Its Finance Chief to Chairman.
