WASHINGTON — Orders to American factories for long-lasting manufactured goods fell in February for the third time in the last four months, and an important investment category fell for a sixth month.Orders for durable goods dropped 1.4 percent in February, after a 2 percent increase in January and declines of 3.7 percent in December and 2.2 percent in November, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. A crucial category that serves as a proxy for business investment spending retreated 1.4 percent in February, the sixth consecutive monthly decline.The weakness in February was widespread, with weaker demand for commercial aircraft, autos and machinery. The result adds to a slew of disappointing data from recent economic indicators. Economists, however, expect domestic demand to strengthen in the months ahead and hope that will be enough to offset weakness caused by a stronger dollar, which dampens export sales of American companies.Transportation orders were down 3.5 percent. Excluding transportation, durable goods orders dropped 0.4 percent. Demand for machinery and computers fell, and orders for communications equipment and appliances rose.

But he noted one sign of encouragement: Business surveys of investment spending plans have improved significantly in recent months.Advertisement"We would expect to see a rebound in equipment investment in the second quarter," Mr. Ashworth said.Many economists are looking for manufacturing orders to start strengthening after a stretch of weakness in the second half of last year. They believe the end of harsh winter weather and the resolution of a labor dispute at West Coast ports, which caused supply disruptions, should help.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Analysts expect growth will be revised slightly to a rate of 2.4 percent, up from the previous estimate of 2.2 percent. But that would still leave the economy expanding far below the 5 percent rate in the third quarter.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
