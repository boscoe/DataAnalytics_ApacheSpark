AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks posted their biggest gains in more than a week Tuesday, led by rising energy companies and banks. The market was higher all day, building on a gain late Monday. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose two days in a row for the first time since early November. Energy stocks rose as the price of crude oil jumped 3 percent, and banks moved higher a day before an expected rate increase by the Federal Reserve.The Dow Jones industrial average added 156.41 points, or 0.9 percent, to 17,524.91. The S.&P. 500 increased 21.47 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,043.41. The Nasdaq composite index gained 43.13 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,995.36. Stocks have been turbulent since a six-week winning streak ended in early November. They dropped sharply in mid-November, then bounced back the next week, but did not build consistently on those gains.Last week, a plunge in the price of oil set off a sharp drop in energy stocks, which dragged the broader market down to its second-worst weekly performance of 2015. Now with more encouraging economic signs, many expect the Fed to begin returning borrowing costs to normal levels with its first interest rate increase in nine years.The government said early Tuesday that prices for a variety of goods and services rose last month, including plane tickets and medical care. Overall prices were unchanged from last year because food and energy prices are weak, but “core inflation,” which leaves out energy and food, rose 0.2 percent. That is the largest gain in more than a year.Michelle Girard, chief United States economist for Royal Bank of Scotland, said the reassuring signal on inflation gave the Fed “a green light to take action tomorrow.” The Fed’s major short-term interest rate has been near zero for seven years.Energy stocks were the top-performing sector as United States crude rose $1.04, or 2.9 percent, to $37.35 a barrel in New York. That was atop a 2 percent gain on Monday. Oil is still down 30 percent this year and is at its lowest in more than six years. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, rose 53 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $38.45 a barrel in London.That helped the energy sector, which has struggled this year. Exxon Mobil had its best day since late August. Its shares jumped $3.40, or 4.5 percent, to $79.43. Shares in the offshore drilling company Ensco added $1.21, or 8 percent, to $16.40 and Transocean stock rose 74 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $13.38.Natural gas continued to tumble, sliding 7.2 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $1.822 per 1,000 cubic feet. That is the lowest price since March 1999, not adjusting for inflation. Industrial demand for natural gas has been weak, and the warm weather means most Americans have not needed as much heat for their homes as they usually do this time of year.In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1.1 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.2444 a gallon and heating oil rose 1.9 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $1.147 a gallon.Bank stocks climbed as investors anticipated that higher interest rates would help banks become more profitable by charging more for loans. JPMorgan Chase shares rose $1.83, or 2.9 percent, to $66.10 and stock in Wells Fargo gained $1.71, or 3.2 percent, to $54.91.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Investors dipped a toe back into the high-yield bond market after several days of selling. The iShares high-yield corporate bond ETF rose $1.29, or 1.6 percent, to $80.12 and the SPDR Barclays high-yield bond ETF rose 39 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $33.81.High-yield bonds have been attractive in recent years because their returns are generous. But investors are becoming worried that more companies could default.Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said plunging oil prices were a big contributor to the recent decline. He predicts more pain is coming.“Buyers of high-yield bonds will be, on average, pretty happy five years from now,” he said. “But I think they’re going to be pretty unhappy in the next three months.”Prices for United States government bonds, which are considered extremely low-risk, fell. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 2.27 percent from 2.23 percent late Monday.Gold fell $1.80 to $1,062.90 an ounce, while silver gained 7.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $13.77 an ounce. Copper fell 5.5 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.06 per pound.The euro fell to $1.0919 from $1.0983. The dollar rose to 121.67 yen from 121.00 yen on Monday. Advertisement
