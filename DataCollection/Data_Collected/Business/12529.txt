For Goldman, it is the latest foray into digital offerings for consumers and small businesses.It has been developing its own credit-oriented business to make small loans to individuals and small businesses. Goldman also recently has made investments in the start-ups Digital Asset Holdings and Circle Internet Financial, which use the bitcoin online currency.In 2013, Goldman led a $25 million round of financing for Motif Investing, another robo investing platform that allows investors to pick or create themed bundles of exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s. Honest Dollar will be managed as part of Goldman’s investment management division.Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.“Honest Dollar has created a simple solution to a complex retirement savings problem,” Timothy J. O’Neill and Eric S. Lane, co-heads of investment management at Goldman, said in a statement. “Together, we have the potential to help millions of people achieve their investing goals.”Advertisement
