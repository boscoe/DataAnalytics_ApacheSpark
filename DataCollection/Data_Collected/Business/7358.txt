It also urged Congress not to weaken financial regulations passed in 2010. The I.M.F. said that American banks were stronger but that risk had risen elsewhere. Its previous assessment of the American financial system was conducted five years ago. Over all, the fund said banks and insurance companies had increased their capital defenses against losses, but it expressed concern about risks outside the banking sector. It warned that American stock prices were “approaching levels that may be hard to sustain given profit forecasts” and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates later this year. Mutual funds could “act as amplifiers” of a panic if jittery investors cashed out, forcing funds to dump risky investments into a collapsing market. The I.M.F. said that ultralow interest rates were pressuring insurance firms to take bigger risks, making regulation of the business “fragmented” between states. It repeated its calls for a federal insurance regulator. Advertisement
