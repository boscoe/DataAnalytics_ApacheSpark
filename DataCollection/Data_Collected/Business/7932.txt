A federal judge in California dismissed this week a lawsuit filed by two consumers against the bourbon distiller Maker’s Mark, who claimed they were misled by the company’s claim that its spirits were handmade. They said that was what had enticed them to purchase Maker’s Mark instead of a less expensive whiskey, and their suit accused the company of false advertising, unfair competition and negligent and intentional misrepresentation. The suit said the process to produce the bourbon features “little to no human supervision, assistance or involvement.” That argument did not persuade United States District Judge John A. Houston. “This court finds that ‘handmade’ cannot reasonably be interpreted as meaning literally by hand,” Judge Houston wrote. The judge added that the plaintiffs “cannot plausibly contend defendant intends to deceive consumers about the nature of its processes when its label clearly describes the process and points consumers to its website.” It was the latest legal victory for Maker’s Mark in fending off claims of false advertising. A similar suit was dismissed earlier this year in Florida. Maker’s Mark, owned by Beam Suntory, is produced at a distillery outside Loretto, Ky.A version of this brief appears in print on July 30, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Suit Over Bourbon Maker Using ‘Handmade’ in Ads Is Dismissed.
