LOS ANGELES — Some of the best-known Merchant Ivory films — including “Howards End,” “Maurice” and “Heat and Dust” — will be headed back to theaters under a deal in which the indie distributor and financier Charles S. Cohen acquired a 30-film library of movies directed and produced by the James Ivory-Ismail Merchant filmmaking team.“It took 18 months to do it,” Mr. Cohen said in disclosing the acquisition in an interview on Monday. Mr. Cohen said his Cohen Media Group acquired 21 narrative feature films and nine documentaries and shorts from the director-producer James Ivory, while clearing a complicated set of financial obligations.Speaking by telephone, Mr. Cohen said the transaction did not include studio-backed films from Merchant Ivory Productions, like “Remains of the Day” and “Jefferson in Paris.” But, he said, the production company’s independently made films were included in the transaction. Those, he said, will be restored and rereleased to theaters, probably starting with “Howards End,” a romance based on an E.M. Forster novel, which was directed by Mr. Ivory and produced by Mr. Merchant. The film won three Oscars in 1993, including a screenwriting award for Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, their frequent collaborator.In a statement, Mr. Ivory said he was “gratified — and relieved” to have placed the films with Mr. Cohen’s company. Mr. Merchant died in 2005. Merchant Ivory was known for lush, romantic period pieces of a sort that Mr. Cohen said he hoped to produce again under that company’s name.“I’d always thought it was a superbrand that had high respect,” Mr. Cohen saidA version of this article appears in print on October 13, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Merchant Ivory Films Heading Back to Theaters.
