The police in Hong Kong raided the offices of Uber, the ride-hailing service, and arrested five drivers on Tuesday for the “illegal use of vehicles for hire,” the authorities said. A Hong Kong police senior inspector, Bruce Hung, said undercover police officers had used a mobile phone app to hail five cars and arrested the drivers after being driven to their destinations. He said the drivers lacked the required hire car permits or third-party insurance. The police officers’ fares had been settled using a credit card, Mr. Hung said. Harold Li, an Uber spokesman for North Asia, said Uber stood by its “driver-partners 100 percent.”A version of this brief appears in print on August 12, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Uber Offices in Hong Kong Raided by the Police.
