The large jump from a year ago reflected calendar shifts, which had made the 2015 deficit look smaller because $36 billion in benefit payments were shifted into February. Through the first six months of the budget year, the deficit totaled $461 billion, an increase of 4.9 percent from the same period a year ago. Receipts were up 4 percent from the same period a year ago, and spending was 4.2 percent higher than the first half of 2015.Advertisement
