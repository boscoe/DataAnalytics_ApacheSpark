Loeb prevailed in a number of prominent corporate challenges, including one over Sotheby’s, the famed auction house.Now he has set his sights on Baxter International, the medical products maker.Mr. Loeb’s Third Point disclosed on Wednesday that it had amassed a stake of roughly 7 percent in Baxter and was seeking two seats on the company’s board. (Including both stock and options, the hedge fund owns nearly 10 percent of Baxter’s shares, a position worth more than $2 billion.)Baxter, which makes devices like intravenous pumps and dialysis systems, represents one of Third Point’s bigger targets to date, though behind the likes of Sony and Dow Chemical. The company’s market value as of Tuesday’s close was roughly $22 billion.Baxter is in the midst of finding a successor to its longtime chief executive, Robert L. Parkinson Jr.In a letter to Baxter’s board, Mr. Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new C.E.O. He also deplored the current setup of the Baxter board, in which directors do not face re-election every year, as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”Unlike in other campaigns, where Mr. Loeb has been willing to wield  his poison-tipped pen, the tone of this letter was cordial.“We are confident the new C.E.O. will benefit from a board with fresh perspectives and are grateful to you for beginning this productive dialogue with shareholders,” he wrote.Shares of Baxter were up 3.5 percent in midafternoon trading on Wednesday, after Third Point disclosed its stake.(Coincidentally, Baxalta, a biopharmaceutical business that Baxter spun off just last month, is under pressure from an unwanted suitor, the drug maker Shire.)Advertisement
