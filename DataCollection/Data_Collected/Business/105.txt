SchwartzEver since the American dollar began to surge against foreign currencies late last year, economists have warned that the repercussions would eventually be felt on the home front.If there were any doubts about that, they were resolved last week.With Friday’s Labor Department report showing slower hiring than expected in September, and the weaker data on exports and factory activity released earlier in the week, evidence of the effects of the dollar’s rise on the domestic economy is piling up.While hardly catastrophic — almost no one expects the American economy to fall into recession anytime soon — the greenback’s strength will exert a significant drag on economic growth in the months ahead and could help push the Federal Reserve to wait until 2016 before raising interest rates.“There is no question about it: The dollar is clearly having an impact,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and consulting firm that tracks the economy.Indeed, while Mr. Behravesh estimates that domestic consumption rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the third quarter — a healthy pace by most measures — he expects economic growth for the period to come in at around 2 percent.That’s a significant gap, Mr. Behravesh said, with most of it due to the strengthening dollar, which makes American goods more expensive abroad, as well as slower growth overseas in important export markets like China and Brazil.Other experts are even more pessimistic about the economy’s growth rate in July, August and September, with Macroeconomic Advisers cutting its estimate to 1.4 percent on Friday, down from 2.4 percent at the start of the week.Goldman Sachs expects the drag from trade on output to persist through the end of 2016, reducing the American economy’s overall growth rate by nearly a full percentage point.Although the dollar dipped after the release of Friday’s anemic jobs report, few experts expect that weakness to persist. In fact, the dollar could eventually move a bit higher from current levels, depending on when the Fed finally makes its long-expected move to raise rates.A stronger dollar not only makes American-made products more expensive and therefore less competitive overseas, but it also favors foreign manufacturers, since they can afford to sell their goods for less in the United States than domestic producers.That is one reason there is nervousness on Wall Street with many big American companies reporting earnings for the third quarter in the coming weeks, starting with Alcoa on Thursday.Still, as with most trends in the economy, this one cuts both ways, with benefits as well as costs.Chief among the benefits are lower prices in the United States, especially for energy and consumer products, which has the effect of keeping inflation at bay.Although inflation, if anything, has tended to be too low rather than too high since the current recovery began six years ago, Federal Reserve policy makers are keeping a very close eye on prices in order to determine when to finally raise short-term interest rates from near zero.With import prices under pressure, the stronger dollar “is essentially doing the Fed’s work for them in terms of keeping inflation in check,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington.To put it another way, the Fed has more leeway to leave rates near zero into early 2016. That would allow the labor market to recover more fully and average hourly earnings to potentially rise.In fact, in a speech in late September, the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, cited the dollar’s strength as a prime reason that inflation had been running well below the central bank’s 2 percent target. Barring another drop in energy prices or further appreciation in the dollar, Ms. Yellen said she expected the inflation rate to rise to 1.5 percent or higher in 2016.But the dollar’s advance may not be over.Although most of the dollar’s rise against major currencies like the euro and the Japanese yen occurred in late 2014 and early 2015, with exchange rates stabilizing more recently, emerging market currencies have continued to deteriorate in recent months.Some of that is because of aftershocks from China’s currency devaluation in August, which caught markets around the world by surprise, as well as from the impact of slowing growth within China.More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.Already, the drop in emerging market currencies is resulting in an uptick of goods arriving on American shores from countries like Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, said Jon W. Slangerup, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach in California, the country’s second-busiest port after the Los Angeles port.In fact, in the first seven months of the year, imports from Vietnam totaled $21 billion, up 27 percent from the same period last year, according to the Commerce Department. Imports from Malaysia are up 17 percent to more than $19 billion.Over all, the trade deficit in the United States is running about $10 billion more than last year, and a sharp widening for August is expected when the government reports the latest data on Tuesday.While much of the jump in imports is coming from consumer goods, which tend to be made overseas, American factories are being hurt as demand for equipment and other heavier goods from overseas ebbs.Manufacturers shed 27,000 jobs in August and September, a significant reversal from the gains recorded from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2014, when factory employment jumped by more than 300,000.“It takes a while for the dollar to work its way through the economy, but it’s weighing on manufacturing,” said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.Mr. Gapen said the dollar’s surge — and its ripple effects on the domestic economy in the United States — were major factors in his firm’s decision to move its forecast of the first Fed rate increase from December 2015 to March 2016.“Some Fed policy makers are definitely looking at this, and they know that trade will be a big drag on growth,” he said. “It’s very clear that the dollar’s strength is showing up in the numbers.”Advertisement
