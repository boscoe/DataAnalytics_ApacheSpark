When a friend in 2010 told her about a taqueria that was for sale at a good price, she jumped on it.“We didn’t know anything about cooking,” she says. “At the beginning, we were only making $40 or $50 a day.” Ms. López describes cooking with one hand while holding recipes in the other.Persistence works.
