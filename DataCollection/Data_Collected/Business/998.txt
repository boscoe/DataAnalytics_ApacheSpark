LOS ANGELES — The 20th Century Fox studio said on Tuesday that it would make a new foray into the resort and theme park business, with an opening in Dubai in 2018.The complex, to be called 20th Century Fox World Dubai, is to follow the opening of a similar park in Malaysia. The Malaysian project, announced in 2013, was scheduled to open next year but was delayed to 2017 by issues including the weakness of the Malaysian currency, according to recent news reports.The Dubai project is to be built by the Al Ahli Holding Group under a licensing agreement with the Fox consumer products group, the companies said on Tuesday. The theme park will include attractions based on Fox movies and shows like “Aliens,” “Ice Age,” “The Simpsons” and “Sons of Anarchy.”The companies did not disclose the expected cost of the development. But one person briefed on the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures, said the developers were likely to invest more than $850 million in the project.The agreement also allows for the development of as many as three additional Fox-branded resorts, Fox and Al Ahli said in a statement.Fox previously announced plans for an “Avatar” theme area in the Animal Kingdom of Disney World in Orlando, Fla. That attraction is expected to make visitors feel as though they have been planted on the planet Pandora, which figures in the film, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
