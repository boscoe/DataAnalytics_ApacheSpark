Service revenue refers to sales from voice, data and messaging services.A continued lift from the company’s emerging market operations also helped Vodafone increase its yearly service revenue to £38.5 billion, from £35.1 billion in the previous 12 months.The company’s operations span from the United Kingdom to India, but Vodafone continues to face stiff competition in many European markets where companies like Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Telefónica of Spain have fought to entice customers to switch cellphone providers.A new round of consolidation in Europe’s telecom industry has also led mobile operators to join forces with broadband providers to offer high-speed mobile Internet access, leading to a price war between rivals.Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s chief executive, said the company’s multibillion-dollar investment plan to upgrade its mobile and cable networks had started in early 2015 to show signs that it was persuading customers to stay with the British carrier.“We have seen increasing signs of stabilization in many of our European markets,” Mr. Colao said in a statement. He added, “In emerging markets, our good growth trend has continued, driven by rising data penetration.”Last year, Vodafone sold its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $130 billion. The carrier has also spent more than $20 billion on acquiring cable assets in Germany and Spain.Vodafone said that its annual net income fell 27 percent, to £1.5 billion, in part because of the one-time jolt it had received from the Verizon sale.Despite the early signs of recovery in its European operations, the company’s yearly service revenue in the region fell 4.7 percent, to £25.9 billion, as it responded to the region’s continuing economic malaise and to low-price offerings from rivals.That competition is expected to continue in its home market of Britain as BT, the country’s former telecom monopoly, has agreed to acquire the local mobile provider EE for $19 billion.Vodafone’s European earnings were offset by a strong performance in its emerging markets division, which includes Egypt, India and Turkey. That division benefited from the increasing use of smartphones to surf the web. Service revenue for the unit rose 5.8 percent, to £12 billion, for the 12 months through March 31.Advertisement
