Earlier this year, Weinstein had been involved in a possible deal to sell its TV unit to ITV of Britain, but that transaction faltered.In announcing the deal, Weinstein’s co-chairman, Harvey Weinstein, cited the “enormous, untapped opportunity” in American Media properties, which also include OK!, Men’s Fitness and Soap Opera Digest.Advertisement
