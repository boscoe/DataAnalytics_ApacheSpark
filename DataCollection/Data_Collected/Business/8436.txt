Stock markets around the world plummeted on Thursday, signaling that investors have not gotten over the shock of China’s devaluation last week and remain nervous about the health of the global economy.The selling began in Asia, punishing Chinese stocks once again. It then moved to Europe, walloping markets in Germany and Italy, and ended with a rush for the exits in the United States.Along the way, the price of oil traded near six-year lows and currencies of developing countries suffered further pain. Astonishingly, the currency of Kazakhstan lost a fourth of its value against the dollar after the country’s government let it trade freely in the markets.“It was a bad day — everything came together,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. Mr. Silverblatt noted that the stocks of 76 companies in the S.&P. 500 were down at least 20 percent so far this year, a decline that officially puts them in a bear market. He added that 45 companies were up at least 20 percent.AdvertisementAfter several years of strong gains, the United States stock markets have struggled to move up this year. And in recent weeks, the worries have piled up.

The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 358.04 points, or 2.1 percent, on Thursday to close at 16,990.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, a broader benchmark favored by investors, declined 43.88 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,035.73, its lowest level in six months. The S.&P. 500 is down just over 1 percent for the year.AdvertisementInvestors sought the safety of government bonds. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, fell to 2.07 percent, from 2.13 percent on Wednesday.The biggest source of uneasiness right now appears to be China’s economy. The country surprised the world last week by announcing changes in the way it manages its currency, the renminbi, which led to the currency falling in value against the dollar.Many analysts assumed that the devaluation was in part motivated by a desire to stimulate China’s economy, the second largest in the world. A cheaper renminbi would make Chinese goods cheaper in other currencies, increasing demand for them.But the devaluation stoked suspicions in the markets that the country’s economy might be weaker than its official figures suggested.

“The shock of China’s move to devalue — you can’t understate that,” said Sharon Stark, chief fixed income strategist at D.A. Davidson. “What that has done is put the world on notice that the economic conditions in China may be worse than they are reporting.”Investors are also fretting over what the Federal Reserve will do next with interest rates. Its loose monetary policy since the financial crisis helped push up stock markets around the world. Now, though, the Fed is contemplating raising interest rates, a move that could happen as early as next month.AdvertisementMinutes from the Fed’s last monetary policy meeting, released this week, showed that central bank officials were wary about global growth. The meeting was held before China’s devaluation. That event and the recent turmoil in the markets could persuade the Fed to delay a rate increase.Still, the mere specter of rising rates has prompted investors to pull money out of many markets around the world. This has particularly weighed on the economies of developing countries. If they weaken further, there would most likely be less demand around the world for the goods and services of United States companies.Caterpillar, whose stock has been hit by such fears, is down nearly 17 percent so far this year, and fell 1.29 percent on Thursday.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            The price of oil, as measured by the benchmark United States crude contract in New York, took a hit early on Thursday, nearly falling to $40 per barrel but recovering as the day went on. The decline could keep gasoline prices lower, benefiting consumers but also weighing on energy companies in the United States, which have created thousands of jobs in the last few years.Fears unrelated to the global economy also buffeted the market on Thursday. Stocks in large media companies dropped steeply after an analyst at Bernstein released a research note that highlighted, in particular, the challenges to advertising revenue at television companies. Shares in Disney, one of the companies that Bernstein downgraded, skidded 6 percent.Elsewhere, Twitter dropped nearly 6 percent, to close at $26, the price at which it went public in 2013. Financial stocks have fared relatively well so far this year, but they weren’t shielded from Thursday’s sell-off. JPMorgan Chase slid 2.5 percent and Morgan Stanley was down 3.39 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A Greek default appeared to have been averted for now, and Europe’s central bank is pumping stimulus into the Continent’s economy. China has the financial firepower to avoid an uncontrolled devaluation. Last fall, nervousness about the strength of the global economy roiled markets, but when investors calmed down, markets soared again.And if the United States economy continues to grow at recent rates, the whole world should continue to benefit, some analysts asserted.“It could all come out in the wash,” said Raymond Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm focused on hedge funds. “The wheels aren’t coming off the U.S. economy and we’re not going into a recession.” He added that valuations of stocks in the United States were not especially cheap right now, which makes them more likely to drop when investors get jittery.Or as Ms. Stark put it: “What we are learning is that the market has a very low tolerance for uncertainty and instability.”A version of this article appears in print on August 21, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: China Woes Send Stocks Into Tailspin.
