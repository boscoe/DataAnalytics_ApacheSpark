After the transaction, Atmel shareholders will own about 38 percent of the combined group, Dialog said.“By bringing together our technologies, world-class talent and broad distribution channels, we will create a new, powerful force in the semiconductor space,” Jalal Bagherli, Dialog’s chief executive, said in a statement.The transaction, expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, will boost Dialog’s earnings in 2017, Dialog said, and result in annual cost savings of $150 million within two years.Worldwide semiconductor mergers and acquisitions reached $31 billion in 2014, the most since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data, and the pace has not let up this year.Advertisement
