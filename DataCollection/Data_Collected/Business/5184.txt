J. C. Penney expects comparable-store sales to top most expectations in the first quarter, but industry watchers believe it will be at a cost and shares slid Tuesday. Figures for sales at stores open at least a year were released in a regulatory filing Tuesday, the company said, after a senior official inadvertently gave nonpublic sales data to a securities analyst. J. C. Penney said that based on the quarter-to-date performance and a shift in the timing of the Easter holiday from the previous year, it expects sales at stores open at least a year to rise 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent for the first quarter. But shares slid 2.7 percent amid worries about heavy discounting.A version of this brief appears in print on April 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: J.C.
