The investment banking firm Greenhill & Company said on Tuesday that it had hired Joseph C. Dilg, a veteran deal maker in the energy industry, as a vice chairman in its Houston office.Until last month, Mr. Dilg was a partner at Vinson & Elkins, a Texas law firm that counts many of the biggest American energy companies as clients. He served as managing partner of the firm from 2002 until 2011, a tenure that included the opening of offices in San Francisco, the Middle East and Asia.(He became managing partner of Vinson & Elkins as the scandal surrounding Enron — one of his biggest clients — began to mount, and he spoke about the law firm’s dealings with the company to a congressional panel investigating the energy giant’s collapse.)At Greenhill, Mr. Dilg will continue to focus on energy companies, including  mergers and activist shareholder campaigns. The said he would also work with its restructuring practice to help oil companies struggling with the steep drop in oil prices.“Joe brings us and our clients a wealth of corporate and board relationships, decades of experience in advising on complex corporate transactions, and broad experience across the U.S., Asia and the Middle East,” Scott L. Bok, Greenhill’s chief executive, said in a statement.Mr. Dilg said, “I have enjoyed advising senior management teams and boards on innumerable transactions, as well as a variety of other corporate matters, and my work has ranged from domestic energy sector mergers to cross-border and project development transactions around the world. Greenhill is the perfect fit for this next phase.”
