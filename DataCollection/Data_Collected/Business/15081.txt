LONDON — Mediaset, an Italian media company controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, said on Tuesday that the French giant Vivendi had backed away from a deal to acquire 100 percent of Mediaset’s pay-TV arm.In April, the companies agreed to  take a 3.5 percent stake in each other. Under that deal, Vivendi would acquire the pay-TV business, known as Mediaset Premium.The deal was seen at the time as way for Vivendi, which also owns Canal Plus, the French pay-television company, to better compete with the premium broadcaster Sky, which is partly owned by 21st Century Fox, and Netflix.On Tuesday, Mediaset, Italy’s largest commercial broadcaster, said that Vivendi proposed in a letter on Monday to proceed with the share swap, but Vivendi would acquire only a 20 percent stake in the pay-TV arm. It would then buy an additional 15 percent of Mediaset through a mandatory convertible bond in three years.AdvertisementVivendi’s new position “comes absolutely out of the blue and was not agreed in any way,” the company said in a news release. “It is, moreover, in clear contradiction with the commitments made by Vivendi in the contract signed on 8 April, concluded after long and detailed negotiations and with the approval of the appropriate corporate bodies of both parties.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
