Whole Foods says it has agreed to pay New York City $500,000 to settle allegations it overcharged customers for prepackaged food. The city’s Department of Consumer Affairs says the settlement also required Whole Foods Market to conduct quarterly audits to ensure products are accurately weighed and labeled.
