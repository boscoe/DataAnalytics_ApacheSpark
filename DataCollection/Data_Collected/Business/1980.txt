Employees who chose to participate were accepted only after approval by Sotheby’s management.The auction house’s stock price has declined over the last six months, and its third-quarter results showed a 12 percent decrease in commissions from sales compared with the same period in 2014.Sotheby’s also took a financial risk in guaranteeing $515 million to the family of A. Alfred Taubman, its former chairman, to secure his collection for the most recent sale cycle. With more than $1 billion in auction sales this fall, Sotheby’s has said it expects to break even on that commitment. The final Taubman sale, old masters, is scheduled for Jan. 27.Advertisement
