But the income weakness will probably prove temporary as the labor market gradually tightens.In a fourth report, the Labor Department said the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, advanced 0.7 percent after a 0.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter.The index is widely viewed by policy makers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack.In the 12 months through March, labor costs jumped 2.6 percent, the largest rise since the fourth quarter of 2008. They are approaching the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the central bank's 2 percent target.Private sector wages and salaries increased 0.7 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in the previous quarter. They rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months through March, the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2008."The conditions seem to be in place for labor costs to start breaking out on the upside," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.Advertisement
