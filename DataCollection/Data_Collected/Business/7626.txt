They were originally scheduled for July 24.On Thursday, the insurers said that PartnerRe shareholders would receive a one-time, special dividend of $17.50 a share before the closing of the deal and that they had agreed to other improved terms.“This amalgamation will immediately enhance our strategic positioning and financial strength and we will have tremendous resources to build upon our proven track record of stability and success,” Jean-Paul L. Montupet, the PartnerRe chairman, said in a news release.“In addition to the cash special dividend, shareholders will benefit from owning a significant interest in a world-class specialty insurance and reinsurance franchise.”The fight over PartnerRe comes at a period of frenzied deal-making in the insurance sector.It is also an ambitious move by John Elkann, Exor’s chief executive and the scion of the Agnelli family that founded and still controls the Italian holding company. Exor also owns a controlling stake in the automaker Fiat Chrysler.On July 7, Exor, which has argued its offer is superior, announced a series of revisions to its latest offer for PartnerRe, worth about $137.50 a share.As part of its sweetened offer, Exor said it would be willing to let PartnerRe actively seek out potentially higher takeover bids through the end of August, that it would pass along the value of a $315 million breakup fee in the Axis deal if investors in both companies rejected the deal and that it would raise the dividend on PartnerRe’s preferred shares.On Thursday, PartnerRe and Axis Capital also said that they had agreed to match terms of an exchange offer proposed by Exor for PartnerRe’s preferred shares. That would include an increase in the dividend rate.But the insurers said that the exchange offer could be considered a “fast-pay stock” under United States tax laws and possibly subject preferred shareholders to an “onerous” annual reporting and penalty regime.PartnerRe and Axis Capital said they had sought a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether the exchange offer would result in enhanced reporting for preferred shareholders.“The strategic and financial benefits of the merger agreement between Axis Capital and PartnerRe are compelling, and we are confident that it will deliver superior value both to our shareholders and to our clients and distribution partners,” Albert A. Benchimol, the Axis Capital chief executive, said in a news release.PartnerRe and Axis agreed in January to a merger that would create a larger player in the insurance industry with a combined market capitalization of more than $11 billion.The combined company’s business lines would include expertise in the specialized field of reinsurance, as well as specialty insurance and life, accident and health insurance.Advertisement
