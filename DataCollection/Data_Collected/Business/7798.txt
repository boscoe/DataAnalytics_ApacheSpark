Others have issued cautious outlooks, citing the strength of the dollar, a slowing economy in China or falling oil prices. That is giving investors reason to pause.Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab, said that what investors needed to push stocks higher again was “true revenue growth from the corporate sector, which we just haven’t seen.”AdvertisementAmazon bucked the trend, jumping 15 percent in after-hours trading after better-than-expected earnings.AdvertisementThe Dow slid 119.12 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,731.92.
