LONDON – Credit Suisse on Wednesday gave investors a preview of the potential effect that the recent sharp rise in the value of the Swiss franc will have on its profit. The bank emphasized that it had not suffered any “material trading losses” since Switzerland eliminated a cap on its currency last week.On Wednesday, the bank, which is based in Zurich, reiterated guidance it gave in October that a 10 percent move in the euro to the franc would have potentially reduced its profit for the first nine months of 2014 by 180 million francs, or $205 million.Credit Suisse said that the euro’s value to the franc is 20 percent below its average in 2014.“Our currency sensitivities have remained broadly unchanged since the end of 3Q 2014,” the bank said in a news release. Credit Suisse, like a number of its Swiss rivals, holds capital in a variety of currencies, like the dollar, but reports its results in francs.The bank said its sensitivity to moves in the dollar and the euro to the franc in 2015 would depend on average exchange rates as well as any actions taken by its management to offset such sensitivity.Credit Suisse is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 12.Last week, Switzerland abandoned measures to hold down the value of the franc to the euro as Europe’s troubled economy has pressed the euro downward. The European Central Bank is expected to unveil a bond-buying program later this week in hopes of stimulating growth in the region’s economy.Despite a rapid rise in the franc’s value, Credit Suisse said that it had posted positive trading results and not recorded “any material trading losses” in its foreign currency trading after the move by the Swiss National Bank.Credit Suisse also said that it did not expect its capital levels to be affected by the move in the franc.“In terms of capital, our policy is to hedge the capital allocated to our non-Swiss-based activities,” the bank said in a statement. “Accordingly, this currency volatility has not materially impacted our capital ratios.”
