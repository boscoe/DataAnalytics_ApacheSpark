It would then pay $1.5 billion when acalabrutinib, Acerta’s treatment for blood cancer, receives regulatory approval in the United States or by the end of 2018.It would then have the option to buy the remainder of the company after the approval of the drug in Europe and the United States, and other milestones.AstraZeneca said that an extensive development program for acalabrutinib was underway and that it might be able to take the first steps toward regulatory approval of treating patients with certain types of blood cancer in the second half of 2016.The top yearly sales of the drug could exceed $5 billion globally, AstraZeneca said.AstraZeneca announced on Monday that the companies were exploring “potential strategic options.”AstraZeneca has said it would target similar small or midsize deals as it looks to bolster its drug pipeline after it fought off a $119 billion takeover bid by Pfizer last year, which would have created the world’s largest pharmaceutical company.In November, AstraZeneca agreed to acquire ZS Pharma, a California-based biopharmaceutical company, for $2.7 billion in cash. This week, AstraZeneca also announced that it would acquire the core respiratory business of the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company of Japan for $575 million.Advertisement
