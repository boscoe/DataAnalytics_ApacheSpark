The Airbus Group surprised investors with a strong second-quarter rise in earnings, pushing its shares up as much as 5 percent as lucrative jetliner deliveries outshone more bad news for the A400M military transporter. Quarterly operating profit before one-off items jumped 15 percent to 1.23 billion euros, with gains of at least 20 percent in jetliner and helicopter profits masking a €159 million loss in defense and space. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected operating profit of €1.06 billion. Airbus maintained its financial forecasts for the year as first-half revenue and core profits rose 6 percent. Cumulative provisions on the troubled A400M, Europe’s largest defense project, topped €5 billion, about $5.47 billion, and Airbus took a fresh charge of €290 million on new development delays after the crash of an A400M during a test flight in May. Airbus aims in 2015 to deliver up to 17 of the troop and cargo carriers, which were developed for seven European NATO nations at a cost initially set at €20 billion.A version of this brief appears in print on August 1, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Robust Jetliner Business Buoys Earnings for Airbus.
