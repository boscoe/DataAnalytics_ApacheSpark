WINKLEVOSSES PLAN BITCOIN EXCHANGE  |  The Winklevoss twins, two of the biggest boosters of Bitcoin, are trying to firm up support for the virtual currency by creating the first regulated Bitcoin exchange for American customers, Nathaniel Popper and Sydney Ember write in DealBook. The brothers have hired engineers from top hedge funds, enlisted a bank and engaged regulators with the aim of opening their exchange, which they have financed themselves, in the coming months. They are calling the exchange Gemini ‒ Latin for twins.The Gemini staff is working at a few rows of desks in the Winklevoss Capital offices near Madison Square Park in Manhattan, which has dry-erase boards on the walls covered in math equations and strategic scribbles, and the requisite bean bag chair. The team has been creating Gemini’s security infrastructure and trading engine from scratch, and already has a test model of the exchange running. They are planning to be ready to open the exchange as soon as they win regulatory approval from New York State’s top financial regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, the superintendent of the state’s Department of Financial Services.The twins’ close cooperation with regulators has helped them secure a bank account with an American bank. According to documents viewed by The New York Times, the Winklevosses have an agreement with a bank chartered in New York to handle the dollars moving in and out of customer accounts.

HUTCHISON WHAMPOA CIRCLING O2  |  Hutchison Whampoa, one of the flagship companies of the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said on Friday that it had agreed to enter exclusive talks to buy O2, the British cellphone carrier owned by the Spanish telecom giant Telefónica, for roughly $15 billion, Mark Scott and Neil Gough write in DealBook. The deal between Three, Hutchison Whampoa’s British cellphone business, and O2 would be the latest in a transformation of Europe’s telecom sector.
Under the terms of the proposed deal, Hutchison would pay 9.25 billion pounds, or $14 billion, in cash for O2. A further payment of up to 1 billion pounds would be made at a later date, depending on the performance of the combined businesses of Three and O2. The potential deal follows the announcement last month by BT, Britain’s former telecom monopoly, that it was in discussions to buy EE, the British mobile phone business of Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany, for about $19 billion. An O2-Three deal would create Britain’s largest carrier based on the number of subscribers and would make EE No. 2 and Vodafone No. 3.



ATTRACTIVE PAY FOR TWO BANK CHIEFS   |  Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, are both receiving pay packages for 2014 that are slightly more attractive than the ones they received the year before, Nathaniel Popper and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. Mr. Blankfein is receiving a $1 million raise, to $24 million, according to an unnamed source. And while Mr. Dimon’s pay is staying flat at $20 million, he is receiving $7.4 million of his pay in easier-to-access cash after receiving his entire bonus in restricted stock last year.
For the first time this year, Goldman is giving its top executives a significant portion of their bonuses in restricted stock that will be granted only if the bank’s future performance beats certain benchmarks. In Mr. Blankfein’s case, he will receive $7.33 million in these performance-based stock awards and another $7.33 million in regular restricted stock. He will receive $7.33 million in cash, plus his $2 million salary, a person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Dimon’s pay included a $1.5 million base salary, $11.1 million in restricted stock and a $7.4 million cash incentive bonus.

MARKETS RESPOND TO E.C.B. STIMULUS PLAN  |  The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would begin buying 60 billion euros, or about $69 billion, worth of bonds a month, more than the €50 billion a month that many analysts had expected.
After more than a year of speculation, Mario Draghi, “the never-predictable head of the European Central Bank, has given global investors what they have clamored for, with an extra twist: an open-ended commitment to buy eurozone government bonds in bulk,” DealBook’s Landon Thomas Jr. writes. “By targeting a larger than expected 1.1 trillion euros’ worth of bonds and by leaving room to keep the program going beyond 2016, Mr. Draghi gave his bond-buying bid an added charge of adrenaline.”
Financial markets responded favorably to the news. The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50-stock index was up 1.6 percent on Thursday, with European stocks continuing to rally on Friday. Markets in Asia also closed up on Friday. Bond yields in some eurozone countries hit new lows, including countries that might benefit most from the central bank’s program. In the United States, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.5 percent on Thursday. The euro, already on a downward slope, lost 2 percent against the dollar, to $1.1361.
Neil Irwin of The Upshot writes: “The 1.1 trillion-euro question is whether the bond-buying program will jolt Europe out of its economic doldrums or merely create a short-term lift to financial markets. The flood of new money sloshing around the global economy could also create problems elsewhere.”
