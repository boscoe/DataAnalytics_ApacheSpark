A Walmart employee sued the retailer on Tuesday, saying its previous policy of denying health insurance to the spouses of gay employees violated gender discrimination laws. The lawsuit, filed in United States District Court in Boston, seeks nationwide class-action status. Walmart began offering health insurance benefits to same-sex spouses last year. The employee, Jackie Cote, who has worked at Walmart stores since 1999, said in the lawsuit that her wife, Diana Smithson, developed cancer in 2012 and the denial of insurance led to more than $150,000 in medical debt. Ms. Smithson is now in hospice care, Ms. Cote said. A Walmart spokesman said that the company’s benefits coverage before the 2014 change was legal. Allison Wright, a lawyer with Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, which filed the lawsuit, said the group thought other large companies had similar policies in place that could be open to legal challenges.A version of this brief appears in print on July 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Gay Spouse Sues Walmart Over Older Health Policy .
