Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 49.6, equal to March’s final figure. After a brief rebound in February, the index has been in contraction territory for two months.The survey showed that the decline in employment, which had been sharp in March, moderated somewhat in April and that export orders rose for the first time in three months — but most of the news was bad.New orders declined further from the level of the month before, indicating softer domestic demand. Decreases in input and output prices, which had appeared to ease in March, showed signs of accelerating again, signaling intensifying deflationary pressures, an important concern for policy makers.The weak early reading for the April index adds to a growing number of signs that China’s economic growth is decelerating more rapidly than most analysts and perhaps some policy makers had expected.In March, growth data for money supply and industrial production both came in at or near multiyear lows, with the factory output posting its worst performance since the global financial crisis.Economists have cautioned that some of the extreme weakness in March may have been a reflection of the timing of the 2015 Lunar New Year holidays, which were later in the year than usual, which yearly comparisons. Many factories and offices shut for lengthy periods during the holidays. But continuing weakness in the April numbers adds to evidence that growth is still slowing.Particularly worrying from a policy perspective are renewed signs of rapidly falling prices. The Chinese government and central bank have closely studied lessons from Japan, Asia’s former economic dynamo, whose policy missteps have plunged it into decades of deflation from which it is still struggling to escape.China’s economy, weighed down by a cooling property market, industrial overcapacity and increasing local debt, grew 7.4 percent in 2014, its slowest expansion in 24 years. Economists expect growth to cool further, to 7 percent, in 2015, even with the government adding stimulus measures.The central bank has cut interest rates twice since November, on top of a series of other monetary and fiscal measures announced over the past year, most recently a cut to banks’ required reserve ratios — the amount in deposits that banks must maintain, rather than lend.“Although momentum appears to have weakened recently, we don’t see a reason to be overly concerned,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in Singapore. The reduction of “the required reserve ratio will have come too late to have much impact on today’s reading but should help shore up activity over the coming months, and we also expect policy makers to roll out more support measures to ensure that growth doesn’t slip much further.”Advertisement
