The deal is expected to be finalized this year and is subject to regulatory approval.Apollo is also in talks with Banque Publique d’Investissement, a French government-owned investment fund, about the fund’s potential acquisition of a minority stake in Verallia, Saint-Gobain said.Pierre-André de Chalendar, the chairman and chief executive of Saint-Gobain, said in a news release that the sale of Verallia would complete the company’s “strategic refocus on the design, manufacture and distribution of innovative, high-performance solutions for the habitat and industrial markets.”Verallia employs about 10,000 people at 47 plants in 13 countries and posted sales of 2.4 billion euros, or about $2.7 billion, in 2014, excluding its North American operations.Saint-Gobain agreed to sell Verallia’s North American business to the Ardagh Group in January 2013 for $1.7 billion, but it did not finalize that deal until April last year.“We are extremely excited to be acquiring Verallia, which is an outstanding franchise and one of the world’s leading packaging companies,” Robert Seminara, a senior partner at Apollo, and Jean-Luc Allavena, an operating executive at the company, said in a news release.Advertisement
