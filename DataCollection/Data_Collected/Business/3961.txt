Though Cyberonics is based in Houston and Sorin in Milan, the combined business will be domiciled in Britain, which has a lower tax rate. The new company will be listed on both the Nasdaq stock market and the London Stock Exchange.Under the terms of the deal, Cyberonics shareholders will receive one share of the combined company while their counterparts at Sorin will receive 0.0472 of a share.As of Wednesday’s closing prices, the transaction values Sorin at about $1.4 billion and represents a nearly 15 percent premium to the company’s stock price. Together, the two companies will have a combined market value of about $3 billion.Sorin’s chief executive, Andre-Michel Ballester, will retain that role in the new business, while his counterpart at Cyberonics, Dan Moore, will become nonexecutive chairman.Mittel and Equinox Two, entities that own 25.6 percent of Sorin’s shares, have agreed to support the merger. They will own about 11.5 percent of the combined manufacturer.Each company will pick four directors for the combined company’s board, and the two will pick an additional director together.The deal is expected to close by Sept. 30.Rothschild and the law firm Latham & Watkins advised Sorin, while Piper Jaffray and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell and Legance advised Cyberonics.Advertisement
