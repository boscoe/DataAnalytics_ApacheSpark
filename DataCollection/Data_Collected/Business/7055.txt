Southwest will allow Delta to continue operating five daily flights between Love Field and Atlanta, the spokeswoman said. A gate-sharing arrangement between the carriers is set to expire on July 6. The two had scheduled overlapping flights from identical gates at the space-constrained airport. The conflict has drawn in city and federal officials, with the city of Dallas suing the carriers last week. In a court filing Tuesday, Delta said that it had sold almost 20,000 tickets to Love Field flights through May 2016 and that a mass cancellation would “cause significant harm to Delta’s operations.” Advertisement
