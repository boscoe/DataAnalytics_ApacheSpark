The complaints are the latest move in a campaign by the Service Employees International Union to win pay of $15 an hour and unionization for fast-food workers by publicly pressuring McDonald’s to come to the bargaining table. The burns and other hazards were detailed in complaints announced Monday and filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in recent weeks. Workers cite a persistent lack of gloves for handling hot equipment and say they have been burned while cleaning grills that must be kept on. One worker said he was told by a manager, “Put mayonnaise on it, you’ll be good.” In a statement, McDonald’s said the company and its independent franchisees were committed to providing safe working conditions.
