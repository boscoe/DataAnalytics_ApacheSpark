Those cars were manufactured during a different period of time, but the problem was the same, Kia said: A part of the steering assembly called the pinion plug could loosen and come out. Kia attributed the problem to a manufacturing error.The result was a dangerous inability to control the car, according to complaints made to the safety agency’s website.“I noticed a pop as I was making a left-hand turn and the steering wheel became really loose,” the Maryland owner of a 2014 Soul wrote in a complaint to federal regulators in August 2014. “I began to make a U-turn a few minutes later and the steering wheel turned 360 degrees, but the actual wheels did not turn with it. I was stuck in the middle of the street.”In the latest recall, Kia told regulators it was not aware of any accidents or injuries.The first recall occurred in June 2014 and was prompted by three warranty claims involving the pinion plug. It covered vehicles manufactured from July 21, 2013, to Jan. 17, 2014. Kia told regulators that it decided a second recall was needed after receiving five warranty claims on vehicles manufactured during a different time period: Jan. 18, 2014, to Sept. 30, 2015.Advertisement
