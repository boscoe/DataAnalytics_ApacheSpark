As consumers change the way they use their smartphones, surf the web and watch television, Vodafone is finding itself in need of a face-lift.After years of focusing heavily on its cellphone business, Vodafone, based in Britain and the world’s second-largest mobile operator behind China Mobile based on subscribers, is concentrating on high-speed broadband.Once, Europeans were happy to pay for separate cellphone, cable and pay-TV services. Now, they prefer them bundled into a single package that streams content to any device — a smartphone, tablet or Internet-connected television.Regional rivals like Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany have moved quickly to offer these so-called quadruple-play deals — ones that combine cellphone, fixed-line phone, broadband Internet and TV services. But Vodafone, which had largely staked its claim in the cellphone business, has found itself playing catch-up just as Europe’s telecom industry undergoes a new round of consolidation.“Vodafone used to think that offering mobile would be enough,” said Katja Ruud, a telecom analyst at the technology research company Gartner Research. “But they’ve realized that if they want to keep up with competitors, they have to offer all the services people are looking for.”Vodafone’s aggressive push into cable has led to rumors that the carrier, whose operations span as far as South Africa, may be considering a $90 billion bid for Liberty Global, the Pan-European cable operator controlled by the American billionaire John C. Malone.By DAVID GELLESAfter several acquisitions, the international cable and wireless operator is reported to be a takeover target.Liberty Global and Vodafone, which have large footprints in countries like Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, both deny talk of any deal. However, a merger could allow the British carrier to better serve consumers who are watching movies online, streaming music to their cellphones and increasingly turning to Internet messaging services likes WhatsApp and Snapchat.“If we ever look at any combination, it will be on our own terms,” Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s chief executive, told a recent telecom conference in Barcelona. “It’s not a secret that at the right price, Vodafone would like more fixed assets.”Regardless of whether a deal is reached, Vodafone’s revamped strategy comes as the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has shown a greater willingness to allow the region’s largest telecom operators to scoop up smaller rivals.Unlike in the United States, where behemoths like AT&T and Comcast dominate the telecommunications sector, the European Union still has more than 100 cellphone and cable providers across the 28-member bloc. Cutthroat competition has kept prices low. Europeans, for example, spend an average of $38 for a monthly cellphone contract, or about half what Americans pay, according to industry statistics.But telecom executives hope to whittle down the number of carriers and cable providers. That, industry watchers say, is necessary to allow companies to earn a sufficient payback on the multibillion-dollar investments needed to upgrade Europe’s telecom network, which still lags those of countries like South Korea and the United States.“If you want to attract investors, you need to ensure returns on investments,” said Gervais Pellissier, associate chief executive at Orange. “Things have started to change in that direction.”Vodafone, however, has a bit more financial muscle compared with European competitors, many of which are still struggling under piles of debt from the last round of deal-making more than a decade ago.Last year, for example, Vodafone pocketed roughly $130 billion from the sale of its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. And after returning about $85 billion to investors, the company has earmarked around $30 billion in a two-year investment program, primarily to introduce high-speed mobile coverage to its European customers.So far, Vodafone has also spent more than $20 billion over the last 18 months to improve its broadband assets in crucial markets. Those acquisitions include Kabel Deutschland, one of Germany’s largest cable providers, and Ono, a Spanish broadband operator.The company also briefly became a potential takeover target for AT&T before that carrier decided to double down on the American market by agreeing to buy DirecTV for $48.5 billion.Vodafone has also been linked to other potential European cable acquisitions, including the Italian Internet provider FastWeb, whose value could top $6 billion, according to industry analysts.Europe’s antitrust authorities may demand that Vodafone sell off some of Liberty’s assets, particularly in Germany, where both companies operate extensive cable networks. But the multibillion-dollar deal would provide the British telecom company with a Pan-European fiber network that otherwise would take years — and billions of dollars — to build.“Only Liberty credibly reinforces enough weaknesses to put Vodafone on a competitive footing,” said Jerry Dellis, an analyst at Jefferies in London.In Britain, Vodafone’s second-largest market after Germany by revenue, Mr. Colao’s deal-making hand may soon be forced by the actions of its competitors.Hutchison Whampoa, which is controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced on Jan. 23 that it was in talks to buy O2, the British cellphone carrier owned by the Spanish telecom giant Telefónica, for up to $15 billion. The deal would create Britain’s largest cellphone operator, relegating Vodafone to third position in its home turf.And BT, the former British telecom monopoly, agreed on Feb. 5 to buy EE, the British mobile phone business of Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany, for $19 billion to offer both mobile and cable services.Both takeovers would create powerful British rivals for Vodafone, though the Hutchison Whampoa deal has yet to be reached.In response, Vodafone has said that it will start its own British broadband service in 2015 that will use the fiber network of Cable and Wireless Worldwide, a telecom operator providing broadband services for businesses that Vodafone acquired for $1.7 billion in 2012.Vodafone has also reached content deals with the likes of Sky, the European pay-TV and satellite provider that is part owned by Rupert Murdoch, so that its customers can stream the latest movies and sports events to their mobile devices.“The era of just offering mobile services is coming to an end,” said Bengt Nordström, co-founder of Northstream, a telecom consulting firm. “The idea that Vodafone is making a play for cable assets makes total sense.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/17/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Vodafone Turns Focus to Broadband, Seeking to Catch Up to Rivals.
