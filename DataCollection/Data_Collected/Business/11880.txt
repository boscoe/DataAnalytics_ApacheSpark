HONG KONG — The multinational media and telecommunications conglomerate SoftBank said on Monday that it would buy back shares worth 500 billion yen, the biggest share repurchase it has ever made.Stock in the group, which owns the United States telecom business Sprint, has slipped about 38 percent over the last year, and the company had already announced a share buyback worth about $1 billion in August. Matthew Nicholson, a spokesman for SoftBank, said that with the stock price at its current level, “as a shareholder return, we judge that now is an optimal time” for the new buyback, worth about $4.4 billion.Mr. Nicholson noted that when SoftBank reported its earnings last week, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive, was asked about the company’s share price. Mr. Son indicated then that the shares were undervalued, saying that there was a “perception gap.”Masamitsu Oki, the chief portfolio manager at Fivestar Asset Management, said the decision to buy back shares indicated that Mr. Son saw “potential that the shares could go up in the future; this will be used as a weapon for future M. and A. deals.”AdvertisementMr. Oki also noted that SoftBank has about ¥11.6 trillion in debt and about ¥1.2 trillion in cash. The decision to spend ¥500 billion on the shares “indicates they are trying to take a bold step with this decision and that they are confident and know what they are trying to do next.”The buyback, which will amount to about 14.2 percent of SoftBank’s shares, will be funded by sales of assets and cash, but not debt. The repurchasing will take place over a year, starting on Tuesday. SoftBank declined to comment on which assets it would sell.AdvertisementSoftBank, which is the largest shareholder in Yahoo Japan, reported a 7.3 percent increase in operating profit for the final three months of 2015 compared with the year before.Amie Tsang reported from Hong Kong, and Hisako Ueno from Tokyo.A version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: SoftBank Stock Buyback  Will Be Its Biggest to Date.
