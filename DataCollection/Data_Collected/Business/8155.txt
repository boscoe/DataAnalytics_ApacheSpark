The pomegranate juice maker Pom Wonderful cannot stop a smaller rival from selling a pomegranate-flavored energy drink with a similar name, a federal court ruled on Thursday. It was the second time Pom Wonderful had failed to obtain an injunction against the energy drink labeled “pom,” made by Pur Beverages, in a continuing trademark dispute. Judge Margaret M. Morrow of United States District Court in Los Angeles said in her ruling that Pom did not deserve an injunction because it could not show it would be harmed without one. Pom sued Robert Hubbard, Pur Beverages’ founder, in 2013 for trademark infringement, saying consumers would be deceived into thinking Mr. Hubbard’s energy drink was associated with Pom Wonderful. Pom said that its reputation as a health-conscious brand would suffer if it were associated with Mr. Hubbard’s beverage. Pom, based in Los Angeles, began using the Pom trademark for beverages in 2002.A version of this brief appears in print on August 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Pomegranate Juice Maker Loses Trademark Fight .
