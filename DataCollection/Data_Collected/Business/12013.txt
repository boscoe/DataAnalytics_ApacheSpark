The biggest such deal is Pfizer’s planned $150 billion merger with Allergan.The bill would limit certain tax deductions, blocking a company’s ability to use interest from debt payments by its American operations to its foreign parent company to offset taxes, a practice referred to as “earnings stripping.” The bill will be introduced by Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee.The Democrats are also taking aim at Republican lawmakers after several attempts to get legislation through Congress in the last few years.“While Republicans sit on their hands, House Democrats will continue to take actions to aggressively limit tax-motivated inversions,” Mr. Levin said on Monday.In November, the Treasury announced rules to curb inversions but called on Congress to do more, and its rules did not specifically address earnings stripping.In earnings stripping, the American unit of a foreign company takes on debt from the parent company. Under current rules, the interest payments on that debt can be deducted from the American unit’s earnings for income tax purposes, assuming the company is not leveraged more than 1.5 times equity and is not deducting an amount greater than 50 percent of its earnings.The bill to be introduced on Tuesday proposes to eliminate the debt-to-equity requirement and puts limits on how much interest expense can be deducted, lowering it to 25 percent of earnings from 50 percent. It would also curtail a company’s ability to record any interest expenses above that 25 percent threshold after five years (currently companies can move those expenses forward indefinitely).The bill would apply to inversions that happened after May 8, 2014, and those where historical shareholders of the United States entity own more than 50 percent of the new foreign parent (but less than 80 percent).Previous efforts to block inversions have not shut the spigot of such deals.Pfizer’s combination with Allergan was announced just days after the Treasury’s proposals were announced. Other recent deals include one by Coca-Cola Enterprises, the Atlanta bottler and distributor, to combine with two European Coke bottlers and form a new British company.The Treasury proposed rules in 2014 and a group of Democratic lawmakers introduced a bill last year, but it never went beyond its introduction.Advertisement
