Lockheed Martin has agreed to buy Sikorsky, the maker of the Black Hawk helicopters used by the United States military, people with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday.The deal, which one person said would be worth more than $8 billion, could be announced as soon as Monday. Buying Sikorsky would give Lockheed a major new line of business apart from a number of already hugely popular military equipment, notably the F-35 fighter jet. The company is already the biggest military contractor worldwide, noticeably ahead of Boeing and other major manufacturers.The acquisition of Sikorsky, which had more than 15,000 employees and net sales of $7.5 billion at the end of last year, would be the biggest by Lockheed since its $10 billion takeover of Martin Marietta 21 years ago. AdvertisementShares in Lockheed have risen about 4.5 percent so far this year, compared with a 13 percent rise in Boeing stock. By contrast, shares in United Technologies, the parent of Sikorsky, have fallen about 3.7 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
