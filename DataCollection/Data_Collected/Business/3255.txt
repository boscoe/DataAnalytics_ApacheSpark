The Food and Drug Administration approved Ibrance for women who have tumors that do not contain a protein known as HER-2. Ibrance, known generically as palbociclib, works by blocking molecules linked to cancer cell growth. Pharmaceutical industry analysts expect Ibrance to have annual sales as high as $4 billion by 2020. The drug is intended to be used in combination with another cancer medication known generically as letrozole. The F.D.A. granted the drug accelerated approval based on a 165-patient study showing that it slowed the progression of breast cancer. Advertisement
