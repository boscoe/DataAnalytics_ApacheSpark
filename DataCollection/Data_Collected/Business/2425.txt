LONDON – A trader who reportedly once spent more than $188,000 on a single bottle of Champagne was convicted of fraud on Friday in an investment scam that authorities say took in 5 million pounds, or about $7.54 million, from investors.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain said that Alex Hope promised large returns for investors from foreign exchange trading between March 2011 and April 2012 but suffered heavy losses and spent more than £2 million on personal expenditures.Mr. Hope was convicted of a single count of fraud at Southwark Crown Court in London on Friday after pleading guilty in April 2014 to operating a collective investment scheme without authorization.“Using fraud and false promises, Hope took in those who trusted him to invest their money,” Georgina Philippou, the F.C.A.’s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a news release. “He promised fantastic returns but, as is so often the case with unauthorized investment schemes, those who invested ended up with significant losses and the main beneficiary of the scheme was Hope himself.”The Daily Mirror, a tabloid newspaper, reported in 2012 that Mr. Hope spent more than £200,000 on Champagne during a night out in Liverpool, including £125,000 on a single bottle. He was arrested about a month after running up the large bar tab. The F.C.A. said that Mr. Hope held himself out as a “talented and successful trader,” but lost £500,000 of the £650,000 in his trading accounts.Mr. Hope, who represented himself, couldn’t be located for comment on Friday. He and a co-defendant are scheduled to be sentenced next week.
