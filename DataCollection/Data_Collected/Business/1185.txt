Mitsubishi has ambitions to eventually sell more than 2,000 aircraft.So far, it has secured 223 firm orders, most recently in January when Japan Airlines asked for 32 planes. The biggest single purchase, for 100 aircraft, was from the American regional airline operator Trans States Holdings.Mitsubishi says the jet burns a fifth less fuel than aircraft of similar size, thanks to new-generation engines from Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies.Japan’s last attempt to establish itself as a commercial aircraft maker ended in failure. Production of the YS-11, built by a consortium that included Mitsubishi Heavy, halted after only 182 planes were built.However, that program helped Mitsubishi Heavy and other companies forge ties with the American aircraft maker Boeing, turning them into major suppliers and partners of the company and helping revive an aerospace industry that was dismantled after World War II.Those Japanese companies build 35 percent of Boeing’s advanced 787 carbon-composite jetliner, including the wings, the most complex part.Japan’s biggest carmaker, Toyota Motor, and largest trading company, Mitsubishi, each own a 10 percent stake in the jet venture.
