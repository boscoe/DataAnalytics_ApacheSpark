Our full ownership of these assets will provide significant potential to add further value through asset management and development.”Tesco, one of the world’s largest retailers, said it would continue to lease the stores at the sites acquired by British Land after the deal.“Last year, we identified the opportunity to increase the proportion of our stores we own as freehold,” Dave Lewis, the Tesco chief executive, said in a news release. “This transaction with British Land allows us to increase our ownership and thereby insulate more of our businesses from indexed rent reviews. We have a long way to go, but it’s a transaction which takes us in the right direction. This agreement makes our business simpler and stronger.”British Land owns or manages about £19 billion in property assets in Britain, with retail assets accounting for about 54 percent of its portfolio.Advertisement
