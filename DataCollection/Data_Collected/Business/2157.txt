Ferrari North America is recalling some 2016 California T vehicles because of the risk of a fuel leak in the engine compartment, according to a United States Department of Transportation notice on Friday. The recall, which began on Dec. 14, affects up to 185 vehicles manufactured between Sept. 8 and Nov. 11, 2015. The higher risk of a leak, which increases the chances of fire, was the result of a manufacturing defect in a part provided by a supplier, according to a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The move comes after Ferrari, owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V., recalled upward of 800 cars in the United States to fix a problem with its Takata airbags over the summer. Ferrari issued a stop sale notice to dealers of the 2016 model California T, which has a list price of just over $167,000 according to The Car Guide, on Nov. 23, filings show. Dealers will replace the line free of charge, the notice read.A version of this brief appears in print on December 26, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Ferrari Recalls Up to 185 Vehicles for Fuel Leak Risk.
