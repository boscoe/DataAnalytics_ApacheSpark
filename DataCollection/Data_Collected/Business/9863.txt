Margrethe Vestager, the European competition chief, has picked some high-profile fights with American companies.The most prominent battle at the moment is with Google.The search giant is expected to start responding this week to *three sets of* charges that it abused its dominant position.This is not a fight that will be over any time soon — a final decision by European officials is not expected until midway through 2017 at the earliest.Google could face a fine of up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, and operational changes that could crimp profits further. That’s not even mentioning the lengthy regulatory limbo if it appeals the ruling.For its part, the European Commission is also under scrutiny from those who view it as the last stand against universal control by American technology giants over the digital landscape.“At least a fine in the cases would show that there’s a bazooka in Europe that can be shot at companies like Google,” said Ramon Tremosa, a Spanish member of the European Parliament and a critic of the company.In the United States, the AT&T plan to buy Time Warner is still causing consternation.Jim Rutenberg considers the risks of one company controlling the flow of information to so many people.The deal could “cause a whole bunch of different horribles for consumers,” according to Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, who led the congressional opposition over Comcast’s failed bid to buy Time Warner Cable.As well as the prospect of less choice and higher prices, the deal has raised questions about AT&T’s stance toward net neutrality.As with Google in Europe, there will be plenty of time to examine the minutiae of the different arguments — the fight against the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger took about 14 months.“In the end, people who favor free trade survived to fight another day,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, referring to the trade deal that Canada and the European Union signed on Sunday.But the bigger question may be about how much longer they have to fight on.For some, the arguments over that deal were just a warm-up for the real battle still to come: the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between Europe and the United States.These disputes are being held against a backdrop of flat trade and sluggish growth that has left shipping companies with spare capacity and scrambling to protect themselves.The flow of goods from Asia to the United States was interrupted last month after Hanjin, the South Korean shipping line, filed for bankruptcy.On Monday, Japan’s three largest shipping companies agreed to merge a major portion of their businesses, saying they needed to join forces to survive.• The Commerce Department reports personal income and spending for September. Economists expect both income and spending to have been bolstered by a healthy labor market, but a bigger-than-expected gain could set off alarm bells for those keeping their eye on possible Federal Reserve interest rate movements.“We do natural experiments on a population and wait until it shows up as bad.”— David Bellinger, a professor at the Harvard University School of Public Health, referring to exposure to chemicals in agriculture. An examination by The New York Times indicates that genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang.Advertisement
