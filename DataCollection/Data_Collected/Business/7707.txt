Aveva would also distribute the £550 million it received as part of the deal to shareholders.Schneider Electric would be restricted from increasing its stake in Aveva for two years after the deal without approval of a majority of the company’s independent directors. Schneider Electric intends to seek a waiver under British takeover rules that would normally require it to make an offer for all of Aveva.Two nonexecutive directors nominated by Schneider Electric would be added to Aveva’s board of directors. Two years after the deal, Schneider Electric would have the right to appoint the Aveva chairman.“We believe that through increased scale, complementary footprint and joint R & D capabilities, the transaction will generate synergies that will benefit customers and shareholders alike,” said Jean-Pascal Tricoire, the Schneider Electric chairman and chief executive.Aveva, based in Cambridge, England, provides engineering software to the manufacturing, power and marine sectors. It was spun out of the University of Cambridge in 1967.The company posted revenue of £208.7 million for the 2014-15 fiscal year that ended in March.Aveva was advised by Lazard, while Schneider Electric was advised by Morgan Stanley and Ondra Partners.Advertisement
