Valeant Pharmaceuticals International said on Friday that it was ending its relationship with a pharmacy used to bolster sales of some of its expensive drugs. It also said the pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, would shut down operations as soon as possible.The three largest American drug benefit managers, Express Scripts, CVS Health and OptumRx, said on Thursday that they would stop paying for drugs dispensed by Philidor, which accounted for 6.8 percent of Valeant’s total revenue in the third quarter.That move followed a spate of reports that Philidor had used questionable tactics — such as changing doctor’s prescriptions and using other pharmacies’ identification numbers — to get insurers to pay for the drugs it dispensed.“We understand that patients, doctors and business partners have been disturbed by the reports of improper behavior at Philidor, just as we have been,” J. Michael Pearson, chief executive of Valeant, said in a statement. “We know the allegations have also led them to question Valeant and our integrity, and for that I take complete responsibility. Operating honestly and ethically is our first priority, and you have my absolute commitment that we will make it right.”AdvertisementBut Valeant’s attempt to cut its losses did not seem to work. Its shares, which sold for more than $260 in early August, fell another 16 percent Friday, to $93.77, even as one of its leading shareholders, William A. Ackman of the Pershing Square hedge fund, held a four-hour conference call to make the case that Valeant’s prospects were still bright.AdvertisementOn Friday, Standard & Poor’s lowered its credit rating on Valeant one notch, to B+ from BB–, saying that the Philidor controversy could do broader damage to the business.“We believe reports of wrongdoing at Philidor weakens Valeant management’s credibility” and “further harms the company’s already tarnished reputation,” the credit rating agency said. It said the developments “exacerbate potential legal, regulatory and reputational headwinds for the company.”Philidor declined to comment. Neither Philidor nor Valeant would say what, if anything, patients now getting their drugs through Philidor should do.
            The drug company is known for growing through acquisitions and cutting costs.        Mr. Pearson, a former consultant who took over as chief executive in 2008, made Valeant into a Wall Street darling with his strategy of shunning most risky research and development and instead buying one drug company after another.But Valeant shares have been falling rapidly since mid-September as politicians and the news media have questioned its practice of aggressively increasing prices on some drugs. In one case, it acquired a diabetes drug called Glumetza in its takeover of Salix Pharmaceuticals this year, and raised the price of the pills about 800 percent.Federal prosecutors are investigating the company’s pricing decisions, distribution and patient assistance programs, according to the company’s regulatory disclosures. It is not clear if the investigations were focusing on Philidor, but if not, they probably will now.Part of Valeant’s strategy to sell its dermatology drugs was to encourage doctors to have prescriptions filled by Philidor, a mail-order specialty pharmacy, rather than by retail pharmacies. That made it harder for pharmacists and insurers to substitute a less expensive drug.AdvertisementValeant acknowledged last week that it had bought an option to acquire Philidor.But the company did not disclose that relationship until word was starting to circulate on Wall Street, even though the transaction had occurred in December. That lack of disclosure has also raised questions about the company’s accounting practices.Valeant said it had not made a disclosure earlier because the relationship was too small to be material and Valeant had considered it a competitive advantage that it did not want widely known. While Philidor accounted for only 6.8 percent of Valeant’s sales in the third quarter, it was growing quickly, meaning it accounted for a greater portion of Valeant’s growth.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But by Friday, as allegations accumulated, he had reversed course.“The newest allegations about activities at Philidor raise additional questions about the company’s business practices,” Mr. Pearson said in his statement.  “We have lost confidence in Philidor’s ability to continue to operate in a manner that is acceptable to Valeant and the patients and doctors we serve.”Valeant did not specify what allegations Mr. Pearson was referring to. But The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News, citing internal Philidor documents, have reported this week that the pharmacy’s workers were instructed to use a variety of questionable methods to try to get insurance companies to pay for Valeant’s drugs.These included altering doctors’ prescriptions to specify that the Valeant brand-name drug, and not a cheaper generic, be used. Another tactic was to lower the price of a drug until an insurance company agreed to pay, then try to raise it again to get more reimbursement.Employees were also said to have been instructed that if a health plan would not pay for Philidor drugs, they instead use identification numbers from an affiliated pharmacy.Philidor mainly dispensed Valeant’s dermatology products, such as the acne tablet Solodyn, which can cost more than $1,000 a month, and the toenail fungus ointment Jublia, which costs more than $500 for a small bottle and is one of Valeant’s fastest-growing products.Philidor, which appears to have been started in 2013, has been a secretive company. Its website provides little information about it. California officials denied it a license to dispense drugs in that state, saying the company had not been truthful in answering questions about its ownership.AdvertisementIn a brief interview he gave in April to his state senator at Philidor’s headquarters in Hatboro, Pa., Andrew Davenport, Philidor’s chief executive, said the pharmacy expected to be filling 12,000 to 15,000 prescriptions a day by the end of this year, compared with the 6,000 a day it was dispensing in April. He said the company had 635 employees, of whom 430 were in Pennsylvania, and expected to hire another 300 this year.In the interview, which the state senator, Stewart J. Greenleaf, posted on his Facebook page, Mr. Davenport did not mention that Philidor dispensed drugs from Valeant almost exclusively or that Valeant had an option to buy his company. “We partner with the manufacturers of the best products available on the market,” he said.Mr. Davenport also boasted that Philidor had a “tremendous retention rate,” saying 93 percent of patients who got a drug from Philidor came back for a refill or continued therapy. Its efforts to keep patients on their medicines was probably one of the selling points of Philidor for Valeant.Valeant also announced on Friday that the new board committee evaluating the company’s relationship with Philidor had appointed a former United States deputy attorney general to advise it.The lawyer, Mark Filip, is a partner at Kirkland & Ellis who, the firm says, led BP’s defense in the Justice Department’s criminal investigation after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Before joining the law firm he was deputy attorney general for about a year beginning in March 2008, and before that a Federal District Court judge.A version of this article appears in print on October 31, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Valeant Ends Relationship With Philidor Pharmacy .
