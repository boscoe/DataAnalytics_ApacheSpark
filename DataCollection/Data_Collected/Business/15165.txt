BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — “Vinyl” wasn’t worth it anymore, “Game of Thrones” will run for two more seasons, and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” will be back next year.Those were some of the topics that HBO’s new president of programming, Casey Bloys, addressed at a Television Critics Association event here on Saturday.In addition to discussing programming decisions, Mr. Bloys confronted heated questions about whether HBO depicted sexual violence against women far too frequently.Speaking about the premium cable channel’s expensive flop, “Vinyl,” Mr. Bloys said that executives had decided to cancel it after taking a hard look.Advertisement“Quite frankly, if I’ve got limited resources, there are other things I want to do,” he said. “We didn’t think it was worth the producers’ time, our time, our resources to try to move the needle just a little bit more.”AdvertisementHe also said that “Game of Thrones” would conclude after its eighth season, and he acknowledged that next season’s summer premiere date would mean the show would not be eligible for the 2017 Emmys. “That’s just something we have to live with,” he said.For 16 straight years, HBO has led all TV networks with the most Emmy nominations, and “Game of Thrones” has been the most nominated show for the last three.With the final seasons of “The Leftovers” and “Girls” also coming up, Mr. Bloys said he was hopeful that the network’s new slate of shows — including the limited series “The Night Of,” the Sarah Jessica Parker dark comedy “Divorce” and the science-fiction drama “Westworld” — would make up the difference.HBO has been subjected to pointed criticism recently for several scenes featuring sexual violence against women, particularly in “Game of Thrones,” “The Night Of” and “Westworld.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The show’s creator and star, Garry Shandling, died in March.Mr. Bloys said that “Curb Your Enthusiasm” would go into production this fall, and the network later confirmed that the show’s ninth season would begin at some point next year. And Mr. Bloys did not rule out that “True Detective” could return for a third season, after a disappointing second season.Mr. Bloys also talked briefly about the network’s long-gestating animation project with Jon Stewart, saying it would be a parody of a cable news channel. He said he hoped it would be “up and running” in September or October, though HBO had originally said it would premiere earlier this year.And HBO’s devoted interest in politics is not going anywhere. When Mr. Bloys was asked whether the network would be interested in updating its successful TV movie “Game Change” about the 2008 election for this year’s wild campaign cycle, he suggested that was a possibility. He said that the makers of “Game Change,” Jay Roach and Danny Strong, had been at the Republican National Convention “poking around.”A version of this article appears in print on August 1, 2016, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: HBO’s ‘Game of Thrones’ Gets an End Date.
