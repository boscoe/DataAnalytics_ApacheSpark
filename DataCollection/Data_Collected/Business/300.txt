AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersWASHINGTON — Import prices in the United States fell only slightly in September, offset by recovering oil prices and suggesting a slowdown in the rate of imported deflation.American import prices declined only 0.1 percent last month, the Labor Department reported on Friday, and import prices, excluding oil, fell 0.2 percent, which was half the pace of the declines in July and August.Analysts expected overall import prices to decline more.“Today’s report suggests a significant slowing in the rate of imported deflation,” said Blerina Uruçi, an analyst at Barclays.In September, the Federal Reserve held off from raising interest rates largely because a weak global economy and financial market volatility had raised doubts that inflation in the United States would rise toward the Fed’s target of 2 percent as expected. A slowdown in the rate of imported deflation may help free the central bank to raise rates.A surge in the value of the United States dollar last year, propelled by expectations that a strengthening American economy would lead to higher interest rates, has been a factor pushing down inflation, as shown by declines in nonoil import prices.The Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, who said late last month that the Fed was likely to raise rates by the end of the year, has argued that the disinflationary impact of imports was bound to fade and that United States inflation would then tend to rise. The data on Friday appeared to confirm that.Already, declines in oil prices have moderated after a late 2014 plunge, and prices for imported oil rose 1.1 percent in September after declining sharply in August.Crude oil prices have actually moved higher over the last month. The dollar, which strengthened sharply in the second half of 2014, has weakened since March.The Labor Department data also showed that the price of imported consumer goods other than cars actually rose 0.1 percent in September, the first gain since February. Imported car prices were flat.Still, the data also pointed to continuing weakness in global demand that is weighing heavily on American factories and other exporters. Export prices fell 0.7 percent, more than the 0.2 percent decline expected. Advertisement
