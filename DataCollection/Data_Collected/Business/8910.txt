Markets had expected a 6.4 percent increase.Retail sales were the single positive surprise, growing 10.8 percent in August from the level of a year earlier, above forecasts for 10.5 percent.But the increase did not appear to conform with recent reports from local and foreign companies of slowing sales in China.Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant that dominates online sales in the country, on Tuesday lowered its sales forecasts in a fresh signal that the economic slowdown was taking a bite out of consumer spending.Vehicle sales fell 3 percent in August from a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said.Data last week showed that China’s manufacturers lowered prices at the fastest rate in six years in August, as commodity prices fell and demand cooled, signaling stubborn deflationary risks in the economy and adding to expectations for further stimulus measures.Imports tumbled more than expected, while exports shrank again, pointing to persistently weak demand at home and abroad.China’s surprise currency devaluation last month and a plunge in its stock markets since June have fueled fears of more shocks to the economy, although Premier Li Keqiang recently brushed off concerns that the country was facing a hard landing.China’s central bank has lowered interest rates five times since November and has repeatedly relaxed banks’ reserve requirements in an effort to put a floor beneath the sputtering economy.Further policy easing is widely expected in coming months, and the government is also trying to increase investment in infrastructure projects to support growth.The government is aiming for annual economic growth of about 7 percent this year, which would be the slowest since 1990.Advertisement
