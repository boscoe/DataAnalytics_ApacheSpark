The stock market surged again on Thursday, putting the Dow Jones industrial average on track for its best week since 2011.Investors plowed money back into stocks after a slump the week before, encouraged by a 4 percent jump in the price of crude oil and Pfizer’s $15.2 billion deal to buy the drugmaker Hospira.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 200 points, its third big gain this week. The Dow is now up about 700 points, or 4 percent, so far this week.That’s a far cry from the week before, when the blue-chip index stumbled nearly 3 percent.“We’ve been returning to more normal volatility and this week is just the most recent example of that,” said Gabriela Santos, a global market strategist with JPMorgan Asset Management.

The Nasdaq composite rose 48.39 points, or 1 percent, to 4,765.10.AdvertisementThe gains put the Dow and S.&P. 500 back into the black for 2015.Health care stocks and energy companies had some of the biggest gains.AdvertisementPfizer, the giant pharmaceutical company, said it would buy Hospira, a maker of injectable drugs, for $90 a share in cash. The deal is the first by Pfizer since it walked away from a merger with AstraZeneca last year. Like many other large drug companies, Pfizer is trying to generate more sales as its blockbuster drugs go generic. Hospira soared $22.84, or 35 percent, to $87.64, and Pfizer rose 92 cents, or 3 percent, to $32.99.Oil also had a wild day.West Texas intermediate crude, the United States benchmark, rose $2.03 to settle at $50.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, continuing a volatile ride that has lasted several weeks. On Wednesday, oil plunged $4.60, or 8.7 percent, to settle at $48.45 a barrel the day after the government reported an increase in crude inventories last week.Few investors believe the turbulence in oil trading will end anytime soon.“We’re starting to see some production shifts, but it’s happening slowly,” Ms. Santos said. “Oil is going to keep making these big swings until something is done to deal with all this oversupply.”
