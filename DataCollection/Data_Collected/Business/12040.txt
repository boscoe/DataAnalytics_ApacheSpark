Papa, the former chief executive of EOG Resources, the exploration and production business spun out of Enron in 1999. The cash will give Mr. Papa the ability to buy up energy assets that he and his team, which includes executives at the private equity firm Riverstone Holdings, deem valuable.The vehicle, known as Silver Run Acquisition Corporation, sold 45 million units for $10 apiece, according to a statement released late Tuesday, making it the largest I.P.O. of the year so far.The amount was $50 million more than Silver Run had set as a target, as demand surged on the prospects of being able to buy assets on the cheap thanks to the sharp downturn in oil and natural gas prices.Each unit represents one share and one-third of a warrant; the warrant allows the investor to acquire Silver Runâ€™s shares at $11.50 each in about a year.Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs managed the offering.The units, listed on the Nasdaq stock market, are expected to begin trading on Wednesday under the ticker symbol SRAQU.Advertisement
