The movies are “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” and “Scout’s Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.”Despite “serious talks with Paramount,” Mr. Warner said, “we don’t feel it was in either our best interest or our shareholders’ best interest.” Cinemark has 4,491 movie screens in the United States, making it the nation’s third-largest exhibitor.The Regal Entertainment Group, the No. 1 chain in North America, with roughly 7,300 screens, rejected the Paramount plan last week. “The parameters of the current proposal, both economic and structural, simply do not make sense for us, given the potential risks to the long-term health of our business,” Amy Miles, Regal’s chief executive, told investors in a conference call.Theaters have typically insisted on a 90-day exclusive window to play new films, even though many movies generate the bulk of their ticket sales in their first month of release. A shorter window, exhibitors have worried, could prompt consumers to skip going to theaters and just wait for movies to arrive in their homes.Studios are eager to shorten that 90-day period, in part because they want to reduce marketing costs. Under the current setup, studios advertise films when they arrive in theaters and again several months later, when they arrive in homes.In early July, Paramount announced a deal with AMC Theaters, the nation’s second-largest chain, with about 5,000 screens, and a leading Canadian multiplex chain, Cineplex, to shorten the window for the two horror movies. AMC and Cineplex will play the movies in wide release, but as soon as interest begins to wane and the chains cut back availability to fewer than 300 screens, a 17-day clock will begin to tick.After that, Paramount can release the films on digital platforms, with an undisclosed portion of the revenue going to AMC and Cineplex — up to 90 days.Paramount offered the same deal to other exhibitors. Regal and Cinemark rejected it — meaning the films will not play on their screens at all — but some smaller theater operators have agreed, including National Amusements, Southern Theaters and Alamo Drafthouse Cinema.Rob Moore, Paramount Pictures’ vice chairman, said the company believed that an increase in digital revenue would make up for any lost revenue in the theaters.“We never anticipated 100 percent participation or agreement on this proposal for a flexible window,” he said in a statement. “We believe strongly that our industry needs a new model that responds to how our consumers want to see our movies, and we have been encouraged by the tremendous amount of support we’ve received from within the industry for our efforts to seek a cooperative solution to this growing challenge.”Advertisement
