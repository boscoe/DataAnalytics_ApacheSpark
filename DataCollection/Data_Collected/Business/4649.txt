BEIJING — Activity in China’s factory sector fell to an 11-month low in March as new orders shrank, the early reading of a private survey showed, signaling persistent weakness in the economy.The survey, the preliminary purchasing managers’ index compiled by the research firm Markit and released by HSBC, dropped to 49.2 in March, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from contraction on a monthly basis. The figure was down from a final P.M.I. of 50.7 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading 50.6 for March.The poor reading added to signs that the economy has lost momentum despite two interest rate cuts since November, a reduction in the amount of money that banks must keep in reserve and repeated attempts by the central bank to reduce financing costs.Some analysts expect China’s first-quarter economic growth to fall below the government’s full-year target of about 7 percent — widely seen as the level needed to keep employment steady.Advertisement“The weaker P.M.I. data could increase pressure for policy loosening,” economists at the China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank, said in a research note.AdvertisementThey predicted that the central bank would cut reserve requirement ratios at banks six more times this year, on top of another interest rate cut. JPMorgan said the next reserve requirement cut might come as soon as April.A separate industry survey released by China Beige Book on Monday showed that although Chinese companies grew even more wary of borrowing and investing in the first quarter, profit margins remained sturdy.“With firm performance and the labor market both in decent shape, the absence of heavy stimulus should be surprising only to those analysts who still make policy predictions based on G.D.P.,” Leland Miller, the president of China Beige Book, wrote in the report.The preliminary HSBC survey suggested that manufacturers faced considerable challenges from weaker domestic demand and deflationary risks.The new orders sub-index fell to a 11-month low of 49.3 in March. New export orders decreased for a second straight month, albeit at a slower pace.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It expected growth to cool further to 6.8 percent in the second quarter.A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Factory Activity in China Drops to an 11-Month Low as the Economy Stutters.
