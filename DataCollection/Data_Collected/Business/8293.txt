BERLIN — Germany softened its resistance to a third bailout package for Greece on Wednesday, raising the chances that a draft plan could be approved in time for the country to make a crucial debt payment next week.While a political obstacle course still lies ahead, officials in Berlin and Brussels spoke of a markedly improved negotiating climate. Eurozone finance ministers scheduled a meeting on Friday in Brussels at which they could give their imprimatur to the bailout deal.The German government gave an explicit, if cautious, welcome to a draft agreement reached on Tuesday, which would grant Greece as much as 86 billion euros, or about $95 billion, in return for strict spending limits and other conditions. The officials also stressed they needed a few more figures before they could reach a final judgment on the proposal.The bailout requires approval from parliaments in Germany, Greece and other countries before Aug. 20, when Greece must repay €3.2 billion it owes the European Central Bank. The plan has stirred significant opposition in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative bloc, and Ms. Merkel and other senior government members have taken pains to cast themselves as careful stewards of public money. That stance made Wednesday’s cautious welcome to the Greek plan all the more significant.Advertisement“The direction of the agreement is right,” said Steffen Seibert, spokesman for Ms. Merkel. Nevertheless, he said, the government needed several days to assess the plan before it could recommend it to Parliament for approval. And officials in Berlin continued to speak of giving Greece a temporary loan rather than rushing to reach an accord.AdvertisementAs if to demonstrate the watchdog role it intends to play, the German Finance Ministry sent Brussels a two-page commentary on the draft agreement, posing questions for which the eurozone finance ministers should demand Greek answers. A Finance Ministry official declined to give more detail about the commentary but explicitly denied a report in the German newspaper Bild that Berlin had rejected the proposed bailout program.In Athens, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, also faced resistance to the deal in Parliament, which would need to approve 200 pages of legislation by Friday to qualify for the aid. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the speaker of the Parliament and a dissident in Mr. Tsipras’s Syriza party, was using her control over procedure to delay a vote on the bailout.But Mr. Tsipras said on Wednesday that he was confident the deal would be approved in time.“We will prove wrong those who doubt us, and we will manage to rebuild the country,” Mr. Tsipras said.To qualify for its third bailout in five years, Greece must agree to sweeping changes to the way it manages its economy. Among other things, the draft agreement reached on Tuesday requires Greece to overhaul tax collection procedures, deregulate the natural gas market and change foreclosure laws.In Brussels, officials praised cooperation they received from Athens, which contrasted with the rancor that prevailed when Yanis Varoufakis, a combative economics professor and outspoken populist, was serving as the Greek finance minister. The official who replaced him, Euclid Tsakalotos, has been seen as a more practical and cooperative negotiator.
                European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.            Given the brinkmanship and ill will that had characterized relations between Greece and its eurozone creditors, particularly Germany, the new mood seemed almost jarringly upbeat. But Greece has accepted almost all of the creditors’ demands, making it difficult for Germany to obstruct the deal. The questions ahead include whether the government of Greece can carry out the changes it is promising — assuming the country’s lawmakers vote to embrace them and the Greek people cooperate.The draft agreement with eurozone countries includes 29 pages of details about how Greece should modernize its economy and its public administration, for example by curtailing early retirement, giving businesses more freedom, privatizing state-owned industries like railroads and airports, and fighting corruption.Advertisement“All last details have been clarified,” Annika Breidthardt, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told a daily briefing in Brussels on Wednesday.While many economists see the changes as necessary, many Greeks resent what they see as micromanagement of their economy by outsiders. For example, the plan contains detailed instructions on how Greece should change its foreclosure laws to make it easier for banks to collect unpaid debts. More than a third of Greek loans are classified as nonperforming, a serious threat to the banking system.And many experts say the plan is predicated on an unrealistically speedy turnaround in the Greek economy. After shrinking 2.3 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2016, according to the plan’s forecasts, the Greek economy is supposed to rebound sharply, rising 2.7 percent in 2017 and 3.1 percent in 2018.“I am a little bit stunned because those numbers have no relationship to reality,” said Ashoka Mody, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now a professor at Princeton University. He said the growth estimates were incompatible with the strict spending limits that creditors are imposing on Greece.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Negotiations took place in an atmosphere that we hadn’t experienced in the past months.”A crucial issue is whether the terms of the agreement will allow participation of the I.M.F. in the early stages of the bailout.AdvertisementThe fund, another of Greece’s creditors, participated in drafting the agreement reached with Athens on Tuesday night. But the I.M.F. has said it will not take part in any program that does not include debt relief for Greece. That is a potential sticking point, because the German government and others want to ensure that Greece starts living up to its promises before offering longer maturities or reduced interest rates to ease its debt burden.The Greek government owes more than €315 billion, mostly to other eurozone countries. But it still owes the I.M.F. €20 billion, and the new program assumes Greece might borrow still more from the fund.Germany has not ruled out giving Greece years if not decades to repay its loans, however, which could satisfy the I.M.F. Leaders in Germany regard the fund as a crucial participant because of its expertise in dealing with overly indebted countries and making sure they adhere to bailout terms.Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, held separate telephone calls with President François Hollande of France and Ms. Merkel on Wednesday about the deal. In addition, officials from the finance ministries of the 28 European Union member states planned to talk by phone Wednesday evening on the bailout plan.A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry, Jürg Weissgerber, noted on Wednesday that Berlin was still waiting for important figures and exact details on the size of the proposed package. He also insisted that the idea of temporary financing remained an option if there was no agreement on the new bailout in time for Athens to make the Aug. 20 payment to the European Central Bank.Last month, Ms. Merkel faced open rebellion from 60 deputies in her center-right bloc when the Bundestag voted to approve opening negotiations with Greece. And exchanges among conservative lawmakers this week have suggested that the opposition to giving more money to Greece may have grown in the interim.Ms. Merkel can rely on the Social Democrats, partners in her coalition government, to ensure parliamentary approval. But in Germany’s consensus-minded political system, a rebellion against the authority of a chancellor is unusual, and thus significant.As is her custom, Ms. Merkel has returned quietly from vacation this week and not spoken publicly on Greece or other matters since Mr. Seibert confirmed that the chancellor had talked with Mr. Tsipras on Monday and Tuesday.But Mr. Seibert dismissed a report in Germany’s Bild newspaper that Ms. Merkel and the Greek prime minister engaged in a “loud,” or heated, exchange.AdvertisementMs. Merkel is scheduled to go to Brazil next week on a state visit. If all goes as planned, the German Parliament could be recalled from vacation to vote on the package before she leaves.Alison Smale reported from Berlin, Jack Ewing from Frankfurt and James Kanter from Brussels.
