The German automaker, whose brands include Audi, Porsche and Seat as well as the core Volkswagen marque, has been hit by fallout from the diesel emissions-cheating scandal that erupted in mid-September in the United States, then spread worldwide. The company said it delivered 833,700 vehicles worldwide last month, down from 852,900 in November 2014. While sales in the United States were off 15.3 percent at 45,300 units, and declines were steeper in Brazil and Russia over unrelated economic troubles, deliveries in Western Europe were up 2.6 percent at 270,400 and sales in China rose 5.5 percent to 329,000.
