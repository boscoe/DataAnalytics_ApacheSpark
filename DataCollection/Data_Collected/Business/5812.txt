JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia’s economic growth in the first quarter slumped to its weakest annual pace since 2009, hit by soft global demand and a collapse in commodities, underscoring the challenge facing President Joko Widodo as he strives to revive Southeast Asia’s biggest economy.Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 4.71 percent in January-March from a year ago, below the market’s median forecast of 4.95 percent, and down from growth of 5.01 percent in the final quarter of last year.The data adds “to the case for further rate cuts,” said Daniel Martin, senior economist at Capital Economics.”Although we doubt growth will slow much further in the coming quarters, we are not likely to see a strong rebound either.”AdvertisementAll sectors took a hit, the statistics bureau chief Suryamin told a press conference, with the manufacturing sector slowing and mining contracting 2.32 percent.AdvertisementInvestors, staring at what many analysts say is likely to be sub-par growth through the rest of this year, sold the Indonesian rupiah. The currency, the worst performer among emerging Asian peers this year, fell to 13,030 per dollar, its lowest since April 1.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
