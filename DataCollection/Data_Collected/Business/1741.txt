In a complaint filed on Wednesday in the New Haven, Conn., federal court, Pepperidge Farm said Trader Joe’s was damaging its good will and confusing shoppers through its sale of Trader Joe’s Crispy Cookies. Alison Mochizuki, a Trader Joe’s spokeswoman, said on Friday that the privately held company did not discuss pending litigation. Introduced in 1956, the Milano consists of chocolate filling, and sometimes other flavors, sandwiched between two oval-shaped cookies. A trademark was registered in 2010. Advertisement
