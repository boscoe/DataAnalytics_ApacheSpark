The transaction would give FedEx access to TNT’s extensive road delivery network in Europe, which would be much more costly for FedEx to build on its own.The commission, which opened an “in-depth” inquiry, has until Dec. 8 to investigate the proposed acquisition and to determine whether its initial concerns are founded.“Many businesses, and in particular e-commerce, rely heavily on affordable and reliable small-package delivery services, and many consumers depend on these services to ensure rapid and safe delivery of goods they have bought,” Margrethe Vestager, the commissioner in charge of competition policy, said in a news release. “The commission must therefore make sure that FedEx’s takeover of TNT would not impede effective competition and would not lead to higher prices for consumers.”The opening of an investigation does not prejudge the outcome of the inquiry, the commission said.“We will continue to work together with TNT Express to meet the European Commission’s need for additional due diligence and are confident that the combination of both companies will increase competition and create benefits for customers,” David Binks, FedEx’s European president, said in a news release. He said that he still expected the deal to close in the first half of 2016.FedEx said on Friday that the transaction was also being reviewed by other antitrust agencies, including bodies in China and Brazil.Depending on the outcome of their inquiry, European regulators could force TNT and FedEx to divest assets, or they could block the merger if they find that the deal would hurt competition in the delivery industry too much.European regulators blocked a $6.9 billion bid for TNT by UPS in 2013 over concerns that it would decrease competition and increase prices.When the FedEx-TNT merger was announced, the companies said they were confident that their deal would pass antitrust muster. A combination would create a stronger rival to DHL and UPS, which together control about two-thirds of the European express-delivery market, the companies said.In April, Antony Burgmans, TNT’s chairman, said the FedEx deal was “much simpler” than the previously proposed UPS transaction because there was much less overlap between the two companies. “We are far more complementary than what was the case with UPS,” Mr. Burgmans said at a news conference.As part of the transaction, TNT also agreed to sell its airline operations, including its cargo services, because the European Commission restricts foreign ownership of airlines in Europe.Under the terms of the deal, FedEx would pay 8 euros a share in cash for each outstanding share of TNT, valuing the Dutch company at about 4.4 billion euros, or about $4.8 billion.FedEx, which has been operating in Europe for about 30 years, had about 210 million shipments into and out of Europe last year and provides next-day service to about 86 percent of the market, but it lags well behind DHL and UPS in Europe.Advertisement
