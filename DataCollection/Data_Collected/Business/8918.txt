Garth Saloner, the dean of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, announced his resignation on Monday, saying he did not want “a baseless and protracted lawsuit related to a contentious divorce” to hurt the school’s reputation. The divorce involves two Stanford professors. Mr. Saloner began a relationship with the wife shortly after the couple separated, Stanford acknowledged on Monday. The husband is suing the university, saying he was discriminated against. Stanford said he was treated “fairly and equitably.” Mr. Saloner, who has been dean since 2009, told the Stanford community he had become “increasingly concerned that the ongoing litigation and growing media interest will distract all of you.” After Mr. Saloner steps down at the end of the current academic year, he will return to teaching. He did not respond to a request for an interview. U.S. News & World Report rated Stanford’s business school the best in the nation last spring.A version of this brief appears in print on September 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Stanford Business School Dean to Resign Over a Lawsuit.
