Pep Boys, the car-parts and servicing chain based in Philadelphia, agreed on Thursday to be acquired by Bridgestone for $947 million, rejecting a competing, and possibly larger, bid by the billionaire Carl C. Icahn.In a statement, Pep Boys, formally known as Pep Boys — Manny, Moe & Jack, said that its board of directors unanimously recommended that shareholders accept a revised offer from Bridgestone of $17 a share in cash, up from an earlier offer by the tire company of $15.50 a share. Mr. Icahn’s last offer was $16.50 a share.But in a filing on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Icahn said that he was prepared to offer 10 cents a share more than any proposal by Bridgestone — up to about $18.10 per share.If Pep Boys were to accept a better offer from another suitor, it would have to pay Bridgestone a termination fee of $39.5 million, more than the previous termination fee of $35 million, according to the statement.Pep Boys shares closed at $17.51, up 11 cents, or 0.63 percent, before the new Bridgestone offer was made public.A version of this article appears in print on December 25, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Pep Boys Accepts Takeover Bid by Bridgestone for $947 Million.
