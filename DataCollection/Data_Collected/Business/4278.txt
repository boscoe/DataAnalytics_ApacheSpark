Columbia’s Graduate School of Journalism is reducing its class size and cutting staff positions as demand for journalism schools across the country dwindles.The school plans to decrease enrollment over the next several years and will eliminate about six staff positions before the next school year, according to an email sent Wednesday to staff members and full-time faculty from Steve Coll, the dean of the school.The job cuts do not include faculty positions, said Elizabeth Fishman, the school’s associate dean for communications.Newsrooms across the country, struggling with declining revenue and readership, have been downsizing. In 2012, the number of full-time employees in newsrooms fell by 2,600 jobs, or 6.4 percent, according to a March 2014 report by the Pew Research Center.AdvertisementApplications to Columbia’s journalism school surged after the recession in 2008, which led the university to expand enrollment. The school now intends to “return to a smaller student body size,” Mr. Coll wrote, closer to what he called “its historical norm.” There are 234 full-time students in the core degree program, Ms. Fishman said.“This adjustment will preserve our capacity for hands-on and intensive teaching that is a trademark of the school,” Mr. Coll wrote, adding that the reduction would “be gradual.”AdvertisementColumbia is also aiming to increase fund-raising for student scholarships, Mr. Coll wrote. The result would be more money available for each enrolled student, something that would “strengthen our ability to attract high-quality and diverse students,” he said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
