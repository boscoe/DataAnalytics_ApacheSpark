The 2017 F-250, F-350 and F-450 Super Duty trucks will sit on a new high-strength steel frame and have aluminum body panels. The materials help cut up to 350 pounds off the trucksâ€™ weight. Ford will offer three engines: a 6.7-liter V8 diesel, a 6.2-liter V8 gas engine and a 6.8-liter V10. Advertisement
