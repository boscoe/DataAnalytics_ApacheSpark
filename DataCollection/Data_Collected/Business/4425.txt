PARIS —  The planned merger of Holcim and Lafarge, two European cement-making giants, appears to be on the verge of falling apart after Holcim demanded a revision to the agreed to terms.Holcim’s board “has concluded that the combination agreement can no longer be pursued in its present form,” it said in a statement on Monday, “and has proposed to enter into negotiations in good faith around the exchange ratio and governance issues.”Holcim shareholders in recent weeks had expressed reservations about the all-stock deal, under which the two companies were to swap their shares one for one. But since the deal was announced in April, Holcim’s business has performed better recently than Lafarge’s.Holcim, based in Jona, Switzerland, and Lafarge, based in Paris, had said that they would merge on equal terms to form the world’s largest cement and construction materials company. Last year, the companies had combined sales of nearly $33 billion and a total of 131,000 employees.AdvertisementThe two companies’ share prices, which had moved in step for most of the period since the merger announcement last April, but Holcim’s recently have fared better.
            Shares of Holcim and Lafarge rose with the news of their merger last April, but their performance since has been mixed.

While Lafarge has signaled its willingness to address the valuation question, Holcim is now demanding a larger role in running the combined group, including claiming for itself the position of chief executive, a role that had previously been promised to Bruno Lafont, the Lafarge boss.AdvertisementIn its own statement, Lafarge said that while it remained “committed to the project,” it was willing to discuss only the exchange ratio and would “not accept any other modification of the terms of the existing agreements.”Analysts said the deadlock might kill the deal.Holcim is “trying to push the board of Lafarge to a place where they don’t want to go,” said Arnaud Palliez, an analyst at Raymond James in Paris. “It was always a merger of equals. If you no longer respect that parity, I think you have a dealbreaker.”As recently as Friday, teams from the two companies were holding talks near Charles de Gaulle Airport, outside Paris, and it was “business as normal,” according to a person close to Lafarge, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the company’s behalf.But on Sunday, the person said, Lafarge management was stunned by new demands in a letter from Holcim’s chairman, Wolfgang Reitzle, that the Swiss company be given a larger leadership role than was initially agreed upon. That would have changed the deal “from a merger of equals into a takeover without a premium,” the person said, something Lafarge could not accept.Despite the deterioration in the negotiating climate, the person close to Lafarge said, the companies hope to reach a deal by Thursday. That is when shareholders of CRH, an Irish company, are to vote on the CRH’s planned acquisition of Lafarge-Holcim assets valued at 6.5 billion euros, or $6.9 billion, that would smooth the path to regulatory approval.Lafarge shares closed down 6.25 percent on Monday in Paris. Holcim shares were down 1.33 percent in Zurich. Shares of CRH fell by 4.7 percent in Dublin.AdvertisementThomas Schmidheiny, Holcim’s largest shareholder, who has a 20 percent stake, had been agitating for a sweeter deal.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
