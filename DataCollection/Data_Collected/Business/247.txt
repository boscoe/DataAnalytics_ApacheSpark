Many investors were awaiting the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest policy meeting, to be released on Thursday, and the start of the corporate earnings season.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 122.10 points, or 0.7 percent, to 16,912.29. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 15.91 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,995.83 and the Nasdaq composite rose 42.79 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,791.15. The biggest gainers were stocks that were hit hardest the day before: health care, particularly biotechnology companies, and energy stocks. The drug maker Amgen rose nearly 5 percent, Celgene rose 4 percent and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose nearly 6 percent.By far, the biggest loser in the S.&P. 500 was Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. Yum shares sank $15.75, or 19 percent, to $67.67 after its profits and sales missed analysts’ expectations. Sales in China, a major market for KFC, rose only 2 percent, far less than expected.Events over the next two weeks are likely to determine the market’s next move. Earnings season will unofficially start Thursday when Alcoa, the giant maker of aluminum and other metals, will report its results.Expectations for this round of earnings are low. Analysts expect third-quarter results to be down 5.1 percent from last year, according to FactSet, which would be the first back-to-back quarterly drop in earnings since 2009.“Expectations are so low this quarter that it’s not going to be hard for companies to beat,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.Another lingering concern is the direction of the global economy. Fears of a downturn were stoked by a report from the International Monetary Fund suggesting that China’s slowdown and tumbling commodity prices will push global economic growth this year to the lowest level since the 2009 recession.With that in mind, companies, particularly those with exposure to businesses outside the United States, are likely to be in focus this quarter, Mr. Ablin said.Oil prices gave up an early gain and turned lower after the Energy Department reported that domestic oil inventories rose by 3.1 million barrels last week and that demand for oil fell slightly. Oil had rallied earlier on signs that producers were cutting back production.Benchmark United States oil fell 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $47.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, lost 59 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $51.33 a barrel in London.In other futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, wholesale gasoline fell 4.6 cents to $1.390 a gallon; heating oil fell 3.2 cents to $1.580 a gallon; and natural gas rose less than a penny to $2.474 per 1,000 cubic feet.Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.07 percent, from 2.04 percent late on Tuesday. The euro edged down to $1.1240 and the dollar slipped to 119.98 yen.Advertisement
