A former top prosecutor in New York City has been appointed the federal monitor for General Motors after its agreement last month to pay $900 million to end a United States criminal investigation over a lethal defect in its vehicle ignition switches.The appointee, Bart M. Schwartz, formerly chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, will review policies and practices at G.M., including the adequacy of the automaker’s procedures for addressing defects.The appointment was disclosed on Thursday on the website of United States Attorney Preet Bharara, whose office investigated G.M.The defect involved ignition switches on Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other vehicles that could cause their engines to stall, which in turn prevented airbags from deploying in crashes. The defect has been linked to 124 deaths.AdvertisementCraig Glidden, G.M.’s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement that the company pledged its full cooperation to Mr. Schwartz, as well as transparency and candor.Mr. Schwartz has served as a monitor or compliance adviser for other companies, including BP and Deutsche Bank, Mr. Bharara’s office said. Mr. Schwartz could not immediately be reached for comment.AdvertisementNo G.M. employees were charged in the settlement.A version of this article appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Ex-Federal Prosecutor Is Named to Monitor G.M.
