On Wednesday, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, indicated that the measure had already begun to bear fruit.The eurozone as he described it is benefiting from a convergence of low oil prices, improved government policy and — not least — the bank’s newest stimulus program.A bond-buying program begun a month ago is “proceeding smoothly,” Mr. Draghi said at a news conference, which happened to take place on one of the balmiest spring days of the year so far in Frankfurt.Mr. Draghi’s news conference did not proceed quite as smoothly. As he was briefing reporters, a young woman jumped from the news media seats, tossed papers and confetti at Mr. Draghi and shouted “end E.C.B. dictatorship” before she was subdued by security guards. It was a rare breach of bank security.AdvertisementA woman named Josephine Witt who described herself as a freelance activist claimed responsibility for the confetti attack on Twitter. On her Twitter feed, Ms. Witt provided a link to a Wikipedia entry that says she is a 21-year-old philosophy student in Hamburg who took part in a topless protest against Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, while he was on a visit to Hanover in 2013.AdvertisementThe central bank said in a statement later that the protester had masqueraded as a journalist, passed an identity check and had been through a metal detector. After a brief break, Mr. Draghi, though he appeared rattled, resumed reading the central bank’s opening statement.While acknowledging that extremely low interest rates could feed asset bubbles or pose other risks, Mr. Draghi said the central bank was sticking to its plan to keep buying government bonds and other debt at a rate of 60 billion euros, or about $63.6 billion, a month at least through September 2016.He said there was no sign that, as some analysts have argued, the central bank could have trouble finding enough debt to buy that meets its standards.Talk about “scarcity in the bond market is really premature,” Mr. Draghi said. “We really don’t see such a phenomenon.”The program, known as quantitative easing, is a form of money printing intended to push down interest rates and nudge inflation back toward the official target of close to 2 percent. While improvement in inflation will take some time, the effect on bonds has been more immediate, as the program has stoked demand. As Mr. Draghi pledged his commitment to the stimulus, the yield on Germany’s 10-year bond dropped more than 20 percent to 0.105 in afternoon trading in Europe, potentially on the way to joining Switzerland in having negative long-term yields.The newness of the bond-buying program has not stopped some economists from urging the European Central Bank to start planning how to taper its purchases — as the Federal Reserve is already doing in the United States.On Wednesday, economists at Allianz, a large German insurer, called on the central bank to establish benchmarks for scaling back its bond buying. As inflation picks up, the bank should cut its purchases to avoid negative side effects, the Allianz economists said.Advertisement“The program has substantial effects on financial markets,” Michael Heise, the chief economist at Allianz, said in a meeting with several reporters on Wednesday. “The E.C.B. has to confront the question of whether it should have some flexibility built into the program.”Mr. Draghi batted away suggestions that the central bank should already be discussing how to back out of bond buying.A protester disrupted the monthly European Central Bank news conference in Frankfurt by jumping on the desk and throwing confetti at Mario Draghi, the central bank president.“We’ve been in this program only a month,” Mr. Draghi said, invoking a simile on running. “It’s like asking yourself after 1K, are you going to finish this marathon?”He acknowledged that central bank intervention in debt markets, which have pushed the market interest rates on many government bonds into negative territory, comes with risks.“We are aware that very low interest rates for a very long time are fertile terrain for financial stability imbalances,” Mr. Draghi said. “Having said that, we don’t see at this point in time evidence of systemically large financial imbalances.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Eurozone banks are in much better shape than they were three years ago, he added, so that borrowers are finally benefiting from the cheap cash the central bank makes available to commercial lenders.“More accommodative monetary policy is being translated into better credit conditions,” he said, “which is not something we have seen before.”Mr. Draghi noted that financial forecasters had followed the lead of the E.C.B. as it raised its economic growth expectation for 2015, predicting it will accelerate to 1.5 percent from an earlier forecast of 1 percent.While government borrowing costs continued to drop, stocks on Wednesday were little changed, rising by 0.5 percent. The euro, which has fallen sharply against the dollar in recent months, was down slightly to about $1.06.AdvertisementThe central bank also left its main interest rate unchanged at a low of 0.05 percent. As a policy tool, it has been all but eclipsed by the so-called quantitative easing program that the central bank began in March.Some economists are hesitant to give too much credit to the European Central Bank for recent growth. The economy has also benefited from low fuel prices and a steep fall in the value of the euro, which bolsters exports by making products from the eurozone less expensive for customers paying in dollars and other major currencies.Cheap fuel and a weak euro will most likely be temporary, and economists have warned that the recovery could be short-lived unless eurozone countries do more to create permanent conditions for faster growth, for example by loosening rigid labor regulations.“The risk is great that if these conditions turn around, there would be a big drop in growth,” Mr. Heise of Allianz said. “The economy is not yet self-sustaining.”Mr. Draghi said that, while governments have made progress in improving business conditions, they should take advantage of favorable conditions now to do more, for example making it easier for companies to hire and fire.“Our monetary policy finds its natural complement in structural reforms,” he said.Mr. Draghi did not appear overly concerned that Greece’s financial condition is an imminent threat to the stability of the eurozone. The European Central Bank plays a crucial role because it controls the flow of emergency lending to Greek banks, without which some would probably collapse.The E.C.B. has taken a hard line with the government of Greece but has avoided a bigger crisis by providing a drip feed of cash to Greek banks. European Central Bank lending to Greek banks has reached €110 billion, Mr. Draghi said, more than any other eurozone country in terms of the proportion to the size of the economy.Mr. Draghi said the central bank would continue to support Greek banks. But he emphasized that it was up to political leaders to resolve an impasse over the terms of European Union loans to the Athens government.“It’s entirely in the hands of the Greek government,” he said, “and the negotiations that are taking place between the Greek government and the euro area members.”A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: E.C.B. Sees Early Progress From Its Stimulus Effort.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
