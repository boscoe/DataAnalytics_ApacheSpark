The studio, announced on Wednesday, also is backed by Otter Media, the venture between AT&T and the Chernin Group. Terms were not disclosed.Gunpowder & Sky, named after a lyric in the Aimee Mann song “4th of July,” was formed as a global studio for today’s digital media landscape, Mr. Toffler said.“There is a content renaissance going on,” said Mr. Toffler, who left his job as president of MTV Networks Music and Logo Group in April. “I wanted to go back to making stuff and finding new, young, innovative and edgy creators.”The group plans to seek new talent and back it in the creation and distribution of narrative-driven content that is “independent of form, genre or platform.” Examples include a four-minute animation series and digital-first horror movies. Traditional television outlets are struggling to keep young viewers as they, and advertisers, go to digital outlets.The Otter Group, created in April 2014, has more than $500 million in financing and has made several deals focused on streaming video and youth audiences. Its portfolio includes a controlling stake in Fullscreen, a digital media company, and Crunchyroll, which streams anime videos.Advertisement
