As streaming music becomes more popular with consumers, the agency that processes much of the licensing income behind outlets like Pandora and Sirius XM has quickly grown to be one of the music industry’s biggest sources of royalties.The agency, SoundExchange, a nonprofit group that pays performing artists and record companies when their music is played on Internet and satellite radio services, said on Thursday that it paid $773 million in royalties in 2014. That is a 31 percent increase from the year before, and more than triple what it paid as recently as 2010, when SoundExchange distributed $251 million.The amount of royalties generated each year by the 15-year-old SoundExchange is now close to what is paid by Ascap and BMI, which handle the songwriting side of rights for radio, online services and other outlets and have been some of the music industry’s oldest financial engines. BMI, founded 76 years ago, paid $840 million in royalties in its most recent fiscal year.In a statement, SoundExchange’s chief executive, Michael Huppe, called 2014 “a banner year for SoundExchange” and trumpeted the organization’s move to monthly payments to its thousands of members.But SoundExchange also faces challenges. The panel of federal judges that sets its royalty rates, the Copyright Royalty Board, is hearing arguments about webcasting services like Pandora for the years 2016 to 2020; as in past years, the proceeding is contentious, with Pandora, iHeartRadio and other music outlets asking for lower royalty rates and SoundExchange asking for more. The judges’ decision is expected by the end of the year.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
