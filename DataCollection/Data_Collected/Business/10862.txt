WASHINGTON — The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose sharply last week, a potential signal the job market was losing steam although some of the increase might be attributed to temporary holiday factors.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 20,000, to a seasonally adjusted 287,000, for the week ended Dec. 26, the Labor Department said on Thursday.That was the highest since July, although in recent months the weekly readings for claims have held near a 42-year low.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 270,000 in the latest week.The labor market heated up in 2015, enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates on Dec. 16 for the first time in a decade, a milestone in the American recovery from the 2007-9 recession.

Many economists expect a slower pace of job market improvement in 2016 even as the unemployment rate falls further from its current 5 percent. After dropping sharply for years, jobless claims have appeared to stabilize since the middle of 2015.AdvertisementLast week’s data may have been distorted by the holiday period, although the Labor Department said there were no special factors influencing the numbers. The four-week moving average, which analysts follow closely because it smooths out volatility, rose 4,500 to 277,000.AdvertisementStill, claims have been below 300,000, a threshold associated with a buoyant labor market, for 43 consecutive weeks, the longest stretch since the early 1970s.The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 3,000 to 2.2 million in the week ended Dec. 19.A separate report released by Chicago affiliate of the Institute of Supply Management showed that the Chicago  Business Barometer contracted at the fastest pace since July 2009. The index fell 5.8 points to 42.9 points in December when compared with the previous month. Order backlogs slowed and new orders fell. Although the index can be volatile from month to month, the index is down 16.5 points from its high in January.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
