Wells Fargo’s profit machine showed signs of slowing in the first quarter as the bank reported a rare decline in net income from a year ago.The bank’s profits were squeezed by a combination of rising expenses and low interest rates. And although net income of $5.8 billion, or $1.04 a share, beat analysts’ expectations of 98 cents, the 1.5 percent drop from $5.89 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the period a year earlier showed that what many consider to be one of the industry’s most savvy management teams cannot overcome the broad pressures buffeting the financial system.Big consumer banks like Wells, which have been amassing a vast deposit base, are in a bit of a holding pattern while the Federal Reserve ponders when to raise interest rates. When rates do rise, those deposits will earn the bank more money. Until then, Wells has been focused on other ways to increase profits like cutting expenses. But that appeared more difficult to accomplish in the first quarter.Revenue increased 3 percent, to $21.3 billion, as the bank continued to make more loans and take in more deposits.In a statement, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, John Stumpf, said, “We continued to strengthen our customer relationships in the quarter, as reflected in strong growth in deposits and primary checking customers.”AdvertisementBut that growth could not offset some of the other pressures on the bank’s bottom line.Wells Fargo’s efficiency ratio — which is one measure of how the bank is managing expenses — was 58.8 percent in first quarter, which was at the very upper end of the range that the bank is seeking to achieve this year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Net interest margin, which is the difference between what the bank makes on lending and what it pays to customers with deposits, declined to 2.95 percent in the first quarter from 3.20 percent a year ago.AdvertisementThe bank’s return on equity also fell, to 13.17 percent from 14.35 in the period a year earlier.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
