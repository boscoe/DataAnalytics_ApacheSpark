Job openings soared 8 percent to 5.75 million, the most since records began in 2000, the Labor Department said on Wednesday in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey. Yet overall hiring slumped, suggesting that employers were slow to fill the jobs they advertised. The big jump in openings in July would typically point to greater hiring in the months ahead, but since China’s economy stumbled in August, concern about global growth has risen, causing violent swings in the stock market. That may cause employers to take a cautious approach in the coming months. In the last 12 months, average hourly pay has increased just 2.2 percent, up from a 2 percent pace in July. More job openings could also contribute to a decision by the Federal Reserve during its meeting next week to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years.A version of this brief appears in print on September 10, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Number of Open Jobs Surges, but Employers Are Hiring Less.
