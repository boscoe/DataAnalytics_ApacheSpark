AdvertisementSupported byBy Sydney EmberAOL introduced an advertising platform Tuesday that it says will help brands more effectively spend their money to maximize the impact of ad campaigns. The platform, called ONE by AOL, is the company’s latest push into ad tech as it seeks to compete with Facebook and Google.ONE will use various data sources to show brands how consumers are reacting to their ads, AOL said, helping them to more easily determine the effectiveness, or return on investment, of their ad campaigns across various media, from mobile devices to television. Marketers will then be able to adjust their ad spending accordingly — for example, moving more money into mobile advertising if that appears to be where more consumers are responding.The platform will also consolidate most of the ad companies that AOL has purchased in recent years, including Adap.tv, which it bought in 2013 for $405 million. AOL’s platform is open, meaning advertisers are able to use the technology alongside that of competitors’.“AOL’s mission has at its heart the ‘simplification’ of the digital space,” Tim Armstrong, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement.Ad companies are racing to offer marketers tools to buy ads, manage ad spending and gauge the effectiveness of online campaigns. The goal is to target consumers at the right time on the right medium.To that end, AOL has been steadily building up its ad technology in recent years with the goal of gaining a bigger piece of the advertising market. The research firm eMarketer, for instance, predicts that AOL will control 3.5 percent of the $27.05 billion digital display ad market in the United States this year.The unveiling of ONE comes two weeks before the annual NewFront presentations in New York, during which media companies try to woo advertisers with original programming and new technology. AOL’s NewFront presentation is on April 28.Advertisement
