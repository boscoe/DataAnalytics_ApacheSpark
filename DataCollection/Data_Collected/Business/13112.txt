During the savings-and loan-crisis in the early 1990s, the question “Where were the lawyers?” was asked about the wrongdoing taking place at numerous banks.The confidential documents known as the Panama Papers, which show how lawyers helped set up offshore bank accounts and shell companies, provides one possible answer: The lawyers have always been right in the middle of it.This is not the only recent example of lawyers acting as willing participants in trying to help clients, while seemingly turning a blind eye to possible violations of the law. A report issued by the nonprofit organization Global Witness, featured on the “60 Minutes” news program in January, included undercover videos of lawyers in New York who appeared quite eager to advise the mysterious representative of an African minister about how to move funds into the United States to buy assets while keeping his ownership anonymous.Rather than seeking to keep clients from violating the law, it appears that some lawyers are willing to go right up to the line of legality in their representation. By keeping themselves ignorant about what may be going on, these lawyers have been able to maintain the facade that they are not involved in potentially illegal activities, even though they are often the prime enablers of misconduct.AdvertisementHas the legal profession lost its moral compass?The answer is that the ethical rules governing lawyers do not put much of a barrier in the way of helping clients engage in transactions that would appear questionable but do not violate any specific laws, so it is not clear whether lawyers pushing to the edge of the law are acting improperly.AdvertisementModel Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(d), issued by the American Bar Association, says that a lawyer should “not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent.”Note how the rule is premised on the lawyer’s knowledge, and many lawyers are expert at keeping themselves ignorant about exactly what is taking place to maintain plausible deniability. Moreover, that same rule says that “a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct,” so exploring the limits of the law can be permissible.Ramón Fonseca, one of the founders of the Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca, the source of the leaked Panama Papers, told The New York Times that the lawyers did nothing wrong in helping their clients set up shell companies.“We are like a car factory who sells its car to a dealer (a lawyer for example), and he sells it to a lady that hits someone. The factory is not responsible for what is done with the car,” he wrote.Lawyers in the United States are not required to comply with anti-money laundering compliance procedures imposed on financial institutions that require gathering information about the identity of account owners and the source of funds or assets. By avoiding the duty to inquire about their clients, lawyers can turn a blind eye by focusing only on what the client wants without asking the harder questions about what led to seeking legal advice.That may be the root of the issue of how lawyers enable their clients to engage in questionable transactions while avoiding any direct involvement, which allows them to claim to have done nothing improper.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The lawyers who were caught on video by Global Witness can assert they were simply discussing options with a potential client, with no obligation to question too deeply because this was only a preliminary discussion that might not advance any further.Lawyers often defend themselves by asserting that their only obligation is to represent their clients, with no greater public obligation. As long as they do not know the client will engage in criminal or fraudulent conduct, then advancing the client’s interests by ostensibly legal means is not only permissible, but a positive social good, even if their services might be misused.AdvertisementThe way to change this approach is to focus on the tools that lawyers have available by making it harder for clients to use their services to engage in misconduct. The Panama Papers detail the use of shell companies to hide assets, something The Times also described extensively in its series “Towers of Secrecy” articles about how the Manhattan condominium market is rife with anonymous owners shielding their identities behind corporate facades.The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, which has been introduced in the House and Senate, would require states to gather the names of those who control corporations and limited liability companies, the vehicles used to hide the true owners of assets. These proposals have not gained any traction yet in Congress, with the American Bar Association opposing earlier bills on the subject. The Panama Papers may give a push to the effort to require that ownership of corporate entities be available to law enforcement, even if it is not publicly disclosed.The Treasury Department is close to issuing a rule that would require banks to determine the identity of any individual owner of 25 percent or more of a corporation or L.L.C. that opens an account, along with individuals who exercise control over them. Lawyers will have to provide that information to banks if their clients are going to have an account, which may push lawyers to gather more information.Neither of these proposals is guaranteed to reveal who is using legal entities to maintain anonymity. One way around the disclosure requirements would be to set up separate entities so that only one person has control of the bank account or owns the entity’s shares, thus limiting whose identity must be revealed.Lawyers could also be subjected to the same anti-money laundering rules as banks, although that is sure to provoke fierce opposition from the legal profession. The attorney-client privilege is usually invoked as the reason to exclude lawyers from having to comply with the “know your customer” rules that would require disclosing the identity of their clients.Whether such disclosure would actually threaten the relationship between a lawyer and client is an open question. The power of the profession to point to the need for client secrecy has successfully thwarted most efforts to compel lawyers to reveal information.It is no surprise that lawyers are at the center of the debate about how to deal with the use of shell companies and secret accounts to hide assets because lawyers are frequently involved in structuring the entities. Despite the elevated rhetoric about the role of lawyers in society, the legal ethics rules do little to restrict how lawyers can represent clients who flirt with the edges of the law.Limiting the tools for helping clients engage in misconduct would make it harder for lawyers to claim they are only serving the wishes of those clients.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
