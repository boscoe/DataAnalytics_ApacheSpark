DETROIT —  After five months of bargaining and divisive ratification votes, the United Automobile Workers on Friday completed new labor contracts covering more than 140,000 workers at the three largest American automakers.The new agreements, which will expire in four years, include raises and bonuses for all unionized workers. They also provide a path for newer employees to eventually achieve wage parity with veteran workers.But finalizing the agreements proved to be a painstaking process, because many workers opposed the terms negotiated by U.A.W. leaders with General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.The ratification process at Ford went down to the wire on Friday, when workers at a large factory complex in Michigan approved the deal and sealed its passage.AdvertisementThe agreement was in danger of being rejected until votes were tallied at the company’s assembly and stamping plants in Dearborn, Mich.AdvertisementBut workers there approved the agreement by large margins, saving it from defeat. The union said that, over all, slightly more than 51 percent of Ford’s nearly 53,000 workers had voted in favor of the contract.Dennis Williams, the U.A.W.’s president, said that the ratification provided economic gains for Ford workers, as well as provisions by the company to add thousands of new jobs and invest $9 billion in its American factories over the life of the agreement.“The voice of the majority has secured a strong future that will provide job security and economic stability for themselves and their families,” Mr. Williams said in a statement.Some Ford workers were dissatisfied with the deal because newer employees might need as long as eight years to achieve the $29-an-hour wages of longtime union members.“To me, it’s still a two-tier agreement with no cap on entry-levels,” said Eric Truss, an employee at one of Ford’s Dearborn plants who voted against the deal.Earlier on Friday, the union ratified its new contract with G.M.While 55 percent of G.M.’s 52,000 workers voted in favor of the deal this month, ratification was delayed because skilled trades employees had rejected it.
                Prodded by its union, the auto industry served as the 20th-century trailblazer in spreading prosperity. But the model of a “social contract” has begun to unravel.            Under union rules, production workers and skilled trades employees must approve the contract separately.AdvertisementNegotiations were reopened with G.M. to address issues specifically related to the skilled trades. On Friday, the union said the agreement had been modified to protect certain job classifications and seniority rights for those workers, and was then ratified by the U.A.W. leadership.The Ford and G.M. contracts were modeled after the agreement reached between the union and Fiat Chrysler last month.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

When the revised agreement was ratified at Fiat Chrysler, it set the parameters for the contracts at G.M. and Ford.In general, the contracts with all three companies provide immediate and longer-term economic benefits.Workers at Ford will receive signing bonuses of $8,500, while employees at G.M. will get $8,000 bonuses and workers at Fiat Chrysler up to $4,000. The disparity in bonus checks was determined by the different financial conditions at each of the three companies.Closing the gap in wages between newer workers and veteran employees will raise overall labor costs for all three automakers.But the companies are making big profits in North America because of surging sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles. Industry analysts said the automakers needed to share some of those profits with factory workers to ensure labor peace and maintain their momentum in the marketplace.“These contracts are all about rewarding workers for their role in the companies’ success, while still remaining competitive with foreign auto manufacturers,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has worked with the U.A.W.AdvertisementThe contracts also guarantee that new products will be assigned to various plants over the next four years, providing job security for current workers and, in some cases, creating openings for new employees.At Ford, for example, the company has agreed to hire as many as 8,500 new workers over the life of its union contract.“This agreement provides a good foundation for Ford Motor Company, our employees and our communities as we work together to create an even stronger business in the years ahead,” John Fleming, Ford’s head of global manufacturing and labor affairs, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page A24 of the New York edition with the headline: Union Vote at Ford and G.M.
