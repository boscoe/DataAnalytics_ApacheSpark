The United States government asserts that five years ago on Wednesday he played a significant role in causing the Dow Jones industrial average to fall more than 1,000 points a matter of minutes, rattling investors around the globe.He is fighting extradition to the United States. But for now, he will probably remain in jail after a judge on Wednesday refused to reduce his bail.James Lewis, one of his lawyers, said it was “impossible” for Mr. Sarao to meet the £5.05 million bail because a freeze was placed on his assets worldwide before his arrest.When his bail was set in April, Joel Smith, another lawyer for Mr. Sarao, said he was a man of means. He cited a £5 million trading account, of which £4.7 million was a loan, and a betting account containing £100,000.The judge at that hearing said Mr. Sarao could use his own money, but also required that his parents and brothers put up £50,000.On Wednesday, Mr. Lewis requested that his bail be cut to £50,000 because of the asset freeze. A district judge refused that request, saying it was not a sufficient amount to deter him from fleeing the country.Mr. Sarao proclaimed his innocence as he left, saying: “I am just good at my job” and “I have done nothing wrong.”His lawyers said they would appeal the decision to the High Court.Mr. Sarao lives with his parents in Hounslow, a middle-class neighborhood near Heathrow Airport.He graduated from Brunel University London and worked at Futex, a British trading firm, for six years.Advertisement
