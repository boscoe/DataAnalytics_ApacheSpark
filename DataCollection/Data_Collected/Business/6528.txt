Two private reports signaled slower growth in the services sector, which has propped up the economy as it faced drags from a strong dollar, a recent rise in oil costs and sluggish demand abroad.“This is consistent with modest growth,” said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. “It’s enough for the Fed to consider tightening. September is very much on the table.” The Fed, which will hold a policy meeting June 16-17, concurred with that view in its latest Beige Book, released on Wednesday.This collection of anecdotes on the economy from early April to late May indicated growth would continue at a “modest” to “moderate” pace, despite weakness in metal and energy industries and a strong dollar crimping exports.The Commerce Department on Wednesday said the trade gap had narrowed to $40.9 billion from March’s revised deficit of $50.6 billion. The 19.2 percent drop in the April trade deficit was the largest decrease since early 2009, and the deficit was about $3 billion less than forecast.Imports fell 3.3 percent, to $230.8 billion, as West Coast ports, a key gateway for goods to and from Asia, cleared a backlog created by a labor dispute that was settled earlier this year.Exports increased 1.0 percent, to $189.9 billion in April, with foreign sales of American services edging up to a record high of $60.9 billion. In recent months, the strength of the dollar has made American goods and services more expensive abroad.The April petroleum deficit stood at $6.8 billion, the lowest since March 2002.The latest trade data led Morgan Stanley to raise its forecast of United States economic growth in the second quarter to 2.7 percent from 2.2 percent.Also Wednesday, the payrolls processor ADP said private employers added 201,000 jobs in May, the most since January. That was in line with analysts’ forecasts and higher than a revised 165,000 jobs in April, the fewest since January 2014.The Labor Department’s more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report, to be released on Friday, includes both public and private sector employment.Other data showed services industries booked fewer new orders last month. The financial firm Markit said its final May reading of its purchasing managers index for the services industry slipped to 56.2, the lowest since January. And the Institute for Supply Management’s own services sector gauge fell to 55.7 last month, the weakest since April 2014.Advertisement
