More flights are arriving on time, but consumer complaints about the airlines have risen sharply. The Transportation Department said on Thursday that the nation’s leading carriers had an on-time rate of 80.3 percent in August, better than the 78.1 percent mark in July and 77.7 percent the previous August. Delta Air Lines led the way at 85.5 percent, followed by Alaska Airlines at 82.9 percent. Spirit Airlines ranked last, with an on-time rate of 63.7 percent. Consumers filed 1,633 complaints about United States airlines with the government, up from 1,107 a year earlier. Spirit had the highest complaint rate by a wide margin. Consumers were nearly twice as likely to complain about Spirit as about Frontier Airlines, the carrier with the second-worst record.A version of this brief appears in print on October 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Airline Complaints Jump, but On-Time Records Improve .
