The Panel on Takeovers and Mergers in Britain extended the deadline until Nov. 4, the companies said.On Wednesday, the companies said that Anheuser-Busch InBev had completed its “due diligence review” and confirmed that “facilities which will allow AB InBev to provide certain funds in support of the cash components of the possible offer have been negotiated and can be executed at short notice.”“There can be no certainty that a formal offer will be made,” the companies said in a news release on Wednesday.Extending the deadline gives the companies more time to complete their negotiations to potentially create a behemoth in the beer industry with annual revenue of about $64 billion.News that the companies would seek an extension of their talks emerged on Tuesday.Under the terms of the latest proposal, Anheuser-Busch InBev is offering to pay 44 pounds, or about $67, a share for SABMiller. That would represent more than a 50 percent premium to SABMiller’s closing price in mid-September, before Anheuser-Busch InBev’s approach was first announced.As part of the deal, SABMiller’s two largest shareholders — the American tobacco giant Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia — would receive restricted shares and a smaller amount of cash at $59.71 a share, a discount to the cash price. That would allow the company’s largest shareholders to avoid a huge tax bill after the merger.As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would probably pay $104.1 billion.The merger, if it were to occur, would probably face regulatory scrutiny, and the brewers may be forced to sell off some assets where they overlap, including the United States.The deal would potentially bring some of the world’s most popular beers under one roof, including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois from Anheuser-Busch InBev, and Grolsch, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Pilsner Urquell from SABMiller.It would also give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure in the faster-growing emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Latin America.Advertisement
