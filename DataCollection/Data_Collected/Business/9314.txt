All but one panel member was recently added to the company’s board by the Redstones’ holding company, National Amusements.The committee hired the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton as its legal counsel.CBS has not disclosed the makeup of its independent board committee. But the broadcaster has already signaled caution about the Redstones’ move, saying in statements that it will act “in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.”War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans. At stake are the fortunes of his family and confidants, as well as the fate of Viacom and CBS.CBS’s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, would play a major role in any reunion of the two media companies.Mr. Moonves, who has been praised for his stewardship, has previously shown coolness to the idea of a reunification. But Ms. Redstone is likely to ask him to run the combined company — a task that would involve a turnaround of the struggling Viacom.In emphasizing that CBS must act in the interest of all shareholders, the company has underlined a desire to make sure that a merger benefits more than just the Redstones, who own about 80 percent of the voting stock in both companies.In its deliberations, the independent board committee at CBS will ultimately decide if combining with Viacom makes sense — and if it does, on what terms.Sumner Redstone, who owns National Amusements and is the controlling shareholder in Viacom and CBS, is 93 and in poor health. He was in the hospital on Wednesday for a mild respiratory infection, according to a person briefed on the matter. He was treated and returned home on Thursday.Advertisement
