AMC is developing a mini-series based on the memoir of the late New York Times columnist David Carr.The cable network announced on Monday that the project was being conceived as a six-part mini-series and that the actor Bob Odenkirk, who stars in AMC’s “Better Call Saul,” would play Mr. Carr.Shawn Ryan, creator of “The Shield,” will write the mini-series and also serve as executive producer.In his memoir, “The Night of the Gun,” which was released in 2008, Mr. Carr reported and wrote about his years of drug addiction and alcoholism, and his unlikely rise as a leading voice in the media world. Mr. Carr died last year after collapsing in the Times newsroom.In a statement, Mr. Odenkirk, who is also an executive producer of the project, said, “I hope to do justice to David’s intellect and his scrappy nature. It’s going to be crazy … if we do it right.”
                15 memorable articles, columns and video clips from Mr. Carr, a prolific media columnist for The New York Times, including his last piece that was published the day before he died.            A version of this article appears in print on June 7, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: AMC Plans Mini-Series of David Carr’s Memoir.
