The results ended the company’s two-year streak of shrinking profits.The South Korean electronics maker estimated operating profit at 7.3 trillion won, or about $6.3 billion, in the third quarter, well above the 4.1 trillion won posted a year earlier. Sales totaled 51 trillion won, up about 8 percent from 47.4 trillion won from the same period a year earlier. The numbers are preliminary; Samsung will post its final earnings this month.The results, which handily beat analyst expectations, sent Samsung’s shares up more than 5 percent in early trading in South Korea. Though the big jump in profit comes in part from the weakness of the company’s performance last year and from a weakening Korean currency, the increased profit is a fresh sign that one of the company’s two major engines of growth, its semiconductor division, is faring well.In particular, analysts said the company’s chip business probably had been lifted by strong sales of Apple’s iPhone 6s and Samsung’s own Galaxy Note 5, both of which use microchips made by Samsung.Samsung’s strength in components—displays for phones and televisions and chips that serve as the brains of smartphones— means that even as it struggles to make money off its low-cost handsets, it can make money supplying the guts of those same devices.Even so, the Nomura analyst C.W. Chung said he expected surging profits from the company’s component business to also start to slow. He also warned not to read too much into earnings surpassing expectations.“In terms of the surprise versus analyst forecasts, it was foreign exchange. All analysts are quite well aware of what parts of the business are better and worse, but they didn’t catch exactly how big the foreign exchange impact would be,” he said.On the smartphone business that helped Samsung become one of the largest and most closely watched electronics makers in the world, analysts’ views remained mixed. In recent quarters, margins on the company’s handsets have declined, even as sales of lower-end phones have steadied. Last quarter, the company struggled to keep up with demand for the Samsung S6 Edge, which has a screen that wraps around one side of the phone.During the past two years, Samsung’s high-end models have faced tough competition from Apple, which expanded the screen size of its phones to compete more directly with Samsung’s handsets. On the low-cost end, which Samsung once dominated, a bevy of Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi and Huawei have pushed prices down, even while offering higher specifications.According to a summer report focusing on the second quarter from the research group IDC, the competition at the low end is only likely to become more fierce, with ever-growing numbers of new entrants targeting specific markets.“While the Chinese players are clearly making gains this quarter, every quarter sees new brands joining the market,” wrote the IDC analyst Melissa Chau. “IDC now tracks over 200 different smartphone brands globally, many of them focused on entry level and midrange models, and most with a regional or even single-country focus.”During the second quarter, Samsung remained the global leader in smartphone sales, but its market share continued to slide from a year earlier, falling about two percentage points to 22 percent. Apple, the next closest, had a market share of 14 percent.Advertisement
