Groupon, operator of a daily deals website, said its co-founder Eric Lefkofsky was stepping down as chief executive and would return to the role of chairman, effective immediately. The company’s chief operating officer, Rich Williams, will succeed Mr. Lefkofsky as chief. Groupon also posted lower-than-expected revenue in the third quarter, hurt by lackluster sales in North America and lower revenue from its international business. Net loss attributable to Groupon widened to $27.6 million, or 4 cents a share, in the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, from $21.2 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $713.6 million from $714.3 million, compared with analysts’ estimate of $732.8 million.A version of this brief appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Groupon Replaces Chief After Disappointing Quarter .
