The company earns most of its revenue from subscriptions to its premium services and advertising on its site, generating $2.2 billion in sales last year.But the company has labored to become more than just an online repository for résumés and job histories. For instance, in 2012, LinkedIn began soliciting influential business personalities like Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, to write original content for the site.The company hired Dan Roth, a former editor at Fortune magazine, to be LinkedIn’s executive editor. Last year, the company introduced blogging capabilities for LinkedIn’s users, essentially becoming an original content platform.And two years ago, the company bought Pulse, the maker of a newsreader app, for $90 million.LinkedIn binds all those services into what it calls the economic graph, where users can connect to both new professional opportunities and the skills needed to take advantage of them.But e-learning and professional development services is an entirely new category for the company, and LinkedIn hopes it will be another way it can lure users back to using its site every week or even every day.Lynda.com was started two decades ago as a small online portal for students to learn web design skills. It was founded by the husband-and-wife team of Lynda Weinman and Bruce Heavin, themselves graphic design experts who have both held positions at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.Today, Lynda.com focuses on a number of subjects, like management skills, programming and video. It sells subscriptions that start at $25 a month.The company collected more than $150 million in revenue last year and has turned a profit since 1997.In January, the company raised $186 million in new financing, the biggest investment round by an education technology company in six years, according to CB Insights.“We’ve followed Lynda.com for a long time, rooted in the conviction that access to high-quality, skills-based learning and development content should be available to every LinkedIn member and a fundamental part of our platform,” Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn’s chief executive, wrote in a blog post.He added, “Both companies believe strongly that the growing skills gap is one of the biggest challenges to the future of the global economy.”In a research note, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, described the transaction as a strategic fit for LinkedIn.Under the terms of the deal, about 52 percent of LinkedIn’s offer for Lynda.com will be in cash and the remainder in newly issued stock. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter.Michael J. de la Merced reported from San Francisco, and Mike Isaac from New York.Advertisement
