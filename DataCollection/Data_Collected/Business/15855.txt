It also manufactures equipment to produce industrial gases. The company generated $10.8 billion in sales in 2015 and has about 26,000 employees in more than 50 countries.Linde has three divisions focused on industrial gases, engineering and supply chain services. Its gas division concentrates on industrial and medical gases, including oxygen, nitrogen and argon.The company generated €17.9 billion in revenue in 2015 and has about 64,000 employees in more than 100 countries.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
