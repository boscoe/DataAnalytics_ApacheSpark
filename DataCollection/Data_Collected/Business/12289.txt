Herbalife, the seller of supplements and weight-loss products that is under federal investigation as a potential pyramid scheme, said that because of a database error it overstated its worldwide membership growth in 2015. The company said active new members worldwide grew 3.4 percent instead of 8.3 percent in 2015. Revised figures for the fourth quarter cut worldwide growth to 3.2 percent from 16.7 percent. The company has also been under pressure from the activist investor William A. Ackman and his Pershing Square Capital Management for its business practices. Herbalife has defended its model, saying it is similar to multilevel marketing companies like Avon or Amway.A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Herbalife Says Database Error Led to Misstatement on Member Growth.
