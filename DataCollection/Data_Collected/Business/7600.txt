Bank of America, seeking to get on with the business of banking after legal and mortgage troubles, said on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, easily surpassing analysts’ expectations.Still, analysts cautioned that while the surprisingly good results reflect progress in cutting expenses, they were also helped by a steep drop in litigation costs and other one-time items, like adjustments to the value of certain debt holdings thanks to a rise in interest rates in the quarter.Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., earned $5.3 billion in the quarter, up from $2.3 billion in the quarter a year ago. The bank earned 45 cents a share in the second quarter, up from 19 cents a share a year earlier. Those results far exceeded analysts’ expectations of 36 cents a share at a time when many critics questioned the bank’s stagnant share price and recent lackluster performance.Shares of Bank of America ended the day up 3.2 percent — their strongest one-day gain in months — to $17.68.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            “Not only were we pleased with the bottom line but revenue was up and expenses were down ,” the bank’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, told analysts in a conference call on Wednesday. “Lots of things came together to achieve these results.”AdvertisementMr. Moynihan has been under pressure to improve the underlying results, now that the mortgage losses from the financial crisis and related litigation are almost entirely behind the bank. Like other giant banks, Bank of America has struggled to increase profits in a volatile trading environment and with interest rates historically low, which has depressed the value of many of its holdings.AdvertisementIn the second quarter, some of those trends began to reverse. While results from equities and fixed-income trading were again choppy, an uptick in longer-term interest rates in the quarter helped improve results.Revenue increased roughly 2 percent, to $22.3 billion, from a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $21.3 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.Plagued for years by soaring litigation costs related to its mortgage problems, the bank reported a broad decline in expenses. Excluding litigation costs in the second quarter, Bank of America said expenses declined 6 percent from a year ago, while the costs of servicing its troubled mortgage portfolio dropped 37 percent. Investors have been clamoring for more progress in cutting expenses in recent quarters to offset the impact of low interest rates.After years of working to reduce expenses, particularly in the legacy mortgage unit, bank executives said that effort was finally paying off.“We think it was a giant step forward this quarter for the company,” Bruce R. Thompson, Bank of America’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning.The bank said its efficiency ratio — a measure of expenses as a percent of revenue — reached 62 percent, down from 84 percent a year ago, when the bank was still struggling to service a backlog of delinquent mortgages in the face of stagnant revenue. By comparison, Wells Fargo, a bank known for aggressively managing costs, reported an efficiency ratio of 58.5 percent in the second quarter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The rise in long-term rates in the quarter allowed Bank of America to adjust how it amortized certain residential mortgage-backed securities.That adjustment generated $669 million, or 4 cents a share, in the second quarter. A year ago, the impact of rates on the bank’s debt portfolio resulted in negative adjustments of $175 million.The move in the bank’s debt securities holding foreshadowed the boon Bank of America and other large banks could receive if the Federal Reserve raises rates in the next few months. Many bank investors have been patiently waiting out the struggles at banks like Bank of America in hopes that their share prices will increase as interest rates rise from historical lows.A version of this article appears in print on July 16, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Bank of America More Than Doubles Profit to $5.3 Billion .
