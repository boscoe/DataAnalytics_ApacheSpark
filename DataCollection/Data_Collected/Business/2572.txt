LONDON — Sunrise Communications, the second-largest telecommunications company in Switzerland, said on Wednesday that it planned to list shares of its new holding company in Switzerland in the first half of the year.The initial public offering on the SIX Swiss Exchange is expected to raise 1.35 billion Swiss francs, or about $1.32 billion, which would be used to reduce the company’s debt.The private equity firm CVC Capital Partners acquired Sunrise in October 2010 from the Danish telecommunications company TDC, paying 3.3 billion francs. CVC would continue to own a majority of Sunrise after the offering.Sunrise provides mobile, broadband and landline telephone services, with 3.3 million customers and accounting for about 27 percent of all mobile customers in Switzerland. It is a challenger to Swisscom, which dominates the country’s telecommunications market.The company signed the Swiss tennis star Roger Federer as a spokesman last year.Sunrise posted revenue of 2 billion francs for the 12 months ended Sept. 30.The offering would “facilitate our ongoing investments into technology, customer care and network to continue the improvement of customer experience and service quality for our valued Swiss customers,” Libor Voncina, the Sunrise chief executive, said in a news release.The I.P.O. announcement comes less than a month after funds advised by the private equity firm Apax Partners agreed to sell the Swiss mobile phone provider Orange Communications to a company controlled by Xavier Niel, the French entrepreneur behind the mobile phone upstart Iliad, for 2.8 billion francs.Deutsche Bank and UBS are acting as joint global coordinators on the offering.A version of this article appears in print on 01/15/2015, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: I.P.O.
