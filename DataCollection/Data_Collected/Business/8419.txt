AdvertisementSupported byBy Hiroko TabuchiWalmart cut its annual profit forecast on Tuesday, saying the costs of raising wages for a half-million workers were weighing down its bottom line.Walmart’s investment in its online services as it vies to compete with e-commerce titans like Amazon is also eating into profits, as is a stronger dollar, the company said.Still, executives at Walmart, the country’s largest retailer by sales, said that spending was necessary to win back customers with an improved shopping experience at its stores and a more competitive presence on the web.“We’re pleased that the investments we’ve made are helping to improve our business. Even if it’s not as fast as we would like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving,” Doug McMillon, president and chief executive of Walmart Stores, said in a statement.“In this case, our desired changes require investments, which are pressuring earnings this year. We’re confident that our strategic plan will create robust sustainable growth for shareholder returns over time,” he said.Walmart, based in Bentonville, Ark., joins a flurry of retailers reporting second-quarter earnings this week, some of which are gaining traction with the economic recovery better than others.Home Depot raised its annual forecast for the second time this year, spurred by a rebound in the housing market. Capitalizing on customers’ hunger for deals and discounts, TJX, which operates the T. J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods stores, said sales this year would exceed expectations.But American Apparel, the struggling clothing retailer, warned this week of slumping sales and a fast-dwindling cash position, and said it might not be able to stay in business.For Walmart, once thought unstoppable, the latest numbers underscore the challenges it still faces as it tries to move on from a period of prolonged decline in sales and market share.The lackluster results also test Walmart’s commitment to improving the lot of its 1.3-million-strong work force and to revamping customer service at its 5,000 American stores, as well as online.Walmart acted to raise wages for its lowest-paid hourly store employees after nationwide campaigning by labor activists and others who highlighted the plight of low-wage workers in the fast-food and retail industries. A tightening job market brought on by the recovering economy also prompted Walmart to raise wages to attract more new workers and reduce turnover.In the short term, the investments will hamper profits, analysts said. Walmart reported second-quarter earnings of $1.08 a share, below analyst expectations of $1.12 a share.That was despite quarterly revenue of $120.2 billion, which was $500 million higher than forecast. Comparable sales at stores in the United States, or stores open at least a year, rose 1.5 percent, the fourth consecutive quarter of increases in the commonly used retail metric.The company lowered its full-year guidance to a range of $4.40 to $4.70 a share, from a previous range of $4.70 to $5.05.Walmart’s investments will eventually pay off, Charlie O’Shea, a vice president at Moody’s, said in a note.Walmart’s performance “reflects the negative impact on near-term earnings of long-term investments in e-commerce and in its employees that we believe will ultimately bear fruit,” Mr. O’Shea said.“Investing in the development of an online channel, which is in effect building a second business, is not cheap and results do not happen overnight,” he said. Even Amazon’s experience has shown that “short-term earnings can get a bit choppy.”Still, Walmart’s spending on wages, training and additional work hours at its stores has amounted to more than the retailer initially forecast, shaving 24 cents off its projected per-share earnings for the year, 4 cents more than expected.The extra hours, in areas like product stocking, “were significant, and more than we had planned,” Mr. McMillon said in prepared remarks to investors.Investment in its online business also lowered Walmart’s expected full-year results by 6 to 9 cents, in line with its guidance in February. Walmart recently took on Amazon and its new “Prime Day” anniversary sale, countering with a midsummer sale of its own.Walmart said the strong dollar continued to weigh on earnings. Problems on the international side of Walmart’s business went beyond the strong American currency, however.Operating income from its international business fell even with currency swings factored in, hurt by poor performance in countries like Britain, where heightened competition in groceries drove down sales 4.7 percent.Mexico and Canada were among the only countries where Walmart logged strong sales gains.Walmart’s spending on e-commerce appears to be paying off, at least. It said global e-commerce sales increased about 16 percent when excluding currency fluctuations.The company continues to open smaller stores, called Neighborhood Markets, to cater to consumers who increasingly prefer to shop at more central, convenient locations. Walmart said comparable sales at Neighborhood Markets increased approximately 7.3 percent, with strong growth from new stores.Walmart expects to open up to 170 Neighborhood Markets this fiscal year, adding to the 350 locations it has opened in the last two years.Walmart’s pared-back forecast came in contrast to a bullish outlook from Home Depot, which expects earnings per share to grow 13 to 14 percent this year, above the 11 to 12 percent annual growth forecast in May.TJX also raised its outlook for the year to $3.28 a share from $3.24, saying it expected sales in stores open more than a year to grow 3 to 4 percent.At the opposite end of the earnings spectrum, American Apparel said in a filing on Monday that second-quarter sales slumped by as much as 17 percent, to $134 million. Its losses for the quarter came to 11 cents a share.American Apparel and its backer, the hedge fund Standard General, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the retailer’s founder and chief executive, Dov Charney, who was ousted last year.The company, based in Los Angeles, said it planned to cut about $30 million in costs in a bid to stay afloat. But it may nevertheless have insufficient liquidity to sustain operations for the next 12 months, the company warned.Advertisement
