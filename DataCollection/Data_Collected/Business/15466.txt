But with universal life you can normally decrease the face amount of a policy to have some coverage last longer. You may be able to get a quote from a different company, using the cash value of your old policy. On the long-term care side, you can increase your waiting period, reduce your daily room rate or reduce or remove the inflation feature of your policy to keep your premium tolerable.Talk with a good agent. “Woe is me” won’t get you anywhere, and you’ll end up without the coverage you need.Bruce WoodruffWinter Park, Fla., Aug. 17Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
