The nation’s top auto safety regulator took aim at a Republican proposal to amend safety rules on Wednesday, saying that it would impinge on his agency’s enforcement authority and decrease transparency for consumers.Mark R. Rosekind, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, sharply criticized the wide-ranging draft legislation at a hearing held by a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and was echoed by several Democrats on the panel.Mr. Rosekind singled out a provision in the draft bill that would require the safety agency to prepare recall notices in coordination with manufacturers and not release them until every vehicle identification number had been made available. The process, he said, could significantly lengthen the time for a recall to be announced.The timeline of the recall, he said, would “be basically under the control of the person who created the defect.”AdvertisementHe acknowledged that it might be frustrating for a consumer to be alerted to a recall but then have to wait before replacement parts are available, as in the case of the recall of defective Takata airbags that can violently rupture.AdvertisementBut Mr. Rosekind cautioned that keeping the public in the dark about safety problems could have deadly consequences.
            Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat of Illinois, interrupted Mitch Bainwol, president of the Alliance of Automotive Manufacturers, during a notable exchange from Wednesday’s hearing.        “People get to make that choice, not the government,” he said. “If they have that information, they get to choose what they’d like to do, including park their car or get a rental.”Mr. Rosekind took the helm of the agency last December as the auto industry was mired in safety scandals. The safety agency itself was facing criticism for lax oversight and missteps in the events leading up to the recalls of defective General Motors ignition switches and Takata’s rupturing airbags.Democratic lawmakers at the hearing joined Mr. Rosekind in attacking the draft legislation. Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat of Illinois, sharply challenged a provision that would allow carmakers to receive credits against federal pollution standards in exchange for installing safety technology, calling it an untenable trade-off.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
