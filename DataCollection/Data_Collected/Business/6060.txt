LONDON — Deutsche Telekom of Germany, Europe’s largest carrier by revenue, on Wednesday reported an 11 percent increase in its pretax profit, as a weak euro and the company’s United States operations bolstered its first-quarter earnings.The German telecommunication giant, which owns 66 percent of T-Mobile US, said its adjusted pretax profit in the first three months of 2015 rose to €4.6 billion, or about $5.17 billion, slightly ahead of the €4.4 billion forecast from analysts polled by Reuters.The carrier’s quarterly revenue jumped 13 percent, to €16.8 billion, as Deutsche Telekom’s push to add customers to its United States operations continued to gather speed.After rebuffing attempts by the French telecommunications company Iliad to acquire T-Mobile last year, Deutsche Telekom has been aggressively expanding across the United States, using price cuts and other offers to entice consumers away from larger carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless.AdvertisementT-Mobile added roughly two million new subscribers in the first quarter of the year, Deutsche Telekom said, and now has almost 57 million cellphone customers across the United States.Advertisement“It has been some time since we have seen positive indications for revenue and earnings in our industry,” Timotheus Höttges, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, said in a news release. “Our clear strategy with strong investment is paying off.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That represents a 57 percent decline over the same period last year, when the company benefited from the €1.5 billion sale of its majority stake in the online classified advertising company Scout24 to the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman.In its domestic market, the carrier said the number of its mobile subscribers rose slightly, to 39.2 million customers. The company also added almost half a million new high-speed German broadband subscribers in the first quarter of the year as people upgraded their Internet packages to stream video and other online content to their homes.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
