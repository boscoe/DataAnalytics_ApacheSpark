The health care sector notched the biggest decline in the S.&P. 500. Even so, it’s up 4.8 percent this year, leading the nine other sectors in the index.“We’ve had a long, good run by the equity markets and, at times, investors look for opportunities to maybe take some gains off the table,” Mr. Gaffney said.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.94 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,698.18.

Also, the Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. manufacturing index slipped in March, reflecting slower growth in factory orders. U.S. construction spending declined in February for the second month in a row.It’s likely the weak ADP jobs report prompted some traders to make moves on Wednesday in anticipation that the government’s March payroll employment tally will also be discouraging.
