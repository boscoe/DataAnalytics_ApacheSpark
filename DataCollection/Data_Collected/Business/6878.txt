The request for an extension was filed earlier this week by Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr.Last December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan overturned the convictions of the two traders, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, and dismissed the charges against them. It also narrowed the definition of insider trading, which has threatened to unravel some of the convictions secured by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan.In April, the appeals court rejected a request by Mr. Bharara’s office to revisit its December ruling. It’s now up to Mr. Verrilli to decide whether to ask the Supreme Court to hear an appeal in the case. Mr. Bharara’s office is said to want to appeal the decision because he sees the ruling as potentially limiting the kind of insider-trading cases prosecutors can bring.Advertisement
