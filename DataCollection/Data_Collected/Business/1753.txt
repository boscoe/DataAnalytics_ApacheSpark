The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index had its best day since Sept. 8, rising 42.07 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,091.69. The Nasdaq composite increased 104.74 points, or 2.1 percent, to 5,142.27 points.When the Federal Reserve decided not to raise interest rates in September, investors concluded that the Fed would act in December unless it received some big warning signs about the health of the economy.Those signs never came. The September jobs report was disappointing, but hiring climbed in October, and November hiring was solid. The Labor Department said employers added 211,000 jobs in November, a figure higher than investors had expected.The Fed slashed its short-term interest rate to near zero during the financial crisis and it kept it low throughout the recession to encourage lending and hiring. It has not raised interest rates in nine years.Luke Bartholomew, investment manager Aberdeen Capital Management, said it was almost a foregone conclusion that the Fed would raise interest rates, but said it was not clear what would happen after that.“It would have taken a really catastrophically bad number to put the Fed off today,” he said. “It’s a question of what the path looks like next year.”Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performers in the S.&P. 500. The discount retailer Dollar Tree, Mattel, and the homebuilder D. R. Horton climbed. Apple rose $3.83, or 3.3 percent, to $119.03.Energy stocks took a beating, and almost all of the largest losses in the S.&P. 500 went to energy companies.
