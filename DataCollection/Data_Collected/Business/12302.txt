LONDON — The Swiss banking giant UBS said on Thursday that its business in France had been placed under formal investigation by the French authorities for possible witness tampering after a complaint by a former employee.The announcement of the inquiry came less than two weeks after judges in France concluded a 19-month investigation into whether the bank helped French clients hide funds from the country’s national tax administration from 2004 to 2012. The judges are in the process of determining whether to send that case to trial.On Thursday, UBS said that a judge in France had decided to put the bank under “formal examination” for potentially interfering with a witness, but not for “moral harassment,” another accusation by the former employee who made the complaint.“We strongly deny these allegations and are confident that we can vigorously defend our rights and position,” UBS said in a news release.AdvertisementThe inquiry is the latest headache for UBS.On Friday, a Belgian magistrate judge began a separate inquiry into whether the lender had engaged in fraud, money laundering and other crimes in an effort to help wealthy individuals avoid taxes.AdvertisementUBS has described the accusations in Belgium as “unfounded” and said it would defend itself in the matter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
