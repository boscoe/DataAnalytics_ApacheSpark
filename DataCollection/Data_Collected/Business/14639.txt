Stock indexes made their fourth consecutive gain Friday, an upbeat finish to a week that got off to a turbulent start as investors fretted about Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.The market came close to regaining all the ground it lost since the vote last week, ending the week up 3 percent — its biggest weekly gain since November. The main indexes in Europe posted even bigger gains this week, and British stocks recouped all their losses along the way.Demand for United States Treasury bonds also surged this week, driving prices sharply higher. That brought down the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 1.45 percent, from 1.48 on Thursday, close to its record low.Investors also bid up the price of gold, another safe haven.“Clearly there is still an underlying sense of nervousness,” said J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. “No reasonable economic theory would be telling you to buy bonds with this kind of yield. It’s more ‘I don’t care if I don’t make yield. I want my money back.’”AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 4.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,102.95.
