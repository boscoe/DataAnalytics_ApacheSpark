It says that he had sought licensing permission from Lucasfilm and, having been denied it, continued to operate despite receiving multiple cease-and-desist letters.Mr. Brown answered emails on Tuesday but said he was too busy and had poor cellular reception, so he could not answer questions about the lawsuit. He did not respond to an email message early Wednesday.A spokeswoman for Lucasfilm declined to comment on details of the lawsuit but said, “We protect our intellectual property rights vigorously and we take reports of suspected infringement seriously.”The lawsuit was filed on Oct. 14 in United States District Court in San Francisco and seeks up to $2 million in damages for each trademark infringement.Lightsaber Academy describes itself as “a consortium of lightsaber practitioners with a culmination of 50 years experience of teaching various swordplay techniques.”It organizes classes at comics conventions, offers a certification in lightsaber instruction and sells, for $10, an “official LSA patch,” which bears a symbol that the lawsuit says is “nearly identical, and confusingly similar, to Lucasfilm’s Trademark Jedi Order logo.”New York Jedi offers private lessons and weekly group classes in Midtown Manhattan with “experienced dancers, martial artists, and cosplayers that know a thing or two about saber choreography.” On one part of the site, the classes are listed with a price of $10; elsewhere, it says the classes are free, but donations are accepted to help cover room fees.The New York Jedi website also advertises a separate group called “Saberkids” for children ages 7 to 13.Lucasfilm has a long history of fan-created projects, some of which have had implicit endorsement from the company, which was bought by Disney in 2013.A documentary released last year chronicled the painstaking efforts of two young fans of “Indiana Jones” who spent eight years creating a shot-for-shot remake of “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” On the comedy program “Robot Chicken,” Gary the Stormtrooper was a popular parody of life as a cog in the imperial machine.And in 2006, a web short called “Chad Vader: Day Shift Manager” earned praise from fans and, the following year, won the George Lucas Selects Award at the annual Star Wars Celebration fan gathering.One of the better-known fan groups is the 501st Legion, a group of Stormtrooper cosplayers. Its members appeared at the official premiere of “The Force Awakens” in 2015, and its members have marched in the Rose Parade with the “Star Wars” creator George Lucas.Josh Mueller, a spokesman for the 501st Legion, said his group, which was founded in 1997 and has more than 10,000 members worldwide, has maintained a positive relationship with Lucasfilm, and that continued after Lucasfilm’s purchase by Disney in 2013.He said the group’s interactions with Lucasfilm began as “a polite courtesy that graduated to some familiarity, and that relationship has just become warmer over the years.”“They were very supportive that their fans were out there doing something creative and productive with their license,” he said. “We don’t see a whole lot of direct interventions.”The 501st Legion even managed to get approval to sell branded T-shirts for the Make-a-Wish foundation, and Mr. Mueller said he thought the focus on charity was why the 501st Legion has had a warm relationship with the film company.“The reason why we’ve done so well is that we’ve played ball,” he said, “and we don’t charge.”But when people seek to make money off “Star Wars,” it’s a different story.In 2011, Vice chronicled Mr. Lucas’s history of aggressively protecting the trademarks to “Star Wars”-related products, or even those that just appeared to be related. That included a complaint against Motorola for selling a cellphone that used the word “Droid,” and, yes, one against the Reagan administration for using “Star Wars” as the name for its missile defense system.A lawsuit over replica Stormtrooper costumes went all the way to Britain’s highest court, which ruled against Mr. Lucas.Elsewhere in the galaxy, relations between fans and film production companies are similarly complicated.Paramount Pictures and CBS are pursuing a lawsuit over a crowd-funded Star Trek fan film, “Star Trek: Axanar.” J. J. Abrams, the producer and director of several recent “Star Trek” films as well as “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” had earlier promised the fans that their project had his blessing and that the suit would be dropped. But the The Los Angeles Times reported in June that it was going forward.Advertisement
