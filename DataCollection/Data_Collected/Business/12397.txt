He said he wasn’t that interested in providing in-depth looks at the candidates. Each week, Mr. Oliver dedicates about 20 minutes of his half-hour show to what he calls the “main story,” but he blanched when I asked him if he would ever spend 20 minutes on Donald J. Trump.“We’re definitely not doing that,” he said.Well, about that. Eight days after Mr. Oliver’s wildly popular segment on Mr. Trump, the YouTube views keep coming. To date, the video has been viewed 19 million times on YouTube, more than any segment that Mr. Oliver’s show has produced. (His segment on FIFA is the next closest, with 12.4 million views, and that’s been online for 14 months).The breakout moment of the sketch was when he referred to Mr. Trump by what he said was his family’s ancestral name: Drumpf. He proposed a hashtag: #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain. And Mr. Oliver said he was selling “Make Donald Drumpf Again” caps in the style of Mr. Trump’s “Make America Great Again” caps and a Chrome extension that would switch any online reference of “Trump” to “Drumpf.”The hashtag caught fire on social media last week, and just how well are those $17.50 caps selling?“Due to, um, unexpected ludicrous demand, our #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain hats may be delayed slightly; we’ll get them to you as soon as drumpishly possible,” reads a post at the show’s online store.That “ludicrous demand” translates to 35,000 caps sold, an HBO spokesman said. Mr. Oliver explained that the caps were being sold “at cost,” so neither the show nor HBO will make any profit.The Chrome extension has been downloaded more than 433,000 times, a spokeswoman for the network said.Mr. Oliver declined to comment about Mr. Trump but he suggested during the segment that the reason for his about-face was Mr. Trump’s early primary victories and strong polling numbers.“At this point, Mr. Trump is America’s back mole,” he said. “It may have seemed harmless a year ago, but now it’s gotten frighteningly bigger, and it’s no longer wise to ignore it.”This last week, Mr. Oliver touched on Mr. Trump again in his opening segment before moving on to a decidedly less inviting topic: special taxing districts.“That’s right, tonight, we are talking about special taxing districts,” Mr. Oliver said on Sunday night. “So, hello people watching for the first time because of our Trump piece. And also I presume, goodbye! Goodbye!”Advertisement
