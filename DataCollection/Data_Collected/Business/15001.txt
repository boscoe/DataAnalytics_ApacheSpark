His last day was last Friday.Mr. Bloom was most recently a vice chairman of United States investment banking at Lazard, having advised the United States Postal Service and Detroit retirees during the city’s bankruptcy. But he is perhaps best known for his work at the White House helping shepherd General Motors and Chrysler through their government-sponsored bankruptcies. When the carmakers successfully exited Chapter 11, he moved on to a broader role as an assistant to the president for manufacturing policy.Mr. Bloom left government in 2012 to go to Lazard — or, more accurately, to return to the investment bank. He began his career there in 1985, though he left five years later to co-found a boutique investment bank that focused on restructuring and in particular advising unions in those matters.Now, he is going to Brookfield to become an investor, according to his note. At the firm, which has more than $200 billion in assets under management, he will help manage the firm’s private equity operations.“I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Lazard,” Mr. Bloom wrote. “I left only because I wanted to take on a new challenge — to try my hand on the principal side.”A spokeswoman for Lazard declined to comment.Advertisement
