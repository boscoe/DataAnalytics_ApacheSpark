AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew GoldsteinFederal authorities have warned for years that big law firms are ripe targets for computer hackers because they are information-rich repositories of corporate deals and other sensitive client information.But big law firms, as a general rule, are loath to confirm whether they have been victims of data breaches, largely out of fear of alarming clients. Breaches and potential intrusions at large law firms often go unreported and generally come to light only anecdotally — often in news reports or discussions at legal conferences.One big firm that has confirmed it was the victim of a “limited breach” of its computer network is Cravath Swaine & Moore, based in New York, which may be best known for its corporate merger advisory work.In a statement on Wednesday, Cravath said that the breach happened last summer and that it was “not aware that any of the information that may have been accessed has been used improperly.” The firm has been working with federal authorities, who are investigating the matter, and an outside security consulting firm.Cravath said it responded to the incident by bolstering its security measures. The firm’s statement added that maintaining client confidences was “sacrosanct” at the firm.Authorities investigating digital attacks at law firms often focus on whether the information that was taken could be used in trading on the stock market.The breach at Cravath and the investigation were reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been warning law firms about attacks by hackers since at least 2011. At that time, the bureau began to organize meetings with the managing partners of top law firms in New York and other major American cities to highlight the problems of computer security and corporate espionage emanating from countries like Russia and China.Last year, the digital intelligence group at Citigroup published a report that warned bank employees of the threat of attacks on the networks and websites of big law firms. The report also chided large firms, saying they refused to discuss breaches and noting that most law firms are not obligated to report data breaches publicly.The Citigroup report was published around the time that Mandiant, a division of the security consulting firm FireEye, began advising a half-dozen unidentified law firms that were victims of a breach or other attack.Cravath would not comment on which security consultant it was working with in response to last summer’s breach.But the firm’s statement is a first move toward putting a name and face on law firm breaches.Advertisement
