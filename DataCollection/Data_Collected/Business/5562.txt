Restaurant Brands International said on Monday its Burger King and Tim Hortons chains posted their strongest same-store sales performance in several years in the first quarter. Sales at Tim Hortons open for 13 months or longer rose 5.3 percent during the quarter, the company said, driven by menu items like a new steak and cheese panini. It was Tim’s best quarterly comparable-store sales in three years. At Burger King, the figure rose 4.6 percent, the best performance in nearly seven years. Sales were helped in part by the chain’s “Two for $5” promotion and its Spicy BLT Whopper. Systemwide sales rose 8.1 percent at Tim Hortons and 9.6 percent at Burger King, on a constant currency basis. The company posted a net loss attributable to shareholders of $8.1 million, or 4 cents a share, for the three months that ended March 31, compared with a loss of $514.2 million, or $2.52 a share, in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit of 18 cents a share. Quarterly revenue more than doubled to $932 million from $416.3 million.A version of this brief appears in print on April 28, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Burger King and Tim Hortons Post Best Sales Figures in Years.
