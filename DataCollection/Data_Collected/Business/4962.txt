Russia’s consumer price inflation hit 16.9 percent in March as the country headed for recession, the state statistics agency Rosstat said on Monday. While annual inflation has continued to rise to levels not seen since 2002, month-on-month inflation has slowed this year, to 1.2 percent in March, down from 2.2 percent in February and 3.9 percent in January. Inflation of food prices remained above the overall rate of inflation, showing 23 percent growth year-on-year in March and 1.6 percent against February’s prices. Russia’s government has banned food imports from the European Union and other Western countries since August in response to sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis. Russia’s central bank expects the country’s gross domestic product to contract by 3.5 to 4 percent this year.A version of this brief appears in print on April 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Consumer Price Inflation Reaches 16.9%. in Russia.
