It took £1.03 billion in total litigation and conduct costs in the quarter.Barclays opted not to settle in November when a group of the world’s biggest banks agreed to pay a combined $4.25 billion to end investigations by British, Swiss and United States authorities, who accused them of conspiring to manipulate currency markets.Prosecutors in the United States are still pushing for guilty pleas from several banks, including Barclays.On a conference call with journalists on Wednesday, Tushar Morzaria, the Barclays group finance director, said the latest provision reflected the lender’s “best estimate” of the potential costs to resolve the matter after its discussions with various regulators and agencies around the world.“As a management team and board, we are absolutely focused on trying to resolve these matters as expeditiously and appropriately as we can,” Mr. Morzaria said. “And are working very hard to that end.”Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.Barclays declined to discuss the potential timing of a settlement.Legal provisions for the currency investigation and other conduct issues drove Barclays to an annual loss last year. The latest provision was on top of £1.25 billion that the bank set aside in 2014 for the currency investigation.For the three months ended March 31, Barclays said profit fell to £465 million, from £965 million in the first quarter of 2014.“Resolving legacy conduct issues is also an important part of our plan to transform Barclays,” Antony P. Jenkins, the Barclays chief executive, said in a news release on Wednesday. “We are working hard to expedite their settlement.”At the lender’s annual meeting last week, Mr. Jenkins said he expected the bank to make “significant” progress this year in resolving investigations into potential misconduct by its employees.Barclays said on Wednesday that it took an additional charge in the quarter of £150 million related to the improper selling of payment protection insurance, a product that has cost British banks billions of pounds in redress in recent years.During the quarter, Barclays also booked a gain of £429 million related to how it calculated its liability for employee pensions.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.Excluding the legal provisions and other one-time charges, Barclays said its first-quarter pretax profit rose to £1.85 billion, from £1.69 billion in the same period a year earlier. The adjusted results exceeded analysts’ expectations, according to Reuters.Operating expenses rose 5 percent to £4.65 billion in the first quarter, from £4.44 billion in the same period a year earlier.Barclays is in the middle of an extensive reshaping of the company, focusing on several core business lines and shrinking its investment bank.In the investment bank, pretax profit rose 37 percent to £675 million in the first quarter, from £491 million in the same period a year earlier.In its other core business lines, pretax profit rose 23 percent, to £295 million, in its African banking business and 14 percent, to £787 million, in its personal and corporate banking operations.Pretax profit declined 1 percent to £366 million in its Barclaycard credit card business.Shares of Barclays declined 1.7 percent, to 256.95 pence, in trading in London on Wednesday.Advertisement
