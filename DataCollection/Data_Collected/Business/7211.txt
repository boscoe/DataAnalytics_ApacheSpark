PARIS —  Global stock markets stabilized on Tuesday as hope arose that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece might still reach a last-minute deal with his country’s international creditors, but Athens missed a deadline for a critical loan repayment to the International Monetary Fund.Markets fell across the world on Monday, after the Greece government said that a referendum would be held Sunday on whether to accept the bailout terms offered by the so-called troika of international lenders: the I.M.F., the European Central Bank and a group representing European Union member states. On Tuesday, Greece was supposed to have repaid roughly 1.6 billion euros, or $1.8 billion, to the I.M.F.In Athens, the Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, told reporters that Greece would not make the I.M.F. payment. But when asked whether there was still a chance that Athens would reach an aid deal with its creditors before Tuesday’s other key deadline — the midnight expiration of the country’s bailout program — Mr. Varoufakis replied, “We hope so.” No deal materialized, however.

                European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.            With investors focused on the crisis in Greece, there was little market reaction to official data on Tuesday that showed consumer prices in the eurozone had risen 0.2 percent in June compared with a year earlier, and that the jobless rate in the same group of countries was little changed at 11.1 percent in May.The bond market calmed after deep declines on Monday in which investors dumped the sovereign debt of so-called peripheral eurozone countries like Italy, Portugal and Spain, which are seen as the most vulnerable to market turmoil if Greece defaults. On Tuesday, bond yields, which move in the opposite direction to prices, fell across most of the eurozone as tensions eased.The exception was the debt of Greece itself, which continued to trade at elevated levels.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.35 percent from 2.33 percent a day earlier.
