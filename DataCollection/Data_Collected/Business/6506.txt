Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has taken on Wall Street banks and the issue of income inequality, is now going after Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.In a 13-page letter to Ms. White on Tuesday, Ms. Warren called her two-year stewardship of the S.E.C. “extremely disappointing” and not in keeping with the kind of leadership that Ms. White had promised to deliver during her Senate confirmation hearing.The senator said Ms. White had been slow to promulgate rules with regards to chief executive pay and failed to require companies settling enforcement actions to admit to wrongdoing. Ms. Warren also took issue with Ms. White having to recuse herself from too many matters her husband’s law firm has worked on and being too deferential when it came to giving Wall Street investment firms that had pleaded guilty to violating securities laws.“I am disappointed by the significant gap between the promises you made during and shortly after your confirmation and your performance as S.E.C. chair,” Ms. Warren said in the letter.Ms. White wasted no time in issuing a response to Ms. Warren’s letter, calling her allegations a “mischaracterization of her statements.”Advertisement“I am very proud of the agency’s accomplishments under my leadership,” Ms. White said. “Senator Warren’s mischaracterization of my statements and the agency’s accomplishments is unfortunate, but it will not detract from the work we have done, and will continue to do, on behalf of investors.”AdvertisementOthers within the S.E.C. noted that during Ms. White’s tenure, the agency has brought more than 1,400 enforcement actions, and in 2014, the agency had imposed orders seeking to collect more than $4.1 billion in penalties and restitution.Ms. Warren’s letter gave Ms. White a month to provide her with a timeframe for instituting new rules on the disclosure of chief executive pay — something that required under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. She also wants a list of all settlements since September 2014 in which a defendant made an admission of guilt.The senator’s letter took an especially aggressive stance on the issue of the S.E.C. granting a regulatory waiver to Wall Street banks, which permit those institutions to continue to quickly raise capital in the markets even after pleading guilty to a securities crime. The issue of S.E.C. waivers for so-called “bad actors” has become a hotly debated topic in the wake of a number of big banks pleading guilty to felonies in the interest rate and foreign currency manipulation investigations. Kara Stein, an S.E.C. commissioner, has been an outspoken critic of the process and Ms. Warren’s letter echoed some of that criticism.
                Before President Obama named Mary Jo White to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, she was the top federal prosecutor in New York City.            “These waivers apparently reflected the commission’s view that these banks deserved to continue to enjoy special privileges under the securities law despite the deep breaches of trust and evidence mismanagement displayed in these cases.”Ms. Warren also has asked Ms. White to list of all S.E.C. matters she had to recuse herself from because of a potential conflict of interest.The issue of recusals has dogged Ms. White since her appointment by President Obama because Ms. White, a former United States attorney in Manhattan, was a longtime partner at Debevoise & Plimpton, a big New York law firm, and her husband is a lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, another big New York firm. Ms. Warren’s letter quoted from an article in The New York Times that said Ms. White had to recuse herself from more than four dozen investigations because of her past work and the work of her husband’s firm.Ms. Warren said the many recusals had slowed the S.E.C.’s work because it sometimes left the commission deadlocked when it came to voting on enforcement cases. In other instances, she said the commissioners who could vote on the matter might have agreed to a lighter penalty to simply come to a resolution.“I am disappointed that you have not been the strong leader that many had hoped for and that you promised to be,” said Ms. Warren toward the end of her letter. “I hope that you will step up to the job for which you were confirmed.”A version of this article appears in print on June 3, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Senator Warren Says She’s ‘Disappointed’ With S.E.C. Chief.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
