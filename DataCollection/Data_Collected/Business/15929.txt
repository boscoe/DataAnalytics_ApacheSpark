AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks on Wall Street were moderately lower on Friday, depressed, in part, by the declining price of oil. Investors remain on edge about the possibility that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its meeting next week.Bank stocks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank, the giant German lender, after it said it would not settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities before the 2008 financial crisis.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.68 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,123.80. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,139.16, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 5.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,244.57.Stocks have been volatile this week; the Dow moved more than 100 points four out of five days. Most of the volatility has been in anticipation of the Fed meeting. While many investors do not expect a rate increase, a small but noticeable likelihood of one remains.“By the Fed’s own criteria, everything is in place for them to raise rates. But still, people don’t think they are going to raise rates, so the market is in conflict,” said David Kelly, chief global investment strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management.The United States-listed shares of Deutsche Bank dropped $1.38, or 9 percent, to $13.38 after the bank said it did not intend to pay the $14 billion settlement that the United States government asked for. Federal regulators have been looking to settle with Deutsche Bank, as they have done with the other major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, for its role in the mortgage bubble and financial crisis.The news about Deutsche Bank hurt European stocks. In Germany, the DAX closed down 1.5 percent. The CAC-40 in France was down 0.9 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 index fell 0.3 percent.In other company news, the pharmaceutical company Novavax plunged $7.05, or 85 percent, to $1.29 after saying that its experimental vaccine had failed in late-stage clinical testing.United States consumer prices edged up 0.2 percent last month, the Labor Department reported, as a surge in medical care costs offset flat readings for food and energy. The result follows an unchanged figure in July. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy, rose 0.3 percent, its biggest monthly increase since February.The increase in core inflation was led by a record jump in drug prices and the biggest rise in doctor and hospital charges in a quarter-century.In the last 12 months, core inflation has risen 2.3 percent, but overall inflation has increased a more moderate 1.1 percent, still well below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target for annual increases in inflation.Benchmark crude lost 88 cents on Friday, to $43.03 per barrel in New York.
