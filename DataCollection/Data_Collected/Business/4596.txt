BEIJING — China’s economy faces increased downward pressure this year, but the slowdown is stabilizing, with employment and services among the bright spots, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said Sunday.Weighed down by a property downturn, factory overcapacity and local debt, China’s economic growth is expected to slow to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014, despite expected additional stimulus measures.The central bank has cut interest rates twice since November, on top of a cut in bank reserve requirements in February, over concerns about growing deflationary risks. More such moves are expected.The government also plans to run its biggest budget deficit in 2015 since the global crisis to support spending.AdvertisementAlthough growth in industrial output and investment continued to slow, the government sees some signs of the slowdown stabilizing, Mr. Zhang said at a conference in Beijing.Advertisement“There are also bright spots; for example, employment, services, high-tech industries, new industries, private investment and innovations,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
