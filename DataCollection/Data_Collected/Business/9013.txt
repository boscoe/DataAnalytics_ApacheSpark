After Cablevision, however, what else can it buy?As the industry consolidates, putting more power into the hands of a small group of giants, future acquisition targets are smaller and smaller.Already, Comcast, Charter Communications and now Altice have been steadily snapping up the major players. Time Warner Cable, the second-biggest cable operator in the country after Comcast, is poised to be absorbed into Charter, as is Bright House.Now Altice has acquired both Cablevision, the jewel of the New York City metropolitan area, and Suddenlink to vault into the top ranks of the industry.What else can it buy? The European telecom has held talks with a number of smaller cable operators, according to people briefed on the matter, which could go toward a roll-up of the industry and put it on stronger competitive footing against Comcast and Charter.The biggest remaining prize is Cox, which is still owned by its founding eponymous family. With more than four million subscribers, it would provide a significant boost to Altice’s ambitions — but could also draw scrutiny from regulators wary of the rapidly contracting industry.Other potential acquisitions include Mediacom, another privately held cable company with roughly 1.3 million customers, and Cable One, a publicly traded operator spun off from Graham Holdings that has about 686,000 subscribers. Shares in the latter were up nearly 2 percent in early afternoon trading on Wednesday.Advertisement
