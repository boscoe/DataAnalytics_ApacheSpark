The Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday that it would require AbbVie to add new warnings to the drugs, Viekira Pak and Technivie, about their risks for patients who already have advanced liver damage caused by hepatitis C. The warning could reshape the growing field of high-priced drugs to treat the virus, which also includes Gilead Sciences’ blockbuster medications Sovaldi and Harvoni. Brian Abrahams, a Jefferies analyst, wrote in an investment note that the warning was a “moderate positive” for Gilead Sciences. But he added that AbbVie’s Viekira Pak was already expected to be “displaced” by a similar drug from Merck next year. The F.D.A. said in an online posting that AbbVie’s drugs had been linked to multiple cases of severe liver damage — some of them fatal — in patients who already had liver cirrhosis. Advertisement
