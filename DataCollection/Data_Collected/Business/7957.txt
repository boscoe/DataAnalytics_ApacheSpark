LONDON — Barclays reported improved second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, but its new chairman said the lender would speed up its overhaul, curtail “marginal” activity and leave its 2015 dividend the same.The chairman, John McFarlane, who has a reputation for taking a hands-on approach to cutting costs, is leading the bank until it finds a successor for Antony Jenkins, who was forced out on July 8 after the directors lost confidence in his ability to improve returns for shareholders.“Barclays today has a good portfolio of businesses,” Mr. McFarlane said in a news release. “However, we need to accelerate the execution of the strategy.”He said the lender would seek to divest itself of operations that it did not consider core business lines faster than originally planned and that it would act quickly to curtail activity “which is marginal or which will not deliver the return on equity we require.”AdvertisementShares of Barclays were up 2 percent in afternoon trading in London.On a conference call with analysts, Mr. McFarlane said the bank derived the bulk of its profit from three core areas – Britain, South Africa and the United States – and the lender should look to bolster its market position in those regions.Advertisement“And so the strategic priority for Barclays is therefore to focus on what really matters, and where it matters,” he said.He said the company’s remaining international network – beyond some domestic opportunities, such as the Barclaycard business in Germany – should be focused on serving “our major market clients internationally, and major international clients in our core markets.”“If defined in this way, going forward, it therefore should be focused and sized to an efficient delivery of its main role, and those propositions that no longer fulfill either their role or their potential, need either to be scaled back or be exited, unless we have a clear competitive advantage in specific products or markets,” he said. He also reiterated his earlier comments that the bank had become “far too hierarchical, bureaucratic and group-centric.”“I therefore want to see much more streamlined processes with clearer individual accountability throughout the organization while maintaining appropriate risk and compliance controls,” he said.For the three months that ended June 30, Barclays reported a profit of 1.15 billion pounds, or about $1.79 billion, compared with £161 million in the same period last year.The lender also took an additional £850 million in provisions in the quarter to reimburse customers for the improper selling of products in Britain, including a further £600 million related to payment protection insurance, a product that has cost British banks billions of dollars in customer redress.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Barclays bought the bulk of Lehman’s North American brokerage operations in 2008.AdvertisementIn June, the trustee overseeing the winding down of Lehman’s brokerage unit said the remaining Lehman estate would pay $1.28 billion to settle a lawsuit filed by Barclays.Barclays also said it would keep its dividend flat at 6.5 pence for 2015, matching the 2014 level. The lender said it wanted to maintain its capital strength while looking to improve returns.“Over time, rather than targeting a particular payout ratio range,” Mr. McFarlane said, “we will aim to maintain a sustainable and progressive dividend policy, recognizing the importance of dividend yield in delivering returns to shareholders.”Mr. McFarlane previously served as chairman of the British insurer Aviva. He replaced David Walker as the Barclays chairman this year and assumed the role of executive chairman this month after the ouster of Mr. Jenkins, who took the helm three years ago while the bank was reeling from a rate-rigging scandal.Barclays said its adjusted pretax profit, which excludes provisions for customer redress and other charges, rose 11.4 percent to £1.85 billion in the second quarter, from £1.66 billion in the prior-year period.The adjusted pretax profit exceeded analysts’ forecasts, according to Reuters.Operating income, which is similar to revenue, declined 1.3 percent to £6.06 billion in the second quarter, from £6.14 billion in the same period last year. Operating expenses declined six percent to £4.17 billion in the quarter, from £4.44 billion in the second quarter of 2014.In the investment bank, pretax profit rose 34.9 percent to £765 million.In terms of the investment bank, Mr. McFarlane said he was “very pleased” with its recent progress and “optimistic” about the future of the business.“The business has presented a refined plan to the board that shows ongoing improvement,” he said. “This is a much more focused proposition building more on what we are good at and where we are good at it, and is likely to use less capital.”In its other core businesses, pretax profit rose less than 1 percent to £245 million in its African banking business and declined 9.1 percent to £709 million in its personal and corporate banking operations.AdvertisementPretax profit rose 8.3 percent to £429 million in its Barclaycard credit card business.A version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Barclays Makes Gains, but Boss Aims Higher.
