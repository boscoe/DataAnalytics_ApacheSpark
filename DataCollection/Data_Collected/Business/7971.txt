Citing intensifying regulatory uncertainty, Wells Fargo is severing roughly 200 agreements with builders, brokers and other real estate firms that the bank uses to bolster its mortgage business.One of the nation’s largest mortgage lenders, Wells Fargo announced on Thursday that it was ending all mortgage marketing services and desk rental agreements with builders and real estate brokers. These arrangements are widespread throughout the highly competitive mortgage industry, where lenders scrap to find eligible borrowers.Such arrangements involve, for example, Wells renting desk space from a home builder in an effort to more easily sell mortgages to the home buyers passing through the sales office.“The decision was made as a result of increasing uncertainty surrounding regulatory oversight of these types of arrangements,” the bank said in a statement.AdvertisementA bank spokesman said the move was not related to a specific regulatory problem or investigation. Rather, he said, the bank was responding to broader regulatory scrutiny of such arrangements, which are governed by the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.AdvertisementThe federal law is meant to prevent mortgage lenders, real estate brokers, builders and any other party involved in the home buying process from handing out or receiving kickbacks in exchange for referrals. The law is meant to protect consumers from being steered into unsuitable loans or insurance contracts by companies that are essentially acting in collusion.The real estate law had been enforced by the Housing and Urban Development department, but now falls under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The agency, which has been taking a series of enforcement actions against smaller mortgage companies related to illegal kickbacks, hailed Wells Fargo’s move on Thursday, “as an important step for the mortgage industry.”“We are concerned that such agreements can carry significant legal risk for companies and undermine transparency for consumers,” the agency said in a statement. “Companies should take note of today’s action and consider carefully whether their own business practices comply with the consumer protections provided under the law, which bars kickbacks for customer referrals.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A few months after its settlement over the consumer bureau in January, Wells fire more loan officers in other states, including New Jersey, over concerns about referrals provided by another title company, this person said.The bank employees were told they had violated the company’s code of ethics by accepting mortgage leads from the title company with the understanding that they would then steer business back to the title company.A version of this article appears in print on July 31, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Mortgage Ties Cut.
