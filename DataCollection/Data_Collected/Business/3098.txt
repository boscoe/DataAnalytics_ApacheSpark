CRACKDOWN ON LOANS LINKED TO CARS  |  Car title loans, which allow owners to borrow money against their cars, are under fire, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Michael Corkery report in DealBook. On Friday, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to announce that it has reached a settlement with two car title lenders, First American Title Lending and Finance Select, over suspicions that they misled borrowers by failing to accurately disclose the terms and costs of the loans, according to people briefed on the action. The agreement will require the companies, both based in Georgia, to overhaul how they advertise and promote their loans, the people said.“The move ‒ the first time that the agency has taken action against title lenders ‒ points to a growing concern among state and federal authorities that the loans are plunging some of the most vulnerable borrowers further into debt, propelling them into bankruptcy and, in many cases, costing them their cars,” Ms. Silver-Greenberg and Mr. Corkery write. The loans allow borrowers to hand over car titles as collateral for cash, usually a percentage of a car’s resale value. The loans come with annual interest rates as high as 300 percent and last from as little as 30 days to two years.There is little nationwide data on title-loan borrowers, but recent academic studies offer a portrait of who takes out title loans, and why, Ms. Silver-Greenberg and Mr. Corkery write. Analyzing more than 400 borrowers in three states, professors at Vanderbilt University and the University of Houston Law Center found that roughly 20 percent of customers used the proceeds of title loans to cover mortgage or rent payments.

  LAW FIRM FIGHTS ‘REVENGE PORN’  |  A big law firm recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of a California law student that seeks damages from her former boyfriend for violating United States copyright law by posting a sexually explicit video and photos without her permission and causing emotional distress, DealBook’s Matthew Goldstein writes. The litigation is the handiwork of K&L Gates, a law firm based in Pittsburgh, which has set up the Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project to fight the shame-posting of sexual photos and videos online by jilted lovers.
The complaint is among the first lawsuits filed by the K&L clinic, which is working with about 100 victims of so-called revenge porn, Mr. Goldstein writes. The program is believed to be the first of its kind at a major United States law firm and is led by David A. Bateman, a partner in the firm’s Seattle office, and Elisa J. D’Amico, a litigator in the firm’s Miami office. Most of its clients come through the program’s website or referrals from two national advocacy groups for victims of revenge porn, the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and Without My Consent.
In instances where the victims have taken nude selfies or videos of themselves, the K&L lawyers are using the protections offered by federal copyright law to demand that the websites take down the images or risk being sued along with the perpetrators. But if a victim wants to bring a federal copyright lawsuit, “there is a catch,” Mr. Goldstein writes. “In many cases, she or he would first need to register any videos or photos to be protected with the United States Copyright Office. In other words, to use copyright law as a hammer, a victim must publicly register a photo or video that she or he would rather no one ever see.”



SHAKE SHACK GOES PUBLIC  |  What began as a Chicago-style hot dog stand nearly 14 years ago in Manhattan’s Madison Square Park is now Shake Shack, a hamburger empire that is set to begin trading on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange with a valuation of about $745 million, Michael J. de la Merced and Kim Severson write in DealBook. The initial public offering will increase the net worth of the restaurateur Danny Meyer, who opened the hot dog cart, by about $155 million.
Shake Shack has become “one of the most prominent purveyors of fast-casual food,” a sector that has fundamentally reshaped the fast-food industry with its emphasis on fresh ingredients, Mr. de la Merced and Ms. Severson write. “Shake Shack has resonated with consumers who grew up on fast food but are both wary and weary of it.” Other fast-casual chains have gone public with great success. Shares in Zoës Kitchen, for instance, have doubled from the chain’s public debut. Those in El Pollo Loco are up 76 percent. 
Hospitality has been the hallmark of Mr. Meyer’s restaurant empire, which includes fixtures of the New York dining scene. Even in its prospectus, Shake Shack refers to its customers as “guests.” The combination of quality ingredients and warm service has proved profitable. Shake Shack reported $5.4 million in net income in 2013 on $82.5 million in sales. But Shake Shack’s ambitious expansion plans ‒ the chain plans to open at least 10 company-owned restaurants in the United States each fiscal year ‒ may threaten the high level of hospitality the company is known for.

HOW APPLE BEAT MICROSOFT  |  With the latest earnings reports from Microsoft and Apple, “the once unthinkable became reality: Apple’s market capitalization hit $683 billion, more than double Microsoft’s current value of $338 billion,” James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column. What is more, Apple earned $18 billion in the quarter ‒ more than any company ever in a single quarter ‒ on revenue of $75 billion. Microsoft’s revenue, on the other hand, was barely one-third of Apple’s, and operating income of $7.8 billion was less than a quarter of Apple’s. 
How ‒ and why ‒ did this happen? Mr. Stewart writes: “The most successful companies need a vision, and both Apple and Microsoft have one. But Apple’s was more radical and, as it turns out, more farsighted. Microsoft foresaw a computer on every person’s desk, a radical idea when IBM mainframes took up entire rooms. But Apple went a big step further: Its vision was a computer in every pocket.” And unlike Microsoft, Apple has not been afraid to “cannibalize itself,” as Walter Isaacson, who interviewed Steve Jobs for his biography, put it. Apple has also integrated all aspects of the design and manufacture of a product.
Although some investors worry that Apple could “become the prisoner of its own success,” Mr. Stewart writes, its shares appear to be a bargain, especially given the huge amount of cash it has on its balance sheet. The question for Apple now is what’s next.
