MGM Resorts International announced on Friday that it would become the first major casino company in Las Vegas to end a longstanding and popular perk: free parking. The move could bring in millions of dollars annually, and transform a tourism hot spot that increasingly caters to visitors who come for expensive attractions other than gambling. MGM Resorts, the largest hotel-casino operator in Las Vegas, said it would charge $10 or less for overnight self-parking at most of its properties on the Las Vegas Strip starting this spring. MGM Resorts has 35,310 hotel rooms and 37,000 parking spots on the Strip, which are at a premium during major events. The parking fees will be imposed at Mandalay Bay, Delano, Luxor, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, New York-New York, Vdara, Aria, Bellagio, the Mirage and MGM Grand. Valet parking will cost still more, but some parking at the Circus Circus hotel and the Crystals and Mandalay Bay Place shopping centers will still be free. The company did not provide details on the fees, but it said that parking would be cheaper at some hotels. Those in MGM’s loyalty program will be able to earn free parking rewards. The fees, though unexpected, fall in line with casinos’ focus on expanding their database of gamblers through reward programs, according to Alex Bumazhny, a gambling analyst with Fitch Ratings.A version of this brief appears in print on January 16, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: MGM Resorts’ Las Vegas Casinos to End Free Parking.
