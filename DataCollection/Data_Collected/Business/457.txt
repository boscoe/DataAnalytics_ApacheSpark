Kia said it had received numerous complaints about the problem, including reports of three injuries. The carmaker said it was caused by drivers who use “excessive force” to move the gearshift lever, thus damaging the gearshift interlock mechanism. That interlock, mandated by the government, requires the driver to depress the brake before the transmission can be moved out of park. An Ohio man told regulators that his Sorento rolled down his driveway when his 10-year-old son was playing unsupervised in the vehicle. In the complaint, posted in 2014 on the safety regulator’s website, the man said his son “jumped out of the truck and tried to stop it by getting behind it.” The child was hospitalized for almost three weeks with injuries including four cracked ribs and a cracked pelvis.
