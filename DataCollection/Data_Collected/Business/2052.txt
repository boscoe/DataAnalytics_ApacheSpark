SABMiller generated no taxable income despite having 2 billion Australian dollars in total earnings.Apple paid a tax of 74 million Australian dollars on income of 247 million dollars. That was in line with the country's 30 percent tax rate but a fraction of the total 6.1 billion dollars it made in Australia that year.Google paid 9 million dollars of tax on 91 million dollars in taxable income; it made 357 million dollars in Australia last year.A BAE Systems spokeswoman said the company paid no income tax that year because of losses it incurred developing a new surveillance system for the Royal Australian Air Force. The company showed full details of its tax arrangements to the country’s tax office to ensure it was compliant.A Hilton spokeswoman declined to comment, while representatives for Apple, Google, Halliburton, SABMiller, Ford and Honda did not respond to requests for comment.The disclosure could build public support for an overhaul to the company tax system after a government inquiry into corporate tax avoidance this year led to some tense clashes between executives and lawmakers.Peter Burn, head of policy at business lobby the Australian Industry Group, said the data release showed tax laws needed to be updated, not that companies were evading their responsibilities.The question of where value was created was a thorny one for tax authorities the world over, he said.“Individual company tax laws haven't really come to terms with that yet, and Australia is probably well ahead of the pack rather than behind it,” Mr. Burn said.Advertisement
