Toyota added nearly 1.4 million cars, trucks and S.U.V.s to a growing recall for airbags that can explode with too much force. The company said it was expanding a previous recall after Takata of Japan agreed in May to double the size of its airbag inflater recall to 33.8 million. Vehicles added to the recall include the 2003 to 2007 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2005 and 2006 Tundra pickup, 2005 to 2007 Sequoia S.U.V. and the 2003 to 2007 Lexus SC430 convertible. Last month, Takata bowed to pressure from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and declared many of its products defective, agreeing to what is now the largest auto recall in United States history. The problem has been blamed for at least seven deaths and more than 100 injuries. The recall expansion brings the number of Toyota and Lexus vehicles being recalled in the United States to 2.9 million.A version of this brief appears in print on June 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Nearly 1.4.
