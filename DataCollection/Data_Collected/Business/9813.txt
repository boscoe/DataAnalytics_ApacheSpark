Neither UBS nor the commission on Thursday elaborated on what I.P.O.s were being investigated.“If such action is taken, there may be financial ramifications for UBS, including fines and restitution orders,” UBS said in a single-paragraph statement in its most recent quarterly report. “Such action could also result in suspension of UBS’s ability to provide corporate finance advisory services in Hong Kong for a period of time.”A spokesman for UBS in Hong Kong declined to comment further.Hong Kong has ranked as one of the world’s biggest markets for I.P.O.s for a decade, driven by a wave of blockbuster listings of mainland Chinese companies. But some of these have turned out to be frauds.Regulators in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997 but maintains its own legal system, have taken increasingly tough action in recent years against misleading or fraudulent stock market listings, targeting both representatives of companies and their bankers.The commission in 2012 revoked the license of a Taiwan-owned underwriter of an I.P.O. that imploded after getting a court to force the company to buy back all of the shares it had sold to the public in the offering.In 2013 the commission toughened legislation for banks that sponsor I.P.O.s, introducing the threat of criminal liability for banks and bankers who sign off on purposely misleading listing documents. But the regulator also has said it is not on a mission to put bankers in jail.Some I.P.O.s that UBS worked on and that later proved problematic included China Metal Recycling and China Forestry, both of which have entered liquidation. Shares in another, Tianhe Chemicals, have been suspended from trading since 2015 pending the results of a forensic investigation after its previous auditor flagged potential accounting issues. The company, which UBS helped to list in 2014, had previously been targeted by short sellers.Advertisement
