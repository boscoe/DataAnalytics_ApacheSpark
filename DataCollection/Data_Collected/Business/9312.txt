LONDON — Shares of the Swiss mining giant Glencore recovered some of their losses in early trading in London on Tuesday after Citigroup analysts suggested that the company should be taken private if the stock market continued to not value it “fairly.”Glencore’s stock has been under pressure as analysts and investors have expressed concern about the company’s heavy debt and weakness in commodities pricing.Concerns about global growth and weakness in commodities also contributed to a sell-off in the United States and Europe on Monday.Based in Baar, Switzerland, Glencore buys and sells commodities, like coal and cooper, as part of its trading arm and mines those commodities as well.AdvertisementThe company’s stock plunged nearly 30 percent in trading in London on Monday and its Hong Kong-listed shares fell 29 percent as a global sell-off spread to Asian markets on Tuesday.But shares of Glencore recovered some of their losses and rose nearly 8 percent in early trading in London on Tuesday. The company’s stock recently traded up more than 8 percent in midday trading in London.AdvertisementIn their note on Tuesday, the Citigroup analysts said they believed the sell-off in Glencore was “overdone” and it was not likely that the company’s debt would be downgraded by ratings agencies to so-called junk status.“We believe that in the event the equity market continues to express its unwillingness to value the business fairly, the company management should take the company private, whereby restructuring measures can be taken easily and quickly, with a potential float of just the industrial business occurring further down the track,” the Citigroup analysts said in a research note on Tuesday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
