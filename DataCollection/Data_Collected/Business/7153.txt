WASHINGTON —  Contracts to buy existing homes in the United States rose in May to their highest level in just over nine years, a further boost to the housing market and the broader economic outlook.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 0.9 percent to 112.6, the highest level since April 2006. Contracts have now increased for five straight months.Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and the increase last month pointed to further gains in home resales after they hit a five-and-a-half-year high in May.“The recent trend suggests that we will see continued strength in resales in the months ahead. However, the current low inventory levels, which are placing upward pressure on home prices, remain a downside risk,” said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at BNP Paribas in New York.AdvertisementThe housing market recovery is back on track after being hit hard by bad weather at the start of the year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
