The decline in the number of oil rigs operating in the United slowed this week, data showed on Friday, suggesting that the collapse in drilling may be ending as prices recover after falling 60 percent from June to March. The oil rig count fell by 24 this week to 679 active rigs, the smallest drop since early April, after 31 and 26 rigs were shut down in the previous two weeks, according to a closely watched report by the oil services firm Baker Hughes. With this week’s decline, the number of active rigs has fallen for a record 21 consecutive weeks to the fewest since September 2010, according to data that goes back to 1987. Since the number of oil rigs peaked at 1,609 in October, producers have cut spending, eliminated jobs and idled more than half of the country’s rigs. The United States oil rig count is bolstering prices and trimming production, but experts say it is approaching a level that will eventually coax oil companies to increase production.A version of this brief appears in print on May 2, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fewer Oil Rigs Are Shut This Week in the U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
