SYDNEY — An Australian watchdog agency said it may reject a tie-up between Qantas Airways and the state-owned China Eastern Airlines, saying it would hurt competition.In a draft decision on Tuesday, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission said it may refuse to approve a Qantas plan for a joint venture with China Eastern. It said the deal could give the pair undue control over the potentially lucrative Sydney-Shanghai route.The ruling, to be finalized after submissions by interested parties by April 5, could do more than just hamper Qantas’ efforts to beef up international operations. Rejection of a deal sealed in conjunction with an Australia-China trade accord, signed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a landmark ceremony last November, could also be a setback for Sydney’s drive to boost commerce with its biggest trading partner.Shares in Qantas fell as much as 3 percent to a near two-week low after the commission’s initial ruling. The two carriers will work together with the regulator as it approaches a final decision, Qantas said in a news release.AdvertisementQantas defended the joint venture, saying it would boost bilateral trade — worth around 150 billion Australian dollars, or $118 billion, in 2013 — increase services and ultimately open up new routes between the two countries. Australia needs China’s help to transition from reliance on minerals exports to expanding food and agriculture to serve a growing Asian middle class.Advertisement“There are more than 20 airlines already providing services between Australia and mainland China, and the sharp pricing on these routes demonstrates that the market is highly competitive,” Qantas International’s chief executive, Gareth Evans, said in the release.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Competition between them will be greatly reduced under the proposed agreement,” the commission’s chairman, Rod Sims, said in a news release.Last month, Qantas reported its best first-half earnings in four years, reporting a profit at its international divisions for the first time since the global financial crisis. Qantas has struggled in recent years thanks to high fuel costs, a strong Australian dollar, increasing international competition and a domestic price war with rival Virgin Australia Holdings.Inbound Chinese tourism could be a future growth engine for Qantas, said Ben Le Brun, an analyst at optionsXpress.“If the joint venture is called into question, it could result in a little bit of downside risks to their earnings capabilities,” he said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
