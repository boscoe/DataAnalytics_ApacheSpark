"China is actually slowing, but it's not collapsing," says Stephen Schwarzman, co-founder of the private equity firm, sharing his outlook on the devaluing of the renminbi.Score one for Mr. Market.The long-running campaign by the Blackstone Group’s chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, to get investors to pile into his stock was hurt on Thursday when Blackstone reported a 70 percent decline in its core income for the fourth quarter.With the stock market in broad retreat, the lucrative performance fees that Blackstone receives when it unloads various investments — and which are at the heart of the company’s business model — nearly vanished in the fourth quarter.And as a result, its economic net income sank to $435 million in the fourth quarter from $1.4 billion in the quarter a year ago.For the full year, Blackstone’s economic net income was $2.1 billion — down 51 percent from its record figure of $4.3 billion in 2014.AdvertisementBlackstone’s stock, already down 41 percent from its recent high, took another dip on Thursday, losing as much as 5 percent before closing the day off about 2 percent.AdvertisementMr. Schwarzman has long contended that Blackstone should command a higher stock market price, like traditional asset managers BlackRock and T. Rowe Price, as opposed to the lower stock market valuation that investors now give it because of the volatility of its profits.Even with the market turmoil, though, Blackstone reported a small increase in its assets under management, which rose slightly to $336.3 billion in the last three months — a period in which most large asset managers have been experiencing significant investment withdrawals.In many ways, Blackstone’s fourth quarter highlighted the company’s unusual mix of pluses and minuses. The plunge in profits reveals how reliant it remains on its main private equity businesses, which reap lucrative performance fees when Blackstone can sell company and real estate stakes into a rising stock market.For several years now, Mr. Schwarzman has been on a crusade of sorts, trying to persuade investors to look through the wild swings in the fees and focus more on the company’s extraordinary capacity to attract investor capital no matter the market conditions.And to his point, Blackstone’s assets under management grew 16 percent for the year, to $336 billion — with $15 billion coming in the fourth quarter alone. For the year, the company raised $93 billion in capital, exceeding by a wide margin the total amount raised by competing alternative asset managers over this period.Unlike other fund companies, Blackstone requires lockup periods of as much as 10 years — a point that Mr. Schwarzman makes incessantly when he pounds the table for his company.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            That means that once the money comes to Blackstone, it stays for quite a while, generating fees. And these funds cannot be withdrawn, as has been the case at firms such as Pimco and Franklin Templeton, when markets or performance suffers.AdvertisementIn a conference call with investors on Thursday, Mr. Schwarzman, who never misses the opportunity to promote his company’s stock, was perhaps the most vocal he has ever been in declaring that Wall Street was not valuing Blackstone correctly.“We remain highly profitable with strong growth and limited downside,” he said. “Right now you are getting Blackstone on sale.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But these alternative managers are super volatile, and they suffer from whims of the market.”The company’s fund-raising skills aside, the quarter did reveal quite starkly how a tough stock market environment can hurt immediate term profits.The economic net income of the company’s two profit-driving machines sank — 77 percent for private equity and 72 percent for real estate. Smaller businesses also experienced measurable declines: Hedge funds fell 36 percent and distressed bonds dropped 87 percent.The firm’s credit business, a fast-growing operation just a few years ago, was hit particularly hard by the turmoil in the junk bond markets.On the call, Mr. Schwarzman was pressed by an analyst who asked why he did not authorize Blackstone to start buying back its own stock if he was so convinced that the company was undervalued.Advertisement“We get asked about stock buybacks a lot,” Mr. Schwarzman said. “But I like cash. And if we buy stock, we leverage ourselves up. There is nothing wrong with buying stock at this price — but we don’t want to compromise the growth of one of the greatest companies in the world.”A version of this article appears in print on January 29, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Income Dives 70% for Blackstone, but Assets Keep Climbing .
