Francis J. Shammo, Verizon’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call on Tuesday that the new packages were allowed “under our existing contracts.” The plans, begun on Sunday, start at $55 a month. ESPN, owned by the Walt Disney Company, objected to the new option and said ESPN and ESPN2 could not be in a separate package according to its contract. Fox Sports and NBCUniversal made similar complaints about their channels. Verizon said it added 565,000 wireless subscribers in the quarter, up 4.8 percent from the same quarter a year ago. The company’s first-quarter net income came to $4.22 billion, or $1.02 a share. Advertisement
