Bank bonds, however, will be excluded from the asset-buying plan.The program, which is a form of quantitative easing, is similar to ones undertaken by the Federal Reserve in the United States and the Bank of England in Britain. It is meant to lower interest rates and encourage borrowing, in that way helping economic growth and inflation.Starting in June, the European Central Bank will offer four-year loans to commercial banks every three months until March 2017. It was not clear how many banks would be eligible for the program.Banks could, under special circumstances, be paid to take out the loans, meaning they would effectively receive interest both from the European Central Bank for borrowing the money and interest from the customers they lend the money to.Advertisement
