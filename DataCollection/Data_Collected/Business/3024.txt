Drawing on growing interest in live music events, the organizer of several big rock festivals around the country has secured an investment from an unusual source.Danny Wimmer Presents, which produces festivals like Rock on the Range and Monster Energy Carolina Rebellion, plans to announce on Wednesday that it has sold a stake in itself to the United Auburn Indian Community Development Corporation. That is the investment arm of the Native American tribe that owns and runs the Thunder Valley casino resort in Northern California.Financial terms were not disclosed.The move comes amid renewed interest in live music and the continuing popularity of festivals like Coachella. Last year, Live Nation Entertainment struck a deal to buy a controlling stake in C3 Presents, which runs the Austin City Limits Music Festival and produces Lollapalooza.And in 2013, SFX Entertainment, the big electronic dance music event company, went public, raising $260 million. Its shares, however, have tumbled 70 percent since then.Founded in 2007 by Danny Wimmer, a longtime music promoter who has worked for Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, the company puts on 10 rock festivals each year — but ones that play in Columbus, Ohio, instead of, say, Los Angeles. Nevertheless, it claims big attendance figures, with its Rock on the Range drawing an estimated 120,000 attendees last year, and the Monster Energy Carolina Rebellion attracting about 60,000.The company, whose 2014 revenue was up 51 percent from 2013, plans to add five new festivals to its portfolio this year.Wednesday’s deal is the first time that Danny Wimmer Presents has taken on outside backing.The festival producer was advised by McCafferty & Company and the law firm Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton.
