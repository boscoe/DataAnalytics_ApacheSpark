The deal was signed Tuesday; the price wasn’t disclosed. Joe Sladek, who bought Skee-Ball Inc. in 1985, called the sale a “bittersweet goodbye.” The chief of Bay Tek, Gaetan Philippon, said in a statement that he hoped to take Skee-Ball “to the next level.” Bay Tek said it would rebrand its alley game Fireball Fusion as Skee-Ball. The games are made in Chalfont, Pa., but production will be moved to Pulaski, Wis., where Bay Tek is based.Advertisement
