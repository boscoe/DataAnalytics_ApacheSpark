LONDON — The consumer goods giant Unilever left its target for sales growth in 2016 unchanged on Thursday, despite a strong first quarter, saying that it expected makers of packaged goods to continue facing difficulties this year.The British-Dutch maker of products including Lipton tea and Dove soap said it expected lower commodity and energy prices to affect sales in emerging markets, which represent more than half its sales, and that slower growth elsewhere would also drag its results.“We expected tougher markets, and we’re finding tougher markets,” said Graeme Pitkethly, the company’s chief financial officer.Unilever’s underlying sales, excluding the impact of exchange rates, nevertheless rose 4.7 percent in the first quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations and near the top end of its growth target of 3 percent to 5 percent for the full year.AdvertisementIncluding currency effects, turnover fell 2 percent to 12.5 billion euros, or about $14.2 billion.The amount of goods sold by Unilever rose by a better-than-expected 2.6 percent in the period, and prices rose 2 percent, below analysts’ expectations.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It is also beginning a much more detailed analysis of package sizes, prices and availability to drive sales growth. It said the program should represent about 40 percent of turnover by the end of 2016.Unilever is also streamlining its structure in the hopes of being more agile, and it is adopting “zero-based budgeting,” under which all costs must be justified from the start. It expects the changes to result in annual savings of €1 billion by 2018, the company said.“We continue to prefer Unilever to Nestlé,” analysts at Canaccord Genuity said, citing Unilever’s stronger position in the fast-growing personal care sector, possible portfolio changes and its cost-savings delivery.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
