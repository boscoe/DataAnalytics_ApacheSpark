Farms employ almost a third of the country’s 1.4 billion people and produce about 9 percent of China’s gross domestic product, though with low productivity.The central bank said outstanding loans to agriculture totaled 23.6 trillion renminbi, or $3.8 trillion, at the end of 2014, accounting for 28.1 percent of total bank loans.Farm loans rose an annual 13 percent last year, 0.7 percentage point higher than the rise in overall loans, it said.Farm loans made by small banks, including rural commercial banks and village banks, jumped 26 percent last year, while such loans granted by large banks, including big state-owned lenders, rose 11.5 percent, it said.Bank loans for agriculture rose an annual average of 21.7 percent between 2007 and 2014, helping ensure grain harvests and increases in rural incomes, the central bank said.The central bank has been cutting interest rates and bank reserve requirements — including deeper reductions for rural lenders — in a bid to support the slowing economy.Weighed down by a property downturn, factory overcapacity and local debt, growth is expected to slow to a quarter-century low of about 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014, even with expected additional stimulus measures.
