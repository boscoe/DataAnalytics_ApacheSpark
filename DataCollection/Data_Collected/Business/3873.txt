Singer.The activist investment firm had weighed a challenge at Juniper last year, though the company announced a series of moves that drew support from the hedge fund, including stock buybacks and cost-cutting. It also added two independent directors at that time.As of Dec. 31, Elliott owned a nearly 10 percent stake.In its statement, Juniper said that Elliott had agreed to vote in favor of Mr. Dolce and Mr. Merchant.“Juniper has a clear, well-defined strategy against which it has made impressive progress over the past year,” Jesse Cohn, the hedge fund’s head of equity activism in the United States, said in the statement. “We’re pleased with the board’s decision to appoint Jim and Rahul, who will assist Juniper in continuing that progress.”Advertisement
