John S. Weinberg, a banker whose father and grandfather led Goldman Sachs for decades, is retiring after his own 32-year career at the firm.
            The Weinberg family has played a central role at Goldman Sachs since 1907.        Mr. Weinberg, the co-head of Goldman’s investment bank division until last year, is descended from Sidney Weinberg, who led Goldman in the middle of the last century, and John L. Weinberg, who led Goldman in the 1970s and 1980s.Mr. Weinberg, 58, joined Goldman as an associate in 1983 and rose up the ranks, becoming a partner in 1992 and finishing as vice chairman. Unlike his father and grandfather, who helped formulate the bank’s strategy, Mr. Weinberg was known for his focus on advising large corporate clients.“During his more than three decades at the firm, John was responsible for many of our most important clients,” Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and president, Gary D. Cohn, wrote in a note to employees on Monday. “His work as a trusted adviser has been characterized by integrity, transparency, humility and a deep understanding of each client’s business.”A version of this article appears in print on July 7, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Goldman Scion Retires.
