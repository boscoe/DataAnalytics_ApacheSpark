It carries a maximum penalty of up to seven years in prison.The regulator did not provide much detail about the accusations on Thursday, only saying that the charges were related to trading in equities and a call option, a leveraged bet that an asset will rise, between Oct. 2, 2011, and Dec. 16, 2011.Mr. Lyttleton, 45, appeared in Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday, but he did not enter a plea or give an indication of how he planned to plea. He oversaw the BlackRock UK Dynamic and BlackRock UK Absolute Alpha funds before he left the firm in March 2013.A lawyer for Mr. Lyttleton declined to comment on Thursday.BlackRock said it had been informed by the Financial Conduct Authority that the charges related to a former employee for actions carried out in 2011 “for his personal gain, while off our premises, and that neither BlackRock, nor any employee, was under investigation.”“The alleged behavior is totally contrary to the firm’s principles and values, and we strongly support aggressive enforcement of the law in these matters,” BlackRock said. “As charges have now been brought, we will not be able to make any further comment.”Mr. Lyttleton was arrested in April 2013 in connection with an insider trading inquiry, but his identity was not publicly released at the time and he was not charged.The Financial Conduct Authority said at the time that two people had been questioned about insider trading and market abuse, and that several homes and offices had been searched in Switzerland in connection with the inquiry.BlackRock also confirmed in 2013 that a former employee had been arrested by the City of London police on suspicion of insider trading. The company said that the accusations were related to personal activities by the individual and that they were not connected with dealings related to the firm’s clients.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
