The energy-rich country owns the outlet.When the decision to shut down Al Jazeera America was announced in January, some workers surmised that the changes were because of declining oil prices. The company denied that at the time. Al Jazeera America will shut down by April 30.Al Jazeera has grown since its founding in 1996, with more than 70 bureaus for its subsidiaries across the world and a large digital presence.Mr. Souag said the decision to cut the jobs was difficult. “However, we are confident it is the right step to ensure the network’s long-term competitiveness and reach,” he said.Advertisement
