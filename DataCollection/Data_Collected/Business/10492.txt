It also said it was aiming at an operating cost base of less than 17 billion francs for 2018, compared with its prior target of less than 18 billion francs.The bank announced plans last year to cut thousands of jobs and reduce its costs by billions of dollars by the end of 2018. It moved to accelerate those cost-cutting efforts this year, saying it would eliminate 6,000 jobs.“About a year ago, we presented our strategy to be a leading private bank and wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities,” Mr. Thiam told investors on Wednesday. “One year into the implementation of this plan, we believe our strategy is the right one.”Mr. Thiam joined the bank in 2015 after serving as the chief executive of the British insurer Prudential. The restructuring has led to some tensions among its bankers. In March, the bank said it would accelerate its cost-cutting and shrink its investment bank, with Mr. Thiam saying at the time that the size of the positions on the bank’s trading book “was a surprise for a number of people and was not a widely known fact.”Credit Suisse’s share price rose nearly 7 percent in afternoon trading in Switzerland, but it remains about 36 percent lower than the levels it was trading at when Mr. Thiam first announced his plans in 2015.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
