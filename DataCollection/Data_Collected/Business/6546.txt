The notes, some of which don’t mature until 2029, could be converted into shares if the lender’s capital fell below certain thresholds.But changes in how regulators viewed a bank’s core capital meant that the Prudential Regulation Authority excluded the bonds when it calculated whether Lloyds had sufficient capital to survive a future financial crisis as part of a stress test last year.As a result, Lloyds sought and received permission from regulators in December to redeem some of the bonds at face value. A group of bondholders objected and challenged the move in court.On Wednesday, the Chancery Division of the High Court in London found that even though regulators did not consider the bonds in the most recent stress test, they might be included in future stress tests.“The group is disappointed with the decision and has sought permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal,” Lloyds said in a news release.In 2009, Lloyds issued about 8 billion pounds, or about $12 billion, of the notes.Last year, it exchanged about £5 billion of them for other bonds and sought permission to redeem about £700 million of the remaining ones at face value.Lloyds had argued that the changed view of regulators on core capital resulted in a so-called capital disqualification event, allowing it to redeem the bonds at par.The lender said it would save £200 million, or about $305 million, a year over the next five years by redeeming those bonds, which paid a high annual interest rate.The setback comes just days after the British government said it would extend a trading plan to reduce its stake in Lloyds and said it would offer some of its holdings to retail investors in the next year.The government held as much as 40 percent of Lloyds after a £17 billion bailout in 2008, but it has pared its holdings in recent years as the bank’s prospects have improved. It now holds just less than 19 percent of the lender’s outstanding shares.Shares of Lloyds were up less than 1 percent, at 88.78 pence, in midafternoon trading in London on Wednesday.Advertisement
