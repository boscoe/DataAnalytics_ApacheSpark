Hacker’s List, an online meeting place for hackers and people who want to hire them, spent a good part of Friday struggling to keep the upstart web service running.The roughly three-month-old website reported getting a flood of unexpected visitors after the site was profiled in a front-page article  in The New York Times about the hacker-for-hire businesses.“As some of you have noticed, we’ve been upgrading our server like crazy this morning,” Hacker’s List said in an email to customers. “We have all been busy this morning trying to get ahead of what has turned out to be a turbulent but great morning.”The inaccessibility of the website at times led to some speculation that Hacker’s List may have itself been hacked. But a man claiming to be one of site’s three founders said in a separate email that the problems were simply the result from heavier-than-normal web traffic.“It went viral,” said the man who has identified himself only as “Jack.”Still, later on Friday the website remained slow and inaccessible at times.All the owners of Hacker’s List have sought to remain anonymous for now and will not disclose their identities. The owners contend the website is a legitimate business even though some of the job postings on Hackers’ List seek hackers to things that might raise eyebrows: such as, gain access to another’s email account, hack into a Facebook account or gain access to a company’s database.In the email to customers, Hacker’s List reminded its registered users to only use the website’s escrow system for exchanging money between customers and hackers and to avoid direct payments for hacking jobs. The site’s owners also advised users to “be careful not to post personal information in your projects and try to use private message to further convey information.”The advisory about using the private message system may be because the job postings on Hacker’s List are visible to anyone who registers as a user.Separately on Friday, Taia Global, a cybersecurity consulting firm, issued a report warning about “mercenary hacker groups” that are being paid wealthy businessman and companies to hack into competitors networks to steal corporate secrets. The consulting firm said so-called “espionage as a service” is a growing problem for companies operating in the aerospace and defense industries.
