HONG KONG — A week of volatility in China’s stock markets ended on a better note than many investors expected, as government policies to prop up shares seemed to have muted some of the panic among sellers.China’s Shanghai composite index jumped 4.5 percent Friday, after a similar rise on Thursday. Responding to the restored confidence and a new proposal from the Greek government for a bailout plan, regional markets followed suit. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 2.1 percent.Many Chinese companies remain suspended from trading. A collapse of sentiment since June 12 sent markets plummeting and by Wednesday had erased 32 percent of the value of the Shanghai index in less than a month.Over the week, Beijing introduced several policy efforts to stop the decline, including coordinating a broker-backed bailout fund and banning certain investors from selling shares in companies. Insurers and large state-owned companies have also been encouraged to invest in the market.AdvertisementThough many criticized the responses as being overly focused on the short-term, for now analysts said the changes seemed to be stanching the bleeding.Advertisement“Market movement appears to indicate that government actions are working,” Morgan Stanley wrote in a Friday report. “Though not everyone agrees with the sequence and order of the government actions, we believe they have helped to achieve meaningful deleveraging in the equity market without triggering systemic risks.”
                The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country’s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.            That leverage came as Chinese investors poured into the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets over the past year, looking for better returns as property prices stagnated. Cheered on by state media and supported by cheap loans, investors bid up stock valuations to bubble territory, with price-to-earnings ratios of many smaller companies well beyond those of comparable markets elsewhere.In recent weeks, a correction, in part spurred by concerns at Greece’s potential exit from the eurozone, at one point cut more than $3 trillion from the markets, which remain well below the peak in June.Though many investors in China had invested based on loans, the amount of leverage in the market is relatively small, according to economists, and unlikely to have a broader impact or set off any sort of debt crisis. Nonetheless, in China, the collapse of a major source of middle-class wealth is viewed in political terms as much as in economic ones, and the government’s policies were coupled with statements from politicians seeking to restore calm to the markets.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

With data out this week indicating low inflation, the People’s Bank of China has the leeway for further rate cuts. Meanwhile fiscal stimulus in the form of debt swaps is also likely to help stabilize the investment climate.After the close of markets on Friday, China’s Prime Minister Li Keqiang said on a government website that the country’s economic growth was stabilizing but that the government had more to do to lift growth. He also said that Beijing would make targeted changes to policies supporting the economy.Volatility in the markets could continue on external factors, like the Greek debt crisis and China’s seesawing stock market, Hong Kong’s financial secretary, John Tsang, said at a news media event on Friday evening. He added that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority would provide liquidity to banks if necessary.Even as stability prevailed by the end of the week, many retail investors have lost huge amounts of wealth as overpriced small cap shares saw their valuations wilt since June 12.That may well hit broader consumer sentiment in a Chinese economy that is continuing to cool, according to economists. In particular, the property market, which had begun to see prices rise again on the stock boom, could see prices stagnate as purchases based on gains in the market dissolve.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
