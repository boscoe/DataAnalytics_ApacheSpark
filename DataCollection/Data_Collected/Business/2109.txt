Ford Motor is recalling about 313,000 older Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis sedans because the headlights may fail, the automaker said on Tuesday.It has been six years since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration closed an investigation into the same problem, saying that while it had 306 complaints from owners, there were no reports of crashes, injuries or deaths and “a safety-related defect has not been identified at this time.”The recall, which includes about 296,000 cars in the United States and covers the 2003 to 2005 model years, was announced about four months after the federal regulators opened a new investigation at the request of the North Carolina Consumers Council, which argued there was an important safety problem. That request noted that there were 604 consumer complaints on the agency’s website, including seven reports of vehicle crashes but no mention of injuries.“The surprise I have is how quickly Ford issued a recall,” said Matthew Oliver, the executive director of the council, which is based in Raleigh.AdvertisementMr. Oliver noted that early in 2014 Ford sent a letter to owners saying it was possible a component would fail and the headlights would not work, so it provided an extended warranty of 15 years or 250,000 miles from the time the vehicle was new.Ford decided on a recall now after “reviewing data this year” and meeting this month with federal regulators, a Ford spokesman, John Cangany, said in an email. “Our decisions are driven by the available data and we move quickly on behalf of our customers when we determine a safety recall is needed.”AdvertisementFord said it was aware of one minor injury and 11 reports of accidents related to the defect.A version of this article appears in print on December 23, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Ford Recalls 313,000 Cars to Fix Lights.
