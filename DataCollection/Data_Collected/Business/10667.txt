The public has long been wary of used cars and the claims of roadworthiness by the dealers who sell them. On Friday, the nation’s main advertising regulator issued a ruling that consumer groups complained will give used-car dealers too much leeway in the disclosures they are required to make.The Federal Trade Commission, in a decision that also drew criticism from some lawmakers, said that General Motors and two big used-car chains could advertise their used vehicles as having been carefully inspected and repaired even if the cars might still be subject to safety recalls for problems that had not been fixed.The only requirement would be that the dealers must advise buyers that the cars could be subject to recalls and tell them how to determine if they are. There would be no requirement that any recall problems be specified or that any repairs be made.The ruling follows a succession of high-profile cases in which automakers concealed crucial information from car owners, including General Motors’ failure to disclose a deadly ignition switch flaw, Volkswagen’s misrepresentation of pollution emissions, and Honda’s failure to report potential safety problems for more than a decade.AdvertisementUsed-car dealers, in particular, have drawn criticism for selling vehicles under recall without addressing their defects, including violently exploding airbags that have been linked to 11 deaths in the United States. Under lobbying pressure from the used-car industry, efforts to introduce tougher laws for used cars have languished in Congress.AdvertisementSenators who had been among those pressing the F.T.C. to take a harder line criticized the agency’s action. “The disclosure requirements do more to deceive than fully inform, and worse, could protect unscrupulous dealers,’’ Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement.The ruling, in the form of a settlement with G.M. and the two car chains over their advertising claims, will be in effect for 20 years. The F.T.C. also proposed a similar settlement with several other car retailers it had been investigating. The settlements could set a buyer-beware precedent for other used-car dealers to adopt, consumer groups warned.“It is the worst thing the F.T.C. has ever done on any issue because it is allowing false advertising,” Rosemary Shahan, the president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, one of the groups that had been lobbying for months against the settlement.The F.T.C.’s action, which the agency defended as providing consumers with enough information to make informed purchases, is at odds with the position of the country’s main auto safety regulator, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has called for used-car dealers to fix items subject to a recall before selling a vehicle. But the safety regulator does not have the authority to order such fixes.Safety advocates said the ruling was particularly troubling at a time when the N.H.T.S.A. is struggling with problems including the recall of 42 million vehicles for the exploding Takata airbags that have also been linked more than 180 injuries.Because of the huge number of vehicles with recalled Takata airbags, it will take several years to fix them all. Under the F.T.C. decision, it would not be necessary to for a dealer to tell consumers that the vehicle they are considering has a Takata bag, said Michael Brooks, the acting director of The Center for Auto Safety.
                In 2015, the F.T.C. said G.M. ads claimed that “certified” used vehicles had been inspected. But the F.T.C. found vehicles still had unrepaired safety problems.            Friday’s action settled a F.T.C. complaint from June 2015 that G.M. had engaged in unfair or deceptive practices with ads on its website saying that its “certified” used vehicles had been carefully inspected and any mechanical problems had been fixed.AdvertisementBut the F.T.C. said that some of those vehicles still had unrepaired safety problems serious enough that they had been recalled, and G.M. was at fault for not providing that information. Those recalls included a G.M. ignition-switch defect linked to at least 124 deaths.Also included in the settlement were two dealership chains that faced complaints and settlements similar to General Motors: Jim Koons Management Company, which sells vehicles in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware; and Lithia Motors, which is based in Medford, Ore., and sells vehicles in 17 states.In settling the case, G.M., Koons and Lithia neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, but agreed that in the future such ads would include a prominent disclosure that the vehicle “may be subject to recalls for safety issues that have not been repaired” along with information on how to check for recalls.While the consent order does not require G.M. to carry out recall repairs on its certified used vehicles, the automaker is already fixing them and has no plans to change, spokesman James Cain said. That was also the case when the F.T.C. began its inquiry, he said.The automaker’s website for used certified vehicles currently has a statement saying: “GM requires dealers to complete all safety recalls. However, because even the best processes can break down, we encourage you to check the recall status of any vehicle.”The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has an online database in which consumers can enter a vehicle’s identification number to see if it is subject to any safety recalls.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

                Defective airbags made by Takata have been tied to 12 deaths and more than 180 injuries in the United States alone. The ensuing recall — the largest in automotive history — has turned out to be messy, confusing and frustrating for car owners.            The F.T.C. had reached a preliminary settlement in January with G.M. and the two used-car chains. But the deal was subject to a period of public comments, during which many consumer groups and some lawmakers had pressed the agency to require fuller disclosure by those who sell used cars.Norman I. Silber, a professor of consumer law at Hofstra University, said it was hard to understand how the F.T.C. could approve the order and say “they have lived up to their consumer protection mandate.”But F.T.C. officials defended the disclosure requirement as adequate. The agency does not have the authority to require dealers to fix recalled vehicles, said Malini Mithal, the F.T.C.’s acting associate director for the Division of Financial Practices.“We absolutely share concerns about significant public safety risks posed by recalls in the used-car market,” she said.The F.T.C. also announced it had reached similar preliminary settlements with three other dealer chains — CarMax, Asbury Automotive Group and the West-Herr Automotive Group — over the agency’s claim that consumers were not adequately warned about outstanding recalls on used vehicles.The dealerships did not admit any wrongdoing. The agency will accept public comments for 30 days before deciding whether to make the settlements final.AdvertisementBut Ms. Shahan at the Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety said the F.T.C. could and should have told G.M. and the dealers they cannot indicate a vehicle is safe if a recall is pending.When the preliminary settlement was announced, it immediately triggered criticism from five Democratic senators and about 20 consumer groups, including Consumers Union, The Center for Auto Safety and the Consumer Federation of America.In July, the senators wrote to F.T.C. chairwoman Edith Ramirez arguing that the proposed settlements “would establish an anti-consumer, anti-safety precedent with far-reaching policy implications.” Besides Mr. Blumenthal, they were Charles E. Schumer of New York; Edward J. Markey or Massachusetts; Bill Nelson of Florida, and Richard Durbin of Illinois.Ms. Ramirez responded, defending the consent order as benefiting consumers. “The proposed orders directly address the deceptive conduct identified in the complaints” and impose requirements to prevent such misconduct in the future, she said at the time.An F.T.C. spokesman said on Friday that Ms. Ramirez was not available to comment.The F.T.C.’s approval of the consent order is likely to raise legal questions nationwide on whether a dealer can make false statements about a vehicle’s safety or condition and evade responsibility because there is also a disclaimer that those statements “may” not be true, said Bernard Brown, a consumer protection lawyer in Kansas City, Mo.“It will muddy the waters on everything from personal injury to fraud,” he said. “The settlement is totally outrageous, astonishing, and contradictory to the F.T.C.’s charter and protection of consumers.”Danielle Ivory and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on December 17, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Certified’ Used Cars Do Not Need Safety Recalls Fixed, F.T.C.
