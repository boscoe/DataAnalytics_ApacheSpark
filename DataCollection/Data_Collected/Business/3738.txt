A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region’s manufacturing.That weakness is most likely related to softening economies in Europe and Asia as well as a strong dollar, which are expected to result in a moderation in growth in the first quarter.“A lot of the demand has been domestically sourced, so a lot of export-oriented industries are facing headwinds given a stronger dollar and weaker global growth backdrop,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. “I would expect a pickup given how quickly employment is growing and just how solid the U.S. recovery has been thus far.”Last week, the four-week moving average of jobless claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,500 to 283,250.Advertisement
