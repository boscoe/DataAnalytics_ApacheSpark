Spotify has struck a deal with the electronic music site Beatport that will bring it new music and video content, the latest step in its intensifying competition with Apple over streaming music.Spotify’s deal with Beatport, announced on Wednesday, will also bring programming from the dozens of music festivals around the world operated by Beatport’s parent company, SFX Entertainment, which was founded three years ago by the media mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman to capitalize on the growing popularity of dance music.Beatport, founded 11 years ago, began as an iTunes-like download service specializing in dance music, with many of its songs available nowhere else online. It has since expanded into an all-purpose media hub for the dance world, with news and information about D.J.s. This year, it introduced its own streaming service.
                Different music streaming services have varying costs, platforms and catalog sizes. See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.            SFX bought Beatport in early 2013 for $58.6 million. SFX went public in October 2013, but this year the company announced a plan to go private again through a buyout offer from Mr. Sillerman that would value the company at $774 million. A “go shop” period to solicit alternative offers ends on Friday.Spotify, which has 75 million users around the world, including 20 million paying subscribers, also this week introduced personalized playlists for its listeners. Apple’s new music service, Apple Music, was introduced last month. In addition to a subscription streaming service to compete with Spotify, Rhapsody, Google Play and others, Apple Music emphasizes its “curated” playlists.Also on Wednesday, Rhapsody, the service that pioneered streaming music by subscription in 2001, announced that it had reached three million paying customers around the world.A version of this article appears in print on July 23, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Deal With Dance Music Hub Will Expand Spotify’s Content.
