WASHINGTON — American consumers borrowed at a modest pace in February for the second consecutive month, evidence of continuing caution that has kept a lid on spending this year.Borrowing rose at a 5.8 percent annual rate, the Federal Reserve said Thursday, just above the 5 percent pace in January.A separate report showed that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting that the labor market continued to strengthen despite tepid economic growth.

The use of revolving credit, mostly credit cards, rose just 3.7 percent after slipping in January. Total outstanding credit increased $17.2 billion, to $3.57 trillion.AdvertisementAmericans barely increased their spending in February for the third straight month. More hiring and cheaper gas may have also reduced some consumers’ need for credit cards.AdvertisementEconomists are closely watching consumers’ behavior, as their spending has emerged as a main source of growth this year. Weak overseas economies have weighed on American exports, widening the trade deficit. Business investment has been lackluster and manufacturing is struggling in the face of a stronger dollar, which has made American goods more expensive overseas.Yet so far this year, consumers have been reluctant to increase spending. That has prompted many economists to lower their estimates for growth in the first three months of this year to an annual rate of 1 percent or below. That would follow a tepid 1.4 percent growth rate in the final three months of last year.

Analysts expect consumer spending to pick up later this year and help the economy. Businesses have continued to hire at a solid pace, suggesting they remain generally confident about the economy’s outlook.The borrowing figures include student and auto loans, as well as credit card debt. They exclude housing-related debt like mortgages and home equity lines of credit.The Labor Department said on Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 267,000 for the week ended April 2.Economists had forecast claims slipping to 270,000 in the latest week. Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 57 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.“The persistently low level of claims should provide some reassurance that the economy is growing,” said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.A version of this list appears in print on April 8, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Modest Rise in Consumer Borrowing.
