The case appears to be the first challenge to the Interior Department’s plan to withdraw 10 million acres from future mining claims, prohibit oil and gas drilling near breeding grounds and impose new reviews on grazing permits. Those steps were a key factor in the Interior Department’s decision not to grant Endangered Species Act protection to the species. But critics from the mining, oil and gas industries contend that the restrictions are just as onerous and will stifle economic development. The plaintiffs are Elko and Eureka Counties, Quantum Minerals and Western Exploration. The suit names Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and other federal agencies and officials as defendants.
