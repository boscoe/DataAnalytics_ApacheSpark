The investors, Hagan Capital Group and Silver Creek Capital Partners, said their proposal included $90 million of new equity and a $40 million term loan, and supports a business plan from Mr. Charney, who was fired as chief in December 2014. The enterprise value of the offer exceeds the valuation of $180 million to $270 million “publicly stated by the debtor in its disclosure statement,” the investors said. The proposal could lead to a showdown at a Jan. 20 hearing in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. American Apparel must convince the judge, Brendan L. Shannon, that its plan is fair and feasible, and Mr. Charney has objected. Advertisement
