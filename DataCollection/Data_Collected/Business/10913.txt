Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, campaigned for a secondary listing in Milan to reaffirm the carmaker’s links with Italy. “Ferrari’s listing is a symbol of an Italy that is fearless and sees globalization as an opportunity,” Mr. Renzi said on Monday. Sergio Marchionne, Fiat’s chief executive and Ferrari’s chairman, vowed to keep production in Italy and said the carmaker would start to distribute generous dividends. The company was unlikely to grow through acquisitions that would dilute the brand, he said, but could expand via other highly selective items with the prancing horse logo. In spinning off Ferrari, Mr. Marchionne has sought to position it as a luxury goods business. But New York-listed Ferrari shares are down 20 percent since their Wall Street debut in October, and some analysts questioned whether the small-volume, capital-intensive carmaker will be able to sustain the high valuations.
