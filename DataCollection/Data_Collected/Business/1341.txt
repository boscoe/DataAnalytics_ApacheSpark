Some websites are advertising that they will register a drone for a $25 fee. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that drone owners should “think twice” before using a registration company, since the process will be no more difficult than registering any other product. The government plans to require that most owners register drones so that they can be identified if they crash or are caught flying where they should not. A government task force is expected to release plans this week on registration. Advertisement
