AdvertisementSupported byBy Matthew GoldsteinHackers are going local in their efforts to steal credit card information from United States customers, hitting small businesses with as much frequency as retail giants.Take Eataly, the operator of more than two dozen upscale food halls in New York, Chicago, Italy, Japan and elsewhere. The company disclosed last month that the systems at its store in the Flatiron district of Manhattan had been breached. The hackers unleashed malicious software into its payment processing system that enabled them to potentially steal customer credit card information for several months of this year.Eataly said the breach affected only customers of its Flatiron food hall, which has seven Italian restaurants and sells imported Italian chocolate for $46 a pound, as well as other items. But the company said the hacking had taken a toll.“The disruption to our business, the extent of unanticipated costs and expenses, and the unwelcome frustration and concern caused upon our customers have all been, and continue to be, significant,” Eataly said in a statement.The breach at Eataly reflects a trend that security consultants and law enforcement officials have seen for several years: Bent on stealing credit card information, hackers are going after small retailers and restaurants as well as big national chains like Target and Home Depot.The smaller businesses, which tend to have less sophisticated security defenses, are more vulnerable to hackers seeking to exploit weak spots in the point-of-sale systems used by companies to process credit card payments.One frustration for the authorities investigating these cases is that many attacks against small companies go unreported because the businesses are not publicly traded and are bound by fewer disclosure requirements.Still, half of 675 small businesses surveyed by the National Small Business Association reported being victims of hackers’ attacks last year, up from 44 percent in 2013. And of those companies that reported being hacked last year, 68 percent said they had been victimized at least twice.Many small businesses are lulled into thinking they are immune from hacking because they are too small to draw any attention, security consultants say.“Cybercrime traditionally has been more a scattershot approach,” said Nart Villeneuve, a threat intelligence analyst with the security firm FireEye. “But they are going after large and small retailers and restaurants and point-of-sale companies that service them.”Ari Baranoff, an assistant special agent in charge with the Secret Service’s criminal investigative division, said that for the most part the hackers going after retailers, both large and small, are “Russian-speaking cybercriminals” who are not in the United States.Mr. Baranoff said that the Secret Service, which oversees the investigation of many point-of-sale attacks, had found that some criminals test out new disruptive malware programs on smaller businesses before unleashing them on bigger companies.A recent investigation by FireEye found instances of criminals who operated on the Internet sending thousands of malicious emails to small, lesser-known businesses in the United States — hotels, restaurants, pizza shops, cafes — all in an apparent attempt to get unsuspecting employees at those business to download an intrusive malware program that can compromise the logon credentials for point-of-sale systems.The FireEye investigation found that while many hackers are carrying out such “spear phishing” email campaigns broadly, some are aimed specifically at smaller retailers.The hackers’ interest in small businesses illustrates their insatiable appetite for credit card numbers that can either be used by the hackers themselves or sold to others on black-market websites.In May, Harbortouch, a vendor of point-of-sale systems based in Allentown, Pa., disclosed that some of its merchants had been victims of a malware attack that might have compromised customer credit card information.Nate Hirshberg, a company spokesman, said the “malware targeted a small percentage of individual merchant locations that we support.” He added that “the threat was eliminated almost two months ago” and that Harbortouch’s network itself was never affected.The number and identities of Harbortouch’s affected merchant customers were not disclosed. Eataly is not a Harbortouch customer.An indication of hacking’s growing threat to small businesses can be seen in increased interest in insurance covering these attacks. Beazley Group, which underwrites such policies, say it has had an increase of roughly 62 percent in requests for quotes for such coverage from businesses with less than $35 million in revenues.And the attacks come with a growing price tag. Last year, the average hacking cost the typical small business $20,752, up from $8,600 in 2013, said the National Small Business Association.In the case of Eataly, the company has taken a number of steps to notify its customers and investigate the incident. On May 1, the company bought a legal notice in The New York Times to alert its customers of the breach — along with posting the same notice on its website. Eataly also hired the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright and a forensic investigator to review the incident. And as retail giants often do when they are hacked, Eataly is offering complimentary identity protection services for any customers who were affected.Alex Trautman, a lawyer with Norton Rose Fulbright, said Eataly was cooperating with law enforcement agencies investigating the matter. He declined to say who might be responsible for the breach. So far, the investigation has ruled out current or former employees of Eataly as being responsible, Mr. Trautman said.Eataly, in its statement, said the “learning curve has been quite steep.” But it noted that it was now better prepared to deal with any future attempt to hack into its system.Advertisement
