Its parent, Restaurant Brands International, said on Monday that sales rose 7.9 percent at Burger King sites in the United States and Canada in the second quarter, a gain it attributed to Chicken Fries and other factors. Chicken Fries — long, deep-fried pieces of chicken — were dropped in 2012, but brought back in response to customer demand. That campaign was so successful the fries returned again this year. Restaurant Brands International earned $9.6 million, or 5 cents a share. That was down from $75.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. The decline was attributable largely to preferred share dividends. Not including one-time items, the company earned 30 cents a share. That was above the 24 cents a share analysts expected, according to FactSet. Total revenue rose to $1.04 billion, also topping the $1.02 billion Wall Street expected. Advertisement
