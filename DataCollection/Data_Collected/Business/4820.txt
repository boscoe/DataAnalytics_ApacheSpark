Top prosecutors in several states accused an Oregon company on Tuesday of overcharging consumers for subscriptions to newspapers, magazines and other periodicals.The Orbital Publishing Group, a periodical subscription service, is facing accusations that it charged consumers as much as twice the cost of a subscription and pocketed the difference, according to state attorneys general in New York, Oregon, Minnesota, Missouri and Texas.Many of the victims appeared to be elderly, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.A lawyer for Orbital, David P. Lennon, said in an email that he had not yet reviewed the complaint.The lawsuit accused Orbital and a group of interconnected companies of sending millions of unauthorized solicitations to consumers around the country.AdvertisementThe lawsuit contends that, after the companies received customers’ orders for magazines or newspapers, the companies bought subscriptions through the publishers for the normal retail value and kept the difference in price.AdvertisementFor example, the companies were accused of charging $599.95 instead of $413 for a year’s subscription to The Wall Street Journal, and 30 to 40 percent more than the actual price of a subscription to The New York Times, according to the complaint.Customers found it nearly impossible to cancel their subscriptions or to reach anyone through customer service, according to the lawsuit, which said that since 2010, thousands of consumer complaints had been lodged against the companies with the Federal Trade Commission and other regulatory agencies.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Schneiderman, attorney general of New York.Customers have sued The Times and The Journal, according to the complaint, mistakenly thinking that both publications had authorized the solicitations. Dow Jones, on behalf of The Journal, provided $2.6 million worth of free one-year subscriptions to customers who proved they had been overcharged, the complaint said.“After years of working with law enforcement to raise awareness of this issue, we’re pleased to see the attorneys general take action, and we’re hopeful that today’s suits mark the end of this industrywide scam,” said Mark H. Jackson, the general counsel for Dow Jones, in a statement provided by Colleen Schwartz, a spokeswoman.The Times published an ad and sent letters to subscribers to warn them of a potential fraud, according to a spokeswoman, Eileen Murphy. Ms. Murphy said The Times had begun processing “valid refund claims.”Orbital has been accused of misleading consumers before. The Wisconsin attorney general filed an enforcement action last year that accused the company of selling fake magazine subscriptions, or subscriptions to magazines it could not actually offer.A version of this article appears in print on April 1, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Subscription Service Is Accused of Overcharging Consumers for Periodicals.
