Wall Street’s self-regulator plans to take a closer look at electronic trading in bonds this year, as part of an expanded review of fixed-income markets.The regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, known as Finra, announced the initiative on Tuesday in a letter outlining its priorities for 2015. Among the plans, Finra said it would start conducting examinations of firms that offer electronic bond trading, as well as “books and records, supervision and order execution practices” in bonds.Richard G. Ketchum, Finra’s chief executive, said the review was motivated by broad changes in the bond market. Partly in response to new regulations, bond dealers are holding less inventory, pushing more trading to various intermediaries, he said.“I do think this is very much a year of fixed-income,” Mr. Ketchum said in an interview. “Sales practices and best execution in fixed-income are going to be a huge focus.”In its review of bond trading, Finra said it would scrutinize whether firms are able to ensure they are achieving the best price for their customers. The regulator also said it was examining situations where bond intermediaries may have failed to disclose information about how they are charging customers.When the regulator announced its priorities last year, it said it would seek to increase the visibility of its BrokerCheck website, which lets investors see whether a broker has a clean record.That proposal has not yet been enacted. Finra is revising it, with plans to resubmit it to the Securities and Exchange Commission for approval.
