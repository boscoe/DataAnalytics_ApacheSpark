LONDON — Top executives and managers at banks operating in Britain could have their bonuses clawed back for up to 10 years after any finding of misconduct under new rules announced by British regulators on Tuesday.The move extends a seven-year clawback period that one regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, introduced for so-called variable pay last year as part of tougher accountability rules. The new rules announced by the authority, which is part of the Bank of England, and by another regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, are the latest effort by financial regulators in Europe to hold bankers accountable for improper actions that could play a role in precipitating future financial upheavals.Under the new framework, senior managers, risk managers and others at banks will also be asked to defer more of their variable pay for a longer period, making it easier for regulators and financial institutions to recover bonuses if misconduct is uncovered.Martin Wheatley, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said the new rules were part of a wider set of initiatives to be introduced this summer in an effort to “embed an accountable culture” in the City of London, the traditional banking and financial services hub.Advertisement“This is a crucial step to rebuild public trust in financial services and allows firms and regulators to build long-term decision-making and effective risk management into people’s pay packets,” Mr. Wheatley said in a news release.AdvertisementThe new rules apply to banks, building societies and investment firms regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority, including British units of United States banks and other financial firms based outside Europe. They will apply to bonuses awarded for performance periods beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2016.The changes come as financial regulators across Europe have sought to restrict pay and have ramped up regulations in recent years to discourage the unnecessary taking of risks by banks and their employees in pursuit of profit.European rules limit bankers’ bonuses to the equivalent of their annual salaries, or to two times their base salaries if the company’s shareholders approve it.Some European nations have gone even further on pay. Dutch lawmakers enacted a cap on bonuses this year for employees in the banking, insurance and other finance sectors that limits variable pay to 20 percent of their fixed salaries. The Netherlands has also banned bonuses for executives at bailed-out banks.A dispute over the pay of some senior executives at ABN Amro also forced the Dutch government to delay a decision on an initial public offering of the state-owned bank this year. The government later announced plans in May to proceed with an I.P.O., possibly in the fourth quarter.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Those moves effectively bolster fixed wages to allow more flexibility for bigger bonuses.In addition to the 10-year clawback period on bonuses, the new rules in Britain mean that senior managers will have to defer their variable pay for seven years after a bonus is accrued, while risk managers at regulated firms will have to do so for five years. Staff members who engage in activities that could have a “material impact” on the firm will have to defer their bonuses for three to five years.The rules will also prohibit bonuses for nonexecutive directors and for the managers of companies that are receiving financial support from the government.Advertisement“Effective financial regulation involves creating appropriate incentives to encourage individuals to take greater responsibility for their actions,” said Andrew Bailey, the Prudential Regulation Authority’s chief executive and a deputy governor at the Bank of England.“Our intention is that people in positions of responsibility are rewarded for behavior which fosters a culture of effective risk management and thus promotes the safety and soundness of individual institutions,” he added.The regulators also said they would study further whether to require that buyout awards for executives who change companies be deferred or held in a form that makes it easier for a previous employer to reclaim them if misconduct is uncovered.A version of this article appears in print on June 24, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Britain Toughens the Rules for Banking Bonuses.
