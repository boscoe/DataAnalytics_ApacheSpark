When you really want something, you tend to pay up for it.Take Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose tentative $104 billion deal for SABMiller represents a premium of nearly 50 percent to where SABMiller shares were trading before reports of a possible deal merged in mid-September. That is about double the average premium this year, according to Dealogic.That Anheuser-Busch InBev would offer such a rich premium underscores how valuable it views a combination with SABMiller. The companies, the two biggest brewers in the world, have been grappling with slowing beer shipments and competition from upstart craft brewers, and they think profit margins could be improved if they could join forces.Of the 35 largest deals where the target is publicly traded, the premium in the deal for SABMiller ranks No. 9, according to data collated by Dealogic. While the biggest transactions tended to have large premiums – such as the 86 percent premium Warner-Lambert received when Pfizer acquired it – SABMiller’s premium bucked the trend seen more broadly this year.The average premium this year among deals of more than $1 billion is 26 percent, which is the lowest since 2007, the data showed.SABMiller previously rejected three of offers from Anheuser-Busch InBev that it deemed too low.The two companies have now asked British regulators for permission to extend a takeover deadline under British law until Oct. 28 to continue their merger talks.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
