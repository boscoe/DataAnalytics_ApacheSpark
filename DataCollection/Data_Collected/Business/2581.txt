KesslerDETROIT — Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric car company Tesla, urged traditional automakers to step up their efforts at electrifying automobiles, saying that with gasoline prices hovering in the $2-a-gallon range, high fuel prices can no longer be expected to drive consumers toward alternatives.Mr. Musk, speaking at a conference sponsored by the Automotive News here on Tuesday, said that electric motors were “fundamentally better” than gasoline engines in terms of efficiency, and that if major automakers throw their weight behind electrification, they “won’t regret making that decision.” “It’s only going to go there if the big car companies make risky decisions” to support electric vehicles, Mr. Musk said, adding that he was less than impressed with the efforts of the major carmakers, with the exception of Nissan, with its Leaf, and General Motors for its new Volt and the concept car Bolt.He said when he originally founded Tesla, he gave the company only a 10 percent chance of success. On Tuesday, Mr. Musk affirmed Tesla’s sales target of reaching 500,000 annually by the end of the decade.But in a frank admission by the generally upbeat chief executive, Mr. Musk acknowledged sales in China had hit turbulence at the end of 2014.“China was unexpectedly weak in the fourth quarter,” he said, attributing the problem to what he described as a “misperception about charging” that the company was taking steps to correct.The problem, Mr. Musk said, involved Chinese apartment dwellers who thought they would be unable to gain access to electrical outlets for charging.A Tesla spokeswoman later said that the company planned to ease the concerns of Chinese buyers by building supercharger stations in Chinese cities.Advertisement
