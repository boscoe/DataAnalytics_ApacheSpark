The important category that tracks business investment plans — nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft — slipped 0.3 percent. Orders for electronic products plunged 4 percent, while demand in the volatile aircraft category tailed off sharply.

The stronger dollar has increased the cost of United States-made goods for overseas customers, cutting into sales in Europe and parts of Asia. At the same time, cheaper oil prices have slashed demand from energy firms for pipelines and equipment. The spring rebound from a frigid winter that shut down assembly lines has yet to blossom.Orders for durable goods, which are items expected to last at least three years, declined 1 percent in April. Demand for nondurable goods, which include food and clothing, increased just 0.2 percent.Still, there are signs that manufacturers are adjusting in response to the changing conditions. Energy firms responded quickly to oil prices’ dipping below $60 a barrel, such that the brunt of the layoffs and canceled orders has largely been processed by the economy. Demand for oil and natural gas field machinery increased slightly in April. The dollar has also steadied itself against the euro, rising slightly since March."We do think that we are moving past the weakest period” for energy-related cutbacks from manufacturers, said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
