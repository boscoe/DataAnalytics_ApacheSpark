AdvertisementSupported byBy Diane CardwellAs SolarCity, the rooftop solar system provider, has rapidly expanded its reach over the last few years, its executives have pushed hard against the utility industry, criticizing it as a hidebound monopoly standing in the way of change.Now, SolarCity officials are trying a different tactic: moving into that business themselves.On Monday, company executives announced a program aimed at cities, remote communities, campuses and military bases under which they will design and operate small, independent power networks called microgrids. While the move will not turn the company into, say, Con Edison overnight, it represents a step in that direction.“The microgrid product is basically a culmination of all of the technology that SolarCity’s been developing over the past eight years,” said Peter Rive, the company’s co-founder and chief technical officer, calling it “a template that can be scaled up to basically be the next-generation grid.”He said that he and other executives were convinced “that if there was a utility that was particularly aggressive, they could manage their distribution system far more efficiently through distributed resources.” Eventually, he said, they asked themselves, “Well, why don’t we actually run the grid?”SolarCity is announcing its new undertaking as the rooftop solar industry is realigning, with upstart companies seeking to create partnerships and expand their roles while more established companies from energy and other spheres seek to capture a piece of the expanding solar market.Those shifts are part of the natural evolution of a maturing industry, but also are a result of the approach of December 2016, when an important solar investment tax credit will decline to 10 percent from 30 percent, executives and analysts said.“The pressure of the step-down from 30 to 10 percent I think is driving people to say, ‘I need to get big, and I need to be the best at what I do so that I am a winner if the tax credit is not extended at 30 percent,’ ” said Nat Kreamer, chief executive of Clean Power Finance, which provides software and financial services for solar projects and businesses. The looming shift, he said, is driving “people to figure out how to make sure their cost structure competes in a post-2016 world.”At the same time, SolarCity is hoping to capitalize on the fact that state regulators are encouraging utilities to add more decentralized sources of energy — like rooftop solar installations — to get away from large conventional power plants and to better handle power failures in severe storms. The New York State Public Service Commission, for instance, recently released a plan to overhaul its regulations in part to encourage the growth of distributed energy sources, including microgrids.SolarCity’s package of products and services would allow localities to create independent electricity networks using a combination of rooftop solar power, batteries, backup generators and demand management, Mr. Rive said.The systems, for which the company plans to offer financing, could work in remote communities without robust infrastructure or in established ones in partnership with conventional utilities. During power failures, the systems could function separately, whether to keep emergency and community centers running or to fill basic household power needs — or both — depending on the design.“We achieve a lot of resilience in the microgrid by virtue of the fact that it has, at its roots, hundreds of distributed resources rather than just a handful of centralized ones,” Mr. Rive said. “This architecture is the best blueprint for how one should rebuild the electricity delivery infrastructure.”Advertisement
