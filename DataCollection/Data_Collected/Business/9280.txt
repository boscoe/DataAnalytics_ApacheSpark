Julius Baer said that it was “fully cooperating” with the inquiry.The Swiss competition commission is the latest regulator to examine the process behind how precious metals are priced.The authorities in the United States and the European Commission are conducting their own inquiries into the trading of gold and other precious metals, coming after investigations into the manipulation of foreign currency markets that resulted in billions of dollars in fines.The Swiss commission announced its own formal investigation into the foreign exchange market last year.Barclays, HSBC and UBS are among banks that had previously disclosed that they were facing inquiries regarding precious-metals trading.As part of a settlement with United States authorities in the foreign currency trading investigation in May, UBS said it would not face a criminal charge over currency misconduct, or related to investigations by American authorities into its precious-metals division.UBS at the time agreed to pay $500 million in fines to resolve inquiries into its role in the manipulation of currency markets and benchmark interest rates. UBS also said it would receive conditional immunity from prosecution by the United States Justice Department’s antitrust division, reflecting its role as the firm that first reported potential misconduct to the department.A spokesman for the Swiss commission said on Monday that the regulator had been in contact with other authorities, including the Justice Department and the European Commission.As part of a separate inquiry into foreign currency trading last year, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or Finma, said in November that it had found repeated instances of so-called front-running in the silver fix orders of one client at UBS.UBS, in that instance, was ordered to pay 134 million Swiss francs, or about $137 million, as part of a settlement.Advertisement
