July is when it agreed to a $4.8 billion sale to the telecommunications giant Verizon. The latest assault on Yahoo’s reputation gives Verizon extra firepower to snag a better deal.Yahoo, led by Marissa Mayer, said in a regulatory filing late Wednesday that it had investigated the data thief’s claims and found it could not substantiate them. The time frame, though, only raises questions.Yahoo agreed to sell its advertising and search units to Verizon on July 25. At the time, the company noted that there were no material adverse effects on its businesses, although certain language in the merger agreement addresses security breaches and unauthorized access and gives Verizon a degree of protection.Then in September, Yahoo dropped a bombshell by admitting that certain information was stolen from at least 500 million user accounts in 2014. That prompted Marni M. Walden, Verizon’s president of innovation and new business, to emphasize that the company would “protect our shareholders and our investors, so we’re not going to jump off a cliff blindly.”Now, it turns out that Yahoo discovered the huge breach after it started an investigation to delve into the previously undisclosed July allegation.Yahoo stands by its statement that the breach of 500 million accounts has not had a material effect on its business. That said, the company has “subsequently incurred expenses” related to the hacking and it expects to incur “investigatory, legal, and other expenses” associated with it in the foreseeable future, the filing points out without providing a figure.Both sides are already negotiating to try to determine how much this has hurt Yahoo’s value, never mind its ever-dwindling reputation. The revelation on Wednesday should give Verizon an additional cudgel at the negotiating table.Jennifer Saba is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews.
