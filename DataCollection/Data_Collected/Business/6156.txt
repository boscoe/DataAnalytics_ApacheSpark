But prices in many smaller cities, which account for around 60 percent of national sales, continued to fall.“We expect home sales to see year-on-year growth in the second half of the year, and home prices in third- and fourth-tier cities to also bottom out in the second half,” said Nomura chief China economist Zhao Yang.“But the big impact for the overall economy is from property investment, where I don’t expect a quick rebound in growth” he said. “That’s why we forecast China will miss its 7 percent target” for 2015).Mr. Zhao said real estate investment, which comprises around 20 percent of China’s gross domestic product, may grow less than 5 percent this year, compared with 10.5 percent in 2014, knocking 1 percentage point off economic growth.Data last week showed home sales measured by floor area rebounded 7.7 percent in April from a year ago, the first growth since November 2013.But real estate investment growth continued to slow in the first four months of 2015 to the lowest since May 2009 as new construction slumped, impacting demand for everything from steel and cement to appliances and furniture.Still, government measures seem to be slowing enticing some buyers back into the market. Mortgages rose 2.1 percent in the period from January through April from a year earlier. China relaxed tax rules and downpayment requirements on second homes in late March. Earlier this month, the central bank cut interest rates for the third time since November to lower companies’ borrowing costs and stimulate loan demand.“The price data are signaling an obvious bottoming out,” said Rosealea Yao, an economist with Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, adding the secondary market was leading with a 1.1 percent annualized monthly rebound.The National Bureau of Statistics data showed new home prices in Beijing rose 0.7 percent in April from March, improving from a 0.3 percent rise in March from February, while Shanghai prices were up 0.6 percent after being flat in the previous month.Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, said in a statement that prices are still polarized between first and lower-tier cities, with an average 1 percent monthly rise in the first-tier and 0.1 percent fall and 0.3 percent fall in the second and third-tier, respectively.Of the 70 major cities the bureau monitors, 48 posted a monthly decline, down from March’s 50.
