Your Money columnist Ron Lieber answered questions about preparing your personal finances for 2017. Read the full transcript below.
Hello readers! We’re thrilled to chat with you today about getting your finances in order for 2017. Ron Lieber, The Times’s personal finance columnist, is here fielding your questions. Should you change your 401(k) contributions in the new year? What new apps should you be using? Will your money situation change once President-elect Donald Trump takes office? Submit your questions below!In the meantime, catch up on Ron’s latest column about learning to figure out how much we really need.We can get an idea of what to us feels like enough money by getting a baseline on spending and quantity, then homing in on quality.The New York TimesHi everyone, Ron here. I’m the personal finance columnist around here, but my real beat is beating the system. Let’s get started.The other night I was out to dinner with a friend, and it happened to come up that she has tens of thousands in savings. I choked on my wine, a glass of which cost 8 percent of my net worth. (I had two.) Hey, I thought I was doing OK—I could spend money on the night before my paycheck!! What should I do? How bad is it to be 28 without any savings at all? Totally depends on who you are and what your goals are. Trust fund? Probably ok. Public school teacher who won’t leave the profession ever, and you have a fat pension plan? You’ll have a decent retirement. But if it’s all on you, you should get started soon. The sooner you start and the more you save soon, the more time that money has to earn interest on the interest. Look up a couple of compound interest graphs and pages to get a sense of how the math can really help you here. Good luck!I am 23 and just graduated college last year (2015). My current financial savings plan is to turn down offers to open a 401(k) from my employer and instead dedicate my savings to a HYS account until I have enough cash on hand to weather a 3 month job loss or other emergency. Then, I will open a 401(k) and begin saving for retirement. Does this seem like a reasonable plan? It should be noted that my employer does not contribute to employee 401(k) accounts, so I’m not losing any money by not opening an account now. It just keeps nagging at me because I feel I should be saving for retirement, but I also feel its more important in the short term to have money set aside for emergencies. Thanks!D. Adams – great that you’re thinking this through. Do you have parental units who might offer a short-term loan if there was an emergency? Most single 23 year-olds tend not to have too many. Maybe that’s a good backstop. I like the habit-forming nature of starting to siphon off money for a 401k early/immediately, even if there is no match. But it sounds like you are so on top of things that all is going to work fine in the long run.My employer doesn’t offer 401k as we’re a small business. They’ve been telling us they’ll try to offer it upcoming year, but I highly doubt it. What is the best way to save for retirement even without 401k? What is the right amount of compensation to ask for since we don’t have 401k (to make up for the lack of benefit)? Is it simply best to leave if they don’t offer it soon? Thanks. Concerned, sounds like you’re already lobbying, and you should be. Good for you. Show this around the office. This is just not that hard for an employer anymore, especially if they’re not matching.    Photo        Tailoring Retirement Plans to Companies With a Handful of Workers  Only 14 percent of businesses with 100 or fewer employees sponsor a retirement plan, a market gap that is luring new players into the field.   The New York Times    Only 14 percent of businesses with 100 or fewer employees sponsor a retirement plan, a market gap that is luring new players into the field.The New York TimesMeanwhile, set up a Roth IRA if your income isn’t too high – that money will come out tax-free in retirement if the current rules hold. I don’t know if I’d ask for additional comp – instead, I might offer to head the committee to get a plan started asap.I’m a HUGE fan of Mint. It’s helped me get my credit score in good enough shape to secure a loan for my first house. What other financial apps are worth trying out?Annemarie – I like the Trim service, which gets you out of the habit of letting useless subscriptions ride.    Photo        Cutting Off Those Recurring Charges You Forgot About  A new service promises to ferret out those monthly billings for services you forgot you signed up for, and put a stop to them.   The New York Times    A new service promises to ferret out those monthly billings for services you forgot you signed up for, and put a stop to them.The New York TimesThis is cool too, for people having trouble saving. https://www.acorns.com/Is it smarter to pay down all my debt ( student loans, back taxes to the tune of $40k total) first and then contribute to my 401k at work and save cash instead for emgerncies? James – depends on the interest rate of the debt. If you’ve got a match on your savings at work, it’s hard to turn that down. As I said above, I wouldn’t worry as much about emergencies, especially if you’ve got family who could help you out temporarily if need be.4% of my income goes into a 401k. I know I’m supposed to probably be putting away more but it gets too tight. In fact, sometimes I have to dip into my other savings (which is mostly invested in mutual funds). But that seems like I’m putting money into a 401k which is invested in mutual funds to the detriment of my brokerage account which is…invested in mutual funds. I know the answer to this is “spend less money” but let’s assume that that isn’t going to happen because I have a lease and other baked in commitments etc…Should I stop contributing to my 401k?Ben D. we’re talking apples and oranges here. The 401k may get a match, which is huge. Even if it doesn’t, money is going in there pre-tax and growing tax-free until you take it out in retirement. Good stuff. Brokerage accounts are taxable generally, which means you’ll pay capital gains taxes on any winnings. So I’d favor the 401k to the extent you can. Plus it’s harder to pull the money out because of the penalty/taxes you’ll pay, so it enforces some discipline.Who regulates the Automated Clearing House and how do they justify causing overdrafts by holding transfers hostage over four day weekends when they are an automated service dealing in 0s and 1s?Rachael, I love this so much, more than you know. I have a really fun stunt planned around this soon in the column, watch for it. It drives me freaking bananas, especially now that I have a second kid and things are tight. I don’t actually know, but given that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulates the banks in many ways, I’d complain there. Each complaint really does get the attention of people with power at these banks. Please let me know what happens! lieber @ nytimes dot com. Also, Schwab helps itself to 4 days to clear transfers into my checking account. Sometimes I call and howl in protest and they just press a button to clear it. So they have that power too.I’m a pretty passive investor. Matching 401k at work and a pair of indexed mutual funds with automatic contributions deposited from my paystub monthly. I want to explore taking a slightly more active interest in my money management for the new year. Where do I start?Randall, why? You are not smarter than the market, and neither am I. Stick with index or similar funds and just keep shoveling money at it, more if you can or earn more. Dare to be dull, as Allan Roth puts it. Investing should be boring.What changes to monetary policy might you expect from a Trump presidency that we should account for in our personal financial planning?Chris in MN, I have no idea. I try to stay out of the prediction game generally, since real professionals get it wrong much of the time. And with this president (even with a theoretically united Congress), who can really say what might happen? Control what you can and keep on keeping on.This next year I’m going to get my finances in order. For real this time. I have 6 credit cards that are all carying various balances about 50%. How do I start digging out?Carolyn in VA, most people do it this way: Figure out which one has the highest rate and pay that first. It will feel good. Others like to pay the smallest balance first, since wiping stuff clean quickly helps them feel better about the situation. Lots of stuff on the web on this – Google credit card payoff snowball. Dave Ramsey has done good stuff on this too.I have a small 5-figure savings account, but want to make more off of it.  Is the best option an ETF, a high interest account, what?  I am recently engaged so may need that cash in the next 18 months, but aren’t sure how to stay liquid without wasting the potential of a decent chunk of change.Luke, if you need that money soon or there’s even a chance you might, I’d keep it in the savings account. I know the return sucks, but imagine if we get some insane market surprise and the value falls 20% and then you need the money. How will that feel? If you can live with that loss, then maybe put some of it in an indexed exchange traded fund that tracks all stocks in the world to keep your costs low.If you’re headed towards financial idependance at ages 40-45 and might need income from investments, would maxing out your 401k be your primary investment account? Michael, the problem with using the 401k primarily is that I’m pretty sure you can’t start yanking from there until you hit a certain age. You’ll need something else to tide you over until you can get 401k access.Do you think stocks will tank in 2017?Bobby – I have no idea and neither does anyone else. Don’t listen to the talking heads on TV who insist otherwise.How much should I be saving? I am 31. I am reworking my budget for the new year and looking for a framework for saving and spending. Currently putting 10% into retirement savings and I have both an IRA and 401K working for me towards that. I have manageable living expenses and like to travel. Where should I start?Nadia, you’re doing great. Depends on whether you have shorter-term goals – a down payment, wedding, a parent to help. But save as much as you reasonably can, as our Carl Richards puts it.  http://thecollegeinvestor.com/16337/the-one-page-financial-plan-review-and-interview-with-carl-richards/My husband and I have contributed the maximum allowed in our 401k accounts for the past two years.  He receives an employer match.  We have been focusing on paying off our student debt for the past several years, but are ready to start saving outside of our employer retirement accounts this year.  Where should we put our money?  Should we consider a back door Roth IRA conversion?C in Atlanta – not quite sure what you’re referring to re the Roth, but it depends on shorter term goals. Is there stuff you’re saving for that will come sooner than retirement? Then you’re looking at a taxable account, where you should look hard at super low cost indexed investments, either mutual funds or index funds.I have been contributing ~12% to a 401(k) for the past 7 years and maxing out a roth IRA for a couple years before that. Last year we bought a home and this year we had a bunch of unexpected expenses and are looking at a long while before we can dig ourselves out from this. That is unless I reduce my contributions to 8% (that qualifies for the 6% match my company offers). I’m 37 now and do you think it would be prudent to cut back my savings to make sure I stay out of debt? Will I still be on track for a comfortable retirement?Overwhelmed, I’d need to know more to say for sure. Are you in debt from those expenses? What’s the interest? When do you want to retire? How do you define comfortable? So much about money is really about feelings – feelings about risk and security and our goals for our 60s and 70s. But it sounds like you’re not going to give up that match, which is great. Going to 8% means you’re effectively getting 14% of your salary in the bank. That’s a healthy savings rate, so congrats.How many months of Emergency Fund should I have saved away? What type of account or investment should it be in?John Curl, three months is generally fine for most folks (though are you sicker than most? In a vulnerable industry? Irregular/commissioned income?). You want it safe, so a high-yield saving account (yeah, earns just 1% for now, I know) is what you want.I was chatting with a friend on Thanksgiving who said his financial analyst suggested that the economy is in for a major turn down/ recession. I am 59 Y/O with about $500K in my 401K and own real estate in NYC. I was going to retire this next year, but am concerned that the markets are getting ready to take a big hit. Is he wrong?Jerry, I don’t know and neither does that so-called analyst. Keep in mind that you won’t need that $500k all at once if you retire. And you’ve got your rental income working for you. Even if your 500 falls to 400, you could just temporarily spend less until the market recovers. Or take on some freelance income to avoid selling when markets are down. If you can’t sleep at night, maybe put a bit less in stocks, but I would not go to cash. More here from the last big downturn from my column:       Switching to Cash May Feel Safe, but Risks Remain  So let’s dispense with the first part straightaway. The right time to move out of stocks was a year or so ago, before various stock indexes the world over fell by one-third or more. If you missed that opportunity, you’re hardly alone. But if you sell now, you’ll be locking in your losses.   The New York Times    So let’s dispense with the first part straightaway. The right time to move out of stocks was a year or so ago, before various stock indexes the world over fell by one-third or more. If you missed that opportunity, you’re hardly alone. But if you sell now, you’ll be locking in your losses.The New York TimesI’ve maxed my 401k contributions. Should extra savings go to a Roth IRA (with only a few more years until my family is allowed to donate the max) or should I just open a roboadvisor account and put extra savings there? T money, yeah, hit that Roth until you can’t anymore. You’re going to be so happy to have that tax-free money come retirement time.Do you think it’s worth the money to hire a real live accountant, as opposed to using Turbo Tax like programs? My husband is freelance, I have a job with benefits, but also make freelance income. We’re never sure if we’re getting all the savings/making right choices, but when we have used a real accountant, they just seem to plug in the numbers for us. Rachael tough call – also, how much do you value the time you spend futzing with Turbotax? One possibility – ask an accountant (right now, before they get busy in early 2017) to read your last Turbotax return. Pay that person for an hour of time and see what they can find. Some people might even do that for free.Is it better to have cash in savings that could cover any debt – credit card, student loans, mortgage – or is it better to have no debt a very little savings?JR, depends on what kind of savings (emergency? 401k?) and what kind of debt (mortgage at 3.5%? credit cards at 18%). And also feelings: how much does debt keep you up at night?I have enough saved up that I’m looking to start investing, but feel a bit lost as to what strategy to adopt in my investments, especially considering the upheaval that could result from the Presidential transition in 2017. What would be your recommendation for where to start off with investing, considering the uncertain political climate?Lena, check out services like Betterment and Wealthfront and see if that works for you. They help you figure out what the goal is for the money (using soon? using later?) and how much risk you can live with. Then, they buy baskets of stocks that cover entire market segments, like all US stocks or international bonds. This way, you don’t have to be smart enough to find the right single stock or two. You’re not that smart, and neither am I and neither is Betterment or Wealthfront and they’ve built businesses around that.Is it better to pay off student loan debt at 6.5% interest (grrr) before starting to save or is it better to throw some money at the debt and some money towards saving. I’m 36, have 40k student loan debt…but would like to be able to buy a small place or have a child before I’m 40.Fiona, this is always a tough one. If you have no retirement savings or pension at all, I’d get started there asap, especially if that student loan debt comes with a tax deduction for the payments. The thing is, you’re getting a 6.5% “return” by retiring debt that costs that much. It’s hard to earn that much consistently with investments in an account where you’ll pay capital gains on any earnings. But I know it would feel good to get some money saved for a baby or apartment. (Also, can I just say that buying a little Brooklyn place years ago was one of the best moves I ever made. If I’d been smarter, I would have bought two. So it’s good to think on this…)Hi Ron. I’m currently an MBA student with income that would put me in the 0% capital gains bracket and a number investments with a low cost basis. Given that the market is at an all time high, how should investors weigh potential volatility under the Trump administration against tax reform? While timing the market is near impossible, would you be long on US equities?PG no predictions here, but I like your thinking. Do you know about wash sales and those rules? If not, look it up. You might boost your basis now while the getting is good income-wise.Hi Ron, I have a foreclosure on my credit report.  Its affecting me financially.  Is there anything I can do to get rid of this.  The Lender was very sneaky and foreclosed on me while negotiating a short sale.Seth, that sucks, I’m sorry it happened to you. You can, I think, ask the credit bureaus to put a note of explanation in the file, but it doesn’t change the way that the credit scoring formulas will read that foreclosure. If you’re looking for another loan now, sometimes credit unions where you can talk to real people may be able to work with you. And each month that goes by gets you closer to when that thing will fall off… Good luck.Between investments such as mutual funds or stocks vs. real estate, which would be the better option for a HH (young couple without children) earning annual $180K?A Reader, I’d need to know much more about you to say. But I wouldn’t think about real estate as an investment unless you’re REITS or similar funds. If you’re thinking about a home this way, don’t – they don’t earn all that much anyway after inflation, costs, taxes. If it’s rental real estate, think really (really really) hard about how much time it’s going to take – or how much you’re going to have to turn over to Airbnb and/or an onsite property manager. It’s tough stuff.I am in my mid-60s, with a 3% mortgage that I can afford to pay off.  Do you recommend doing so?K – nah, leave it be. As long as you don’t mind the risk of being in stocks with the money you’d use to pay that off, then any even moderately risky portfolio is likely to do better than 3% (especially if you’re getting a tax break on any interest) over the longish haul. Seems like a better bet to me.When I left jobs previously, I didn’t roll over old 401k accounts and now have two separate accounts open with previous employers. They’re not growing obviously b/c I can’t contribute. I currently don’t have a 401k.  I do have a Roth account. Is it better to roll them over to current Roth account or wait until I have a new 401k to roll over to? I am nearing 40 and am starting to really think about retirement and plan for it - hpe it’s not too late. Thanks!  Jamie, not too late at all. I’m a big believer in having everything in one place – it just make planning and picking your investments easier, and keeping track of what you have. Re the Roth switch, you’ll want to explore any/all tax implications – and what kind of money you’d need to pay those taxes.I need to rebalance my 401k plan and other investments to reflect my age and retirement plans.  What are some good on line resources for me to use?Larry, I’ve got your risk tolerance questionnaire right here:    Photo        As Stocks Gyrate, It’s Time to Measure Your Risk Tolerance  Knowing how much risk you can stomach will help you respond to market turmoil. Two companies have provided readers with tests to measure their risk.   The New York Times    Knowing how much risk you can stomach will help you respond to market turmoil. Two companies have provided readers with tests to measure their risk.The New York TimesI’m considering investing more into the stock market, but is it smart to do so when it’s at an all time high? Angela, how long is your time horizon and what’s the money for? Need to know that first. But we really have no idea what the short-term prospects are for stocks. Long-term, they are a bet on capitalism continuing to pay out to the people who make it possible – that’s stockholders, and they’ve gotten about 10% back annually historically. No guarantee that will continue, but I don’t have a better idea/bet and neither does anyone else that I’ve seen.My 401k will be maxed out for 2017 and my income will likely exceed the normal limits for deductible IRAs limits.  Can I make a “backdoor” contribution for 2017 to my existing Roth account by first making a nondeductible IRA contribution and then converting the contribution into my Roth account?  And is this a good idea?Paul, ok, second backdoor Roth question – I’ve never written about it, but those of you who want to geek out on this stuff (and I mean that in the best possible way), you should hang out at the Bogleheads forum – they are passionate index fund investors and smart and helpful. Here’s the wiki on the backdoor Roth conversion. https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/BackdoorRothIRAIf I have $10,000 rolling over from a 401K for a job I left, should I purchase stock directly and avoid mutual fund fees by mirroring investments of reputable funds? Ellen D – that will be hard to do on your own. Just find a cheap index fund or ETF from Vanguard or Fidelity and keep it simple.I’m lucky to have inherited a substantial amount of stocks. Much of it was originally purchased 30 and even 40 years ago, and the inheritance skipped a generation so the values did not reset. As a result I’m loath to sell the stuff, which has appreciated hugely over the decades and would face massive taxes. Should I continue to sit on it and use other assets for cash if possible, hoping to pass it on to my own kids? Or bite the bullet, sell and invest in a more up-to-date portfolio?Lucky, great question. You should really talk to a qualified tax professional. One other thing: Giving that stock away probably gets you a fat tax deduction and solves the capital gains problem. What about funding all of your charitable income for the rest of your life with at least a chunk of that money?I am going to lose the deduction for my adult child next year, I have maxed out 401K, IRA and just refinanced my mortgage so less interest what can I do to save on taxesEric, are you using any/all tax-advantaged savings accounts at work? An HSA for a high-deductible health plan (if you buy your own plan you can do this too). Flexible spending account for medical expenses? Transport account? I dump five figures of money into these things each year and being in NY, save a ton on taxes. Also, charitable giving – those rules/deductions could change a bit under the new regime.Hello Ron, Can you please tell what sources of information should one be reading to understand how investments may be affected - in US and outside US? I understand the prudent path of Index fund investing and leaving investments alone (except may be once a year rebalancing). but it would be nice to be informed of what events - withn US or outside US - may affect one’s investments in a big manner. Thanks.Ravi, to be honest, I don’t read too much of that stuff. It’s speculative. And even people who get it right may not be right the next time. So I’m just not reading much in that area, though I get that some people find it intellectually intersting.Should one wait for the market to drop before investing in an index fund for the long term?Nate – drop to what? How would you know when the right time is to get in? And how would you feel if it doesn’t drop again for a while?I just started my first “real” job and will be putting money away into a Roth IRA, and ideally I would just track an index and forget about it. However, I have a small (okay, possibly large) ethical qualm with profiting from fossil fuels. Is there an index you could recommend that tracks essentially everything but those companies?Thomas, Vanguard has an index fund like this: https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0213&FundIntExt=INTCan’t remember where they are on fossil fuels. But stay tuned, I’ve been wanting to columnize on this for a while.I am 32 and have held a full time job for the last 3 years. I’ve been living paycheck to paycheck pretty much and haven’t saved any money, but am determined to get my finances on track. What is the best way to approach saving? I have no emergency fund, no retirement fund (my job doesn’t have 401k), and only few hundred in savings… Please help. B – the best trick is automation – siphon off a little bit each week or month and get in the habit. Drop it into a savings account to get an emergency fund going and a Roth IRA to start some retirement investing. Google online savings accounts to shop for those. You can open a simple Roth at Vanguard or Fidelity or E-Trade, just check the fees to see if there are any for smaller accounts.Do you have any tips on how to slow down credit card spending? Lucy, you could put it in the freezer or cut it up! And switch to debit.If you were three years from retirement, would you put money in the stock market now?Rebecca, how old are you? Here’s hoping you’ll live another 30-40 years. So unless you have a ton of money saved, you’ll probably need to be in some stocks at least. Remember, if the markets tank tomorrow, you’ll have a quarter century or more for them to recover. Even in 2009, they came back relatively quickly.My Company got bought out and now I work at a the new company. I have two 401ks(one old, one new) now and have been told I can’t roll them together. They keep saying they are waiting on IRS, it has been over 2 years since the acquisition. What is really going on here?John, the IRS works in mysterious ways. I’d roll the money over into an IRA anyway, because then you can invest in whatever you want – including funds with rock-bottom costs.What options do you suggest for community and local investing?  Some CDFI’s offer 2% or more.Brian, wish there was more of this. Check out the Slow Money movement.My wife and I both have great public school pensions. We are 40ish. We have a very strong amount of cash. We also have 403B, IRSs, etc. Where would you be comfortable investing with this excess cash?Ben, that’s great. I’d take on a fair bit of risk with that money if you think your pension plan is solid – after all, that money is essentially guaranteed, so consider that your safe money.Do you have any recommendations for books or online courses to understand basic finance (budgeting, investing, financial planning) for a new college graduate?Liv, re those books – love Beth Kobliner’s Get a Financial Life (get the newly updated one, not the old one), Ramit Sethi’s I will Teach You to be Rich and Zac Bissonnette’s book on how to be richer, smarter and better looking than your parents.I’m 34, got a good job in a growing field (tech/design). I’ve got $51,00 in student loans, but I’d also like to contribute more to my IRA and savings accounts. Should I be directing my earnings towards paying off my loans OR split resources between the loans and retirement (if that day ever comes…)KP (and others) column on student loan payments vs savings:    Photo        High Cost to Focusing on Student Loans Over Saving  Taking on debt to pay for college leads many young people to forgo saving money for years — potentially sacrificing hundreds of thousands of dollars.   The New York Times    Taking on debt to pay for college leads many young people to forgo saving money for years — potentially sacrificing hundreds of thousands of dollars.The New York TimesMy wife and I have some money (~150k) set aside for a down payment on a home (we also save for retirement and the kids education), but no specific plans to buy due to indecision about where to settle and questions about jobs. So we could be renting for another 5 years, or another 2. Probably not 10 but who knows. Where should we park this money? Right now it’s roughly evenly split between money market, short term bond, and a conservative allocation balanced funds. Kevin, re that down payment money, I think you have it right mostly, but I’d be a bit wary of bonds right now given what may happen to interest rates. I might toss 10-20% of that in a very broad global stock fund even.I am 67, still working, no pension, and plan to retire on a combination of social security, work-based TIAA account, and a 403b.  I am concerned about the impact of the new administration on my limited resources.  The market has been good for the last few weeks, and bonds low, but what is the outlook for modest growth and safety? P Golden, I worry more uncertainty around Medicare than I do about your investments. Medicaid too, and potential nursing home coverage. I wish I had any idea what is going to happen, but spend as much time as you can exercising and taking care of yourself…What do you think Trump’s personal incoMe tax plan will look like and what will it look like after it goes through Congress.Tim in Towson, his plan is different in some important ways than Paul Ryan’s. Will Trump be a pushover here? Will they concede a fair bit to the Dems and or the projections on how deficits will grow? I wouldn’t dare predict, but my guess is that something will happen and change sooner rather than later.Gang – this was so much fun, hope it was useful. We’ll do it again (and again).
