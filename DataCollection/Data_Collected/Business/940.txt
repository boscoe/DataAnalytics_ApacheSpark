Now, WeWork is seeking a new type of capital: another $750 million in debt.The company is getting ready to close a credit facility this week, people briefed on the negotiations said. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank are participating, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Credit facilities often signal a transition point for companies, as they move from an early stage to one that looks more like a public company with a more nuanced capital structure.Representatives from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, as did those from WeWork.For WeWork, as is the case with many start-ups, there is no such thing as too much capital, and the $750 million could help WeWork expand its real estate and the services it offers to its customers. WeWork leases more than two million square feet and then rents that space to individuals, companies or nonprofit organizations.The company offers work space for as little as $45 a month or dedicated offices and desks for $350 a month, with an office environment that can include kegs of beer and neon signs.An article by The Information, citing a fund-raising document, reported that WeWork had been locking itself into leases that were longer than typical. In exchange, WeWork obtains benefits such as free rent for the first year, indicating those costs could skyrocket in the future, the article said.WeWork has raised five rounds of equity capital from venture firms (Benchmark), mutual funds (Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and Wellington Management), banks (Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan) and even an endowment (Harvard Management). Its most recent round closed in June.Advertisement
