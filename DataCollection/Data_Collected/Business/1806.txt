The F.T.C. previously blocked plans by the two to merge in 1997.A merger would eliminate competition and lead to higher prices and reduced quality, the agency said on Monday.The suit seeks a temporary restraining order to hold up the deal pending an administrative trial scheduled to begin in May. The Canadian Competition Bureau also filed Monday to block the transaction.Advertisement
