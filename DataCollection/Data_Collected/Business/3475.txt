LONDON – Aena, the Spanish airport operator, and Elis, the French provider of rental uniforms and linens, surged in their stock market debuts on Wednesday as investor appetite for initial public offerings remained strong in Europe.The pace for initial public offerings this year is off to its best start since the financial crisis, with more than a dozen companies making their debuts in the recent weeks, including four on Friday.And it follows a particularly strong year for I.P.O.s in Europe in 2014, with 239 offerings raising $66.2 billion in gross proceeds, according to data from Thomson Reuters.Aena, which operates 46 airports in Spain and owns a stake in Luton Airport near London, raised more than $4 billion for the Spanish government after it priced its stock at 58 euros a share, or about $65.64, on Tuesday afternoon. The pricing was at the top end of its expected range.Shares of Aena jumped 16 percent, to €67.42, in midday trading in Madrid on Wednesday.José Manuel Vargas Gomez says that the Spanish airport operator is very much linked to “the evolution of the domestic economy.”The company was valued at €8.7 billion after the Spanish government sold 66.8 million shares in Aena, representing 44.6 percent of the company. In a news release, Aena said the government could sell as much as a 49 percent stake if an overallotment of shares is fully exercised. The sale to institutional investors, as well as retail investors in Spain, came after the government debated a potential divestiture of Aena for years and delayed an offering last fall.Elis, the French provider of rental uniforms, table and bed linens, and carpets to businesses, raised €700 million after pricing its stock at €13 a share on Tuesday. The pricing was at the low end of its expected range.Shares of Elis rose 3 percent, to €13.39, in midday trading in Paris on Wednesday.An entity controlled by the French buyout company Eurazeo sold €47.4 million of its holdings in the offering, representing about 3.2 percent of Elis’s share capital after the I.P.O., Eurazeo said in a news release.Eurazeo acquired Elis from the French private equity firm PAI Partners in October 2007 in a deal that valued the company at about €2.28 billion. After the I.P.O., Eurazeo will hold a 34.7 percent stake in Elis if an overallotment of shares is fully exercised.
