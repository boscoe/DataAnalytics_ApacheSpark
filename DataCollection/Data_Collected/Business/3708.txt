Housing starts fell last month, while manufacturing output edged higher.“The reports paint a disappointing picture on the U.S. recovery, with the housing starts report in particular reinforcing the narrative that the housing recovery might be in a spot of bother,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for final demand fell 0.8 percent, the biggest drop since the revamped series started in November 2009, after dipping 0.2 percent in December. It was the third straight month of decline in the index.In the 12 months through January, producer prices were unchanged, the weakest year-on-year reading since records started in November 2010, after rising 1.1 percent in December.Economists had forecast the index’s declining only 0.4 percent last month and gaining 0.3 percent from a year ago.Lower energy prices, against the backdrop of softer global demand and increased shale production in the United States, as well as a strengthening dollar, are reducing domestic inflation pressures.“The weak P.P.I. report adds further evidence of building disinflationary pressures in the U.S., not only in headline prices, but also in core prices,” Mr. Mulraine said.While the Federal Reserve, which has a 2 percent inflation target, views the tame price environment as transitory, signs that the energy-driven weakness is leaking to core inflation could cause discomfort among some policy makers.An important measure of underlying producer price pressures, which excludes food, energy and trade services, fell a record 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in December.Most economists expect the central bank to start raising interest rates in June, citing rapidly tightening labor market conditions. The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.The American economy still faces difficulties created by a stronger dollar and weaker overseas markets, which weigh on exporters. Manufacturing output rose a modest 0.2 percent in January and was flat in December, the Fed said in a separate report.Wholesale energy prices tumbled a record 10.3 percent in January after sliding 6.2 percent in December. It was the seventh straight month of declines.Food prices fell 1.1 percent, the largest decline since April 2013, after falling 0.1 percent the previous month. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins, rose 0.5 percent after a similar gain in December.The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.07 million units in January.Despite the decline, which was driven by a fall in groundbreaking for single-family projects, housing starts remained above the million-unit mark for a fifth straight month. Compared with January last year, groundbreaking was up 18.7 percent.Sluggish wage growth and a shortage of homes on the market stymied housing last year, even as the broader economy was accelerating.But a turnaround in housing is expected this year as a rapidly tightening labor market pushes up wages and encourages more young adults to move from parents’ homes.In January, permits for future home construction dipped 0.7 percent to an annual pace of 1.05 million units. Permits have been above a million-unit pace since July.Single-family permits fell 3.1 percent last month, while multifamily permits rebounded 3.6 percent.Advertisement
