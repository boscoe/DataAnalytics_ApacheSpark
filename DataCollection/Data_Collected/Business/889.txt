But the outlook for future growth improved, and fears waned that a slowing Chinese economy would send the American economy into a tailspin.Strong corporate earnings in some sectors, including health care and telecommunications, also helped propel the market all the way back to positive for the year after a swoon in August and a rocky September.Paul Christopher, global market strategist for Wells Fargo, said investors were gaining confidence in the United States economy and were more hopeful that China would not suffer an abrupt downturn.“We could see investors finally put that correction in August and those fears permanently behind them,” he said.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose for five consecutive weeks and ended October up 8.3 percent, or 159 points, its best month since October 2011. The next-best month was March 2000, the height of the dot-com bubble, when it rose 132 points.Sam Stovall, United States equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said a very strong October usually meant the market would not make big gains in November and December, muting the so-called Santa Claus rally. He does expect stocks to keep rising for the rest of this year, though, and make gains in 2016, lifted by overall economic growth and improving corporate earnings.He said that for equities, 2016 “has a chance of being a good year but not a great year.”He added, “Investors will continue to buy the dips until the prospect of either a U.S. or global recession spooks investors again.”On Friday, stocks were largely flat through much of the day, venturing into positive territory in the early afternoon before ending lower. The S.&P. 500 lost 10.05 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,079.36. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 92.26 points, or 0.5 percent, to 17,663.54. The Nasdaq slid 20.53 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,053.75. The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer spending inched up just 0.1 percent in September, partly because consumers were spending less on gasoline as energy prices fell. The gain was the smallest in eight months. The department said on Thursday that economic growth slowed sharply in the summer, although most economists said they thought the economy had improved this month.Mr. Christopher of Wells Fargo said the November and December United States unemployment reports would help set the course of the markets for the rest of this year, along with the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policies.The busiest week of third-quarter earnings wrapped up on Friday with big moves for a spate of companies. The professional networking service LinkedIn surpassed estimates and its stock gained $23.87, or 11 percent, to $240.87. The drug maker AbbVie surged as sales of its anti-inflammatory Humira, the biggest-selling drug in the world, continued to rise. AbbVie rose $5.45, or 10.1 percent, to $59.55. Chevron, the second-largest oil company in the world, said that its profit fell almost two-thirds and that it would eliminate around 10 percent of its jobs, or up to 7,000 positions. It is also slashing capital and exploration spending as it deals with lower oil prices that are cutting deeply into profit. Its shares fell just over 1 percent.Valeant Pharmaceuticals suffered more losses on Friday as controversy around its drug prices and sales practices climbed. The stock sank $17.73, or 15.9 percent, to $93.77. On Thursday, the two largest pharmacy benefits management companies in the United States, CVS and Express Scripts, cut ties with Philidor, a Valeant-linked specialty pharmacy that has been criticized as a “phantom pharmacy” used to artificially bolster Valeant’s sales. On Friday, Valeant said Philidor had informed it that it would shut down as soon as possible.Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.15 percent.
