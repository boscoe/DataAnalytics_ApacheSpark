Medical care and housing costs also retreated in March after strong increases in the previous two months.The price index fell 0.2 percent in February. In the 12 months through March, it increased 0.9 percent; in February, it advanced 1 percent.The so-called core C.P.I., which strips out food and energy costs, inched up 0.1 percent last month after two strong monthly readings. The increase in March in the core price index was the smallest since August and followed a 0.3 percent rise in February.In the 12 months through March, the core index rose 2.2 percent after gaining 2.3 percent in the 12 months through February.In a second report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 253,000 for the week ended April 9. That matched the level for early March, which was the lowest since November 1973.Jobless claims have now been below 300,000, a threshold associated with healthy labor market conditions, for 58 weeks, the longest stretch since 1973.The labor market has shown strength even though recent reports on trade, wholesale inventories, retail sales and business spending suggested that economic growth almost halted in the first quarter after posting a 1.4 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2015.Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.2 percent after plunging 13 percent in February. Food prices fell 0.2 percent, and the cost of food consumed at home posted its largest decline since April 2009.The core C.P.I. was restrained by housing and medical costs, as well as apparel. Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence increased 0.2 percent after increasing 0.3 percent in February.Medical care costs slowed their rapid ascent, gaining only 0.1 percent after shooting up 0.5 percent in February. Apparel prices fell 1.1 percent in March, in contrast to the previous month’s 1.6 percent advance.Advertisement
