One of the three Howard Johnson’s restaurants still in business has been sold and will close after a nearly 60-year run in Lake Placid, N.Y. Mike Butler said his family-run restaurant was bought by local restaurant owners who plan to move their own business to the property after the Howard Johnson’s closes on Tuesday. Mr. Butler’s father, Ron, opened the restaurant with the chain’s signature orange roof 58 years ago. Two other HoJos still operate. One is attached to a hotel in Bangor, Me., and the other is in Lake George, a tourist destination 60 miles south of Lake Placid.A version of this brief appears in print on March 26, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Howard Johnson’s Restaurant, One of Three Left, Will Close .
