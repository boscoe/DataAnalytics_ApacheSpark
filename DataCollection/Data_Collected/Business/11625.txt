Lazard on Tuesday reported a 29 percent decline in adjusted net income in the fourth quarter as market volatility hampered its asset-management business, while fewer deals closed, which affected the firm’s advisory revenue.The firm worked on six of the largest transactions of 2015, yet only one of them, Heinz’s combination with Kraft Foods, has closed, with the rest still pending. Investment banks typically generate most of their fee revenue from a deal once it has been completed.Lazard’s adjusted net income slumped 29 percent, to $123 million, in the fourth quarter from the quarter a year ago. Adjusted operating revenue from the financial advisory side of the business declined 8 percent, to $331 million, the company announced on Tuesday.As the largest of the independent investment banks, Lazard is known as a bellwether for deal activity as a whole. The company was tapped to advise on some of the enormous deals that made 2015 the biggest year ever in terms of transaction volume, with $4.7 trillion in deals consummated, according to Thomson Reuters data.AdvertisementLazard worked on some of the hallmark ones, including Dow Chemical’s merger with DuPont, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s acquisition of SABMiller and Dell’s acquisition of EMC, which could contribute to the firm’s revenue in 2016.“It’s the best market position I can remember Lazard having,” Kenneth M. Jacobs, who has worked at Lazard for 28 years and now serves as chief executive, said in a phone interview. “All in all, we’re pretty happy with the advisory business of last year, even with the downtick.”On the asset management side, revenue slumped 8 percent, to $261 million, in the fourth quarter. Lazard’s average assets under management in the quarter was $188 billion, or 4 percent below the equivalent metric during the same period in 2014.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            “On the asset side, it’s just math,” Mr. Jacobs said. “Markets were off pretty significantly from where they were in 2014.”For the full year, Lazard reported operating revenue of $2.38 billion, a record amount. During the fourth quarter, the firm posted $598 million in operating revenue, which surpassed analysts’ estimates of $574.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Even though the fourth quarter showed steep declines in adjusted net income, for the full year, Lazard generated $480 million, up 12 percent from 2014.Advertisement“This is a business which has existed over many cycles, many types of market environments, and the key thing here is to slowly and steadily improve everything you do,” Mr. Jacobs said. “We just continue to make a steady level of improvements.”A version of this article appears in print on February 3, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Net Income Slides at Lazard, a Bellwether for Deal Activity .
