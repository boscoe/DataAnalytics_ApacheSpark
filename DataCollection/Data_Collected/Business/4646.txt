Stocks dropped Tuesday as investors weighed company news and the latest report on consumer prices. Signs that the dollar could resume its recent surge also seemed to make investors nervous.Homebuilders bucked the trend, gaining after sales of new U.S. homes in February climbed to their fastest pace in seven years.The stock market has drifted lower for two straight days. The declines follow a rally last week in the market when Federal Reserve policy makers surprised investors by suggesting they were in no hurry to raise interest rates. Those low rates have helped power a six-year bull run for stocks.“We’re in something of a holding pattern as markets continue to digest all that’s going on,” said Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors.AdvertisementThe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 12.92 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,091.50 Tuesday.

The Nasdaq fell 16.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,994.73.AdvertisementStocks were little changed throughout the morning before drifting lower in the afternoon.

The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in February, the Labor Department said Tuesday, after dropping 0.7 percent the previous month.Utilities declined the most of the 10 industry sectors in the S.&P. 500. They are the worst performing group in the index this year, falling 5.8 percent. These stocks typically pay dividends that are high relative to their companies’ share prices.They were in demand last year, when government bond yields fell, and investors wanted them for the level of income they were no longer able to get from bonds. Now, they are less popular because many investors think that the Fed will raise interest rates later this year. That means that the yield on safer bonds should eventually rise, making utilities less attractive by comparison.“Your real vulnerability is on the stock side,” said Jeff Lancaster, a principal of San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough. “You can lose more money in a day in stocks than you can in a bad year on bonds.”AdvertisementAmong individual stocks, mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell after it said it would slash its quarterly dividend by 84 percent due to falling commodity prices.
