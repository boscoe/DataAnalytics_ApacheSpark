Singer to block a shareholders’ vote later this month on the proposed merger between two subsidiaries of Samsung.The planned merger is widely seen as a crucial piece in a father-to-son succession taking place in the family that controls Samsung, South Korea’s leading family-controlled conglomerate, or chaebol, through a complex web of cross-shareholdings among its subsidiaries.Mr. Singer’s hedge fund, Elliott Associates, tried to disrupt the transfer of power by filing an injunction request with the Seoul Central District Court last month. The fund asked the court to stop the Samsung C&T Corporation, a construction and engineering company, from holding a shareholders’ meeting on July 17 to vote on an $8 billion takeover bid from another Samsung affiliate, Cheil Industries.Elliott, which owns 7.12 percent of Samsung C&T, claimed that the all-stock merger offer from Cheil, whose businesses include fashion and theme parks, grossly undervalued Samsung C&T’s shares. It said the merger would serve the family that controls the Samsung conglomerate but not the best interests of the rest of the shareholders.On Wednesday, the Seoul court sided with Samsung, saying that the merger offer, which valued each Samsung C&T stock at 35 percent of a Cheil share, followed a domestic law under which merger ratios are calculated through a predetermined formula based on recent stock prices.“There is no data proving that Samsung C&T management is promoting the merger only for the interests of the Samsung Group chairman’s family and in disregard of the interests of its shareholders,” the court said in its ruling.Samsung C&T share prices have increased since the merger plan was announced in May, undermining Elliott’s argument that the merger did not benefit Samsung C&T shareholders, the court added.Samsung C&T said in a statement: “The court’s ruling validates the fairness of the merger ratio and affirms that legal requirements have been met. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders.”Following the court’s decision, Elliott was expected to resume its battle with the conglomerate at the Samsung C&T shareholders’ meeting this month. “We will continue to seek to prevent the proposed merger from being consummated,” Elliott said in a statement, “and we urge all Samsung C&T shareholders to do the same.”The proposed deal needs the support of at least two-thirds of votes at the meeting, and both sides have been working to rally shareholders to their sides. South Korea’s National Pension Service, which owns a 10.2 percent stake in Samsung C&T, has not indicated how it is going to vote.The court decision removed one hurdle from what Samsung has called an efficiency drive that requires realigning its affiliates through mergers and spinoffs. The moves have drawn intense attention as possible signals of the succession plans in the conglomerate.Lee Kun-hee, whose official title is chairman of Samsung Electronics, the conglomerate’s flagship company, remains incapacitated following a heart attack in May last year. His son, Lee Jae-yong, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics, is widely seen as taking control of a business empire that generates the equivalent of a quarter of South Korea’s gross domestic product.If approved at the shareholders’ meeting, the merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil will help solidify the son’s leadership position by consolidating stakes in key companies like Samsung Electronics into a de facto holding company controlled by his family.Lee Jae-yong controls less than 1 percent of Samsung Electronics, the global maker of smartphones, computer memory chips and home appliances. But his family is expected to own a combined 30.4 percent, including a 16.5 percent stake by Mr. Lee, in the company that would be created through the proposed merger. That company would hold 4.1 percent of Samsung Electronics, as well as a 19.3 percent stake in Samsung Life Insurance, which owns 7.2 percent of Samsung Electronics. Lee Jae-yong replaced his father in May as chairman of two Samsung foundations that hold stakes in Samsung Life.Another key element of his plan to consolidate control is to inherit many of his father’s stakes in Samsung Electronics, and in Samsung affiliates that also hold stakes, although he will have to pay billions of dollars in inheritance taxes.Elliott’s challenge represented a rare case of shareholder activism in South Korea. South Koreans have often accused the managers of chaebol of serving as vassals of the controlling families at the expense of minority shareholders. But South Koreans have also been wary of foreign hedge funds, which have been accused of making quick profits through corporate raids and then exiting the country.Advertisement
