For Ralph Morse, it was a serendipitous visit to Jones Beach with friends the weekend after he had been hired as a darkroom assistant for a photo sales agency. His impromptu shots of a father bouncing his child in the air so captivated his boss that Mr. Morse was promoted to full-time photographer.Unlike Zelig or Forrest Gump, Mr. Morse rarely posed himself. But for nearly 50 years as a photojournalist, his vivid, inventively captured images of major world events peppered the glossy pages of Life and Time magazines. He was behind the camera for the D-Day landings, the German surrender the next year, Babe Ruth’s farewell at Yankee Stadium and the groundwork on the earliest American missions into space. He shadowed the Mercury 7 team so doggedly that John Glenn called him the “eighth astronaut.”Some photographers are famous for a single image. Mr. Morse’s classics could fill entire albums: a soldier’s skull on a destroyed Japanese tank in World War II, an injured United States Army medic being fitted for a plaster cast in France, Audrey Hepburn snuggling with her Oscar for “Roman Holiday,” Jackie Robinson stealing home, Albert Einstein’s messy office at Princeton on the day he died, in 1955. (Mr. Morse bribed his way into the professor’s lair with a fifth of Scotch.)“If Life could afford only one photographer,” George P. Hunt, who was the magazine’s managing editor in the 1960s, once said, “it would have to be Ralph Morse.”AdvertisementMr. Morse died at 97 on Dec. 7 at his home in Delray Beach, Fla., his longtime companion, Barbara Ohlstein, said. His death was not widely reported at the time.Ralph Theodore Morse was born in the Bronx on Oct. 23, 1917, and grew up there. He worked on the student newspaper at DeWitt Clinton High School. Borrowing a camera from his aunt, he photographed his friends and charged them 15 cents apiece for prints.After enrolling in photography courses at City College of New York, he pounded the pavement looking for jobs for photographers, going door to door, alphabetically, armed with a Manhattan business telephone directory. He was hired by the Paul Parker Studio. Six months later, he left for Harper’s Bazaar, but he quit the magazine after three days because, he said later, he found fashion shoots vapid.AdvertisementHe was soon hired by Pix, an agency that handled celebrated Life magazine photographers, including Robert Capa, whose brother, Cornell, a fellow darkroom assistant, had lent Mr. Morse a 35-millimeter Contax camera for the Jones Beach shoot. Another Life standout, Alfred Eisenstaedt, encouraged the magazine to give Mr. Morse his first assignment when he was just 19: photographing the playwright Thornton Wilder appearing as the stage manager in his play “Our Town.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He landed in the third wave with the Marines at Guadalcanal, clung to a life preserver for six hours after the Navy cruiser he was traveling on was torpedoed, and snared the grisly image of a severed Japanese soldier’s head propped up on a tank, as either a warning or a war trophy.“It’s a great picture to show people who want to go to war what war is like,” he said.He applied his ingenuity not only to the content of his pictures but also to how he made them. As the first civilian to fly on a Strategic Air Command B-47 “globe-trotter” mission in the mid-1950s, he shot blind from a catwalk in the frigid fuselage, his cameras aimed at the crew and activated by remote control. To catch Jackie Robinson heading home, he trained a foot-controlled camera on the third-base line, leaving his hands free to shoot with a second camera.His spooky photo of an Air Force pilot being measured for a flight helmet became the inspiration for the psychedelic “Spaceman” poster promoting the Avalon Ballroom, the counterculture San Francisco music venue, in the 1960s.Mr. Morse was Life’s senior staff photographer when the magazine ceased publication as a weekly in 1972. He recalled checking with the magazine’s lab after shooting a chromatic montage of the Apollo 17 astronauts’ equipment for a moon mission.“They said, ‘Oh, the color is fine, but there’s no magazine to put it in,’ ” he told John Loengard, the author of “Life Photographers: What They Saw” (Bullfinch Press, 1998). After working for Time, he retired in 1988, but he was enlisted 10 years later when John Glenn, at the age of 77, returned to space.“Hi, Ralph, you still shooting?” Mr. Glenn asked.“Hi, John,” the 81-year-old Mr. Morse replied. “You still flying?”When he finally retired, he recalled, he sold all of his cameras.“If I had a camera,” he said in 1994, “everybody and his brother would say: ‘Gee, would you take my wedding? Would you take my kid getting married? Would you do this for the condo?’ I don’t own a camera, so I can’t do it.”A version of this article appears in print on January 27, 2015, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: Ralph Morse, 97, a Photographer at Life.
