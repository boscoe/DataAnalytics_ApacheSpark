The diamond mining company De Beers said global diamond jewelry sales increased by 3 percent last year to a record of over $80 billion, helped by strong demand in the United States, but it warned that 2015 would be tough for the industry. De Beers said sales of polished diamonds rose 7 percent in the United States, while demand grew by 6 percent in China and by 3 percent India, in terms of local currency. “Growth would have been almost 5 percent had it not been for the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of several of the major diamond consumer markets in the latter part of 2014,” De Beers said in a report. De Beers, a subsidiary of the global mining concern Anglo American, said growth would be muted in 2015 because of the strong dollar and an economic slowdown in China. The chief executive of De Beers, Philippe Mellier, said many industry participants started the year with more inventory than planned because of weak demand for diamond jewelry at the end of 2014. “This led to a period of ‘indigestion’ in the diamond value chain, and, as a result, we expect 2015 as a whole to be a more challenging year,” Mr. Mellier said.A version of this brief appears in print on September 22, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Diamond Jewelry Sales in 2014 Set Record, De Beers Says.
