The combined company would have 88 stations in 54 markets and reach about 30 percent of American television households.Media General said on Monday that its board of directors would “carefully review and consider” the Nexstar proposal with its legal and financial advisers. The company urged shareholders to take no action until it completed its review.“The board of directors of Media General continues to recommend the proposed transaction with Meredith,” the company said in a news release.In a letter to Media General’s board of directors on Monday, Nexstar called the Meredith deal “ill-conceived” and said a combination of Nexstar and Media General would create a much larger player in local television in the United States, with 162 stations in 99 markets reaching 39 percent of American households.Under the terms of the proposal, Nexstar would pay $14.50 a share in cash and stock worth, representing 30 percent premium to Media General’s closing price on Sept. 25.“We strongly believe a combination of Media General and Nexstar is far more compelling strategically and financially than your planned acquisition of Meredith,” Perry A. Sook, the Nexstar chairman, president and chief executive, said in a letter to Media General’s board of directors. “Were you to engage with us, we believe you could deliver significantly more value to your shareholders.”Under the proposed offer, Media General shareholders would receive $10.50 a share in cash and 0.0898 shares of Nexstar. The transaction is worth about $1.85 billion and values Media General at about $4.1 billion, including debt.Media General, based in Richmond, Va., owns or operates 71 television stations in 48 markets and owns a digital media business, whose portfolio includes Federated Media and BiteSizeTV. Its broadcast outlets reach 23 percent of households in the United States.It posted operating revenue of $674.9 million in 2014.In arguing for its proposal, Nexstar said on Monday that its bid would give the combined company greater scale and have less overlap, requiring fewer sales of television stations to win regulatory approval than the Meredith deal.Nexstar also said it expected that Media General shareholders would prefer its deal, particularly because of its lack of exposure to publishing. Media General’s share price declined after the announcement of the Meredith deal, but has recovered.Media General sold the bulk of its newspaper assets to Berkshire Hathaway in 2012 for $142 million in cash and has focused on deals in recent years to bolster the size of its broadcasting operations, including a cash-and-stock deal last year to acquire LIN Media for $1.6 billion.Nexstar, based in Irving, Tex., owns and operates 107 television stations in 58 markets, accounting for about 18 percent of American households.
