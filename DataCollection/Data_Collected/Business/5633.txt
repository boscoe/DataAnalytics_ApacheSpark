Mr. Marchionne told analysts that “large-scale integrations are required” in the industry to sustain the heavy capital investments needed to meet demands for cleaner, safer vehicles. “The capital consumption of this industry is unsustainable,” he said. Fiat Chrysler’s latest results illustrated that problem. Its North American profits were up 60 percent in the quarter, but the company’s 5 percent operating margins for the same period lagged its rivals General Motors, which reported margins of 8.8 percent, and Ford, with 6.7 percent.
