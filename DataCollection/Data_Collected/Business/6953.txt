In the cynical trademark style of Gawker Media, Mr. Mahler focuses on Mr. Denton’s stance on the Hulk lawsuit: The Hulk asked for it. He started the fight.Mr. Denton stated that Gawker would have settled with Hulk Hogan, but it wasn’t cost-effective. The larger interest of the story is that Gawker, while denying it, is all about eyeballs. Hulk Hogan is proving a fantastic story to milk: With the court date less than a month away, Gawker Media is at five million eyeballs and counting.Tom VerkozenBerkeley, Calif., June 16Advertisement
