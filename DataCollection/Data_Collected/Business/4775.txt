The system, called Amazon Home Services, is the e-commerce company’s latest attempt to expand its empire beyond online shopping. It was introduced on Monday across the United States after several months of testing in New York, Los Angeles and Amazon’s home city, Seattle. The move poses a potential threat to other online referral and business rating services, including Angie’s List, Yelp and Thumbtack, a start-up that raised $100 million last year from a group of backers led by an investment arm of Google. Amazon says it believes connecting consumers with handymen and home-maintenance specialists will be a logical extension to its e-commerce business because about 85 million of its customers buy products needing installation or periodic servicing. About 700 different services, including housecleaning and goat-grazing, can be booked through Amazon in major United States cities. Amazon collects a commission ranging from 10 to 20 percent from most of the services. All companies listed in the service are vetted by Amazon, which also guarantees all the work. Advertisement
