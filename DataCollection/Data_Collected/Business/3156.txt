The European cement makers Lafarge and Holcim agreed on Sunday to sell assets to CRH plc, an Irish manufacturer of building materials, for about $7.3 billion to help pave the way for their own merger.The deal is meant to help Lafarge, which is based in Paris, and Holcim, which has headquarters near Zurich, satisfy requirements by antitrust officials. Together, the two would create the world’s biggest maker of cement, with combined sales of $44 billion in 2013.The two companies had needed to sell assets that generated about $5.6 billion in revenue to assuage government regulators.Lafarge and Holcim’s proposed combination has already won approval from the European Union’s competition arm, provided they sell businesses in more than six countries in the region.They expect the transaction to be completed by June 30.Sunday’s deal is the biggest by CRH, which was formed in 1970 by the merger of two Irish building materials makers, Cement Ltd. and Roadstone Ltd.It is based in Dublin and manufactures products like concrete and asphalt and runs do-it-yourself construction-supply stores.The company prevailed in an auction that included several private equity firms, according to media reports.CRH said in a statement that it planned to finance the deal by using cash on hand, taking on additional debt and selling new shares. It added that more information on the transaction would be announced soon.A version of this article appears in print on 02/02/2015, on page B2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Cement Makers in Asset Sale.
