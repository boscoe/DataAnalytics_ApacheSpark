Revenue was depressed by a shift in the timing of a big London art auction that occurred in last year’s second quarter but was held in this year’s third, the auction house said, and by adverse currency movements.Profit for the quarter was $73.1 million, compared with $87.8 million in the comparable period a year ago.Sotheby’s share price closed down 7.5 percent on Friday, at $37.49.“There is a lot of noise in the quarter, and the results were worse than expected,” said Kristine Koerber, a research analyst at Barrington Research, an investment firm.Sotheby’s also suffered a setback, it said, when a painting it had bought earlier this year was resold at auction in the second quarter at a loss of several million dollars.The loss on the single painting, which was not identified, accounted for most of the $10 million increase in Sotheby’s cost of inventory sales in the quarter, it said. But Sotheby’s said that it had sold a second painting as part of the same deal, and that the transaction involving both works was profitable over all.Another loss, of nearly $7 million, was caused by “a significant charge related to an unexpected authenticity claim related to property sold several years ago,” said Sotheby’s chief financial officer, Patrick McClymont. The auction house would give no more details about the property or the nature of the claim.Despite the short-term slowdown, Sotheby’s new chief executive, Tad Smith, a businessman with a background in the entertainment, sports and media industries, said his strategic review of the company would continue and he looked forward to stronger growth in the future.Around the world, “overall sales numbers continue to be strong,” said Mr. Smith, who most recently led the Madison Square Garden Company. “Quality is continuing to sell at very high prices.”The auction house said it was doing better in private sales, where it had been struggling. Commissions from private sales were up by almost a third, to $22 million in the quarter.Calling Sotheby’s turnaround a “work in progress,” Ms. Koerber, the analyst, said, “The company is getting on the right track, and down the road we will see an improvement in shareholder returns.”Although Mr. Smith didn’t speak in great detail on Friday about future restructuring, Ms. Koerber said she expected to see job cuts.“It’s a people business,” she said. “There is an opportunity to bring down head count.”She said the reported adjusted earnings of $1.04 a share had missed analysts’ consensus expectations of about $1.26.In an update on the strategic review Mr. Smith has undertaken since joining, he said he was seeking to change the company by, among other things, putting a greater focus on contemporary art.“Our contemporary group has identified some areas where we can be doing a lot better,” he said, suggesting he might increase Sotheby’s efforts and resources in the United States and overseas, and change the way it related to consignors.While Sotheby’s has typically been stronger than its rival Christie’s in the area of Impressionist and Modern art, it has struggled to match Christie’s in the booming sector of contemporary art.Mr. Smith announced a doubling of Sotheby’s share repurchase program, to $250 million. He said he wanted to expand Sotheby’s middle-market activities — for works below $1 million — and its business in jewelry and other collectibles.Another priority, he said, is to improve the Sotheby’s brand, including the customer experience at Sotheby’s locations.When customers enter a Sotheby’s building, he said, “I want every element of what you see, how you’re treated, what you do, every element to reflect the elegance of our brand.”He said activity by Chinese buyers, which has become a focus for the auction houses, remained strong in New York and London, but was a bit softer in Beijing and Hong Kong.Advertisement
