It also reported that world economic growth came in below expectations in 2014.The bank predicts the world economy will expand 3 percent this year, up from 2.6 percent in 2014 but down from predictions last June by World Bank economists of 3.4 percent growth this year and 2.8 percent for 2014.“The recovery has been sputtering in the euro area and Japan as legacies of the financial crisis linger,” the bank said on Tuesday in the first of its twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects reports.Plunging oil prices and stronger growth in the United States are expected to help raise global growth in 2015. The bank expects the United States economy to grow 3.2 percent this year, up from 2.4 percent in 2014.Growth among the 19 European Union members that use the euro currency is expected to pick up modestly — to 1.1 percent in 2015 from 0.8 percent last year. Likewise, the Japanese economy is expected to rebound to 1.2 percent growth this year from 0.2 percent in 2014.The bank expects China’s economy to expand 7.1 percent this year, down from 7.4 percent in 2014. The slowdown reflects in part the Chinese government’s effort to rein in excessive lending and wasteful investment.Over all, the bank expects high-income countries to grow 2.2 percent this year, up from 1.8 percent in 2014. Developing countries will grow 4.8 percent, an improvement from 4.4 percent in 2014.But the bank sees risks that could spoil its forecast. A financial crisis is possible if investors withdraw money from emerging markets to take advantage of rising interest rates and improving economic prospects in the United States. That could cause emerging-market currencies to plummet and squeeze companies that have borrowed in United States dollars — a partial replay of the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98.Conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East also could disrupt economic growth. The Chinese economy could tumble into a “disorderly slowdown.” And sub-Saharan African economies, expected to grow a healthy 4.6 percent in 2015, could be devastated instead if the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not contained.Advertisement
