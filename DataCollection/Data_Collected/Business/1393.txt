DEARBORN, Mich. —  Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union said on Wednesday that a slight majority of workers at Ford Motor Company have so far voted against a proposed new labor agreement.The tight results mean the deciding votes are in the hands of workers at three large assembly plants in Michigan and Illinois that begin voting on Thursday.U.A.W. officials are urging those workers to support the four-year tentative agreement, and avoid a defeat that would force the union to go back to the bargaining table with Ford.Jimmy Settles, the union’s lead negotiator with Ford, said at a news briefing on Wednesday that about 75 percent of the company’s 52,000 factory workers had voted so far. Of that number, about 52 percent voted against the agreement, he said.Advertisement“We’re optimistic,” Mr. Settles said at the briefing at the union hall outside Ford’s huge Rouge assembly plant. “It looks dark now, but it might be light in the morning.”AdvertisementA defeat at Ford would be the second setback for the union leadership in the current labor talks involving all three Detroit automakers.Last month, results from voting at Fiat Chrysler showed that workers had voted down a proposed contract that did not go far enough in closing the gap in wages between entry-level employees and veteran workers.After the defeat, the U.A.W. resumed bargaining with Fiat Chrysler and ultimately won better terms with the company. The revised contract called for raises for every union member and eventual wage parity for newer employees and longtime workers.Fiat Chrysler workers then voted to accept the deal, which set the template for contract terms that were subsequently approved by a majority of union workers at General Motors.The contract at G.M., however, has been the subject of further negotiations to address opposition in the ranks of skilled-trades workers.
                Prodded by its union, the auto industry served as the 20th-century trailblazer in spreading prosperity. But the model of a “social contract” has begun to unravel.            Under union rules, both production workers and skilled-trades employees must approve the contract separately.The union has extended its current contract with G.M. while the skilled-trades discussions take place. That extension is set to expire on Friday.AdvertisementIndustry analysts had expected the vote at Ford to go smoother than negotiations at G.M. and Fiat Chrysler.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Local 600, which represents workers at the Dearborn plant, said he had held 14 informational meetings with union members to build support for the contract.“If we thought there was another dollar on the table we would have got it in the first one,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on November 19, 2015, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Results of U.A.W.
