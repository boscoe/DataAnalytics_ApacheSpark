Taking advantage of strong investor appetite, Shake Shack plans to raise the price range for its eagerly anticipated initial public offering.The fast-food restaurant operator disclosed on Wednesday that it had raised the expected price range of its stock sale to $17 to $19 a share, up from $14 to $16. At the high end of that newly expanded range, the company would raise $95 million — and more than $109 million if underwriters exercise an option to sell more shares. Wednesday’s filing highlights the growing interest in Shake Shack, which has grown from a humble hot dog stand in a Midtown Manhattan park into a global network of 63 outposts serving burgers and fries. The company is by far the most prominent part of the empire run by Danny Meyer, the restaurateur previously known for fine dining establishments like Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern.(Mr. Meyer and other existing owners will continue to control the company through their ownership of Class B shares that hold much more voting power than the Class A shares being sold.)And it fits into a series of casual restaurant operators that have transformed themselves into publicly traded companies, following the likes of El Pollo Loco and Zoe’s Kitchen.Shake Shack is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the ticker symbol SHAK. Its offering is being led by JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.A version of this article appears in print on 01/29/2015, on page B9 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Greater Expectations.
