Arthur T. Minson Jr., who helped guide Time Warner Cable through the collapse of the $45 billion takeover attempt by Comcast, then the $56 billion proposed sale to Charter Communications, is leaving his position as chief financial officer of the company to work as president and chief operating officer of WeWork, a company that rents shared office space.Charter announced its deal for Time Warner Cable a week ago; it would create the second-largest cable operator in the country if approved by regulators. Time Warner Cable said that Mr. Minson’s departure, announced on Monday, was effective immediately, but that he would continue to work as an adviser to the company until its merger with Charter is complete.“His steady hand at the helm of our financial operations, as well as his overall business acumen and judgment, has brought great benefits to our shareholders and employees, and we will miss him,” Robert D. Marcus, Time Warner Cable’s chief executive, said in a statement.In Mr. Minson’s place, Time Warner Cable named William F. Osbourn Jr. and Matthew Siegel as co-chief financial officers. Mr. Osbourn now is the company’s senior vice president-controller and chief accounting officer, and Mr. Siegel is the senior vice president and treasurer.Mr. Minson was appointed chief financial officer of Time Warner Cable in 2013 after working at AOL, where he oversaw its spinoff from Time Warner. Before that, he worked at Time Warner Cable, Rainbow Media, Time Warner and Ernst & Young.A version of this article appears in print on June 2, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Executive Shift at Time Warner Cable.
