The market closed slightly lower on Thursday as investors were reluctant to make large bets before the release of the government’s closely watched jobs report on Friday.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 4.15 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 17,863.43. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 2.38 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,099.93, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 14.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,127.74.Drug stocks were among the biggest decliners, after another steep drop in shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Valeant shares, which traded above $250 a few months ago, fell below $80 after reports that a major hedge fund had sold its stake and a congressional panel was investigating Valeant’s operations. Valeant fell $13.20, or 14 percent, to close at $78.77.While the government’s monthly jobs report is always important to investors, it is even more so this month. With the fate of years of near-zero interest rates hanging in the balance, strong October and November jobs reports could give the Federal Reserve reason to consider raising rates in December.

“We think the Fed does raise interest rates in December, but it is going to be somewhat of a close call, and it depends on how the data comes in between now and then,” said David Lefkowitz, senior equity strategist for UBS.AdvertisementTestifying before a congressional committee on Wednesday, Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, described the United States economy as “performing well” and said a rate increase in December was a “live possibility” if the economy stayed on track. Her view was echoed by another Fed policy maker that day.AdvertisementMs. Yellen emphasized that no decision had been made and that a move in December would depend on how the economy fared until then.Economists expect that American employers added 190,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate remained steady at 5.1 percent, according to FactSet.Investors have become increasingly confident that there is a chance of a rate increase in December. Investments that track which way the Fed will move rates show the possibility of an increase at about 60 percent. Bond yields remained unchanged, and the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 2.23 percent. Bond yields are at their highest level since right before the Fed’s September meeting.
