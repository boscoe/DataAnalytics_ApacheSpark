Don’t expect that freeze to lift anytime soon, according to two top officials for the United States’ biggest stock exchanges.Executives at both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq stock market said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here that they expect very few companies to try to make their market debuts.Elevate, an online lender, postponed its planned offering earlier this week, joining the likes of the Albertsons supermarket chain and the Caribbean telecommunications provider Digicel.“This has been one of the worst starts to a year,” said Garvis Toler, the head of capital markets for the Big Board’s parent, NYSE Euronext.The hesitation of companies to pursue I.P.O.s arises from a stew of circumstances, including the poor reception for companies that made their market debuts this year, the whipsawing stock markets and the continued availability of money in the private capital markets.Executives from both the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq said that their backlog — companies that have filed privately for an I.P.O. without publicly disclosing their intentions — remains strong. But Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, noted that prolonged market troubles simply meant that those would-be debutants would push back their plans.“The backlog is now less meaningful than at other times,” he said.Still, Mr. Greifeld held out hopes that another Nasdaq offering would rise in popularity. Last fall, the exchange operator bought SecondMarket to bolster its options for companies to allow the sales of their stocks without going public.As companies stay private longer, he said, they will face more pressure to let shareholders and early investors cash out their holdings, in part as the number of “down rounds” — financings that value a company at less than what it was worth in a previous round — multiply.Such a system will not eliminate I.P.O.s, Mr. Greifeld said. But he predicted that these private markets would become even more popular.Advertisement
