Standard Deduction By

Jeb Bush’s tax returns take us back to the time when it was a point of pride for high-income earners to buy a piece of a Panamanian gold mine, a Hollywood movie, a Texas oil well or a California alpaca farm. The point was not to make money but to use the artificial tax losses from a partnership to shelter one’s true salary from tax.Mr. Bush released 33 years of returns on Tuesday, and his effective tax rate of 40 percent in 2013 contrasts notably with that of the last Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, who disclosed an effective rate of 13.9 percent in 2010. After releasing his returns, Mr. Bush joked that he “apparently didn’t take full advantage” of deductions.Mr. Bush should be careful when throwing stones; he did not always pay tax at such a high rate. In the 1980s, before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed many of the rules related to tax shelters, Mr. Bush’s dealings in real estate allowed him to pay almost no income tax, even when he earned considerable wages and had little to no risk of economic loss on his investments.His real estate business, in other words, provided Mr. Bush with a textbook tax shelter: an investment that generated paper tax losses and sheltered his ordinary labor income from high tax rates.AdvertisementIn 1984, for example, Mr. Bush earned about $117,000 in wages and real estate commissions — about $268,000 in current dollars. But he paid no regular income tax and paid less than $2,000 in alternative minimum tax, thanks to his business partnership with Armando Codina, a Miami real estate developer.AdvertisementIn 1984, two real estate deals with Mr. Codina called Museum Tower Ltd. and 1390 Brickell Ltd. generated $80,000 in paper losses that Mr. Bush used to reduce his taxable labor income. The deal for 1390 Brickell Avenue, which can be tracked through his tax returns, generated a paper loss of $57,899 in 1984.I call the loss a “paper” one because Mr. Bush had little money at stake, although the precise amount cannot be determined from the tax return. Mr. Codina and Mr. Bush formed a partnership to buy 1390 Avenue, an office building just off the water in downtown Miami. In a similar deal for the Museum Tower office building nearby, Mr. Bush contributed just $1,000 in exchange for a profit interest of 20 percent, also known as a carried interest. To buy 1390 Brickell, Mr. Codina and Mr. Bush borrowed $7 million from an insurance company, securing the loan with a mortgage on the building.Another real estate developer, J. Edward Houston, considered acquiring an equity stake in the partnership. Instead, Mr. Houston borrowed $4.565 million from Broward Federal Savings and Loan, secured by a second mortgage on the Brickell building. Mr. Houston then lent the money to the Codina-Bush partnership in exchange for an option to acquire half the equity in the partnership. All said, the Codina-Bush partnership borrowed about $11.5 million to buy an office building for $9 million. The only way the deal made any economic sense was if Miami’s real estate boom of the mid-1980s continued indefinitely.It did not. When the market turned, Broward Federal was one of the many savings and loan institutions that became insolvent in the late 1980s. Federal regulators, left to collect on the $4.565 million, eventually decided to settle the debt for $505,000. The balance of the loan, about $4 million, was ultimately paid off with taxpayer money. Mr. Bush eventually made a modest profit when the building was sold in 1990.The 1390 Brickell deal was more than a risky business transaction. It was a classic real estate tax shelter. Because the owners of a building are allowed to count borrowed money as part of the cost basis, or tax basis, of a building, depreciation of the building can generate tax losses far in excess of the owner’s real economic investment. Thus, although Mr. Bush invested perhaps only $1,000 in the deal, and he never risked reaching into his own pocket to pay back the building’s creditors, in 1984, he was able to take a loss of $58,000 to shelter his wage income from taxes.The pattern continued in 1985 and 1986. In 1985, Mr. Bush earned about $49,000 in wages and an additional $28,000 in capital gains, but he showed an adjusted gross income of negative $80,000, again thanks to losses from his real estate deals. Mr. Bush recognized a tax loss of $144,563 from the investment in 1390 Brickell.In 1986, Mr. Bush earned $131,545 in wages and an additional $53,971 in taxable retirement benefits, but after deductions, credits, and the pass-through of real estate losses, paid no income tax at all. The 1390 Brickell building passed through a net loss of $140,531 for that year.AdvertisementMr. Bush was hardly alone in taking advantage of tax rules that had become so riddled with loopholes that paying income tax was, for many wealthy people, optional. After a long fight, Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, reducing tax rates and closing many of the loopholes that Mr. Bush and others relied on to reduce taxable income. Because of some especially effective lobbying by the real estate industry, however, many tax benefits remained intact.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One set of rules, known as the at-risk rules, provided that taxpayers could not take losses in excess of the amount that they had placed at risk in an investment. But the real estate lobby secured an exception for “qualified nonrecourse financing” secured by real property — precisely the kind of financing used for deals like 1390 Brickell.The Tax Reform Act of 1986 added another provision, known as the passive loss rules. The passive loss rules provided that taxpayers could not use losses from passive activities to offset active income, like income from wages or business income. Mr. Bush’s real estate activities were, under the definition of the tax code, passive activities. Still, the rules remained generous enough that Mr. Bush managed to pay very little tax until 1990.In 1987, Mr. Bush earned about $87,000 in wages and other income but recognized about $118,000 in losses from the real estate business. He paid just $4,353 in alternative minimum tax. He realized $93,401 in tax losses from 1390 Brickell, with $50,293 disallowed and carried forward under the new passive loss limitations.In 1988, Mr. Bush’s passive activities generated a net loss of $237,000, again zeroing out his income tax. Mr. Bush recognized a loss of $30,348 from 1390 Brickell. Mr. Bush did not attach the schedule that would have indicated exactly how much passive loss was disallowed, but one can infer from the information provided that about 32 percent of the overall net loss of $237,032, or $75,867, was attributable to Brickell, meaning that about $45,000 was disallowed and carried forward for use in later years.In 1989, 1390 Brickell generated a passive loss of $139,340. Meanwhile, the real estate market crash led to the failure of many banks, including Broward Federal Savings and Loan, the holder of the second mortgage on the building. Lawsuits commenced, and the partnership eventually settled with federal regulators.In 1990, Mr. Codina and Mr. Bush told The New York Times that they had incurred a $1.316 million tax liability when they declared the forgiven debt as income. If that was indeed the case, the liability doesn’t appear to show up on Mr. Bush’s bottom line.1990, Mr. Bush did report a gain of $888,192 from 1390 Brickell alongside a loss of $328,623, with the gain presumably reflecting a portion of the taxable income arising out of the settlement. The passive activity gain from 1390 Brickell was zeroed out, however, by a $1,000,993 passive loss from Museum Tower, the other real estate deal Mr. Codina and Mr. Bush began in 1984. The tax returns do not explain why the Museum Tower building would suddenly generate a million-dollar loss allocated to Mr. Bush.In 1991, Mr. Bush reported losses of more than $22,000 from Brickell, but classified $21,931 as loss from a nonpassive activity, and thus not subject to limitations. News reports at the time indicated that the partnership sold the building for $8 million in 1991, or about $1 million more than the existing mortgage. Mr. Bush’s tax return indicates a gain of $203,526 that appears to represent his share of the profits from the sale of the Brickell property, although information on the tax return is unclear.AdvertisementIn a 1994 interview, Mr. Bush defended the fact that he paid so little in income tax in the 1980s. “In the real-estate world, you pay the price at the end,” Mr. Bush told The Orlando Sentinel. “When you sell ... you have to declare the income that had been sheltered. Look at the taxes I’m paying now. Give me credit for that,” he said.All in all, from 1984 to 1991, Mr. Bush’s investment in 1390 Brickell generated tax losses of just more than $1 million. And just when the sale of the Brickell deal finally generated taxable income, the Museum Tower partnership allocated a new million-dollar loss to Mr. Bush.This is all ancient history, of course. Nothing in the tax returns shows that Jeb Bush did more than participate in a tax shelter, something that thousands of Americans did in the 1980s. And unlike a doctor investing in a Panamanian gold mine, Mr. Bush at least contributed sweat equity to the deal, working to lease and manage the building. Most of the wages he sheltered came from the company that managed the building.Still, I think the history raises some questions for Mr. Bush as a candidate. His real estate business in the 1980s achieved the same bottom-line result that Mitt Romney did with his private equity business — a low effective tax rate on his labor income. Real estate continues to receive preferential tax treatment in various ways. When Mr. Bush’s father was vice president, his involvement in the tax reform effort led by President Reagan was largely limited to fighting to preserve tax preferences for the oil and gas industry. Mr. Bush’s nonchalance about the tax consequences of his real estate deals in the 1980s suggests that he might feel the same way about the tax preferences for the real estate industry.Victor Fleischer is a professor of law at the University of San Diego, where he teaches classes on corporate tax, tax policy, and venture capital and serves as the director of research for the Graduate Tax Program.
