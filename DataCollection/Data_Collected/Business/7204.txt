Buying so-called white label brands, made for supermarkets and the like, was meant to serve as a complement to mainstay labels like Orville Redenbacher’s and Chef Boyardee.But since that deal was struck in late 2012, the private-label business has proved far less lucrative than anticipated.On Tuesday, ConAgra said that its private brands unit reported $1 billion in sales, down slightly. The division has cost ConAgra more than $1 billion in write-downs.The final straw may have come earlier this month when Jana Partners, one of the best-known activist hedge funds around, disclosed that it had acquired a 7.2 percent stake in the company and was readying a potential board fight.Now, ConAgra has acknowledged that its foray into private brands will come to an end.“As I have intensely studied the situation in our private brands operations over the last few months, it has become clear that the time and energy the company is devoting to the private brands turnaround represent a suboptimal use of our resources,” Sean M. Connolly, ConAgra’s chief executive, said in a statement.ConAgra said that it planned to announced a new strategic direction, built in part on cost cuts and on investing more in its main consumer foods segment.In a statement, Barry Rosenstein, the managing partner of Jana Partners, said: “Today ConAgra acknowledged the need to pursue a new strategic direction, improve margins through better cost controls, and improve capital allocation, while still leaving all options to maximize shareholder value on the table. We look forward to our ongoing discussions with the company and its advisors on these and other matters.”Advertisement
