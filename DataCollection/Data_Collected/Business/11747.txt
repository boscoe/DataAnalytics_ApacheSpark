He was 54.An announcement sent to Houlihan Lokey employees on Sunday said that Mr. Feinstein died of a heart attack.Mr. Feinstein was one of the few bankers who publicly advised shareholder activists on their campaigns, in which they targeted corporations that they thought were undervalued and agitated for changes. He also advised companies that sought to defend themselves from hostile takeovers or activist investors.Other firms have largely avoided advising activists because they perceive it to be a conflict with their work with existing clients.“We are deeply saddened by the loss of our friend and colleague, Gregg Feinstein,” Houlihan Lokey said in a statement. “His contribution to our business was significant, and his warmth and generosity was well known among his clients, colleagues and friends.”Mr. Feinstein joined Houlihan Lokey in March 2005 from another independent investment bank, Jefferies & Company, where he also led the mergers and acquisitions group. Before that, he was chief operating officer for 12 years at Berenson Minella & Company, a boutique bank for mergers and acquisitions, of which he was a co-founder. He also worked at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in their respective mergers groups.Mr. Feinstein received his undergraduate degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.Advertisement
