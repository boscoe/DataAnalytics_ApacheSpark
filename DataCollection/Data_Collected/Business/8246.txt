The drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline is shutting down a North Carolina plant that produces inhaled medications after discovering the bacteria that causes Legionnaires’ disease, a potentially fatal form of pneumonia. The manufacturing plant in Zebulon, about 25 miles east of Raleigh, was closed on Tuesday after testing found the bacteria in cooling towers. A spokeswoman, Jenni Brewer Ligday, said it was not immediately clear whether there was any effect on medications produced. The same bacteria found in cooling tanks in the Bronx section of New York City caused 12 Legionnaires’ disease deaths this summer.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
