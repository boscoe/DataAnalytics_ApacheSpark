AdvertisementSupported byBy Landon Thomas Jr.Volatile global markets had their effect on BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, as its earnings for the first quarter of this year declined by 14 percent.Bonds and stocks rallied in March, but persistent selling rattled the markets in the first two months of the year, as oil prices slid and concerns mounted over China’s slowing economy.For the quarter, BlackRock said on Thursday, its net earnings declined to $711 million, compared with $830 million in the quarter a year ago. The firm’s assets under management, the most critical gauge of an investment managers success, declined by only 1 percent, to $4.7 trillion.“In a volatile quarter, we only had a 1 percent drop in assets under management,” Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday. “Growth in E.T.F.s helped, and we continue to see strong flows into our funds from institutional investors.”Compared with other less diversified asset managers that have been experiencing pronounced investor withdrawals more several years now, BlackRock was buoyed by its exchange-traded funds division, which was responsible for $24 billion of the firm’s $36 billion net inflow for the quarter.Some $27 billion of the inflows came from passive, index-based strategies, which continue to attract more funds than higher-priced actively managed approaches. Exchange-traded funds are low-priced funds that track a variety of different indexes and investment strategies.So even in a quarter when investor sentiment swung from negative to positive, BlackRock’s iShares unit was able to lure investors into its defensive Treasury bill funds in the beginning of the year and its riskier high-yield and emerging market funds last month.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.BlackRock Solutions, the firm’ advisory practice, also bucked the down quarter, increasing revenue 16 percent from the quarter a year ago.Growth was driven by the Aladdin risk management platform, which acts like a central nervous system of sorts, allowing an investment manager to assess the risk and liquidity of its assets at any given moment.BlackRock uses the platform itself and has become increasingly successful in selling this service to its institutional clients who are under persistent pressure from regulators to disclose the risk of the securities they own and their ability to sell them in a pinch.As to the future, Mr. Fink said he expected equity markets to remain robust on the expectation that there would not be a hard economic landing in China. He did caution, though, that there could be a number of political surprises in the months ahead that could influence investor sentiment — including worries over Britain leaving the European Union and the uncertainties of the United States presidential race.“We are living in a world of political uncertainty,” he said.Advertisement
