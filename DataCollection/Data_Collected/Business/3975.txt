Only in the rarefied world of private equity would an annual payout of more than $300 million for a top executive constitute a decline from the previous year.Leon D. Black, 63, the chief executive and co-founder of Apollo Global Management, received a total of $330.6 million for 2014, according to a regulatory filing on Friday, a smaller sum than the $546.3 million he received in 2013.That payout — consisting mostly of dividends and including returns on his personal investments with Apollo funds — demonstrates how the fortunes of private equity’s top executives are closely tied to the investment performance of their firms.While Apollo reaped significant profit in 2014, its cash dividend was smaller than in 2013, a year when Mr. Black said the firm was “selling everything that’s not nailed down.”Mr. Black, who founded Apollo with Marc Rowan and Joshua Harris in 1990, earned $268 million in dividends for 2014, the Friday filing showed. He also received $62.4 million in profit and returned capital from his personal investments with Apollo.His salary and other compensation totaled $273,980, a relatively small part of his total earnings.A rival private equity titan, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the Blackstone Group, received about $690 million for 2014, including dividends and investment returns.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
