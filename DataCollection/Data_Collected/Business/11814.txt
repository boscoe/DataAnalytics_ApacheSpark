Donald J. Trump and Univision said on Thursday that they had resolved the lawsuit that Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential contender, filed after the Spanish-language broadcaster decided last summer not to broadcast the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants. Mr. Trump owned the pageants at the time, and has since sold them. Univision acted after Mr. Trump accused Mexico of sending criminals into the United States.
