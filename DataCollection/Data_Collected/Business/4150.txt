The company behind the Snuggie, Perfect Bacon Bowl and other “As Seen on TV” products has agreed to pay $8 million to settle charges that it deceived customers. The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday that the company, the Allstar Marketing Group, promised customers buy-one, get-one-free promotions but ended up charging higher fees. The agency said customers were led to believe they would be getting two $19.95 products for less than $10 each, but actually paid $35.85. Some customers were also sold more products than they intended to buy. The New York attorney general said one customer who wanted to buy two $19.95 Perfect Brownie Pans was charged $105 for six of them after being confused by an automated phone call. Allstar will pay $7.5 million to the F.T.C. to create a fund for customer refunds. The other $500,000 will be paid to the New York attorney general’s office for penalties, costs and fees. Allstar said it had already made changes to make costs easier to understand.A version of this brief appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Marketer of the Snuggie to Pay Fine for Misleading Ads.
