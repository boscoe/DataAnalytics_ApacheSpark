Cook, Apple’s chief executive.Mr. Cook said in an interview at WSJDLive, a technology conference presented by The Wall Street Journal in Laguna Beach, Calif., that the service, Apple Music, had a total of 15 million users, 6.5 million of whom pay. Apple Music, a competitor to Spotify, was introduced at the end of June and offered customers three months of music free; those who continue after their trial periods end pay $10 a month for individual accounts or $15 a month for family plans.In August, Apple said 11 million people had tried the service, and trial periods began to expire at the end of September. Since then, the music industry has been eagerly awaiting Apple’s subscriber numbers, while the company’s executives have made various public statements that they were aware of early problems with the service — like jumbled playlists — and were working to resolve them.Spotify last revealed its user numbers in June, when it said it had 20 million paying users around the world and 55 million who use its advertising-supported free version.Advertisement
