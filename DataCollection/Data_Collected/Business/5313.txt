Both her parents, as well as parts of her extended family, have worked in major Wall Street broker/dealers.In reading Professor Mullainathan’s piece, I am struck by how conflicted the professor is in wondering whether society benefits from having another financier in its midst.I have a few practical questions for the professor. Who will be providing for her when she is an adult? How will she be able to independently support herself and any family that she may have?If she chose a career that served the “greater good,” who will ultimately still have to pay her own bills? Of course, the answer to all these questions is that she has to be responsible for herself and her own well-being.Finally, with all due respect, would society be any better served by having another economics professor?Richard ChinNew York City, April 13Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
