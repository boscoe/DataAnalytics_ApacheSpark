Even as Volkswagen embarks on the task of fixing the emissions systems it disabled on almost 500,000 of its diesel vehicles in the United States, the automaker faces another hurdle: persuading owners to make the repair at all.That’s because the software that allowed Volkswagen to fool federal emissions tests also lowered the car’s performance and fuel economy while the device was turned on. So for owners, the prospect of having a car’s emissions cleaned up, only to have the car perform worse — whatever the pollution — is not sitting well.“If we take a 10 percent hit in our gas mileage, I can live with that, but I won’t be happy,” said Patrick Downs, who lives in Port Angeles, Wash., and owns a 2013 Jetta TDI.“If it is 25 percent or more and the performance is degraded to the point where the car has a lot less torque and pickup, that is going to make me very unhappy,” he added. “That is going to make me consider not getting the fix.”AdvertisementIt was well known among owners of Volkswagen diesels that the cars’ advertised fuel economy — as shown on the window sticker — was almost always lower than their real-world performance.AdvertisementMichael Horn, head of Volkswagen’s American unit, told a congressional panel this month that the repairs he outlined — which will take years and require significant new equipment — might result in a slightly lower top speed in the cars. But he was careful to say that the cars’ fuel economy would not be lower than the rating on the window sticker.That’s not satisfactory, said Jeff Hinton, the owner of a 2013 Passat diesel. “Every TDI owner will tell you, ‘I get much better numbers, miles to the gallon, than any number that is on that Monroney sticker,’” Mr. Hinton, 36, said in a telephone interview from Morrisville, N.C., using a term for the window sticker.“On recent trips, 500 miles plus, I’ve gotten 52 to 55 miles per gallon,” Mr. Hinton said. The Environmental Protection Agency rating on the window sticker of his Passat is 40 miles per gallon on the highway.“I wouldn’t want my car recalled or reprogrammed or retrofitted in any way if it is going to hurt the performance, because that is not what I paid for,” he said.The E.P.A. cannot force owners to repair their vehicles, said Julia Ortiz, a spokeswoman for the agency.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            Automakers also cannot require owners to carry out the emissions recall, just as they cannot force owners to take vehicles in to complete a safety recall.Some states require vehicles to pass emissions tests before they can be registered each year. But those tests are far less sophisticated than the E.P.A.’s, and the Volkswagens that are not repaired are sure to pass them, said John German, a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation, which played a crucial role in discovering the automaker’s deceit.AdvertisementThat loophole means the air pollution consequences of Volkswagen’s action — at least on a small scale — are irreparable if enough owners refuse to have their vehicles fixed.Despite their small size, the Volkswagen diesels produce a large amount of nitrogen oxide pollutants, Mr. German said, up to 40 times what is allowed under the Clean Air Act. The Passat sedan is emitting an amount of nitrogen oxides similar to that of a modern, medium-duty truck, he said, while the Jetta — and its sibling the Golf — have emissions similar to those of a typical modern 18-wheeler, he said. The Jetta and Golf use a different emissions system than the Passat.Volkswagen must come up with an incentive plan to make repairing the engines irresistible, said Dan Becker, the director of the Safe Climate Campaign at the Center for Auto Safety.“Volkswagen made this disaster; it is its responsibility to fix it,” he said in a telephone interview. “We need to recognize that consumers may need to have an incentive to do what the law requires.”General Motors, for example, last year offered $25 gift cards to owners of about 2.6 million older small cars that could have defective ignition switches. But unlike the case with the Volkswagens, that was for a potentially fatal defect that has been linked to at least 124 deaths.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But it has never been used and it would be “premature and speculative” to discuss how that law might apply to Volkswagen, said Mairin Bellack, a spokeswoman for the state’s Motor Vehicle Commission.California also requires owners to have their vehicles repaired, said Stanley Young, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. The automaker has until Nov. 20 to submit a remedy to California regulators, which must then be approved.“If it turns out that there is not enough of a response, we do have in California the option of putting a block on registration until the fix is done,” he said. “But that is only as a last resort.”Even before Volkswagen announced the recall remedy, diesel owners fretted about the impact.“Do not take your car to the dealer for service (if it’s out of warranty) as they will automatically install the eventual software fix if you do,” an owner wrote on the Volkswagen Owners Club website. “This software fix will allow the car to pass emissions, but it will lower MPG, decrease performance and finally reduce component life of the engine and emissions system.”AdvertisementBut some emissions experts say it’s hard to predict the consequences, since it is not clear exactly what Volkswagen did.Federal regulators have said the automaker installed software that signaled the emissions system to work during the E.P.A. tests, but then at least partly disabled it during routine driving.Even the motivation is unclear.“Fuel economy could be a factor but it need not be the factor,” said Arvind Thiruvengadam, research professor at West Virginia University, which helped uncover VW’s cheating. “Meeting lower emissions means it is also a lot of burden on other components of the vehicle.”Part of the strategy, then, could have been to minimize mechanical wear and tear, he said.Mr. German at the International Council on Clean Transportation said that what all this meant to diesel owners would not be clear until Volkswagen provided far more information.He said there might be a loss in fuel economy, although he would be surprised if it was significant. “It shouldn’t be, like eight miles per gallon or anything like that,” he said.Consumer Reports tested two Volkswagen diesels, with and without the cheating software activated. In one of the cases, a 2015 Jetta TDI got 53 m.p.g. without the modification used to cheat, compared with 50 m.p.g. with it. The advertised fuel economy was 45 miles per gallon.Mr. German said he would be surprised if the smooth delivery of power without hesitation or surges was a major problem because vehicles today have advanced fuel-injection systems and sophisticated computers.Advertisement“It is rare for there to be a drivability problem,” he said. “You can almost always figure out some way to manage it.”That leaves owners like Mr. Downs in Washington State, who is waiting to see how his Jetta diesel will be affected and what to do about the recall. But he readily acknowledges he is pondering the environmental downside of not repairing the car.“What does this mean in terms of actual environmental impact?” he said. “It is millions of cars. That weighs heavy on my mind.”Eric Taub contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on October 19, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Essential Part of the VW Diesel Repair Is the Owner.
