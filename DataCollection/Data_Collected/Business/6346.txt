Such was the case with the China-based Hanergy Thin Film Power Group, a $40 billion company that lost half of its value in less than an hour on Wednesday.The Reuters data analysis flagged 35 more stocks whose rapid gains in value apparently outpaced the company’s earnings.Hong Kong’s regulator warned that more turbulence may be in store.“The S.F.C.’s surveillance systems have picked up more ‘noise,”’ Mr. Alder said, referring to the commission.
