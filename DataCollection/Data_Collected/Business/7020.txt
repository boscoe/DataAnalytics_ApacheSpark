Greed and fear are the primal forces that in the past have driven the stock market to its highs and lows. Now the dominant emotion among investors seems to be lukewarm enthusiasm.The power of this barely positive thinking can be seen as Greece and Europe appear to edge closer to a debt deal. Avoiding a financial disaster on the Continent would remove a pressing worry that has been hanging over the market for months.Instead of cheering, however, investors will most likely return to fretting over a long list of concerns. And if recent trends continue, they will keep grudgingly buying stocks anyhow.The worries that investors have are numerous and endlessly debated: the impact of the Federal Reserve’s increasing interest rates, tepid earnings in corporate America, a stronger dollar, conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, and that perennial favorite of the pessimists, something bad happening in China.AdvertisementThe benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is up 3.2 percent so far this year. But in a testament to the low-energy vibe of this market, the index has not risen or fallen by 2 percent or more on any single trading day in 2015.
                From a small island to the capital in Athens, here is a glimpse into some of the lives of Greeks as their country struggles to repay billions in debt.            “The market would have a heart attack if we did 3 percent,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.AdvertisementStill, this unappreciated bull market has carried stocks 214 percent higher since March 2009 — and it recently became the third-longest bull market in the postwar period, according to S.&P. It is now 75 months long, just ahead of the ascent that took place between 1974 and 1980. (It still lags the 86-month rally between 1949 and 1956 and the nearly 10-year bull run that ended in 2000.)Yet as stocks keep rising, investors keep shrugging.A survey by the American Association of Individual Investors shows that 40 percent of individual investors are “neutral” about where the stock market is headed in the next six months. And those two-fifths saying “meh” about the market eclipse the 25 percent who said they were bullish. “One thing that has been quite striking about stocks is the lack of participation of the retail investor,” said Gina C. Martin Adams, an equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities.The Wall Street professionals who prognosticate about the broader stock market are also wanly optimistic. Right now, stock strategists, on average, are recommending that investors have 52 percent of their portfolios in stocks, well below the 60 to 65 percent share that brokerage firms typically recommend as a basic allocation, according to Savita Subramanian, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The country became the epicenter of Europe’s debt crisis after Wall Street imploded in 2008. Now, it is struggling to pay its debt, and its people and creditors are growing restive.But stocks actually tend to do well when analysts have a low level of conviction. “In the past when strategists have been as or more bearish than they are today, the market has moved higher over the next 12 months 98 percent of the time,” Ms. Subramanian wrote in an email.At some point, however, something will most likely trip up the market — and it may be some of the concerns that analysts have anguished over in recent years.AdvertisementWith a Greek exit from the euro possibly receding as a fear, the Fed’s interest rate policies will most likely now loom as the most immediate concern. The Fed is expected to hold off on raising interest rates until it feels confident that such a move won’t undermine the economic recovery — and, as a result, it may put off any rate increases until next year. In theory, if the economy is then stronger than it is today, corporate earnings will also be more robust, potentially offsetting the anxiety among investors caused by a rise in interest rates.But all sorts of negative chain reactions can take place when the Fed lifts rates. If the European economy is still weak when it happens, the region will most likely have lower interest rates than in the United States. This could prompt a rally in the dollar against the euro. And when that happened earlier this year, it caused an unexpected hit to many United States companies, particularly exporters. Higher interest rates could also upset the delicate balance that has helped keep stocks elevated. Company earnings, which typically undergird stock prices over the longer term, have not grown at a strong pace. Investors have been happy to tolerate that at a time when low interest rates have meant investors get low payouts in the bond market.If the Fed were to raise rates, bond yields would also go up, making bonds look more attractive. In the adjustment, the valuations on stocks may come down — and stay down.And after so many years of low inflation, some analysts are now starting to account for the possibility of inflation rising to a level that causes a big sell-off in the bond market.Productivity indicators are currently low for the United States economy, which means that companies may not absorb a rise in wages, but pass it on to consumers in the form of higher prices, stoking inflation. The Fed may then have to apply the brakes more sharply than investors anticipated, roiling the wider market.“I think the inflation story is turning around,” said David Rosenberg, an economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff. “If we get into an interest rate cycle, things are going to change. Very few Fed tightening cycles ended well.”Even then, the shakeout may not be as bad as the one in, say, 2008. The worst busts in the market tend to follow times of untrammeled excess. The so-so economy of the last few years could stop stocks from tipping into a long slough in the market.Or as Mr. Rosenberg put it: “Without the boom, you don’t get the bear.”A version of this article appears in print on June 24, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: As Greece Calms, Investors Find Other Concerns .
