LONDON —  Oil prices quickly gave back early gains to close lower on Monday after investor concerns about Middle East tensions gave way to a continued focus on weaknesses in global economies.Earlier in the day, a growing conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran worried investors, sending oil prices higher during the European trading day.In the past, a flare-up in the Middle East could send oil prices soaring, but investors these days seem mainly focused on a global glut of petroleum. With so much oil on the world market, even the biggest producer — Saudi Arabia — has only a limited ability to affect prices.The moderate price reaction to a feud between two of the world’s major oil producers shows how much the dynamics of the oil market have changed in the last two years.AdvertisementIn the broader markets, traders were focused on economic data from China, where equity markets declined sharply on Monday.AdvertisementThe signs of a slowdown in China, the world’s biggest economy after the United States, is weighing on prices of various commodities, including oil.Brent crude oil futures for February, the main international benchmark, settled 6 cents lower at $37.22 a barrel. It had risen as much as 4 percent in Europe on Monday.In the United States, benchmark crude oil briefly traded over $38, but closed at $36.76 a barrel.The friction between the Iranian and Saudi governments did serve as a reminder that, despite the sharp fall in oil prices over the last two years, the Middle East, which produces almost one-third of the world’s crude, remains a volatile region.“What is coming back to the surface is how deeply divided and complex the Middle East is at present,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm in London.If anything, the Saudi-Iranian tensions might simply emphasize the considerable disarray in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.OPEC nations, instead of banding together to limit production and raise prices, are scrambling to discount oil in a battle for customers, like China and India.Brent crude, the main international benchmark, was trading around $ a barrel on .
	The American benchmark was at around $ a barrel.
	This is why oil prices have dropped so much since 2014.It is now a matter of “the winner gaining market share and the loser being squeezed out,” analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients on Monday.AdvertisementIran, along with Venezuela, has called for production cuts to prop up prices — entreaties that the Saudis and their Arab allies like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have ignored. Despite the depressed oil prices, OPEC members at their most recent meeting in early December were unable to agree on anything of substance, including a production target.“An agreement to cut production has already eluded OPEC for more than a year; this latest disagreement seems to put it further out of reach at this time,” said Bhushan Bahree, a Washington-based analyst at IHS, a research firm.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
