HONG KONG — Gambling revenue in Macau plunged a record 49 percent last month, as wealthy players shied away from China’s only legal casino hub amid an economic slowdown and a crackdown by Beijing on conspicuous spending.Revenue fell for the ninth consecutive month to 19.5 billion patacas, or $2.4 billion, in February, from 38 billion patacas a year earlier, according to data released by Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.“We believe the biggest culprit for the weak month was the already-troubled V.I.P. segment,” said Grant Govertsen, an analyst at the research firm Union Gaming Research Macau. “Ultimately, while we believe there was a pickup in V.I.P. headcount, gaming volumes just weren’t there.”A crackdown on corruption led by President Xi Jinping of China — a campaign that also aims at the illicit outflow of money from the country — could be blamed for the revenue decline in Macau, according to casino executives and analysts.AdvertisementMacau casino stocks listed in Hong Kong rose between 1 percent and 3.5 percent on Tuesday. The decline in February’s revenue was within the range of 45 percent to 55 percent expected by analysts.AdvertisementShares have dropped 4 percent to   9 percent since the start of this year, sharply underperforming the benchmark Hang Seng index, which was up 5 percent for the same period.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
