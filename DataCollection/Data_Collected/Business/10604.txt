These recommendations come at a tough time for climate advocates, still reeling from the prospect of a presidential administration in the United States hostile to steps to address climate change.With little prospect for new rule making in the United States and slow progress elsewhere, the task force urged corporations to disclose climate risks voluntarily.In particular, the group calls for all companies to undergo what are essentially stress tests to see how their businesses would fare under the 2-degrees Celsius warming situation laid out under the Paris climate accord. Companies should disclose their findings in their financial statements, the guidelines say, treating any foreseeable dangers as material risks to their business just like risks posed by market or currency swings.“Climate change is not only an environmental problem, but a business one as well,” said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, who headed the task force.The guidelines follow a stark warning last year by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, who said oil companies risked setting off a financial crisis because of their blindness to climate risks.If the world seriously intended to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, he said, most of Earth’s coal, oil and gas reserves would need to remain in the ground, rendering a substantial bulk of those assets worthless. Add to that other global corporations that will face growing losses from flooding, drought and other severe effects of climate change in the coming years, he said, and there was the real danger of a systemic shock to the world economy.Mr. Carney’s warnings, the gravest to come from a top financial official, prompted Group of 20 to commission global guidelines on how corporations should disclose climate-related risks. And the resulting recommendations have some powerful backers.Among its advisers are executives from some of the world’s biggest investment banks, credit agencies and other multinational corporations, including JPMorgan Chase, the mining company BHP Billiton and the Indian conglomerate Tata Steel. Mary Schapiro, the former head of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, is a special adviser.The guidelines remain voluntary, however, and are unlikely to be readily adopted by the oil and gas companies that they most target. Critics say that volatile oil prices and uncertainty over what regulators might do make predicting the value of oil reserves extremely tricky.The 2-degree scenario laid out in Paris has come under doubt amid fears the incoming Donald J. Trump administration will renege on commitments and dismantle other climate-friendly policies. Mr. Trump has appointed fossil fuel advocates to crucial posts in his office, including Myron Ebell, a climate change skeptic, to lead the transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency.Still, the recommendations speak to a broader public concern over climate change risks to companies.The New York and Massachusetts state attorneys general are investigating whether Exxon Mobil appropriately values its oil and gas reserves in light of the recent slump in oil prices and global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The S.E.C. has started a similar inquiry against the oil company.Activist shareholders have increasingly pressured corporations to disclose climate-related risks, with some early victories. The fossil fuel companies Shell and BHP Billiton have released studies of the impact a 2-degree warming situation would have on their sprawling operations.The stakes are high, according to recent estimates. Under a scenario that would limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius, oil company revenue could fall by more than $22 trillion over the next 25 years, Barclays predicted last year.Advertisement
