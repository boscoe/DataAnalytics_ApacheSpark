The department store chain said on Friday that its losses narrowed in the second quarter on better-than-expected sales, fueled by men’s clothing, fine jewelry and the beauty brand Sephora. J. C. Penney lost $138 million, or 45 cents a share, for the quarter that ended Aug. 1. That compares with a loss of $172 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Losses, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were 41 cents a share. Revenue rose 2.7 percent to $2.88 billion, a little more than expected. Shares of the company increased nearly 5 percent in afternoon trading. “It’s clear that when we execute well, we can deliver profitable sales and take market share,” said Marvin Ellison, a former Home Depot executive who took over as chief executive on Aug. 1.
