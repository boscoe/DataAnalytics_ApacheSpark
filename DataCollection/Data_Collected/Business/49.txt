WASHINGTON —  The pace of growth at factories in the United States slowed in September, a sign that the chill falling over the global economy could complicate the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates.Other data on Thursday pointed to a tightening labor market and stronger spending on home construction, highlighting the split in the economy between strong domestic growth and weakness abroad.This is causing headaches at the Fed, which cited concerns last month about “global economic and financial developments” when it surprised much of Wall Street by holding off on raising rates.

The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 50.2, its lowest since May 2013. While any reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, growth has slowed sharply over the last year as a strong dollar has crimped exports.AdvertisementThe weakness was widespread. Only seven industries out of 18 tracked by the index reported growth, including printing, textiles, furniture, food and beverages, paper products and minerals. The 11 that shrank included steel and other metals, clothing, oil and coal products, wood products, electrical equipment and appliances, machinery and computers.AdvertisementA slowdown in China is dragging on global growth. The I.S.M.’s index for exports held steady at 46.5, the fourth straight monthly contraction in activity.Despite the weakness abroad, America’s domestic economy and the labor market have appeared on more solid footing, which has bolstered expectations that the Fed could increase rates this year or in early 2016.

The Labor Department said the number of new applications for jobless benefits rose modestly last week, although they remained near 15-year lows and a gauge of the trend in claims fell.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week that ended Sept. 26.“Filings at this level are incredibly low by historical standards, speaking to how tight labor markets are getting,” said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.Small businesses added 0.18 worker per firm in September, the best growth this year, the National Federation of Independent Business said in a report. America’s monthly employment report, due on Friday, is expected to show 203,000 positions added to payrolls last month, a pickup from the pace in August.Construction spending in the United States climbed in August to the highest level since 2008, the Commerce Department said in a separate report.A version of this article appears in print on October 2, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Factory Growth Slows, Muddying Waters for Fed.
