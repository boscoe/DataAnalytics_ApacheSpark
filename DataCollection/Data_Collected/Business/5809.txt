He noted improvements in the bank’s markets business and in its commercial banking in Britain and Hong Kong.Mr. Gulliver said that loan impairment charges were significantly lower in the first quarter, particularly in Europe and North America.HSBC set aside $570 million for bad and underperforming loans in the quarter, down from $798 million in the first quarter of 2014.The quarter also included $43 million in restructuring charges, $139 million in regulatory provisions and $137 million for programs to compensate consumers who were improperly sold loan protection insurance and other products in Britain.HSBC announced last month that it intended to formally review whether to move its headquarters from Britain. The bank, which traces its roots to Hong Kong, generates more than half of its earnings from Asia and faces a shifting regulatory landscape that includes a bank tax that has hit lenders based in Britain particularly hard.On a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, Mr. Gulliver provided additional insight into the bank’s reason for reviewing its domicile now, noting it has become increasingly difficult to continue to raise its dividend as the bank levy has increased.“The process to review the holding company is clearly informed by that,” he said.The British tax, known as a bank levy, was put in place in 2010 to help finance government efforts to rescue the financial system, but it has also generated revenue for other programs here. Banks based in Britain are taxed on their global balance sheet, while their overseas competitors are taxed only on their British operations.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.The bank tax cost HSBC $1.1 billion last year, and politicians, in the prelude to the general election in Britain this month, have promised to keep the tax or raise it to help pay for social programs.Mr. Gulliver said the tax on HSBC would most likely increase to $1.5 billion this year and could rise even higher if the Labour Party wins a majority on Thursday. The bank levy has been raised nine times since it was introduced.That said, it wouldn’t be the same kind of issue for HSBC if the industry was operating in a more normal interest-rate environment, particularly with interest rates moving into negative territory in parts of Europe, Mr. Gulliver said.“If interest rates were to rise and we generated a ton more revenue, some of the pressure of the bank levy drops away,” Mr. Gulliver said.Mr. Gulliver also said that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the market regulator in Hong Kong, had the “technical capability” to serve as HSBC’s regulator and already oversees 70 to 80 percent of its profits.Hong Kong remains deeply tied to HSBC, which was founded there in 1865 as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. The lender moved its headquarters to Britain in 1993 after its acquisition of Midland Bank.The bank’s shares are primarily traded in Hong Kong and in London, and its executives often conduct earnings calls from Hong Kong, as they did on Tuesday.In recent years, HSBC, like many of its competitors, has moved to streamline its operations and exit riskier businesses, but it has struggled to raise its profits amid increased scrutiny by regulators. The bank is expected to update the market on its strategy on June 9.In the first quarter, HSBC said revenue was flat at $15.9 billion.Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined to $8.27 billion in the quarter, from $8.72 billion in the first quarter of 2014.Expenses were flat at $8.85 billion.Pretax profit in its investment bank, known as Global Banking and Markets, increased 5.9 percent to $3.04 billion in the first quarter, from $2.87 billion in the same period a year earlier.In its commercial banking business, pretax profit declined 5.8 percent to $2.28 billion, from $2.42 billion in the first quarter of 2014. In its retail and wealth management business, pretax profit declined 5.2 percent to $1.62 billion in the first quarter, from $1.71 billion in the same period a year earlier.In Asia, which accounts for 61 percent of the bank’s pretax earnings, pretax profit rose 15.2 percent to $4.33 billion.Advertisement
