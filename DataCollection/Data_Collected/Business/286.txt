Under British law, the proposals so far have not been considered formal offers.The latest rejection came despite support for the deal from the American tobacco giant Altria Group, which owns about 27 percent of SABMiller. The offer includes an option for Altria and other investors to accept a portion of the offer in restricted shares instead of cash.“Notwithstanding our good-faith efforts, the board of SABMiller has refused to meaningfully engage with us,” Carlos Brito, Anheuser-Busch InBev’s chief executive, said in a news release. “Our proposal creates significant value for everybody.”“How long will it be before shareholders see a value of over GBP 42 in the absence of an offer from AB InBev?” he added. “If shareholders agree that we should be in proper discussions, they should voice their views and should not allow the board of SABMiller to frustrate this process and let this opportunity slip away.”On Thursday, a spokesman for SABMiller said, “We’ve noted their announcement, it contains nothing new.”Under the terms of the latest bid, Anheuser-Busch InBev said it would be willing to pay 42.15 pounds, or about $64.40, a share in cash for SABMiller. That would value the company at as much as $104 billion.But the bid includes a precondition that would require SABMiller’s largest shareholders to agree to support the deal and accept shares in lieu of cash at a rate of £37.49 a share, a discount to the cash price. As a result, Anheuser-Busch InBev would most likely pay £65.1 billion, or about $99 billion.By offering an option to accept a portion of the deal in shares, Anheuser-Busch InBev is hoping to entice SABMiller’s two largest shareholders — Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia — to accept the deal. Both would face huge tax bills if they sold their holdings.The share offer would consist of a restricted class of up to 326 million Anheuser-Busch InBev shares. The stock would be unlisted and convertible into regular Anheuser-Busch InBev shares after a five-year lockup period, Anheuser-Busch InBev said.Shares of SABMiller closed up less than 1 percent to £36.41 in trading in London on Wednesday. In trading in Brussels, shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev ended down nearly 1.2 percent, at 97.50 euros.On Wednesday, SABMiller’s board, excluding directors nominated by Altria, rejected the latest proposal, saying in a news release that the revised bid “still very substantially undervalues SABMiller, its unique and unmatched footprint, and its stand-alone prospects.”Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Wednesday that it “does not currently have the support” of the Santo Domingo family, whose BevCo owns 14 percent.The deal, if it were to be completed, would create a combined company with $64 billion in annual revenue that commands 30 percent of global beer sales.It would also bring some of the world’s most popular beers under one roof, including Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, and SABMiller’s Miller Lite, Peroni Nastro Azzurro and Grolsch.Any deal between the brewing giants would most likely face significant regulatory scrutiny, given the breadth of their combined beer brands and their dominance in the United States and other countries.“Together with its advisers, AB InBev has done significant work on regulatory matters and has identified solutions that provide a clear path to closing,” Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Thursday. “AB InBev intends to work proactively with regulators to resolve any concerns.”Advertisement
