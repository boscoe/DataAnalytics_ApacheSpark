PepsiCo says it is dropping the artificial sweetener aspartame from Diet Pepsi in response to customer worries. To replace it, the company will use sucralose, an artificial sweetener commonly known as Splenda. Driving the decision is the fact that Americans are losing their taste for diet sodas. Executives at Pepsi, and rival Coke, attribute declines in sales to the perception that the sweetener isn’t safe. “Aspartame is the No. 1 reason consumers are dropping diet soda,” said Seth Kaufman, a vice president at Pepsi. The Food and Drug Administration says there are more than 100 studies supporting the safety of aspartame, known by the brand names Equal and NutraSweet. Reformulated Diet Pepsi will start hitting shelves in August. The change only applies to the United States market and will affect all varieties of Diet Pepsi, including Wild Cherry Diet Pepsi.A version of this brief appears in print on April 25, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Pepsi Drops Aspartame From Diet Pepsi Varieties.
