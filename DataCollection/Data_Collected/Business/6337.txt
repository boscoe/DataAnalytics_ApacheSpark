AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedWhen Comcast swooped in with an offer to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion last year, a small platoon of advisers for Charter Communications found themselves out of a huge payday.Now, as Charter clinches a deal to acquire Time Warner Cable in the wake of Comcast’s failure last month, those banks and law firms will finally reap those fees.Advising Charter in its $56.7 billion deal were the same group of firms that guided the cable company last time: Goldman Sachs, LionTree Advisors, Guggenheim Securities, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Kirkland & Ellis.Time Warner Cable’s advisers — Morgan Stanley, Allen & Company, Centerview Partners, Citigroup and the law firms Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Latham & Watkins; and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — will also earn a big payout.Both sets of advisers looked to lose out in the tumult that has roiled cable deal-making over the last year. Charter’s army of banks and law firms appeared to have lost out last spring to their competitors who sided with Comcast, including JPMorgan Chase and PJT Partners.And Time Warner Cable’s coterie of banks and law firms briefly lost out when Comcast withdrew its takeover for the cable operator last month amid opposition from government regulators.The deal announced on Tuesday will provide a helpful boost to the banks’ standings in the mergers league tables. Goldman ranks first and Morgan Stanley second, according to Thomson Reuters, while Bank of America stands at fourth and Citi at fifth.Benefiting even more from the merger will be the boutique investment banks, which focus only on deals and don’t have financing arms. Centerview ranks sixth in Thomson Reuters’ league tables, while Guggenheim will place 10th, LionTree 14th and Allen & Company 16th.LionTree, which is run by Aryeh Bourkoff, a media and telecommunications specialist, had an especially prominent role in the rapid-fire deal-making in the American cable landscape. Besides advising Charter, the boutique also helped Suddenlink in its $9 billion sale to the European telecommunications company Altice.Last year, the firm did not even rank in the top 25.Advertisement
