PlayBuzz, a website and online platform for creating quizzes, lists and surveys, which has been ranked as one of the most shared sites on Facebook, said on Wednesday that it had raised $16 million in a fresh round of financing.In recent months PlayBuzz, which was founded in 2012 and allows readers to create their own content, shot to the top of a ranking of news sites on Facebook conducted by the analytics firm NewsWhip, placing it among established names like The Huffington Post, BuzzFeed and The New York Times.Stories on the site Wednesday included “Which Kardashian’s Blond Hair Do You Like the Most?” and “How Well Do You Know Justin Bieber?”Arnon Dinur, a partner at the venture capital fund 83North, which led the round of investment, said in an interview that his firm had been drawn to the company because it provided a means for any website to attract and engage readers. “Literally anybody on the planet with users who wants to create a more engaging experience will be able to go to PlayBuzz and get the tools,” he said.AdvertisementMr. Dinur said that he would be happy to see PlayBuzz diversify, but that for now its reliance on Facebook for a large chunk of its traffic is “also an opportunity.”PlayBuzz’s co-founder and chief executive is Shaul Olmert, the son of the former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel.AdvertisementFacebook, with nearly 1.4 billion monthly active users, according to its own figures, has the heft to make or break other sites. Last August it adjusted its algorithm to reduce what it called “click bait” — items with a beguiling headline to draw readers in, but not much more.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
