ABN Amro is up to the finance minister, and only the finance minister,” an ABN Amro spokesman said. “He is postponing his decision on a potential I.P.O. We will await further notice on what the next steps will be.”The uproar over pay comes as Dutch lawmakers have taken a much tougher stance on compensation for members of the finance industry, even tougher than bonus caps put in place by its European peers.Dutch lawmakers enacted a cap on bonuses this year for employees in the banking, insurance and other finance sectors that limits so-called variable pay to 20 percent of their fixed salary.In its annual report last week, ABN Amro said its supervisory board approved a “temporary fixed allowance” of €100,000 for six eligible members of its managing board, raising their base salaries to €707,500.Gerrit Zalm, the ABN Amro chairman, wasn’t eligible for the allowance. Mr. Zalm was paid a base salary of €759,375 in 2014.Managing board members were eligible for this €100,000 allowance in 2012 and in 2013, but previously waived it, ABN Amro said in its report.The managing board members are not eligible to receive variable allowances, essentially annual bonuses, while the lender is receiving government support.The bank’s underlying profit, which excludes certain special items, more than doubled in 2014, to €1.55 billion from €752 million in 2013.Advertisement
