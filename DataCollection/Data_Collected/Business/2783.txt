In its quest to go global, the online file-sharing giant Dropbox has again turned to deal-making.Dropbox has acquired CloudOn, a start-up that allows users to create Microsoft Office documents online, the two companies disclosed late on Tuesday. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Armed with hundreds of millions of dollars in financing raised from an army of investors, Dropbox has occasionally used acquisitions to bolster its reach and services. So far, the company — one of Silicon Valley’s “unicorns,” with a $10 billion valuation — has made 19 takeovers, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.Among those deals were the purchases of the mobile mail app Mailbox.Now Dropbox has purchased CloudOn, a nearly six-year-old start-up whose engineering team is based in Herzliya, Israel. CloudOn allows its nine million users to create Microsoft Word and Excel documents on their mobile devices. Before its sale, it raised more than $26 million from investors like Foundation Capital and Rembrandt Venture Partners.Now it will serve as Dropbox’s outpost in Israel as the file-sharing service expands its international presence under Dennis Woodside, a longtime Google executive who joined the company last year. In a blog post announcing the transaction, CloudOn said it planned to shut down its service as it is integrated into its new corporate parent.“Today, we’re taking the next step toward our vision of reimagining docs – by joining the Dropbox team,” the company wrote in the post. “Our companies share similar values, are committed to helping people work better, and together we can make an even greater impact.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/22/2015, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Bolstering its Reach.
