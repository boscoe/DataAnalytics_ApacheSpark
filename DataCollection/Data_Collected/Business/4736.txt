SchwartzThe United States economy grew at a rate of slightly more than 2 percent as 2014 drew to a close, but economists fear some of that momentum flagged in the first quarter of this year.At an annualized rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Commerce Department’s estimate of growth in the period, released Friday, was unchanged from an earlier estimate released in late February.This was the final revision by government statisticians who track the economy’s performance at the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Before the report, economists on Wall Street had expected the growth rate to be revised upward to 2.4 percent.While decent, the economy’s performance in October, November and December 2014 was well below the 5 percent pace of growth in the third quarter and the 4.6 percent rate in the second quarter.Even so, at 2.2 percent, the pace of economic expansion late last year represents healthier growth than is likely to be seen in the current quarter, which ends Tuesday.Although the job market has been showing real signs of life, with the unemployment rate’s falling to 5.5 percent in February as employers hired 295,000 new workers, other yardsticks have been anemic.This week, the government reported that durable goods orders fell last month, and retail sales had also been weak, despite consumers’ having more cash in their pockets because of lower energy prices.One positive factor last year, rising exports, has faded recently, hurt by a strong dollar and weak conditions in key overseas markets like Europe and Brazil. In particular, the decline of the euro against the dollar has made American-made goods more expensive for European consumers.Different components of economic performance within the report did change, but in the end, the overall effect of increased estimates in some sectors was canceled out by downward revisions in others.For example, the estimates for consumer spending and exports were revised slightly upward, but they were effectively washed out by slower inventory additions than first thought. In late 2014, the government said Friday, consumer spending increased at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.4 percent, better than the previous 4.2 percent estimate made last month.Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS, said smaller stockpiles than initially estimated for last quarter actually suggested slightly healthier growth in the current quarter.“Less inventory is good for the future because it provides a little tailwind for future production,” he said. “If you’re going to have downward revisions, it’s better to have it be in inventories than anything else.”Still, like other economists on Wall Street, he foresees a slow start to growth in 2015, estimating that economic output will rise in the first quarter at an annual rate of just over 1 percent. He cautions that the cold winter most likely held back consumer spending, as did a weakening trade balance and potentially lower business investment, especially in the energy sector.Mr. Berger expects the economy’s arc to rise later in the year, with the growth rate average just over 3 percent in the second half of the year, helped by healthier consumer spending.In a separate report Friday morning, the University of Michigan’s monthly survey of consumer sentiment showed a small dip to 93 in March from 95.4 in February, but that was slightly better than experts had expected.Despite the lagging pace of economic growth, consumers have been encouraged recently by a stronger job market and falling gasoline prices. In January, the Michigan index rose to 98.1, its best reading in more than a decade, although a modest rebound in energy prices since then has tempered that enthusiasm.The downshift in early 2015 has echoes of the economy’s performance in the first quarter of 2014, when very cold temperatures and snow were blamed for a 2.1 percent contraction in output.Growth did pick up subsequently last year, but the on-again, off-again pattern of the recovery has frustrated experts and ordinary Americans alike, after years of predictions that sustained gains were finally at hand.On Wednesday, after the durable goods figures were released, Barclays cut its tracking estimate of first-quarter growth to 1.2 percent, as did Macroeconomic Advisers, a widely followed forecasting firm. As recently as Feb. 10, Macroeconomic Advisers had been looking for growth of 2.4 percent in the first quarter.Next week, the economic picture will become a bit clearer, with data due April 3 on job creation and unemployment in March. Figures for the trade balance, home sales, personal consumption and construction in February are set to come out earlier in the week.Advertisement
