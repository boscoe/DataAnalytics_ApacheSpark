(BMI), known as performing rights organizations, collect money for songwriters and music publishers whenever their songs are publicly performed, whether on the radio, on television, in retail stores, bars, restaurants or on streaming services.Since Ascap and BMI are collectives that sell music rights at set prices, they have long been under antitrust scrutiny, and since 1941 they have been bound by regulatory agreements called consent decrees. Two years ago, both organizations asked the Justice Department to change these agreements, saying they needed to be updated to secure fair royalty rates in the digital era.The Justice Department said it had decided not to make any changes to the consent decrees. But it added a requirement, saying that for Ascap and BMI to comply with the existing regulations, they must offer “100 percent licensing” of their songs.Many songs have multiple writers, and those writers don’t always belong to the same rights society. According to the government’s proposal, if a song has, say, three writers — one affiliated with Ascap, one with BMI and the other with one of the smaller, unregulated groups like Sesac or Global Music Rights — then for Ascap or BMI to offer that song to radio stations and digital services, it would need to have legal clearance to represent the song and be responsible for getting the writers their share of the royalties.Music industry groups say the proposed requirement would break with decades of practice, causing turmoil and possibly even violating private contracts. They argue that the performing rights organizations have long represented only the fractions of songs that they control, and that for a radio station or digital service to be properly licensed, it must have deals in place with the various groups representing any portion of a song.In a filing with the Justice Department, Ascap said the government’s proposed rule could also cast doubt on whether it would actually be able to license as many as 370,000 of the more than 10 million songs in its catalog, which would cause headaches for any music outlets that wanted to play them. And musicians — like Max Martin, who has written blockbuster hits for the likes of Taylor Swift and Britney Spears — say it could interfere with their creative process, causing complications when they collaborate with a writer who is a member of a different rights organization.Broadcasters and tech groups dispute this. In their view, offering entire works is the only way to have a fair marketplace and prevent the monopoly power that consent decrees were put in place to block.Some executives and analysts in the music industry said the government’s proposed changes would drive down the amount of money artists received because it would give an incentive to groups like broadcasters and streaming services to shop for the lowest royalty rates. Advocates for technology companies say that by helping keep costs down, this will lead to more consumer choice.Others say it is too soon to know how the ruling could affect things. Justice Department officials said they expect Ascap and BMI to compete to retain members, which should prevent rates from dropping.One area in which the effect of the new ruling is unclear is unregulated competitors like Global Music Rights, started three years ago by the music executive Irving Azoff. It represents top writers like Pharrell Williams, Bruno Mars and members of the Eagles. On one hand, carrying out the “100 percent licensing” rule would seemingly undermine that company’s leverage to demand higher rates for any songs that were co-written with a member of Ascap or BMI. But music executives also say that the model of Global Music Rights and Sesac may now become more attractive for top writers who are unhappy with the new rules for Ascap and BMI.The Justice Department is giving the music industry a year to comply with its new requirements. It is unclear how this would happen, but industry executives say it could include the creation of new databases to share data that previously was proprietary.Mike O’Neill, the chief executive of BMI, said in a statement announcing the group’s legal challenge that the government’s decision “serves no one, not the marketplace, the music publishers, the music users and most importantly, not our songwriters and composers who now have the government weighing in on their creative and financial decisions.”But the challenge may be difficult because the judges who monitor Ascap and BMI have made tough rulings in recent years. Another possibility is that major publishers like Universal and Sony/ATV could withdraw completely from Ascap and BMI, moves that would severely weaken those groups and add yet more uncertainty in the world of music licensing. For the music companies and the outlets that need music, that is an outcome they would prefer to avoid.Advertisement
