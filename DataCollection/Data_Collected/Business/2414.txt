Encouraging economic news and a rare rise in oil prices on Wednesday helped give the stock market its first gain of the year.Major indexes started climbing from the opening bell after a report from ADP, the payroll processor, that showed that businesses hired more workers last month. Companies added 241,000 workers in December, an increase from the previous month.The increase offered more evidence that the economy in the United States was on steady ground, and it gave investors another reason to jump back into the market after five consecutive days of losses, said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.All three major indexes climbed more than 1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 23.29 points to close at 2,025.90. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 212.88 points to 17,584.52, and the Nasdaq gained 57.73 points to 4,650.47.AdvertisementBefore Wednesday, falling oil prices and concerns about the global economy had knocked the S.&P. 500 down 2.7 percent, its worst start to a year since 2008.AdvertisementThe recent turbulence is most likely just a pause in the stock market’s steady run, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“It’s perfectly normal market activity,” Mr. Arone said. “Things tend not to go up or down in a straight line.”Major markets in Europe also ended higher for the first time this week. Germany’s DAX closed with a gain of 0.5 percent and France’s CAC 40 rose 0.7 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.8 percent.Consumer prices in Europe fell 0.2 percent in December, the first drop since 2009. After the report came out, the euro slipped to $1.1833 from $1.1890.Markets barely moved after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting. Fed officials discussed various risks to the economy, but concluded that the recent big drop in oil prices was likely to end up increasing growth.The price of oil stabilized near a six-year low. American crude oil rose 72 cents to close at $48.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The gain, which followed news of a decline in inventories, was only the second in nine trading days.Crude oil has fallen by more than half since June as supplies rose. Lower energy costs are a boon to consumers and businesses, but some see the plunge as a worrying sign of weakness in the global economy.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They’re very good.”Among other companies in the news on Wednesday, J. C. Penney soared $1.33, or 20 percent, to $7.89 after the troubled retail chain posted solid sales late Tuesday. For the nine-week holiday shopping season, the company reported sales growth of nearly 4 percent over the same period in 2013.Eli Lilly predicted higher revenue and earnings this year as it tried to recover from the loss of patents protecting important drugs. But the forecast fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s stock fell 49 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $69.23.In the bond market, prices for government bonds fell, nudging yields up. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note crept up to 1.97 percent from 1.94 percent the day before.In the commodity markets, precious and industrial metals dipped. Gold fell $8.70 to $1,210.70 an ounce, silver sank 9 cents to $15.54 an ounce and copper lost less than a penny to $2.76 a pound.Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many American refineries, rose 5 cents to close at $51.15 in London.In other futures trading, wholesale gasoline fell 1.6 cents to close at $1.338 a gallon; heating oil fell 2.7 cents to close at $1.699 a gallon; and natural gas fell 6.7 cents to close at $2.871 per 1,000 cubic feet.A version of this article appears in print on January 8, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Shares Rise on Hiring Report, Interrupting a String of Losses.
