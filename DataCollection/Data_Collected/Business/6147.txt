The filing names several vendors from Alibaba’s sites and says they copied Kering brand names in products that were shipped to New York.Alibaba has long contended that the scale of its e-commerce platform — China’s largest — makes it difficult to closely monitor the goods being sold there. Still, after a run-in with China’s main corporate regulator in January over unlicensed and unregistered vendors selling knockoffs, the company said it would increase the thousands of staff members that it said it used to monitor its shopping sites.“We continue to work in partnership with numerous brands to help them protect their intellectual property, and we have a strong track record of doing so,” the company said on Monday. “We believe this complaint has no basis and we will fight it vigorously.”Before the latest lawsuit, filed on Friday, Kering had sued Alibaba over similar claims in 2014. That suit was dropped after two weeks.“This lawsuit is part of Kering’s ongoing global effort to maintain its customers’ trust in its genuine products and to continue to develop the creative works and talents in its brands,” the company said in an email on Monday.Alibaba’s extremely popular Taobao e-commerce website has for years served as a bazaar for all types of goods sold by large companies, small businesses and individuals from their homes. As a result, the sale of fake goods and close knockoffs of major Western brands has thrived there.Yet the Chinese company has made inroads in convincing the United States that it is fighting counterfeits. In 2012, the United States trade representative removed Taobao from its list of “notorious markets” based on what it said was progress that the company had made in cleaning up its sites. The removal of Taobao from the list came shortly after the company hired James Mendenhall, a general counsel for the trade representative’s office during the administration of President George W. Bush, to lead the company in talks over intellectual property rights with the United States government.Some luxury brands have addressed the issue by opening stores on Alibaba’s Tmall site, which hosts shopping pages for branded companies and other larger merchants. But many luxury companies prefer to maintain control over the distribution channels of their goods and have refrained from selling products on the platform.Gerry Doyle contributed reporting.Advertisement
