See how some of the most popular companies stack up against one another.Apple Music was introduced on June 30 in more than 100 countries with a trial plan that gave each user three months of access free. After that period ends, the service will cost $10 a month. Of the 11 million sign-ups, two million are for family plans that will cost $15 a month and give access for up to six people, said Mr. Cue, Apple’s senior vice president for Internet software and services.In an earnings call with investors last month, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said only that “millions and millions” of people had signed up for the new service.The meaning of Apple Music’s numbers is already being debated in music industry circles. Its 11 million users immediately makes Apple Music a major destination for online music; Spotify, its biggest competitor as a subscription outlet, has 75 million users, 20 million of whom pay, and has been in operation for seven years.But it remains to be seen how many of Apple Music’s new users will continue after their trial periods end and pay for streaming music. That will not become clear until at least October, when the free access for Apple Music’s first customers begins to expire.Advertisement
