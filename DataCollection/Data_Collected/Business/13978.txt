Monsanto rejected Bayer’s $62 billion takeover offer on Tuesday, calling the takeover approach by the German giant too low.But Monsanto, the top producer of genetically modified crop seeds, said it was “open to continued and constructive conversations” about a potential merger of the two.Putting the two together would yield a giant in the business of agriculture, creating a one-stop shop for farmers that runs from genetically modified organism crops to pesticides.The rejection came as little surprise to analysts and investors. Shares of Monsanto have consistently traded below Bayer’s all-cash offer of $122 a share since Bayer, a German company, formally unveiled its offer on Monday.Shares of Monsanto rose about 2 percent in trading on Tuesday afternoon, to $108 each.A version of this article appears in print on May 25, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Monsanto Refuses Bayer’s $62 Billion Bid, but Proposes More Talks.
