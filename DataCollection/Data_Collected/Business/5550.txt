Although revenue rose 24 percent, to 10.4 billion euros, in the quarter, profit fell because of the 1.5 billion euros that the bank set aside to cover a legal settlement with United States and British regulators and law enforcement authorities.On Thursday, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay penalties totaling $2.5 billion to settle charges it had colluded with other banks to manipulate benchmark interest rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The rate is used to set the rates on credit cards, mortgages, student loans and trillions of dollars in other debt.The impact of the penalty overshadowed a rebound in Deutsche Bank’s investment banking unit. The bank said that revenue generated from trading stocks, bonds and currencies was the best it has been in years. Revenue from investment banking rose 15 percent, to 4.7 billion euros, but profit plunged more than half to 643 million euros after subtracting the penalty.Deutsche Bank “is much stronger than when we began our journey in 2012,” Jürgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the co-chief executives, said in a statement, referring to the year when they took office.“We embark on the next phase of our strategy from a position of strength,” they said. That was a reference to a planned reorganization of the bank, broad outlines of which were disclosed on Friday.Deutsche Bank said late Friday that it would spin off its Postbank network of bank branches in Germany and scale back the size of its investment bank as it responds to increased pressure from regulators.The decision to sell Postbank, which offers retail banking services from German post offices, signals a retreat from Deutsche Bank’s ambition to be a so-called universal bank, serving residents of small towns in Germany as well as hedge funds on Wall Street.Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen have scheduled a news conference for Monday morning in Frankfurt to discuss the reorganization in more detail. They are expected to say that Deutsche Bank will retain a network of branches in Germany and some other countries using the Deutsche Bank brand.The branches will focus on services to wealthy clients, according to German news reports. Postbank, by contrast, offers basic banking services at German post offices.Deutsche Bank had previously set aside money to cover the investigation into interest rate fixing, but increased the amount by 1.5 billion euros last week after the penalty turned out to be larger than expected.Deutsche Bank faces other legal troubles, including investigations into allegations of currency manipulation and violations of United States sanctions against countries like Iran. The bank said on Sunday that it still had reserves of 4.8 billion euros at the end of the quarter to cover future penalties and legal expenses.Pressure from regulators has made it more difficult for Deutsche Bank to reconcile risky investment banking activities with the steadier but less profitable business of taking deposits and writing loans. That led to the decision to spin off Postbank, which it acquired in 2008.Deutsche Bank has been constrained by perceptions that the investment banking business, based in London and New York, risked the savings of ordinary Germans.Deutsche Bank is one of the last big banks in Europe to bow to pressure from regulators to become less risky and to rely less on borrowed money. Other banks like UniCredit in Italy, UBS in Switzerland and Barclays in Britain have sharply reduced the size of their investment banks and their Wall Street profiles.On Friday, representatives of workers protested the spinoff of Postbank, saying the reorganization would lead to job cuts.But representatives of Deutsche Bank employees, who, in accordance with German law, hold half the seats on the supervisory board, said later that they supported the plan.The union that represents Deutsche Bank employees, known as ver.di, said that selling Postbank on the stock market offered the best chance to preserve jobs.“Against a background of increasing regulatory requirements,” the union said in a statement on Friday, “‘business as usual’ is no longer possible.”Advertisement
