LONDON — A British jury has convicted three former employees of Barclays of plotting to improve the bank’s trading results by “dishonestly rigging” an important benchmark interest rate known as Libor.The trial, the third in Britain to focus on the scandal involving the London interbank offered rate, followed a half-decade investigation that led to billions of dollars in fines and shook the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks, including Deutsche Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS, as well as Barclays.The conviction at Southwark Crown Court in London last week of the three men, among five former Barclays employees on trial, came after prosecutors suffered a setback in January. At the time, a jury in a separate case acquitted six former brokers at other financial institutions of helping a former trader at UBS and Citigroup manipulate Libor. The former trader, Tom Hayes, was convicted of criminal charges in August.To set Libor and other rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities. Libor is used to price more than $300 trillion in securities.AdvertisementIn the latest case, the Serious Fraud Office of Britain claimed that a group of Barclays derivative traders in New York and London conspired with rate submitters in London to try to manipulate the benchmark interest rate.AdvertisementThe conspiracy was intended to increase the profits traders made from interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts with so-called counterparties, which could include other banks, governments and pension funds, prosecutors said.Two former Barclays traders, Jay Vijay Merchant and Alex Pabon, as well as Jonathan J. Mathew, a former rate submitter at the bank, were each convicted on a charge of conspiracy to defraud.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            “The key issue in this case was dishonesty,” said David Green, director of the Serious Fraud Office. “By their verdicts, the jury demonstrated they were sure that the conduct of three of the defendants, Jonathan Mathew, Jay Merchant and Alex Pabon, was dishonest.”The jury, which began its deliberations on June 20, was unable to reach a verdict regarding two other former Barclays employees, the former traders Stylianos Contogoulas and Ryan Michael Reich, and it was discharged on Monday.Sentencing is expected later this week.The convictions were delivered on Wednesday, but the court restricted the news media from divulging them until after the jury had concluded its deliberations regarding Mr. Contogoulas and Mr. Reich. The Serious Fraud Office will now have two weeks to determine whether to pursue a retrial of the two.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That order was lifted in May, ahead of his testimony in the case.AdvertisementBarclays, the first bank to settle the matter, paid $450 million in penalties. The ensuing scandal ultimately cost Robert E. Diamond Jr., then the bank’s chief executive, his job.So far, British prosecutors have had mixed results in their efforts to pursue criminal charges in the Libor matter. Mr. Hayes, the former UBS and Citigroup trader, is serving 11 years in prison, after his sentence was reduced in December from 14 years.But prosecutors hit a stumbling block in January, when the six former brokers were acquitted of criminal charges that they helped Mr. Hayes manipulate Libor.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.A version of this article appears in print on July 5, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: British Court Convicts Three Ex-Employees of Barclays in Libor Rigging.
