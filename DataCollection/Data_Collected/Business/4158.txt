WASHINGTON —  Orders to American factories fell again in January, but an important investment category showed a gain.Orders to factories edged down 0.2 percent in January, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. They declined 3.5 percent in December and 1.7 percent in November.In an encouraging sign, orders in a category viewed as a proxy for business investment — nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft — showed an increase of 0.5 percent in January, following declines of 0.5 percent in December, and also in November.Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits rose last week to the highest level since May. The pace of applications, though, remained at a level consistent with steady hiring.

DEC.–1.7%NOV.–3.5%JAN.–0.2%$560 billion540520500480460’13’14Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, showed an increase of 2.8 percent for January, unchanged from the government’s preliminary estimate last week.AdvertisementOrders for nondurable goods, items like chemicals, paper and food, fell 3.1 percent after a drop of 3.3 percent in December. The nondurable category is being pulled down by steep declines in the price of petroleum products.AdvertisementManufacturers in the United States have been held back in recent months by weak growth in China, Europe and Japan, which also depressed demand for American exports. A stronger dollar is also hurting manufacturers in the United States because it means American goods are more expensive in overseas markets while foreign products are cheaper in the United States.The trade deficit — the amount that imports exceeded exports — widened in the October-December quarter and subtracted 1.1 percent point from economic growth. Because of the drag exerted by trade and other factors, the overall economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, down from a torrid pace of 5 percent in the July-September quarter.

The four-week average, a less volatile measure, increased 10,250 to 304,750, a six-week high.The number of applications tends to reflect the pace of layoffs. The four-week average has remained near or below 300,000 since September, a historically low level that typically signals healthy job gains.There are some signs that heavy snow and unseasonably cold weather have played a role in increasing the number of layoffs. Several states said two weeks ago that unemployment benefit applications had risen because of bad weather.Guy Berger, an economist at RBS Securities, noted that snow and ice hit the Midwest and upper South in the final two weeks of February, likely boosting the number of applications. But that increase would have occurred after the government conducted its surveys for the February jobs report, to be released on Friday.A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Factory Orders Edged Down in January, but Data Also Supports Optimism.
