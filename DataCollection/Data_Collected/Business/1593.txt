The bank is the only major domestic player that does not have exposure to Abengoa, the Spanish engineering company seeking protection from its creditors.Spain’s biggest lender, Santander, has not been so fortunate. It has the largest exposure to Abengoa and its projects, at 1.6 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to Reuters. BBVA’s escape may be just luck.Yet BBVA’s independent-minded chairman, Francisco Gonzalez, seems to have created an environment where risk managers rank equally with revenue generators. Just look at his reluctance to invest in Bankia. The great and the good of Spanish companies invested in its initial public offering, resulting in shareholders being badly burned by the subsequent bailout.BBVA also did not invest in Sareb, the asset management “bad bank” set up to house Spain’s most toxic real estate. Its peers own 55 percent of that loss-making entity. Sareb may require more capital, or converting subordinated debt into equity, as it steps up provisions on its assets.Of course, Mr. Gonzalez did not avoid the biggest Spanish dud: the 2008-9 real estate bust. And BBVA recently wrote off 1.8 billion euros in its investment in Garanti Bank of Turkey because the value of the lira fell. Still, BBVA’s record in avoiding the worst Spanish failures suggests it is doing something right.Fiona Maharg-Bravo is Reuters Breakingviews Madrid correspondent.
