LONDON — British regulators on Wednesday fined Bank of New York Mellon 126 million pounds, or about $185 million, for failing to comply with rules intended to protect client assets if the bank were ever to become insolvent.The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain, or F.C.A., said that Bank of New York Mellon’s London branch and its Bank of New York Mellon International unit failed to keep so-called entity-specific records for accounts in which it was acting as a custodian.The regulator faulted the bank for how it recorded information about its clients, including failing to record the actual legal entity identified in each client contract. As a result, it may have been harder to identify the owner of assets in the event of insolvency, the regulator said. The failure to comply with custody rules occurred between November 2007 and August 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority said.As part of its business as a custodian bank, Bank of New York Mellon holds a variety of assets and securities for clients — either directly or through a network of custodians. This includes physical certificates for some securities, like bearer bonds, held in vaults in Britain and the United States.AdvertisementThe two units held custody assets for more than 6,000 clients based in Britain and had more than £1.5 trillion in combined custody assets at their peak during the period at issue, the Financial Conduct Authority said. As a result, the two Bank of New York Mellon units are considered “systemically important” to the British market, the regulator said.Advertisement“The firms’ failure to comply with our rules, including their failure to adequately record, reconcile and protect safe custody assets, was particularly serious given the systemically important nature of the firms and the fact that safeguarding assets is core to their business,” Georgina Philippou, the Financial Conduct Authority’s acting director of enforcement and market oversight, said in a news release on Wednesday.“Had the firms become insolvent, the total value of safe custody assets at risk would have been significant,” she said. “This is compounded by the fact that the breaches took place at a time when there was considerable stress in the market.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The regulator also said that no client assets were lost as a result.Bank of New York Mellon settled at an early stage of the investigation. Otherwise, it would have faced a fine as high as £180 million. The failings were primarily identified by the Financial Conduct Authority as part of a regular review of the Bank of New York Mellon units, the regulator said.Bank of New York Mellon said that it had “worked cooperatively” with the Financial Conduct Authority to resolve the issues identified by the regulator and had undertaken a broad internal review to improve its policies and procedures to comply with the Financial Conduct Authority’s custody rules.“BNY Mellon is very mindful of the importance of safeguarding client assets and has been trusted by its clients to do so for 230 years,” the bank said in a news release on Wednesday. “We regret in this case that we did not meet our standards or those of the F.C.A. As always, regulatory compliance remains a key area of focus as we maintain our track record of safety and soundness as a financial institution.”The regulator said it also found that the Bank of New York Mellon units, in some cases, failed to prevent the mixing of custody assets with firm assets held in proprietary accounts and, on occasion, used custody assets held jointly in omnibus accounts to settle other clients’ transactions without prior consent from all clients whose assets were held in those accounts.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
