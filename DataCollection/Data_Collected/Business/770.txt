That was better news for the legal profession, which has been beset by concerns that fewer graduates are able to clear the bar to be a practicing lawyer.Foreign-educated test takers accounted for 3,150 of those who took the exam and passed at only a 33 percent rate. Excluding them, New York State’s bar passage rate was more in line with other states that have been releasing their outcomes in recent weeks.Even so, there was not much to celebrate. The July bar passage rate fell 4 percent, to 79 percent, the lowest percentage of graduates from American Bar Association-accredited schools since July 2004, when 83 percent of first-time takers passed the state exam.The total of 10,671 candidates who took New York’s two-day test last July was also the lowest number to take the test since 2006. And the number of accredited law school graduates, at 6,535, was the lowest number of candidates to take the test since July 2004, reflecting the shrinkage in law school enrollments.Advertisement
