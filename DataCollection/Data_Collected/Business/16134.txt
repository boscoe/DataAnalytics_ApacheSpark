LONDON — European regulators said on Wednesday that they had opened an “in-depth” investigation into the planned merger of the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse over its potential impact on competition in financial markets.The inquiry came after several politicians, including Michel Sapin, France’s finance minister, raised concerns that the deal would stifle competition in European financial markets and was opened just months after Britain voted to leave the European Union.The merger would create a potential European champion by combining stock exchanges in Britain, Germany and Italy, as well as several of Europe’s largest clearinghouses. The potential combined company would be Europe’s largest operator of stock markets by far.“Financial markets provide an essential function for the European economy,” Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner in charge of competition policy, said in a news release. “We must ensure that market participants continue to have access to financial market infrastructure on competitive terms.Advertisement“Therefore, we have opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed merger.”The inquiry would look at a variety of areas within the European financial markets, including the clearing of trades; the markets for derivatives and short-term repurchasing agreements known as repos; and other areas of financial market infrastructure.AdvertisementThe European Commission noted that the planned merger would combine two of the three markets for German stocks.To address competition concerns, the London Stock Exchange Group said on Wednesday that it intended to explore a potential sale of LCH S.A., the French operating arm of the LCH.Clearnet Group, its majority-owned clearing business.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It was their third effort to combine since 2000.The Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Exchange, considered making a potential counterbid for about two months this year, but it said in May that it would not pursue one.Ahead of the shareholder votes this summer, both exchanges spent much of their time trying to reassure investors about the deal in light of the outcome of the British referendum, which could greatly change Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe.They have said that an exit by Britain would not change the deal but that it could “well affect the volume or nature” of business carried out by the combined company.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
