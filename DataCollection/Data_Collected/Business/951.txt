Its motivation largely centered on ConAgra’s desire to expand private-label business, which manufactured products under grocery store brands.After a $6.8 billion takeover in 2012, including debt, the private-label business was not the growth driver that ConAgra had hoped. That attracted the attention of the activist investor Jana Partners, which took a 7.2 percent stake in June.On Monday, the fate of ConAgra’s private-label unit became known: TreeHouse Foods said that it planned to acquire most of the business for $2.7 billion, according to a statement. The sale included 32 manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada and Italy. ConAgra plans to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt.The divestiture allows ConAgra’s to focus more on the brands side of its business, which includes names such as Healthy Choice and Orville Redenbacher’s.“The sale of our private-label business marks another important milestone as we remake ConAgra Foods into a focused, higher-margin, more contemporary and higher-performing company,” Sean Connolly, president and chief executive of ConAgra Foods, said in a separate statement.TreeHouse said the acquisition would be dilutive to adjusted earnings per share in the first year, because of integration and financing costs, and would become accretive in Year 3. The deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, will be financed with $1.8 billion in debt and $1 billion in equity. After the acquisition, TreeHouse will have annual pro forma sales of about $7 billion, it said.Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch provided financial advice to TreeHouse and Winston and Strawn served as legal adviser. Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners were financial advisers to ConAgra and Davis Polk and Wardwell was the legal adviser.Advertisement
