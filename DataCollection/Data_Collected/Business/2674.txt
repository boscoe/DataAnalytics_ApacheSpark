Aetna and other insurers had resisted the high price of hepatitis C treatments and other drugs. Aetna said its agreement with Gilead followed a clinical review of other approved therapies for hepatitis C, which include AbbVie’s Viekira Pak. Gilead’s Harvoni, its newest treatment, is taken as a single pill and has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks. Viekira Pak, which is administered in multiple pills daily, has a list price of $83,319 per treatment. Express Scripts announced just days after regulators approved AbbVie’s Viekira Pak that it had negotiated a lower price for that treatment. CVS Health followed up by saying that it would back Gilead, as did Anthem. Advertisement
