JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia’s economic growth slipped to its lowest in five years in 2014 as exports and investments weakened, underlining the challenges facing Joko Widodo, the country’s new president.Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy, is finding it harder to fire up its engines of growth with the ending of the commodities boom and as high interest rates weigh on domestic demand.The economy expanded 5.02 percent last year, slower than growth of 5.58 percent in 2013. In the fourth quarter, the economy grew a slightly better than forecast 5.01 percent from a year earlier, but contracted 2.06 percent against the third quarter, on a seasonally unadjusted basis.“Today’s disappointing figures, which were broadly in line with consensus, help to underline the challenge facing the country’s new president, Joko Widodo, who despite a promising first few months in office faces a tough challenge to reinvigorate the economy,” said Gareth Leather, Asia economist at Capital Economics, the London-based consulting firm.AdvertisementThe firm said growth was expected to be flat this year and unlikely to rebound in the near term “with weak commodity prices and high interest rates set to weigh on economic activity.”AdvertisementInvestments grew 4.12 percent last year, weaker than both historical trends and growth of 5.28 percent in 2013, the Indonesian statistics bureau said on Thursday.Government spending was also much weaker during the year, which Suryamin, head of the statistics bureau, said was related to a cut in ministries’ expenditures in the 2014 budget.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
