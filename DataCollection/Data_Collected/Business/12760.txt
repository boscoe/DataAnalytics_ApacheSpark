Six months after he learned that his Volkswagen-made car violated clean-air rules, Tony German was still waiting to learn what to do about it. After a court ruling on Thursday, he might have to wait even longer.“I haven’t heard anything” from the automaker about a solution, said Mr. German, the owner of a 2010 Audi A3 diesel compact wagon in Ithaca, N.Y. “Are they just lying low and hoping this whole thing goes away? It’s a little bit strange.”Mr. German, executive director of a health administration program at Cornell University, is among almost 600,000 Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche owners in the United States who are stuck in limbo by the carmaker’s deliberate cheating to violate air-quality regulations.Volkswagen missed a court deadline on Thursday to present a plan to bring the cars into line with clean air rules, but Judge Charles Breyer at United States District Court in San Francisco gave the company an extension until April 21.AdvertisementIf no agreement is reached with the federal government, customers and dealers, a trial would be held this summer to determine what measures Volkswagen should be compelled to make and how much owners would be compensated.
                Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.            Lawyers trying to reach a settlement said during the hearing that they had made “substantial progress” toward a solution. “The engineers are working around the clock,” Robert Giuffra, a lawyer for Volkswagen, said during the hearing.AdvertisementAs more details have emerged about the hardware and software inside the cars, it increasingly looks as if Volkswagen maneuvered itself into a technological cul-de-sac when it rigged vehicles to cheat on emissions tests, beginning with 2009 models. Although the main culprit is software designed to deceive emissions tests, simply correcting that software would not solve the bigger set of interconnected problems. The longer it takes for Volkswagen to come up with a way to stop the cars from spewing illegal levels of pollution, the greater the fines it is likely to have to pay the United States government. Car owners themselves face no legal jeopardy, but any repair is also likely to reduce fuel economy and cause parts of the emissions system to wear out more quickly. That will hurt the cars’ resale value, and raise the amount Volkswagen must pay the owners as compensation.Some experts question whether it is even possible to make the cars in the United States conform to the law at a reasonable price. Those experts also cast doubt on the company’s assertion that only a few low-level employees were responsible.“There’s no way to fix these noncompliant cars,” Bob Lutz, a former vice chairman of General Motors, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Lutz said he had long badgered his engineers to match Volkswagen’s apparent diesel efficiency, and now understands why they never could.People who have closely examined Volkswagen engine technology say that one reason the company cheated in the first place was that its engineers were unable to resolve a fundamental conflict in emissions technology, at least not at a price that fit their budget.Measures that reduce output of nitrogen oxides, which can cause lung ailments, automatically increase production of soot particles, which can cause cancer.AdvertisementIf Volkswagen had turned up the equipment that reduced the nitrogen oxides, the additional soot output would have increased the need for the engine to periodically flush the particle filter by spraying diesel fuel into the exhaust system. That in turn would increase fuel consumption and raise the chances the car’s particle filter would become overburdened and break down.That trade-off between soot and nitrogen oxides remains difficult and costly to resolve despite advances in technology since the diesels in question went on sale in the United States. In Europe, it was not as big a problem because limits on nitrogen oxides are not as strict. The few rival companies who sold diesel in the United States addressed these challenges with more expensive pollution-control technologies.Volkswagen, however, was intent on producing lower-cost, small cars and was in a major push to rebuild sales in the United States.In the six months since the Environmental Protection Agency exposed the cheating, outside experts have also analyzed more closely how Volkswagen manipulated the software in the cars to evade emissions controls.Among them is Felix Domke, a self-described hacker who lives in Lübeck, Germany, who, on eBay, bought an example of the computer used by Volkswagen in its vehicles. He also examined the computer that came with his own car, a Volkswagen diesel van.Mr. Domke, who said he worked in information technology at a large corporation that is not connected to the auto industry, first demonstrated his findings at a hackers’ conference in Hamburg in December, and elaborated on them by email this week.He showed how the software adjusted variables like the amount of exhaust gas that was recycled back into the motor, one of the methods used to minimize harmful emissions. The software was precisely calibrated to track the simulated city, rural and highway driving that cars undergo during official tests on rollers in laboratories.Outside the cycle — in other words, under actual on-the-road driving conditions that regulators would not normally see — the computer turned down the emissions controls in a way that eased the burden on the particle filter, while also saving fuel.Daniel Lange, a former information technology executive at the German carmaker BMW who also spoke at the hackers’ conference, expressed skepticism about Volkswagen’s view that the software manipulation was the work of a small number of low-level employees.AdvertisementSoftware is heavily documented and it is very unlikely that engineers would have taken the risk of modifying the software without approval at a high level of management, Mr. Lange said in an interview.“It’s completely unrealistic that a lonely engineer” would have been responsible for the cheating, said Mr. Lange, who is founder and chief executive of Faster IT, a technology consulting firm.Volkswagen has not explained who inside the company was responsible for creating one of the biggest corporate scandals of the last decade. But in a German court filing last month, the company said that members of its management board “had no knowledge of the rule violation.”The engine control software and onboard computer were provided by Bosch, one of the largest suppliers of electronic components for the auto industry. Bosch has been named along with Volkswagen as a defendant in class-action lawsuits filed by owners of Volkswagen-brand cars.Bosch declined to comment on the lawsuits or provide details about the way the engine software works, citing investigations by the authorities.The Bosch software, also used by other carmakers, can be customized for different vehicles and motors. One question for the courts will be whether Bosch shares any blame because of the relative ease with which the software could be used as a “defeat device” to evade emissions tests.Another question is why Volkswagen’s top managers never asked themselves why their engineers succeeded where others had failed in producing relatively inexpensive diesel cars that met American standards on nitrogen oxides, which are stricter than those in Europe.Advertisement“I was beating up on ’em pretty hard,” Mr. Lutz said. “They’re doing it and we can’t? Nobody could figure out how they were complying and their engine technology is very similar to everybody else’s.”If Volkswagen is not able to fix the cars, there might be no alternative but to buy them back, a solution mentioned by the judge on Thursday. To get owners to surrender the cars, Volkswagen would probably have to pay more than the market value, adding to the already enormous financial burden from the scandal.Mr. German, the owner of the 2010 Audi, who recently moved to Ithaca from Austin, Tex., said by phone that he would gladly accept the car at its prescandal book value, with perhaps a little extra to cover “the hassle factor.” According to Kelley Blue Book, an Audi A3 like Mr. German’s was worth about $16,300 before the emissions cheating became known and about $14,370 now.“I don’t want my car anymore,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2016, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Deadline for VW, and Bigger Worries.
