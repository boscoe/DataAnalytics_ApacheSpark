It warned, however, that the developing shortage of birds would drag on sales for the remainder of the year. Hormel’s Jennie-O Turkey Store business is the country’s No. 2 turkey processor, close behind Butterball. The company’s quarterly per-share profit of 67 cents was a nickel better than Wall Street had expected, according to a poll by Zacks Investment Research. The company reported revenue of $2.28 billion, which fell short of analyst projections for $2.4 billion. Advertisement
