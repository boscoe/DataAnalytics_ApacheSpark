Prosecutors from the Justice Department and top officials with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are grappling with how to root out the practice in a fractured industry, where some of the least regulated players, the auto dealers, wield the most power and where virtually no national data exists to quantify the problem.The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is now examining whether dealerships are discriminating against their minority borrowers.“In every facet of the auto lending market, combating discrimination is a top priority for the Civil Rights Division,” Vanita Gupta, acting assistant attorney general for the division, said in an interview. Ms. Gupta joined the Justice Department in October from the American Civil Liberties Union, where she was deputy legal director and headed its Center for Justice.The latest push against auto dealers comes as previous efforts aimed solely at lenders have faced challenges, including intense resistance from the industry. One prominent action taken by the federal authorities against a large lender, Ally Financial, has been fraught with complications.More than a year ago, Ally agreed to pay $80 million to auto buyers as part of a broader settlement over accusations that it charged minority customers higher interest rates. But none of that money has been paid out, according to several people briefed on the settlement.One reason for the delay, the people said, is that federal authorities have found it complicated to determine which Ally customers are minorities who might have suffered harm. Before sending out the checks, the regulators wanted to make sure that none were sent to white borrowers, the people said. Another wrinkle is that information about the settlement is being sent in six languages.A spokeswoman for Ally said the bank “has taken and will continue to take steps to ensure that customers are treated fairly.”Neither auto dealers nor lenders are required to collect information about a borrower’s race or ethnicity. The mortgage market is different. After the redlining scandals in housing, Congress in 1975 passed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which required lenders to detail their mortgage lending by race, ethnicity and ZIP code.Faced with a dearth of data in auto lending, the government authorities created a method that analyzes borrowers’ surnames and addresses to determine their race.Such so-called proxies are not new in civil rights investigations. The Justice Department has used a similar analysis in investigating potential violations of voting rights. Using proxies in their auto lending investigation into Ally, the federal authorities calculated that roughly 235,000 minority borrowers paid higher interest rates than white ones from April 2011 to December 2013.Government economists and statisticians have tested the data, but the analysis is far from foolproof.Ally is not the only lender facing scrutiny. The government authorities, the people said, are in discussions with other large auto lenders, including JPMorgan Chase, over potential disparities in interest rates charged to minorities.Part of the problem in the eyes of the federal authorities, the people said, is “dealer markups,” in which dealers tack additional interest onto a borrower’s loan. The markups can be used, the people said, to charge minority borrowers higher rates than white ones with similar credit profiles.But eradicating the markups has emerged as a big sticking point in the talks over discriminatory pricing. None of the banks, the people said, want to be the first to turn away loans from auto dealers that include markups. If they do, the banks have argued privately, the dealers will simply take their business elsewhere.Even Ally, which reached a settlement with the consumer protection agency and the Justice Department in December 2013, did not expressly agree to shun loans that included dealer markups. Instead, it agreed to monitor its loans for potential discrimination and continue to make payments annually to customers who might have been harmed.Ally agreed to settle the matter because the bank, which was still owned largely by the government at the time, felt pressured by banking regulators to resolve it, according to people briefed on the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it. At the time, Ally was seeking financial holding company status from the Federal Reserve.Any proposal to ban such markups across the industry would most likely run up against one of the most powerful political players in Washington, the auto-selling industry. Interest-rate markups are a big revenue generator for the dealers.At some dealerships, the Justice Department is taking aim at discriminatory practices that go beyond markups.In February, the department resolved a case against two dealerships in Charlotte, N.C., for intentionally targeting African-American borrowers with unfair and predatory practices in the financing of used-car purchases.To lure the borrowers, the department said, the dealerships were situated in overwhelmingly African-American neighborhoods. At times, the dealerships’ owner used racial epithets to describe his African-American customers, the officials said.The dealers charged most borrowers the highest allowable interest rate under North Carolina law and repossessed some borrowers’ cars even though they had not fallen behind on payments. The dealers’ owner forced one African-American customer, whose car was seized even though she was current on her loan, to pay a fee to retrieve her vehicle.As part of their settlement, the dealerships agreed to cap their maximum interest rates for all borrowers and not to charge substantially more than other local dealers for used cars.The dealerships denied any wrongdoing, adding that they agreed to the settlement “to avoid the risks and burdens of costly litigation.”Advertisement
