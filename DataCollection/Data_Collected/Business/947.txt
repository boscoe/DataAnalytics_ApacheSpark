CBS announced on Monday that it had ordered up a reboot for “Star Trek,” but it’s one that won’t start for another 14 months and it comes with a surprising twist. Though “Star Trek” will premiere on CBS in January 2017, all subsequent episodes will be shown elsewhere: its digital app, CBS All Access.The move is yet another signal of how traditional networks are trying to adapt to a shifting media landscape, as content producers like CBS, Showtime and HBO try to attract viewers to new streaming services. CBS All Access, which was introduced last year, costs $6 a month.It appears there are no plans for episodes of “Star Trek” to run on CBS, the television network. A CBS spokesman said that CBS All Access would be the exclusive home for the show.CBS has found early success in this genre this year. The premiere of “Supergirl” got big ratings last week, with 12.9 million people tuning in, which made it the most viewed series premiere this season. “Supergirl” was a departure from CBS’s usual bread-and-butter of crime procedurals, and showed that the network was open to experimenting at a volatile time in television.Like “Supergirl,” “Star Trek”’s cult following and loyal fan base is an appealing audience for an over-the-top bet. Earlier this year, HBO doubled down on its relationship with Vice for a similar reason: to appeal to a younger audience and convince new viewers to spend $15 a month for its own stand-alone app, HBO Now.Alex Kurtzman will be the executive producer of the new “Star Trek” show; he was a writer and producer for the “Star Trek” movie in 2009, and the “Star Trek Into Darkness” film in 2013. Both movies were directed by J.J. Abrams. CBS released few details about its new show, which is being developed by its in-house studio.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
