PARIS — Crédit Agricole promised stable investor returns and a solid capital base in the future as the French bank outlined plans on Wednesday to simplify its much-criticized ownership structure.The chief executive, Philippe Brassac, said the plan would put to rest criticism from analysts, shareholders and regulators that the cross-shareholding between its listed entity and its cooperative parent banks was too complex.Detailing the plan first announced last month, the bank said its listed entity would sell its 25 percent stake in the parent banks back to them for 18 billion euros, or $20 billion.The listed entity would repay €5 billion to the parent banks to unwind an intragroup guarantee mechanism while also lending them €11 billion over 10 years to fund the stake purchase in a deal expected to be completed in the third quarter.Advertisement“At the end of the day, we will have a much more understandable and simpler group, because what used to be entangled will be disentangled,” Mr. Brassac said at a news conference to present the plan and the bank’s 2015 results.AdvertisementMr. Brassac said the move would allow the bank to generate a return on tangible equity of at least 10 percent over 2016-19. The bank had previously flagged expectations for a return on equity of 12 percent for 2016.The loss of the parent banks’ contribution to the listed entity’s earnings would carve €470 million out of this year’s net income.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
