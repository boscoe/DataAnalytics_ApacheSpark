Rothschild has been appointed to advise the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on the sale.The transaction will be devised to deliver best value for money to the taxpayer; further detail on the form of the sale will be announced later, according to the Treasury.The government raised £1.98 billion in the I.P.O. in October 2013, which was 24 times oversubscribed.But it has been criticized for taking a cautious approach in the sale and not achieving a higher price after shares jumped 38 percent on the first day of trading.Shares of Royal Mail were trading about 54 percent above its I.P.O. price of 330 pence in London on Thursday afternoon.The National Audit Office, a public spending watchdog agency, concluded in an April 2014 report that the government failed to achieve the best value for the British public because it took too cautious an approach.In July, a Parliament committee concluded that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills had underestimated the market value of Royal Mail and that the “pricing decision that was too influenced by perceived risks and fear of failure rather than maximizing value.”Advertisement
