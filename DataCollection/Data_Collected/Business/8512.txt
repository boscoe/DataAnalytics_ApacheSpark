The amount of money raised from public offerings as of Aug. 20 was down 19 percent from the same time in 2014.First Data is expected to raise several billion dollars in its offering, though the timing of the stock sale could shift depending on whether the volatility of the markets persists beyond Labor Day.Other important details of First Data’s offering, including how much the payment processor intends to raise and on which exchange the company plans to list, remain undisclosed.Notably absent on the list of underwriters is JPMorgan Chase, one of the traditional powerhouses in equity capital market offerings. It is particularly striking because Frank Bisignano, First Data’s chief executive, was a longtime top lieutenant to Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chief.But bad blood has run between the two sides in recent years, notably in a dispute over Mr. Bisignano’s hiring of several executives from his former employer. First Data and JPMorgan settled the fight last year for what The Wall Street Journal described as less than $10 million.Advertisement
