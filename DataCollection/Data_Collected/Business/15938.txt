The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a lawsuit against ITT two years ago, accusing the company of predatory student lending.The government move against ITT came during a push to enforce tighter rules on the for-profit education industry.Corinthian Colleges filed for bankruptcy protection last year, abruptly closing 28 schools and leaving 16,000 students without classes as it faced federal and state investigations.In its voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in United States Bankruptcy Court in Indianapolis, ITT listed assets of $100 million to $500 million and liabilities of the same amounts.Advertisement
