The film, “Nine Eleven,” would be Mr. Sheen’s first project since announcing in November that he is H.I.V.-positive.Variety on Monday reported the existence of the “action drama,” which will also star Whoopi Goldberg. Entertainment Weekly, Vulture and The Hollywood Reporter quickly followed with their own pieces. Mr. Sheen is back!But closer scrutiny would seem to make “Nine Eleven” a lot less interesting.The movie’s director, Martin Guigui, who co-wrote the script, has made seven feature films, according to IMDb.com. But box office databases only list one, “Swing,” a 2004 fantasy comedy about a nightclub frozen in time, as having any measurable ticket sales; it took in $2,509, according to Box Office Mojo.It is unclear whether some of his other films, including “The Bronx Bull,” a boxing drama with Tom Sizemore, even made their way to DVD.A listed telephone number for Mr. Guigui’s production company, Sunset Pictures, was out of service on Tuesday. An email query sent to Sunset bounced back. An agent for Mr. Guigui did not respond to a request for comment.A representative for Mr. Sheen did not respond to a query asking for information about the film’s budget and whether it had a distributor.Mr. Sheen has a controversial history with the 9/11 attacks; in various interviews over the years, he has supported conspiracy theories about the causes of the World Trade Center’s destruction.A publicist for Ms. Goldberg confirmed her involvement in the movie, but had no additional information about “Nine Eleven.”Advertisement
