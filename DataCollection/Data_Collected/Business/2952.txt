In this digital age when filling a shopping cart requires little more than clicking on a screen, the printed retail catalog keeps vying for a place on the coffee table.From Anthropologie to American Girl, Pottery Barn to Patagonia, retailers are still relying on direct mail even as they spend considerable resources on improving their websites to accommodate the steady increase in online shopping.Some of their catalog forays, however, barely resemble the traditional merchandise book. These days, retailers are employing devices like adventure tales and photo spreads of wildlife to catch a shopper’s eye, hoping to secure purchases online or in a store.Luring a specific customer base seems to be part of the strategy underlying J. C. Penney’s surprise announcement this month that it would revive a home goods catalog in March, three years after the struggling company discontinued all such mailings. Its new version will focus not on recruiting new customers but on reaching existing ones, according to a spokeswoman. Whether the company will resume a regular schedule for sending out seasonal or general merchandise catalogs remains unclear.Advertisement“J. C. Penney is making a big statement,” said Bruce Cohen, a retail private equity strategist at Kurt Salmon, a consulting firm. “It’s a pronouncement in favor of what all retailers are recognizing — that there are moments when people want to slow down, and there’s still an important place for the catalog.”AdvertisementAfter years of decline, the number of catalogs mailed in the United States increased in 2013, to 11.9 billion, according to the Direct Marketing Association, a trade group. While that figure is about 60 percent of what it was at its peak in 2007, some analysts say the recent 1 percent rise in mailed catalogs, coupled with the care retailers are putting into them, may signal something of a renaissance.Not all catalogs will rebound in this environment. The parent company of SkyMall, the in-flight shopping magazine, filed for bankruptcy last week. But Paul Swinand, an analyst for Morningstar, called that catalog different from most with its quirky assortment of goods. “It’s not about brand with SkyMall,” he said. “There’s nothing emotional about it.”However small, the recent resurgence in direct mail may be explained by a better understanding of the catalog’s power to drive sales, Mr. Cohen said. He pointed to Lands’ End as an early example. In 2000, that retailer reduced the number of catalogs it sent consumers. It experienced a $100 million drop in sales as a result, according to research by Kurt Salmon. Lands’ End later added a pop-up survey to its website and found that 75 percent of customers who were making purchases had first reviewed the catalog.“Sometimes the only way to realize how important the catalog is, is to take it away,” Mr. Cohen said.About 90 million Americans make purchases from catalogs, according to the Direct Marketing Association; nearly 60 percent of them are women. Consumers who receive catalogs spend an average of $850 annually on catalog purchases, according to the American Catalog Mailers Association.
            After sharp declines since 2007, the number of catalogs mailed last year increased slightly.        20billionNumberof catalogsmailed151050’01’07’13For many brands, catalogs are the single most effective driver of online and in-store sales, according to analysts and retailers. Recognizing that, American Girl, a subsidiary of Mattel, recently increased the number it sent out, spending more on catalogs last year than in any year over the last decade, according to Kathy Monetti, senior vice president for marketing.Some stores, like Anthropologie, rely so heavily on catalogs that they make them their principal form of advertising. “We don’t call it a catalog; we call it a journal,” said Susy Korb, chief marketing officer of Anthropologie, whose materials show women wearing dresses in fields, on beaches and “where the rolling heather meets the broad, brisk sky,” as one recent spread detailed.Advertisement“Of course we’re trying to sell clothes and accessories,” Ms. Korb said, “but it’s more to inspire and engage.”Patagonia has produced long-form marketing materials, commissioning essays for them. Last year, in addition to publishing 10 or so traditional catalogs, the company sent two built around themes, including one on falconry. That catalog featured photo spreads of children with condors in Chile and wildlife volunteers releasing rehabilitated red-tailed hawks in California, alongside first-person reflections. “The bird on my fist is an opportunist,” one read. “I like to think it’s there because of the patient discipline I exercise.”That catalog included only a handful of products — among them a green trucker hat, jeans and brightly colored backpacks — on four of the final pages in the 43-page book.Dmitri Siegel, executive creative director and vice president of e-commerce for Patagonia, called the catalogs “a way we’re speaking to our closest friends and people who know the brand really well.”Mr. Siegel added that Patagonia had begun printing on 100 percent recycled paper. “We had to make some trade-offs in terms of circulation and other expenses, but it brought the mode of communication in line with our values,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ikea recently produced a humorous advertisement for its catalog. “It’s not a digital book, or an e-book,” the ad says. “It’s a ‘bookbook.’ The 2015 Ikea catalog comes fully charged, and the battery life is eternal.”Though it is a department store with different customer demographics than that of Patagonia or Ikea, J. C. Penney is not dissimilar in having a lofty, experiential vision for the new catalog. “The scenes tell a story,” said Kate Coultas, a J. C. Penney spokeswoman.While the retailer’s “Big Book,” containing up to 1,000 pages, was discontinued in 2009, the company kept producing short, niche catalogs on segments like school uniforms or outdoor furniture until 2012. The coming catalog will strike a balance, with 120 pages featuring a broad variety of home goods, Ms. Coultas said.Melissa Berggren of Minneapolis, Minn., a mother of two, said the revival of the J. C. Penney catalog surprised her but made sense. “We’ve gotten used to companies printing less and less,” she said. “But more of us are coming back to our mailboxes.”Ms. Berggren said she regularly studied the Pottery Barn catalogs. “It’s not about getting a deal,” she said. “It’s about looking at different settings, how they’re decorated.”AdvertisementNot all mailings get her attention, she said, adding that she never looked at the “tabloid-type mailers from Macy’s” regularly stuffed in her mailbox.Felix Carbullido, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Williams-Sonoma brands, including Pottery Barn and West Elm, said the company’s commitment to catalogs had not wavered but that its view of them had changed. “Years ago it was a selling tool, and now it’s become an inspirational source,” he said, likening catalogs to magazines. “We know our customers love a tactile experience.”Mr. Swinand of Morningstar pointed to Tiffany & Company’s Blue Book catalog — said to be the first catalog mailed in the United States, in 1845. “That’s the type of thing you might want to keep on your coffee table for the whole year,” he said. “It’s not the big book Sears catalog, which was sort of a print version of the Internet before it existed.”Asked if it might consider reviving a catalog, Sears declined to comment.Some consumers feel that retailers should ease off on sending catalogs. “They’re a nuisance,” said Lee Wright, who works in sales for a software company in Arlington, Va.While Mr. Wright nostalgically remembered poring over the Sears catalog in the 1980s and dog-earing pages, he said he now sought to discontinue mailings to his house. “Today, catalogs are a waste of paper,” he said. “It’s the same information that’s online.” He said he didn’t like to shop without reading product reviews, something often embedded in e-commerce platforms.Members of the so-called millennial generation, accustomed to online shopping, may share Mr. Wright’s opinion in greater number. Still, some e-commerce retailers like Bonobos see printed materials as having modern appeal across age groups and have embraced them.Craig Elbert, vice president for marketing at Bonobos, called them helpful for building relationships and for measuring effectiveness. “You know if you ultimately made a sale,” he said. “You know where you ship a catalog and where you ship your orders.”AdvertisementWith “so much clutter and information overload,” said Rohit Deshpande, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, “just getting attention is the hardest thing to do right now for brands. It’s conceivable that trying catalogs again is a way to do it.”Mr. Deshpande said research showed that frequency helped consumers process marketing messages, but some studies suggested diminishing returns after three advertisements.“The issue has always been: What do we have to do in order to get mind-share and not bore people?” Mr. Deshpande said. “Or, worse, turn them off?”A version of this article appears in print on January 26, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Catalogs Rewrite the Book.
