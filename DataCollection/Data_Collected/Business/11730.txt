The 2012-14 Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger with the 3.6-liter V-6 are also part of the investigation, but those models had only eight complaints, with reports of four crashes and two injuries.The three models do not use a conventional shifter to change gears in the automatic transmission. Instead, they use an electronic gear selector with a paddle shifter on the center console. The driver moves that paddle forward or backward to select a gear.Investigators said they found that the system “is not intuitive and provides poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver, increasing the potential for unintended gear selection.” They said the automaker changed the design of the shifter on the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger for the 2015 model year and on the Jeep for the 2016 model year.“I pulled into my driveway and put the car in park,” a Grand Cherokee owner from Oklahoma said in a written statement to the agency in late 2014. “When stepping out of my car, it started rolling backwards. The door was open, so it knocked me to the ground and I rolled to get out of the path of the wheel, only getting missed by seconds.”While that owner said he received only bruises, federal regulators said their investigation found serious injuries, including three people with a fractured pelvis. Others included a ruptured bladder, fractured kneecap, broken ribs, leg damage, broken nose and facial lacerations requiring stitches.Fiat Chrysler is cooperating with the investigation, a company spokesman, Eric Mayne, said in an email.Advertisement
