The AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a drug distributor, agreed on Monday to buy MWI Veterinary Supply for about $2.5 billion in cash, expanding into the animal health business.The company said it would pay $190 for each MWI share, a premium of about 8 percent over the closing price of the stock on Friday.“MWI is the premier supply chain company in animal health, with leading positions in both the companion and production markets, and we are very excited to have them join AmerisourceBergen,” Steven H. Collis, AmerisourceBergen’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Animal health is a growing market in the U.S. and internationally and is a logical extension of our pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses. AmerisourceBergen, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., said the deal for MWI, which is based in Boise, Idaho, would add about 8 cents a share to earnings for the 2015 fiscal year and generate $50 million in synergies by the end of the third full year.A version of this article appears in print on 01/13/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Seeking Growth.
