After an E. coli outbreak and other health scares sent sales plunging, the chain made plans to give away more than 20 million burritos via coupons or mobile offers. “It was kind of eerie — and we’d hear this from customers,” who would walk by a once-busy restaurant and see “now there’s no line whatsoever,” said John R. Hartung, Chipotle’s chief financial officer. He said it was important to let the chain’s 2,000 restaurants “look like Chipotle again.” Heading into summer, Chipotle said it would consider “buy one, get one” offers or more targeted mobile offers in regions of the country where a recovery in sales is lagging. The strategy has its costs. The company said Tuesday it expected to report a loss of $1 a share or more for the January-to-March quarter, its first loss since going public in 2006.Advertisement
