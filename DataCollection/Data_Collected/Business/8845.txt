In a conference call with analysts, executives said expenses relating to the companyâ€™s international expansion efforts and weaker currencies in Canada and Australia dragged on margins. But they reiterated their expectations for improvement next year. Gross margin, or revenue less the cost of goods sold, was 46.8 percent, down from 50.5 percent a year ago. The company raised its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year modestly to $1.87-$1.92 a share, from $1.86-$1.91. Net income fell to $47.7 million in the quarter that ended Aug. 2, from $48.8 million a year earlier. Earnings per share, however, rose to 34 cents from 33 cents, as there were fewer shares outstanding. Revenue grew about 16 percent to $453 million. Analysts had expected earnings of 33 cents a share on revenue of $445.8 million. Advertisement
