Fiat Chrysler said it would invest more than 500 million euros ($540 million) to produce two new engines for its Alfa Romeo cars as part of an effort to rejuvenate the brand. The carmaker said Alfa Romeo was a core part of its five-year, €48 billion turnaround plan. It intends to invest €5 billion to increase Alfa Romeo sales more than fivefold, to 400,000 vehicles in 2018, by adding eight models, starting in June. The engines, to be produced at the group’s Termoli factory in southern Italy, include an advanced high-output four-cylinder engine developed for Alfa Romeo, the company said. The second one will be a Ferrari-derived six-cylinder engine, also developed for Alfa Romeo. Fiat bought Alfa from the state holding company IRI in 1986, but several efforts to revive the brand have stalled. Only 74,000 Alfa Romeos were sold in 2013. Fiat Chrysler’s chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, has said he would keep production in Italy.A version of this brief appears in print on April 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Fiat Chrysler to Spend Millions on 2 New Alfa Romeo Engines.
