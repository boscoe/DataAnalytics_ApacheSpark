Asked multiple times whether he should be held accountable, he said, “I don’t have that line of sight,” adding, “I am ashamed of what happened and I have a shared responsibility, which I accept.”Mr. Gulliver was asked to defend a statement he made earlier this week in which he said that banks were being held to a higher standard than the church or armed services.“That didn’t land very well,” he conceded.He said he was trying to explain that it is hard to know what 257,000 people in 70 countries are doing and that companies need to have sufficient controls in place, which HSBC has worked to do. Both executives said HSBC’s compliance controls were significantly better than they have been in the past.Mr. Gulliver was asked about his own tax matters after it was disclosed earlier this week that while he was living Hong Kong, he had his bonuses paid into a Swiss bank account through a Panamanian company he had set up.“I can understand how people find these arrangements quite unusual,” he acknowledged, emphasizing that he set up the account to protect his privacy because bonus amounts could be viewed by colleagues on the company’s computer system at the time. He said the maneuver gave him no tax advantages.He was also questioned about his status as a so-called non-domiciled resident, meaning he pays taxes on his British income and any money he brings from abroad, but he is exempt — for a fee of £30,000 every year — from any capital gains, income or inheritance tax on foreign assets, including whatever is in his Swiss account.He said that he and his Australian wife had established Hong Kong as their permanent home and that he intends to return there.One lawmaker said, “So you could have worked for a U.K. bank for 50 years, lived in this city for 20 years and still be registered as a non-dom for tax purposes?”Mr. Gulliver said that he had paid British tax on all his HSBC earnings since 2003, when he returned to Britain, “so the amount of tax I have paid is the fair and appropriate amount.”When Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee, enumerated the regulatory investigations HSBC faces, including rigging foreign exchange markets and manipulating interest rate derivatives, among many others, Mr. Flint called it a “terrible list.”“We are suffering through horrible reputational damage,” he said.Advertisement
