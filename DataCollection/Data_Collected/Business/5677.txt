In the same period a year earlier, it had a loss of $42.9 million, or 51 cents a share.Analysts expected a loss in the most recent quarter of roughly 45 cents. Revenue climbed to $166.5 million, a 13 percent increase.DreamWorks Animation was hurt by a hefty restructuring charge; increased costs at AwesomenessTV, a YouTube-based entertainment business aimed at teenage girls; and continuing fallout from “The Penguins of Madagascar,” which flopped late last year. The bulk of revenue came from premium television reruns of “How to Train Your Dragon 2,” which was released last summer.Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of the movie and television studio, acknowledged in a conference call with analysts that his company was enduring “a transitional year,” but added, “I’m confident that we’re taking the right steps.”Despite its feature animation problems, at least one division of DreamWorks Animation continues to grow: AwesomenessTV announced a deal on Tuesday to make multiple movies with YouTube stars — to be shown first on YouTube — and in March teamed with Verizon for a new mobile video service.DreamWorks Animation, which was spun off from Steven Spielberg’s privately held DreamWorks Studios in 2004, has long struggled to move past a boom-and-bust cycle driven by its sporadic film releases.An effort to diversify into consumer products and television started to provide a financial cushion two years ago, but the company was simultaneously caught flat-footed in a marketplace shift: Quality started to become more important as computer animation lost its novelty and every studio jumped into the genre. Some of DreamWorks Animation’s movies were just not compelling enough to compete.The results for DreamWorks Animation’s “Home,” released on March 27, were mixed. The movie, centered on a misfit alien and a lost African-American girl, received subpar reviews but did much better than expected in North America, taking in $154.6 million as of Wednesday. That eased pressure on the studio, which had been facing liquidity concerns.But overseas ticket sales for “Home” have been much softer than expected. So far, the movie, which cost roughly $270 million to make and market, has taken in about $145.3 million at foreign theaters. Mr. Katzenberg struck an upbeat tone in the analyst call, but he steered clear of his trademark grand pronouncements about the state of Hollywood. Questioned about whether the movie industry should speed up the release of films on DVD — a contentious topic among theater owners — he declined to answer. “That’s a really big, juicy question,” he said. “I’m going to stick to little old DreamWorks.”Advertisement
