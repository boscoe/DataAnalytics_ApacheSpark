Halliburton, which provides well-drilling services for oil companies, is cutting 5,000 more jobs as the energy industry continues to struggle with slumping oil prices. The company said on Thursday that the latest cuts would amount to about 8 percent of its global work force. The slump in oil prices, about 70 percent since they peaked above $100 a barrel in 2014, has led to less drilling and to widespread layoffs in the oil fields. Schlumberger, a rival of Halliburton, cut 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter. When the layoffs are completed, Halliburton will have reduced its work force by 26,000 to 27,000 employees since the peak in 2014, the company said. Shares closed up a fraction of a percent.A version of this article appears in print on February 26, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Halliburton to Cut 5,000 Jobs as Result of Lower Oil Prices.
