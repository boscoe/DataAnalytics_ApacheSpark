Including debt, the deal is worth $3.5 billion, and the boards of both companies have approved it.Based in Jerusalem, Teva is the biggest maker of generic drugs in the world. Auspex, based in La Jolla, Calif., does not have any products for sale yet, but is developing several drugs that focus on the central nervous system to treat disorders like Huntington’s disease, tardive dyskinesia and Tourette syndrome.”The acquisition of Auspex is a significant step in strengthening Teva’s leadership position in C.N.S. and advances us into underserved movement disorder markets,” said Erez Vigodman, Teva’s chief executive. “This transaction represents a first major step with regards to that commitment, and we expect to continue this focus in the future.”Teva said the deal would provide it with “mid- to long-term revenue and earnings growth,” and that Auspex drugs could be for sale as early as next year, when a drug for Huntington’s disease is expected to go on sale. Auspex has several other patents that could yield more drugs in the future.”This transaction will enhance Auspex’s mission by bringing innovative therapies to patients across the world as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Pratik Shah, Auspex’s chief executive, said in a statement. “The transaction also marks a great outcome for Auspex shareholders and stakeholders as it not only validates our portfolio of drug candidates while delivering significant financial return, but it also puts our programs into the hands of a company that has the experience and commitment to deliver our pipeline of therapies to patients in need.”Teva is not taking on any new debt to fund the deal.Goldman Sachs advised Teva, and Goodwin Procter provided the buyer with legal advice. JPMorgan Chase advised Auspex, and Cooley provided the company with legal advice.Advertisement
