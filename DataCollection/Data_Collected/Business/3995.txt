Printing Money.” (Feb. 22), about the photographer Peter Lik:Is there a point at which the commercial aspects of the careers of Peter Lik and other contemporary artists such as Damien Hirst intersect? They certainly overlap.No one can deny Mr. Lik the right to call his product “art.” As long as his merchandising stops short of outright fraud, he can claim a world championship in art-world chutzpah.Dr. Robert Jaffe Carpinteria, Calif., Feb. 23To the Editor:Thank you for the article about Peter Lik. It seems his only meaningful relationship is with his camera. Yes, his photos are beautiful, but so are those of hundreds of other photographers.Lucky for him, there are plenty of suckers who will pay $50,000 or more for an image that is identical to the image earlier in the series that sold for $5,000.Frances SegalLaguna Niguel, Calif., Feb. 23Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
