AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe stock market recovered from steep losses early to close slightly lower on Monday as investors looked past another steep drop in the price of oil and renewed concerns about economic growth in China and the United States. Oil and gas companies remained in the red.The fact that utility and other high-dividend stocks were among the better performers should be seen as a sign that investors still don’t have much conviction behind last week’s gains and Monday’s recovery, traders said.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,449.18 after being down roughly 150 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 0.86 point, less than 0.1 percent, to 1,939.38, and the Nasdaq composite rose 6.41 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,620.37.Stocks had been lower most of the day after separate reports showed manufacturing slowing last month in both the United States and China. The reports initially caused a sell-off in commodities, notably energy and industrial metals like copper. The price of United States benchmark oil plunged $2, or 5.9 percent, to $31.62 a barrel in New York. Natural gas also fell about 7 percent.But as the trading day drew to a close, investors began to buy up utilities and other dividend-paying stocks. The Dow Jones utility index, a collection of 15 utility companies, rose nearly 1 percent on Monday. Telecommunications stocks, another traditional dividend play, posted the second-biggest gains in the S.&P. 500.J. J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, said part of the reason dividend stocks did better than the rest of the market was speculation that the Federal Reserve, faced with a more uncertain economy, would probably not raise interest rates as fast as investors had thought at the beginning of the year.Dividend stocks perform poorly when interest rates are rising, because the value of the yield on dividend stocks is worn away as yields rise on bonds and other dividend-paying investments.“We’re looking at probably only two raises this year instead of four, and that makes dividend stocks look relatively attractive again,” Mr. Kinahan said, referring to the Fed’s adjustment of interest rates.Energy stocks, not surprisingly, were the biggest losers on Monday, following the price of oil lower. The energy component of the S.&P. 500 fell nearly 2 percent, while the performance of the broader market was nearly flat.Southwestern Energy shares declined 39 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $8.50, Transocean stock dropped 63 cents, or 6 percent, to $9.79 and Chesapeake Energy fell 18 cents, or 5 percent, to $3.21.In other company news, stock in Alere jumped $16.91, or 45 percent, to $54.11 after Abbott Laboratories announced it was purchasing the health care company, which focuses on diagnostics, for $5.8 billion. Abbott’s shares rose 60 cents, or 2 percent, to $38.45.United States government bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.95 percent. The dollar fell to 120.99 yen from 121.05 yen on Friday. The euro strengthened to $1.0893 from $1.0831.Prices for precious and industrial metals closed mixed. Gold rose $11.50 to $1,127.90 an ounce, silver gained 10 cents to $14.37 an ounce and copper slipped a penny to $2.06 a pound.In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4.9 cents to close at $1.083 a gallon, heating oil fell 4.2 cents to $1.037 a gallon and natural gas lost 2 cents, to close at $2.14 per 1,000 cubic feet. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, fell $1.86, to $34.13 a barrel.Advertisement
