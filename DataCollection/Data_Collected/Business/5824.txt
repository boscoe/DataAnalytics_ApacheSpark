Anyone who has ever been desperate to charge a mobile device at an airport knows the feeling of frustration that can arise from trying to find something that’s been around for more than 100 years: an electric outlet.So it is not especially funny to spot one in the terminal and get down on hands and knees to plug in your charger, only to find that it is a trick, and that you are poking futilely at a real-looking sticker of an outlet pasted on a baseboard.“Apply to the wall at the airport, stand back and record all the miseries you cause,” says one online ad offering such stickers, $5.75 for a sheet of four.It is unclear what dark force would impel a prankster to do this, but the stickers are turning up in airport terminals where passengers often have to compete for any outlet available to charge the mobile devices that most business travelers carry. The reaction to being fooled this way is fairly clear, though.Advertisement“This is Satan’s handiwork,” says a comment on Reddit about the trick stickers from a traveler who was duped at the Denver airport.Business travelers depend mightily on mobile devices. About 85 percent use them for business while on the road, according to a study by Phocuswright, and 97 percent carry at least one mobile device when traveling, an Expedia study found.Frequent travelers often share tips on how to charge that power-hungry mobile-device.Besides the obvious spots where outlets are visible (and where business and leisure travelers can be seen sitting on floors to reach them), a terminal restaurant might be a place to find an unclaimed outlet, assuming the bartender is accommodating, suggests a post on the RoadNews website. Outlets also often can be found away from the crowds in corridors for the use of janitorial staff.Many airports have multiple-outlet charging stations in departure areas, some of them charging a fee, and some free, supported by advertising on the kiosk. And airports big and small that are doing major terminal renovations are adding extra power outlets and USB ports as part of the design plans.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And little Minot International Airport in North Dakota, undergoing a $40 million terminal expansion to accommodate increased traffic, is doing the same.The Minot airport director, Andrew D. Solsvig, said in an interview that ensuring sufficient availability of electrical outlets was a priority in bid negotiations for installing terminal seats and other furniture.Advertisement“I had discussions with some other airport people, and they said get as much power in your furniture as possible, because some said they realized after they’d installed new furniture that they needed a lot more electrical plug-ins,” he said. “So we made a conscious effort to do a minimum 50 percent of our furniture with electrical power.”Of course, many business travelers address the issue of charging by having access to an airline lounge, where outlets are plentiful. Overcrowding has become a problem at some lounges, however, which charge by the year for membership and also have day rates of about $50.“As a very frequent traveler who’s in airports all the time, I’m certainly seeing more and more solutions in airports for charging your battery, said John Jarrell, a senior vice president for airport information technology at Amadeus, the travel technology company. “So they must recognize that from a passenger-service standpoint that’s something very simple they can do to make it a better experience.”Mr. Jarrell added: “What’s better for me is that more and more airlines are putting USB ports on the airplanes, so even if I’m running low coming out of the airport, I can plug in during the flight, and when I get to the other end it’s ready,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on May 7, 2015, on Page F8 of the New York edition with the headline: New Twists in Plots to Grab Power at Airport Outlets.
