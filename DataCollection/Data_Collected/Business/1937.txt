Fosun said that Mr. Guo, 48, a self-styled student of Warren E. Buffett, would still be able to take part in major company decisions through appropriate means, without elaborating. Fosun officials said its shares and convertible bonds, which were suspended in trading on Hong Kong and the mainland earlier on Friday, would resume trading Monday. Chinese authorities have been clamping down on corruption in the financial sector. This year, several senior executives have been missing temporarily in the crackdown, in a sign of how serious China is about increasing scrutiny of its financial sector. “Guo is one of the high-profile Chinese entrepreneurs, and this incident will raise eyebrows among foreign regulators, as Fosun has been aggressively expanding its global insurance footprint,” said Sally Yim, senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service.
