The company, organized into five groups, said it would now have three — simple meals and beverages; global biscuits and snacks; and packaged fresh products, which include seasoned baby carrots. Weak sales prompted the chief executive, Denise Morrison, to start a turnaround program after taking over in 2011, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to revamp the company’s marketing and packaging strategies. New products include “to go” soups that can be made in a Keurig Green Mountain coffee machine. Advertisement
