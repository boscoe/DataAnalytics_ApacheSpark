Orders to American factories posted a modest gain in July, helped by the biggest rise in motor vehicles orders in a year and a solid gain in a category that tracks business investment plans. Factory orders rose 0.4 percent in July, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. Orders had increased a much larger 2.2 percent in June. The modest increase in factory orders in July suggests that manufacturing is still grappling with challenges like falling energy prices and a stronger dollar, which hurts exports. An important category that tracks business investment plans climbed 2.1 percent, posting the strongest gain in 13 months, and orders for motor vehicles surged 4 percent, the largest jump since July 2014. Orders for durable goods — items, like bicycles and battleships, expected to last at least three years — increased 2.2 percent in July. Orders for nondurable goods, like chemicals and paper, fell 1.3 percent.A version of this brief appears in print on September 3, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Factory Orders Rose In June, but the Gain Was Modest .
