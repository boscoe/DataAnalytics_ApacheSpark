CreditTom Jamieson for The New York Times        A new generation of a family business is bringing a fresh perspective to Hancocks, an antique jewelry dealer that has stood in London’s Mayfair neighborhood since 1849.Amy Burton, daughter of the current owners Stephen and Janie Burton, who acquired the business in 1992, recently introduced her own jewelry brand featuring unusual colored gemstones in bold, contemporary statement pieces, which are available exclusively at the store.In part inspired by the artistry and craftsmanship of the past and displayed alongside pieces with names like Lalique and Cartier, Castellani and Verdura, the 35-year-old designer’s collection is the first offering of contemporary jewelry by Hancocks in its more than 160-year history.Meanwhile, Ms. Burton’s brother Guy, 33, has developed his passion for old-cut diamonds, tracking down rare, high-quality antique stones from around the world for use in the creation of bespoke pieces.AdvertisementA life in the family jewelry business, which today resides in the historic Burlington Arcade, is not something either sibling envisioned growing up. “It was by no means a given, it was almost the opposite,” Ms. Burton said.AdvertisementAlthough both spent school vacations traveling with their parents to international trade fairs, helping out on the stand, “cleaning counters and so on,” Mr. Burton said, they both shied away initially from following in their parents’ professional footsteps.Ms. Burton was studying to become a beauty therapist when her parents invited her to Miami, where they were at an antiques show. Instead of spending her time on the beach as planned, Ms. Burton said, “I ended up working with them every day I was there, as I loved it so much.”An antiques trade apprenticeship in New York and jobs in London followed, before she joined the family business full time in 2009. Then, after gaining qualifications in gemology and diamonds at The Gemmological Assocation of Great Britain, or Gem-A, she took a course at the Gemological Institute of America to learn the art and techniques of jewelry design.It proved to be a turning point. “It’s where I found my niche,” she said. “I had all these designs in my head but I didn’t have the skills to communicate them to our craftsmen.”The pieces that now form her three collections, Crescendo, Unum and Disorient, followed, and as each one was finished, she would place it in the store safe. “As it was a whole new chapter for Hancocks, I wanted to wait until I had more to show,” she explained. “I didn’t want to get them lost in what is a saturated contemporary market.”The creations were unveiled in London this summer, making an impact with such pieces as the Disorient cuff, a geometric tangle of gold that wraps itself around a 123.7-carat rich purple amethyst.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One workshop in Hatton Garden, London’s jewelry quarter, has been working with Hancocks since 1851, not long before the store was instructed to create the Victoria Cross, Britain’s highest military honor for valor, a duty it retains today. “The master craftsmen at this workshop are doing filigree work and engraving just as their predecessors would have done 150 years ago,” Mr. Burton said.The appeal of old-cut stones over contemporary, frequently machine-cut, stones including the ubiquitous brilliant cut, is simple, he said: “People think of them as lumpy old stones in their grandmothers’s jewelry box, but I’m really trying to educate them about these hard-to-find, symmetrically cut, beautiful old stones.”“I love them because they are all so unique,” he added. “They were cut during an age when they weren’t necessarily cut to look as big as possible. They were cut to look as fabulous as possible in the piece of jewelry for which they were intended. They therefore tend to be a bit deeper and have so much more life than a modern-cut diamond.”He tracks down such diamonds from the antiques trade, as well as from private customers, and now heads a bespoke service at Hancocks through which customers can make selections for engagement rings and other jewelry. “I might meet with the clients six or seven times over a three-month period,” Mr. Burton said. “It’s a huge investment of time, but it’s all about developing trust. They’ll then come back to you for future jewelry purchases.”This school of thought about developing close and lasting customer relationships is something that has rung true in the jewelry industry since its inception.There is always something new to learn, however. “I’m learning something every single day,” Mr. Burton said. “As my dad says, ‘You’ll never know everything, ever.’ ”A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2016, on Page S4 of the New York edition with the headline: A new generation.
