TOKYO — Dell has agreed to sell its Perot Systems subsidiary, which provides information technology services to hospitals and governments, to the Japanese technology company NTT Data for almost $3.1 billion, NTT Data said in a regulatory filing on Monday.The deal is part of a reorganization by Dell as it prepares to buy  the  data storage provider EMC for $67 billion. That transaction, the largest ever in the technology industry, was announced in October.Dell bought Perot Systems, founded by the entrepreneur and onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot, for $3.9 billion in 2009 as it tried to expand beyond its struggling core business of making personal computers. But now Dell is shedding peripheral units and raising cash as it prepares to take over EMC.For NTT Data, the deal would add to a string of foreign acquisitions in the last several years. Once part of Japan’s government-owned telephone monopoly, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, NTT Data was spun off after its parent company was privatized in a process that began in the 1980s.NTT Data has been expanding rapidly, spending 62 billion yen, or about $550 million, buying companies outside Japan since 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has focused on services similar to those offered by Perot Systems, like handing digital medical records and billing systems for hospitals.NTT Data disclosed the agreement with Dell in a filing with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It did not say when it intended to complete the acquisition.A version of this article appears in print on March 29, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Dell to Sell I.T. Subsidiary to NTT Data for $3.1 Billion.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
