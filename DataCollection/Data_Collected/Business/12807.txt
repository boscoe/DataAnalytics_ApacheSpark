David Gregory, who endured a long and difficult exit from his perch as the host of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” is returning to a regular role on television as a political analyst on CNN, the network announced on Monday.The move brings a familiar face back to the television news landscape during one of the most contentious presidential campaigns in memory, and one for which CNN has aggressively devoted resources to covering.Since leaving “Meet the Press” in 2014 facing declining ratings and criticism of his style and performance, Mr. Gregory has been a scarce presence on TV news programs, appearing occasionally on cable news. He published a book, “How’s Your Faith,” that focuses on his religious interests.A correspondent and anchor for 20 years for NBC News, Mr. Gregory will now appear primarily on CNN’s morning program, “New Day.” On Monday, he joined the show’s regular hosts to dissect Donald J. Trump’s candidacy and the state of the race.The president of CNN, Jeff Zucker, who has made political coverage a priority for the network, is a longtime colleague of Mr. Gregory’s from their days at NBC.CNN also said on Monday that it had hired Angela Rye, a former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, as a political commentator.A version of this article appears in print on March 29, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Ex-NBC Anchor David Gregory to Join CNN in New Role.
