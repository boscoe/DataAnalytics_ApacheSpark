Hallac, a co-president of the asset management giant BlackRock and the architect of its industry-leading investment operating system, Aladdin, now in use around the world, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 50.He had been treated for colon cancer for almost four years. The firm said he died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.Mr. Hallac, whose specialty was in operations and technology, was the first official employee to be hired at BlackRock when the firm opened its doors in 1988. (He bought the firm’s first computer server that year.) Its chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, had founded the firm along with seven others. BlackRock is now the largest publicly traded fund management company in the world, overseeing $4.7 trillion. The Aladdin investment platform, conceived and put in place by Mr. Hallac, became BlackRock’s central nervous system, uniting and connecting the firm’s main trading, risk-management and communication functions. It was an innovative step at the time because most investment management firms, unlike their investment banking counterparts, did not have sophisticated technology operations.But Mr. Hallac and Mr. Fink, who had worked together at the First Boston Corporation as mortgage professionals, had a vision of an entrenched risk-management system that would be unique to BlackRock and ensure that the firm’s traders and investors were all on the same page when it came to making investment decisions.Aladdin became a central part of BlackRock Solutions, the firm’s risk management and advisory department, which Mr. Hallac set up in 2000. The Aladdin operating system is now used by 70 financial firms worldwide.BlackRock Solutions emerged as a major adviser to the United States Treasury and the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.Mr. Hallac became the firm’s chief operating officer in 2009 and played a central role in the integration of Barclays Global Investors, the index giant that BlackRock purchased in 2009.Despite undergoing cancer treatment, Mr. Hallac, known to all as Charlie, reported to work at BlackRock’s offices in Midtown Manhattan whenever he could, and through much of the summer he was putting in a full day’s work, the firm said.Charles Shaul Hallac was born on Oct. 20, 1964, in Tel Aviv and moved to the Philippines as a toddler. He grew up in Manila and graduated from International School Manila before going on to Brandeis University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and computer science in 1986. Before joining BlackRock, he was an associate in the Mortgage Products Group at First Boston. Mr. Hallac, who lived in Scarsdale, N.Y., is survived by his parents, David and Linda; his wife, Sarah; and three children, David, Rebecca and A.J.Advertisement
