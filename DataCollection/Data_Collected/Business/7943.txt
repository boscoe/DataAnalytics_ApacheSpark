When it comes to raising or lowering interest rates, what the Fed is really trying to do is balance growth and inflation. But they have a limited set of tools to accomplish their goal.WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve remains on track to raise interest rates later this year, and perhaps as soon as its next policy meeting in mid-September, as economic growth continues to meet its expectations.The Fed issued an upbeat assessment of economic conditions on Wednesday after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee. While growth remains disappointing by past standards, the Fed said the economy continued to expand at a “moderate” pace, which is driving “solid job gains and declining unemployment.”The statement suggested officials didn’t need to see much more progress before they started to increase their benchmark rate, which they have held near zero since December 2008. The Fed, which said after the last meeting, in June, of the Federal Open Market Committee that it wanted to see “further improvement” in labor markets, said on Wednesday that “some further improvement” would now suffice.“The addition of the word ‘some’ may appear minor, but the Fed doesn’t add words willy-nilly to the F.O.M.C. statement,” wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. “It leaves the door wide open to a September liftoff, but still retains the optionality to delay hiking if the jobs reports disappoint between now and mid-September.”AdvertisementThe decision to keep rates near zero for at least a few more weeks was unanimous, supported by all 10 voting members of the committee. But a number of those officials have said in recent months that they do not think the Fed should wait much longer.AdvertisementThe Fed’s policy committee next meets Sept. 16 and 17.Surveys of economic forecasters show that most expect the Fed to start raising interest rates at that September meeting. But measures of market expectations point to a December liftoff.Investors appeared to parse the Fed’s statement as somewhat reducing the chances of a September increase. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell after it was released, though it posted a small increase for the day, closing at 2.286 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 0.7 percent to close at 2,108.57.“Our expectation is that they will do something in September, but we wouldn’t be surprised if they found a reason to push it back toward December,” said Roger Bayston, director of the fixed-income group at Franklin Templeton, an investment firm based in San Mateo, Calif.The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero as the main element in its campaign to revive economic growth and increase employment after the Great Recession. And it has repeatedly extended that stimulus campaign in the face of disappointing economic news, to avoid raising rates too soon.In recent months, however, officials including Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, have suggested they are growing more worried about waiting too long.Economic growth has increased after a rough winter, and employment expanded by an average of 208,000 jobs a month during the first half of the year, dropping the unemployment rate to 5.3 percent.“If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds target,” Ms. Yellen said in congressional testimony this month.AdvertisementWednesday’s statement described economic progress on multiple fronts, but it noted some persistent concerns. Business investment remains weak. The relative strength of the American economy also has increased the value of the dollar, weighing on exports.
                More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.            And inflation remains sluggish. Prices rose just 0.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, according to the Fed’s preferred measure, a Commerce Department index of personal consumption expenditures. It was the 37th consecutive month that inflation has remained below the Fed’s declared target of 2 percent annual growth.Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials, however, say they are increasingly confident that continued growth will push up prices.In a recent research note, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said that the sluggishness of inflation did not amount to a “statistically significant departure” from the Fed’s target, and that inflation was likely to increase with economic output and employment.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Fed officials will be able to review two government estimates of second-quarter economic activity, as measured by the gross domestic product, and a pair of monthly labor market reports, among other data.The Fed, however, has signaled that it wants to preserve some uncertainty about its own plans. Officials say they will not prejudge the timing of an increase, focusing on the latest economic data. By contrast, the last time the Fed started a round of rate increases, back in 2004, it put markets on notice at the meeting before it took action.“While the tone was a bit more positive, there was no clear signal on when normalization will begin,” Jim O’Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., wrote about Wednesday’s statement. “We continue to forecast a start in September, but, of course, a lot can happen in seven weeks.”An article on Thursday about the Federal Reserve’s most recent assessment of the nation’s economic prospects misstated the location of the headquarters of the investment firm Franklin Templeton, an executive of which speculated on when the Fed might begin raising interest rates. It is based in San Mateo, Calif., not New York.A version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: September Is Looking Likelier for Fed’s First Rate Increase.
