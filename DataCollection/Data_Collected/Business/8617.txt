Triumph, a British company, must pay a $1.4 million cash penalty and spend at least $500,000 to improve safety practices. An additional $1 million in penalties could follow if additional violations emerge. In September 2014, Triumph recalled more than 1,300 motorcycles because of a defect that could reduce steering capability and increase the risk of a crash. An investigation by the American auto safety agency found that the company had failed to report the defect for more than a year. Triumph did not respond to a request for comment. Advertisement
