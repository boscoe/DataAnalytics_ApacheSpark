The Russian central bank cut its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 11 percent on Friday, bowing to pressure from businesses to make lending more accessible. The bank’s decision comes as the ruble has dropped to a four-month low. Market watchers said that Russian monetary officials were being forced to choose between cutting the interest rate, an assistance to Russian companies, and holding it steady to cushion the ruble’s fall and stem inflation. The Moscow-based investment bank Sberbank CIB said in a note to investors that Friday’s cut of 0.5 percentage points was not as big as anticipated, indicating that the central bank wants to “play it safe.” The ruble was down more than 2 percent after the move.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
