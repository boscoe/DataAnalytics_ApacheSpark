Third-quarter economic growth could surprise on the upside after government data on Wednesday showed the goods trade deficit narrowed sharply to a seven-month low in September. The Commerce Department reported that the goods trade deficit fell to $58.6 billion from $67.2 billion in August, leading some economists to estimate that trade subtracted only one-tenth percentage point from third-quarter gross domestic product. “We continue to see a large drag from private inventory investment as trimming headline growth, but with a smaller drag from net trade and more modest equipment investment, the composition of third-quarter G.D.P. is likely to be more balanced,” said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
