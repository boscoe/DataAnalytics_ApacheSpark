Its stock soared 40 percent after the company announced it had renewed its partnership with Walmart for another five years. Netflix climbed in after-hours trading following the company’s announcement that its board had approved a plan to split its stock.Stocks added to gains from Monday, as reports from Europe suggested that Greece’s proposals for budget savings appeared to have won initial approval from the nation’s creditors. European finance ministers are scheduled to meet on Wednesday.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece still has to sell the proposals to his own political party.

Apple, Microsoft and Google top the list of the highest-valued companies in the U.S., and Facebook looks to be on its way to joining them.Facebook was valued at $238 billion at the close of trading Tuesday, according to FactSet. Its stock gained $3.14, or 3.7 percent, at $87.88. Walmart was valued at $234 billion; its stock dipped 22 cents to $72.57.Shares of Facebook are up about 34 percent in the past year compared with just 8.2 percent for the S.&P. 500 index over all. Walmart, meanwhile, asked for investor patience after its most-recent earnings report showed a 7 percent profit decline because of the strong dollar and higher worker wages.Comparing the two companies’ financial results, though, shows just how much Wall Street is investing in growth and potential. In the first three months of this year, Facebook’s total revenue of $3.54 billion amounted to just a little more than Wal-Mart’s total profit for its fiscal first quarter of $3.34 billion.In the energy markets, the price of oil rose Tuesday on expectations that gasoline demand is rising, which would in turn boost demand for crude.Benchmark U.S. crude for August delivery rose 63 cents to close at $61.01 a barrel in New York.
