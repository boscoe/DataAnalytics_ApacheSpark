The bank, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., said it had increased its consumer loans — extending 1.2 million new credit cards in the quarter — while also releasing millions of dollars it had set aside to cover potential losses from defaulting consumers.Much of the good news that came from the banks’ consumer businesses, however, was overshadowed by issues in their commercial loan portfolios, where persistently low oil and gas prices have put pressure on the highly indebted energy industry.Bank of America said it had set aside an additional $525 million for oil- and gas-related loan losses, bringing its total energy reserves up to about $1 billion, covering about 4.6 percent of its energy loans.Wells Fargo increased its oil- and gas-related reserves to $1.7 billion in the first quarter, covering 9.3 percent of its energy portfolio, and began to record losses on some of the loans.JPMorgan put aside an additional $529 million to cover potential losses on loans it has made to oil and natural gas companies and another $162 million for metals and mining companies.Results at Bank of America and JPMorgan, which have large investment banking and trading units, also slumped in the quarter.Trading in stocks and bonds was hurt by volatility in world markets, as the outlook for the global economy darkened and the direction of interest rates became uncertain.Overall market revenue at JPMorgan fell 13 percent from a year earlier. At Bank of America, sales and trading revenue dropped 16 percent after accounting for certain debt valuation adjustments.Wells was less affected by the rough market conditions because its Wall Street operations are smaller than those of its peers.It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.As the fortunes of their investment and consumer banking units seesaw, banks might seem tempted to increase their the most profitable businesses and take more risks on the strength of American consumer.But bank executives vowed they would stay prudent. Mr. Donofrio said Bank of America was able to expand its credit card business without extending loans to people with less than stellar credit.John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, said the bank had been willing to give up market share in the red-hot auto market to avoid taking too much risk. Wells said it has capped its subprime exposure at 10 percent of total auto loans.“We drew a line and lost some share,” Mr. Shrewsberry said in an interview. “We have stuck with the approach not to take any more credit risk.”Despite the challenges, the quarter was better than expected. All three big banks reported higher profit than analysts polled by Reuters had forecast.Bank of America said its profit declined 13 percent from a year ago to $2.7 billion, or 21 cents a share. Analysts expected profit of 20 cents a share.At Wells Fargo, total profit fell 5 percent to $5.5. billion, or 99 cents a share. Analysts expected earnings of 97 cents a share.“We are running this company so we can be a source of stability and strength,” Mr. Donofrio said. “We are not trying to earn all of our money in good times only to give it back in tough times.”Advertisement
