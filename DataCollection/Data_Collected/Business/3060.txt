Openly gay, he became known as a champion of gays in the military and same-sex marriage.A series of publications — Time magazine, The Atlantic and The Daily Beast — hosted his blog before he again struck out on his own in early 2013, charging readers for unlimited access to his site. The move was part of a trend in journalism. In two years, Mr. Sullivan wrote, he had 30,000 subscribers and a million dollars in revenue.His announcement set off a debate over whether blogging had died with the rise of social media and mobile phones. Benjy Sarlin, a reporter at MSNBC, said on Twitter, “The already waning blog era is officially over.” But Chris Cillizza, a blogger at The Washington Post, said that “conflating a publishing medium with a sort of online writing — opinionated, snarky — that tends to be the preferred approach of many of its users is a mistake.”Mr. Sullivan did not respond to a message seeking comment, but in his post, he discussed what he would do next.“I want to read again, slowly, carefully,” he wrote. “I want to absorb a difficult book and walk around in my own thoughts with it for a while. I want to have an idea and let it slowly take shape, rather than be instantly blogged.”Advertisement
