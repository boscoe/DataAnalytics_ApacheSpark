If convicted, he could face a prison sentence of several years, particularly if judges deem that the offenses are crimes against the state.The handling of the so-called Lagarde list, a potential source of much-needed tax revenue that was never exploited, fed widespread public anger in the debt-racked country. The authorities were criticized for not properly investigating the list in a bid to protect the wealthy and privileged while other Greeks suffered cuts to salaries and pensions amid an austerity drive demanded by the country’s creditors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the I.M.F.Greece’s new leftist-led government has pledged to make up for years of impunity; to seriously crack down on tax evasion, particularly among the wealthy; and to make fighting corruption “a national priority.”Greece’s so-called special court is convened only when high-ranking politicians are accused of crimes during their time in office. The last time was in 1991 when a former prime minister, Andreas Papandreou, was tried, and in 1992 cleared, over a financial scandal that brought down his Socialist government in 1989. He went on to serve a second term as prime minister from 1993 until shortly before his death in 1996.Advertisement
