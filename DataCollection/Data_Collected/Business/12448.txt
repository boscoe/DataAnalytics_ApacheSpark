AdvertisementSupported byBy Leslie Picker and Ian AustenTransCanada Corporation’s request to build an oil pipeline through the United States was denied recently. So the company sought to buy its way into the region instead.TransCanada, whose Keystone XL pipeline project was rejected by the Obama administration in November, had been in talks with Columbia Pipeline Group about an acquisition, people briefed on the discussions said.Those discussions subsided recently and may not lead to a deal, one of the people said.Columbia’s shares gained 8.5 percent on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported the talks. The increase gave Columbia a market value of $8.6 billion.TransCanada confirmed in a statement that it had been in conversations about a “potential transaction with a third party” without naming the company and declining to comment further. A representative from Columbia declined to comment.Like many companies in the energy industry, however, Columbia’s stock has plummeted in the last year. Pipeline companies like Columbia, which were once seen as immune from the slump in commodity prices because they carry the oil or natural gas rather than drill it, have been hit in the last few months. But the volatile share price makes consummating deals in the energy sector more difficult as well.The move on Columbia by TransCanada suggests a shift away from its oil business, in which expansion plans have been mired in political controversy.After a long delay, last November the Obama administration rejected TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline project that would have linked oil sands in Alberta with refineries in the Gulf Coast of the United States. TransCanada, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, is now seeking $15 billion in damages under the North American Free Trade Agreement and has asked a court in Houston to overturn the decision.Its current proposal to convert and extend a natural gas line running to Eastern Canada to carry oil from the oil sands has encountered strong public opposition in Quebec, one of the main provinces it passes through. While it is unclear if that will doom the project, known as Energy East, it is expected to at least delay approval.TransCanada’s business of exporting natural gas to the northeastern United States has also been declining because of competition from natural gas produced through hydraulic fracturing of shale formations in that region. Columbia’s pipeline network is a major conduit for that gas.Columbia, which is based in Houston, owns and operates 15,000 miles of pipeline that stretches from New York to the Gulf of Mexico.OpinionAdvertisement
