LONDON — The London Stock Exchange Group said on Tuesday that it was in “exclusive” talks to sell the French arm of its majority-owned clearing business to Euronext, part of the British-based company’s efforts to win regulatory approval for a merger with Deutsche Börse.The Deutsche Börse merger with the London Stock Exchange Group would create Europe’s largest stock market operator by far, combining exchanges in Britain, Germany and Italy. But European Union antitrust regulators opened an “in-depth” investigation into the deal in September over its potential impact on competition in financial markets.The clearing of trades is one of several areas being explored in the inquiry, which is expected to conclude next year.On Tuesday, the London Stock Exchange Group said in a news release that it was exploring the sale of LCH S.A., the French operating arm of the LCH.Clearnet Group, to “address proactively antitrust concerns raised by the European Commission.”Advertisement“There can be no certainty that this will lead to any transaction or as to the terms upon which any transaction might proceed,” the London Stock Exchange Group added.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It was the companies’ third attempt to combine since 2000.Before the shareholder votes this summer, both exchanges spent much of their time trying to reassure investors about the merger in light of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.They have said that Britain’s exit would not change the deal but could “well affect the volume or nature” of business carried out by the combined company.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.A version of this article appears in print on December 21, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: London Exchange Operator in Talks to Sell French Unit.
