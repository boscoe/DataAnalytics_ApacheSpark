With a midnight Saturday deadline looming, hundreds of death and injury claims have been pouring into General Motors’ compensation program for victims of accidents caused by a defective ignition switch in millions of small cars.The program, which is being independently run by the lawyer and victim compensation expert Kenneth R. Feinberg, had received 3,350 claims by Thursday evening, nearly 300 more than it had in hand the previous Friday.So far, 779 claims have come in this month, the largest monthly volume since the inception of the program and nearly a quarter of the total, said Camille Biros, the deputy administrator of the program. Based on their past experience running victim funds for the Sept. 11 attacks, the Boston Marathon bombings and others, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros expect a surge of last-minute filings on Saturday.
                More vehicles, including old models, have been recalled in the United States in 2014 than ever before. Explore the size and scope of the recalls, and find out if your car has been affected.            G.M. has given Mr. Feinberg sole discretion to determine which claims are eligible, and he has already offered payments of more than $1 million apiece for 50 deaths — a total nearly four times G.M.’s initial estimate of 13 fatalities linked to the defect. With more than 200 death claims still under review or awaiting additional evidence, that total is likely to climb.AdvertisementG.M. had already extended the filing deadline by a month after The New York Times reported in November that the family of Jean Averill, whom the company counted as one of its 13 original fatalities, did not know about the compensation program and had not received notification from the company that it had counted her among the victims. Despite a plea from lawmakers and others, G.M. declined this week to push the deadline back a second time.Advertisement“We believe notice (and publicity about the program) has been extensive and effective,” a G.M. spokesman, James R. Cain, wrote in an email.Mr. Cain said the company had sent 5.3 million letters to current and former owners of the recalled vehicles between May and November to inform them about the compensation program and posted information about it on the company’s website and in other communications.
                The New York Times has exposed missteps and delays by automakers and federal safety regulators in responding to deadly defects in automobiles during what became a record year for recalls.            Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros expect the compensation program to remain in operation through the spring as they continue to review claims. Hundreds of them have been filed with insufficient evidence, and they will allow claimants to continue to submit evidence and documents during the review period.A total of 2.6 million cars have been recalled because of the defective ignition switch. The company began the recalls last February but acknowledged that engineers and others inside the company had known about the problem for more than a decade.Outcry over the years of inaction has led to numerous investigations and lawsuits. G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, has said the Feinberg fund was intended as a way for the company to live up to its civic duty to compensate those who had suffered as a result of the defect. But in accepting the payments, victims must waive their right to sue the company.Mr. Cain said the company would not discuss now much money G.M. has paid out through the program until its work was completed. Last year, company officials disclosed that they had set aside $400 million for the fund and said the amount could grow.A version of this article appears in print on January 31, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Nearing Cutoff, Victim Claims Pour Into G.M.
