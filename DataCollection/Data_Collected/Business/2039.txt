AdvertisementSupported byBy Nicola ClarkRolls-Royce, the British engineering group, announced a major management restructuring on Wednesday that the company said was aimed at simplifying a byzantine hierarchy and lowering operating costs after a string of profit warnings.The group presented the changes as part of a broader plan to eliminate as much as 200 million pounds, or over $300 million, in annual operating costs. However, the restructuring also comes amid recent news media speculation in Britain about a possible government intervention to avoid a potential foreign takeover of Rolls-Royce, one of the few British world-leading technology companies.Rolls-Royce, which last year announced cuts of close to 5 percent of its work force of 55,000, has been struggling against intensifying competition in the aircraft-engine market, along with cuts in British military spending and weaker demand for ships and turbines from the oil and gas industry. The engineering group is separate from the Rolls-Royce automaker, which is owned by BMW.In a statement, Warren East, who became chief executive in April, said Rolls-Royce had decided to do away with a divisional structure that had combined the group’s sprawling operations under the responsibility of two senior executives who, in turn, reported to Mr. East. Instead, beginning next month, the heads of the group’s five main business areas — which include engines for civilian and military aircraft, as well as turbines for power companies and nuclear submarines — will report directly to the chief executive, Mr. East said. A new chief operating officer would also be recruited from outside the group next year.“The changes we are announcing today are the first important steps in driving operational excellence and returning Rolls-Royce to its long-term trend of profitable growth,” Mr. East said.As a result of the shake-up, the group said that the chief of its aerospace engine business, Tony Wood, would be leaving Rolls-Royce in 2016 after 15 years at the group. Lawrie Haynes, who has led its land and sea division since 2013, would also step down, Mr. East said.Rolls-Royce has lowered its earnings forecasts five times over the past two years, citing high operating costs, particularly in its marine division, where demand has been weak, and declining profit margins in its aircraft-engine maintenance business. Its share price has fallen by more than 40 percent this year.Rolls-Royce’s financial troubles have raised the hackles of some of its larger shareholders, including a California-based investor fund, ValueAct Capital, which recently raised its stake to 10 percent and has expressed interest in a seat on the Rolls-Royce board.While the British government owns a so-called golden share in Rolls-Royce that allows it to block any sale to a foreign company and limits foreign ownership to 15 percent, the depth of the company’s financial troubles has reportedly prompted London to consider contingency plans.British news media reports suggested this week that the government was considering a number of options, including nationalizing Rolls-Royce’s nuclear submarine and reactor business, or helping to orchestrate a merger of parts of Rolls-Royce with Britain’s other major military contractor, BAE Systems.Rolls-Royce produces reactors for Britain’s fleet of nuclear submarines and currently holds a £31 billion contract to develop a new generation of Trident submarines to be equipped with nuclear missiles. But government officials have sought to play down speculation that they are considering a government rescue of Rolls-Royce to safeguard the submarine program.Asked in Parliament on Tuesday about the reports of a government rescue plan for Rolls-Royce, Anna Soubry, Britain’s minister for business, said only that the government recognized the group’s importance to the British economy and was “monitoring the situation carefully.” But she appeared to dismiss the notion of an outright nationalization, saying: “This is 2015. We’re not back in the ′60s.”Advertisement
