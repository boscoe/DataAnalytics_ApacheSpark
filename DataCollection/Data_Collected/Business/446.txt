BlackRock, the fund management giant, on Wednesday reported an inflow of money to its main investment funds in the third quarter even as investors reacted to volatile swings in stock and bond markets.BlackRock is the world’s largest publicly traded money manager and the leading provider of exchange-traded funds — the mutual fund industry’s fastest-growing investment vehicle. As such, its financial performance is closely watched by market participants.The company said on Wednesday that earnings for the third quarter on an adjusted basis declined 5 percent, to $844 million, or $5 a share, from $890 million, or $5.21 a share, in the quarter a year ago.The muted results reflect today’s highly uncertain investment performance. As stock and bond markets swooned in August and September, many investors withdrew their money in the hope of riding out the storm.AdvertisementNevertheless, BlackRock reported net investment flows of $50 billion, driven by $23 billion moving into its exchange-traded funds called iShares. In the second quarter, the firm had net investment outflows of $7.3 billion.AdvertisementOverall assets under management, the most crucial gauge for investment managers, fell to $4.5 trillion at the end of September, from $4.7 trillion at the end of June.Assets in the firm’s main profit driver — exchange-traded funds — were $1 trillion at the end of the quarter, mostly flat from the quarter that ended in June and up from $975 billion a year ago.“Despite all the insecurities in the market, we had $50 billion in growth,” said Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive. “We can’t control world markets, but because of our diverse range of products, we are in a very good position.”
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            Mr. Fink also addressed some of the criticisms leveled at the exchange-traded funds industry after the events of Aug. 24, when the prices of a number of the funds fell sharply relative to their underlying assets.Several industry participants have said the price dislocations should be seen as a warning for the sector, which has absorbed enormous fund inflows in the past four years.“We didn’t have the problem — this was a market structure problem,” Mr. Fink said. “It was a big event, but 90 minutes later, everything was fine.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
