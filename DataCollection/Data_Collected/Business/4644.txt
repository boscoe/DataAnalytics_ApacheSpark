AdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la MercedOcwen Financial, the mortgage servicing firm under regulatory scrutiny, disclosed on Tuesday that it planned to sell loan servicing rights for $25 billion in loans to another firm, Nationstar Mortgage.The announcement follows a statement on Monday by the mortgage servicer that it faces potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange. The reason, according to a separate statement, is that it has not filed its annual report to shareholders on time.Ocwen said in its statement that it was continuing to examine whether its Home Loan Servicing Solutions business can “meet its obligations to fund new servicing advances.” Though it did not disclose what that meant, Ocwen cautioned that the situation could have a material negative impact on its finances.Shares in Ocwen were down more than 3 percent in early trading on Tuesday, at $8.50.In selling off the rights to service 142,000 mortgages, which are owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Ocwen is continuing to scale back its business as it faces intense regulatory scrutiny. The firm has already paid a fine after New York State’s Department of Financial Services accused it of improper practices, and its chairman agreed to step down.The firm is still under pressure from a California regulator, which pushed this year to suspend its license to operate in that state for 12 months.The transaction on Tuesday involving servicing rights isn’t the first that Ocwen has announced so far this year. The firm previously sold nearly $10 billion in rights to Nationstar last month, $9.6 billion to Green Tree Loan Servicing and a reported $45 billion to JPMorgan Chase.Ocwen’s chief executive, Ronald M. Faris, has said that the company intends to eventually get out of the business of servicing loans held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Advertisement
