PARIS —  Christie’s reported a surge in half-year worldwide sales of art on Monday to a record 2.9 billion pounds, or $4.5 billion, buoyed by new clients and a strong market for Impressionist and Modern Art, as well as Postwar and Contemporary Art. At the spring sale, an auction record of $179.4 million was set for Pablo Picasso’s “Les Femmes d’Alger.”The sales total at London-based Christie’s increased 8 percent in British pounds from the same period in 2014, with new buyers increasingly attracted by online sales, the company said in a statement. With fluctuations of the strong dollar, the result in that currency was flat.Christie’s is a privately owned company belonging to the French billionaire collector François Pinault. Unlike the publicly listed Sotheby’s, it does not divulge its profits or losses, but does reveal its sales.“Christie’s clients spanned 99 countries, demonstrating how truly international sales activity is at all levels and reflecting the expanse of the art market,” Patricia Barbizet, Christie’s chief executive, said in a statement.AdvertisementThe company said a growing, global customer base was spending more on Asian art, with sales increasing in that category by 34 percent to £298.3 million, or $461.4 million. Old masters works did not have the same appeal, with sales of 19th-century European and Russian art down 32 percent to £71.1 million, or $110 million.In May, the company also set an auction record for the sale of a sculpture, “L’homme au doigt,” by Alberto Giacometti for $141.3 million.AdvertisementSotheby’s, Christie’s chief rival, does not report its half-year results until later this summer. But a spokeswoman for the company said that auction sales for the first half of 2015, ended in late June, totaled $3.16 billion. That figure, however, does not include private sales or major July auctions of Contemporary and old masters paintings in London, which reaped $330 million .A version of this article appears in print on July 21, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Impressionist and Modern Art Lifts Christie’s First Half .
