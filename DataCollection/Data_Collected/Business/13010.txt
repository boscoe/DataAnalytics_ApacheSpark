Over the last decade, financial technology has gone from a boring niche in Silicon Valley to one of the fastest-growing sectors in the tech industry. It has become big enough that it now has its own nerdy name: fintech. The fintech label is being applied to almost any start-up that is trying to use technology to solve some financial problem, and that can mean everything from insurance brokering to data analytics to budgeting software. So far, though, the biggest investments have focused on new ways to lend money to consumers, and new ways to make and receive payments. Most of the companies in this space are still too small to be familiar to anyone in the outside world, but that is starting to change. Whether it will be the revolution that some in Silicon Valley talk about is still an open question.

Silicon Valley is trying to fill the void with new, cheaper ways of originating loans. People are bad at managing their own budgets and investments and often rely on expensive brokers and financial products. New start-ups are trying to offer cheaper automated alternatives. COMPANYFOUNDEDVALUATION, IN BILLIONSEnvestnet1.11999COMPANYFOUNDEDVALUATION, IN BILLIONSYodlee1999Sold to Envestnet for $660 mil.Prosper1.92006Mint2006Sold for $170 mil.Lending Club3.22007Credit Karma3.52007OnDeck0.62007Betterment0.72008Kabbage1.02009LearnVest2009Sold for $250 mil.Funding Circle1.12010NerdWallet0.52009CommonBond2011UNKNOWNPersonal Capital0.32009SoFi3.02011Motif0.82010Affirm2012UNKNOWNWealthfront0.72011Avant2.02012Wall Street Trading and Data AnalysisPaymentsStock and bond trading desks are already some of the most technologically sophisticated places in the world, but start-ups are offering new ways to analyze data and buy, sell and price assets. It has been standard for merchants to pay over 2 percent of every transaction to one of the credit card networks.
