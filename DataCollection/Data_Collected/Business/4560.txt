Graco Children’s Products has agreed to pay $10 million to settle claims that it failed to recall promptly about four million child car seats with a defective buckle that could make it difficult to free a child in an emergency, federal regulators said on Friday.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Graco would pay a $3 million fine and spend $7 million developing safety programs.Graco had insisted that the only problem with the buckles was caused by children spilling food or drinks on them. But some parents told federal regulators that they had to cut straps to free a child, and regulators dismissed the contamination explanation, saying such a problem was foreseeable. In January 2014, the agency demanded a recall. Graco refused, but about a month later, it relented.The penalty comes as the safety agency has come under increasing pressure from lawmakers to provide more vigorous oversight of the automobile industry, which recalled a record number of vehicles last year.In January, regulators announced a $70 million fine for Honda for underreporting fatal accidents and injuries to the government, doubling the $35 million penalty imposed on General Motors last year after the automaker failed to report for more than a decade a defective ignition switch — a flaw that has now been linked to more than 67 deaths.AdvertisementIn August, the agency fined Hyundai nearly $17.4 million for not reporting in a timely manner a defect that affected the braking in its cars. And in October, regulators levied a $3.5 million penalty against Ferrari for failing to submit reports on fatal accidents.AdvertisementIn the Graco case, federal regulators opened an investigation in December into whether the company should have recalled the seats sooner than it did. That investigation was prompted by a review of Graco documents that showed that parents complained to Graco about the buckles in 2009.In 2012, however, the company was telling parents how to clean the buckles, arguing that there was no safety issue.Federal regulations require that once a manufacturer is aware of a safety problem, it has five business days to inform the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of its plan for a recall or face a civil fine. The maximum penalty is $35 million.In a statement on Friday, Graco said the company had “evaluated the issue in a timely manner.” Nevertheless, in the consent agreement, Graco acknowledged that “it did not provide the required notice to N.H.T.S.A.”“Parents need to know that the seats they trust to protect their children are safe,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement, “and that when there’s a problem, the manufacturer will meet its obligations to fix the defect quickly.”Graco, a division of Newell Rubbermaid, which is based in Atlanta, said on Friday that the company regretted “that we fell short of N.H.T.S.A.’s expectations for data collection and reporting procedures.”Graco will be required to submit an independent audit showing how it spends the $7 million, which is to be used on programs including “identifying potential safety trends affecting car seats industrywide and launching a child safety awareness campaign.”This is not the first time Graco has had problems with federal safety regulators. It paid a $4 million fine in 2005 after the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it had failed to inform the agency about problems with its products.Danielle Ivory contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Firm to Pay $10 Million Over Recall of Car Seats.
