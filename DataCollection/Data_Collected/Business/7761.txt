Federal and state banking regulators have fined a Citigroup unit over its failure to employ adequate safeguards against illicit financial transactions or other suspicious activities.The unit, Banamex USA, a small California bank that specializes in wiring money between Mexico and the United States, must pay $140 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, of which $40 million will go to the California Department of Business Oversight, the state and federal regulators announced on Wednesday.In a statement, the F.D.I.C. said that Banamex USA, which Citigroup purchased in 2001, failed to retain staff that was “qualified and knowledgeable” about the Bank Secrecy Act. Banamex USA also lacked adequate controls that could detect illicit financial transactions and suspicious activity, the F.D.I.C. said.Federal prosecutors in Massachusetts had subpoenaed Banamex USA as part of an investigation into whether illicit drug money moved through some of its accounts. And for years, banking regulators had been citing Banamex USA for shortcomings in its efforts to guard against money laundering.Citigroup said it was in the process of winding down Banamex USA, which now operates only a few branches and holds about $500 million in assets and deposits of approximately $460 million. The bank plans to close its branches in Houston and San Antonio in October. The Los Angeles branch will remain open through the closing process.In a statement, Citigroup said the Banamex USA wind-down was “in line with Citi’s simplification of its business model.”A version of this article appears in print on July 23, 2015, on Page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Merger Approved.
