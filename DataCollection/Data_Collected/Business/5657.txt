In that business, the firm reported a 12 percent increase in economic net income, to $289 million in the quarter. This gain was the result of a busy first quarter when Carlyle sold positions in many of its public holdings, taking some of its bets off the table in a buoyant equity market in the United States.The firm exited its position in Altice, the European cable and mobile provider, reaping gross proceeds of $1.1 billion. It also made 10 new private equity investments and 24 real estate transactions.Despite the flurry of transactions, distributable earnings — a measure of the amount of cash generated that will be given to shareholders — declined 19 percent to $148 million, compared with $183 million over the same quarter a year ago.Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.More broadly, the results were weaker.In its global market strategies business, which includes Carlyle’s important hedge fund portfolio, the firm said that economic net income for the business fell 82 percent, to $10 million, largely as a result of lower management fees. The firm reported just $2 million of realized net performance fees in the quarter, compared with $5 million in the period a year earlier.In its real estate business, Carlyle reported an economic net loss of $33 million, a result in large part to a tax judgment in France that was greater than what the firm had anticpated. It was forced to pay $112 million in taxes, interest and penalties of $112 million, for an investment the firm exited between 2007 and 2009. Carlyle has appealed the judgement.Without the tax charge, Carlyle said its economic net income was $1 million, compared with a $17 million economic net loss in the same period last year.It announced a dividend of 33 cents.Carlyle’s money-raising machine was in full swing in the first quarter and the firm added $4.4 billion of new capital.“We continue to see an accelerating level of investor interest in our products and a majority of our funds in the market are hitting or exceeding their fundraising target sizes,” David M. Rubenstein, co-chief executive of Carlyle, said in a statement.Carlyle said its earnings were dragged down by energy investments. Yet, even as it continues to feel the effects of plummeting oil and gas prices, the firm is hoping to find opportunities to scoop up new investments. It recently raised new capital and has $10 billion to put to work in the sector.The firm also said it has $60.4 billion of dry powder.Advertisement
