Earlier in the day, Renault’s stock price plunged on news that the government had recently searched the company’s offices in Boulogne-Billancourt, near Paris, as part of the investigation.The preliminary findings, part of a French government review of cars and their emissions after revelations of Volkswagen’s emissions-cheating scandal, are the latest indication of the discrepancies between official air-quality standards in Europe and the on-the-road performance of vehicles.The French government provided few details on Thursday of its findings so far but said it would work with the companies to try to bring their cars into compliance with air-quality standards.Renault’s stock plunged more than 20 percent after publication of a newsletter by a union representing Renault workers, which disclosed the recent government searches of the company’s offices. Some news reports then suggested the company might face an emissions scandal similar to the one that has plagued Volkswagen.The shares recovered somewhat after Renault said that government investigators had so far found no wrongdoing. But they still ended down more than 10 percent in Paris trading.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The French economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, speaking to reporters late in the day during a visit to Berlin, insisted that Renault was “in no way a comparable situation” to that of Volkswagen and expressed his “confidence” in the French manufacturer, which is 15 percent owned by the French state.The French Environment Ministry has been investigating various carmakers’ vehicles in recent months, including Volkswagen’s, after disclosures in September that 11 million Volkswagens with diesel engines had software that produced artificially low readings during official emissions tests.The Volkswagen scandal has called attention to the discrepancies between what diesel cars emit during official laboratory tests and how much they pollute in everyday driving. European rules ban so-called defeat devices meant to trick emissions testers, but carmakers have broad leeway to tune their cars to perform well on the tests.Efforts to tighten testing procedures — and to test cars on the road rather than just in the lab — have run into strong opposition in the European Parliament from legislators in countries like Germany that have large auto industries.In a statement on Thursday, the French Environment Ministry said tests had been conducted by UTAC, a private French company appointed by the ministry to review the emissions performance of French carmakers, on 22 vehicles of 100 that the government plans to test. The ministry said that the initial round of tests found that just two vehicles, both made by Volkswagen, had defeat devices installed. The statement did not specify the models.The ministry said “several” foreign manufacturers and one French company — which Ms. Royal subsequently identified as Renault — exceeded emission standards for carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide.The ministry’s statement said that Renault had already indicated it would “exchange views with members of the commission at its next meeting,” referring to the government-appointed commission reviewing the tests. “Similarly, other manufacturers will be invited,” the ministry said.Renault said it was cooperating fully with the government’s investigation.Fabienne Barbey, a company spokeswoman, said late Thursday that Renault had been in discussions with the commission since last month about the discrepancies found between lab results and road tests on some of its vehicles and about the ways Renault planned to address them. Ms. Barbey cited a company statement on Dec. 17 announcing plans to invest 50 million euros, or about $54 million, toward an “accelerated deployment” of a new exhaust-gas recirculation system for its diesel vehicles that would “significantly reduce the gaps” identified between the real-world and laboratory emissions test results of its cars.The company expects to start installing the enhanced exhaust treatment system in new cars starting in July.Nicola Clark reported from Paris, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement
