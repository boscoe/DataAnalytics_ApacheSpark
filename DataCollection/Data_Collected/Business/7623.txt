A new financial lifeline for Greece and strong corporate earnings helped push United States stocks higher on Thursday.Stocks rose from the start, following a jump in major European indexes, as strong second-quarter results from Netflix, eBay, Citigroup and other companies fed the buying. By the end of the day, nine of 10 industry sectors of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index posted gains.Investors have been worried about a possible Greek financial collapse, plunging Chinese stocks and Puerto Rico’s struggles to pay its debt. But investors put those concerns aside as upbeat second-quarter company results suggested that earnings might turn out better than expected. A key gauge of anxiety among investors, the Vix, was down nearly 40 percent on Thursday from a week ago.“Some of the red flags in the market have come down, and now the market can look to earnings,” said Kevin Dorwin, a managing principal of Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, an investment firm based in San Francisco.

That news was followed by an announcement from the European Union that it would provide a short-term loan to Greece. And the European Central Bank said it would raise the amount of emergency liquidity available to the country’s banks.AdvertisementGermany’s DAX and France’s CAC-40 each climbed 1.5 percent.Among United States companies posting earnings, Netflix was a big winner. Its stock soared 18 percent, the biggest gain in the S.&P. 500. Investors were reacting to an announcement on Wednesday that the company had added 3.3 million video-streaming subscribers, far more than projected. The shares climbed $17.68, to $115.81.Since the start of earnings season a week ago, 38 companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported results, and most have beaten expectations. That has raised hope that earnings will not be as bad as many had feared. S&P Capital IQ, a financial data provider, is predicting that earnings at companies in the S.&P. 500 will fall 3.8 percent from a year earlier.Earnings expectations may be low, but “if today is any indication, three-quarters of the companies will beat” them, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank.
