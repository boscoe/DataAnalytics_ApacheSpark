Federal officials said on Friday that the first tests of a guardrail system, banned by more than 30 states after safety concerns were raised, had met the tests’ criteria.The Federal Highway Administration ordered the tests on the ET-Plus guardrail system made by Trinity Industries, after a federal jury found the company liable for defrauding the government by not disclosing design changes to the system made in 2005.A summary of the results of the first four of eight tests, which involved guardrails about 28 inches in height, showed the guardrails with passing marks for all of the evaluation factors, except one: “vehicle trajectory,” in which the vehicle is not supposed to move into an adjacent lane after the crash. But the agency noted that meeting that criterion was not a requirement for passing the test.The agency said that the tests would not be the end of its work to determine whether the roadside devices were safe.“We’ve said from Day 1 that, when it came to testing, we weren’t going to do this one task, check a box and be done with it,” Gregory Nadeau, the agency’s administrator, said on Friday.The agency did not say when the results of the other four tests would be publicly available. One of those tests — the eighth and final — involved the driver’s side door striking a bent piece of guardrail, causing what appeared to be substantial damage. It is unclear whether the agency will consider that to be a potential risk for vehicle occupants.A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Guardrail System Passes First Tests, U.S. Agency Says.
