LONDON — Shares of Aer Lingus fell more than 5 percent in afternoon trading on Monday after the parent of British Airways and the Spanish carrier Iberia confirmed on Friday that the Irish airline’s board had rejected a revised takeover bid.The International Consolidated Airlines Group, or I.A.G., said last month that it made a preliminary offer for Aer Lingus, but the airline’s board rejected the approach.Late Friday, I.A.G. said that it made a revised proposal for Aer Lingus on Dec. 29 but that the approach was also rejected by the Aer Lingus board. I.A.G. said that it offered to pay 2.40 euros a share in cash, or about $2.84 a share, up from its initial offering of €2.30 a share.Shares of Aer Lingus declined 5.6 percent, to €2.36, in morning trading in Dublin on Monday.Analysts have said the deal would be attractive in part because Aer Lingus holds many takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow Airport near London, which is the main hub of British Airways.Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports, handling more than 191,000 passengers a day, the bulk of them from international flights, including more lucrative long-haul flights.British Airways is by far the largest airline at Heathrow, accounting for 51.3 percent of all takeoffs and landings there each week, based on current traffic data, whereas Aer Lingus has 3.1 percent.The Irish airline market, given its proximity to Britain and potential to increase British Airways’ traffic at its hub, also makes the deal attractive.Any proposal to acquire the airline would also require the approval of the discount carrier Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus, as well as the Irish government, which has a 25.1 percent stake. Ryanair has made three unsuccessful offers for Aer Lingus.I.A.G. is one of the world’s largest airline groups, carrying more than 77.3 million passengers in 2014. Its portfolio of carriers includes British Airways and two Spanish carriers – Iberia, a full-service airline, and Vueling Airlines, a low-cost carrier.The company posted revenue of €15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014, up 7.4 percent from the period a year earlier.
