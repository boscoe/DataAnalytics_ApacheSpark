Combined with agreements from other distributors, the agreement will help Discovery secure high-single-digit growth for its so-called affiliate revenue, according to one executive with knowledge of the agreement who requested anonymity because the contract was private.The new deal also includes some elements that were not in previous agreements. Those include the ability for Comcast customers to view past and current seasons of programming Discovery across an array of devices both in and out of the home.“Comcast is a dynamic and innovative company and has been a great partner of Discovery’s for over two decades,” David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Discovery Communications, said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our relationship and unlocking the value of Discovery’s content.”Added Neil Smit, chief executive of Comcast Cable: “We’re pleased to extend our relationship with Discovery and its family of networks.”Advertisement
