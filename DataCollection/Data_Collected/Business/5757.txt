The states that responded to Mondayâ€™s survey went through six million tons of salt and large quantities of brine and liquid de-icing chemicals. A single-season snowfall record was broken in Boston, with virtually all the 110 inches coming in a six-week stretch to early March. Massachusetts used 600,000 tons of salt and 1.6 million gallons of liquid de-icer. Crews removed 17.5 billion cubic feet of snow from state roadways, equivalent to 40 times the volume of dirt excavated during the giant Boston highway project known as the Big Dig, state officials noted.
