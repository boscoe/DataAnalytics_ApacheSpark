Has NBC found an unlikely hit in a children’s talent and reality show called “Little Big Shots”?The second episode of “Little Big Shots” scored huge ratings, the biggest for an NBC show on a Sunday night in years.The show, which is hosted by Steve Harvey and has Ellen DeGeneres as a co-executive producer, feels as if it came out of nowhere. Unlike NBC’s fall reality show, Neil Patrick Harris’s “Best Time Ever,” which fizzled (and was canceled) after months of publicity, “Little Big Shots” has made an impact very quickly without nearly as much attention. A preview episode on Tuesday night had 12.7 million viewers.The list of superlatives for the show’s first two episodes is long:■ Sunday night’s show had 14.8 million viewers, and a 2.8 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic important to advertisers. It won the night by both measures among the broadcast networks.Advertisement■ As Vulture’s Joe Adalian pointed out, the total audience for “Little Big Shots,” from 8 to 9 p.m., nearly equaled Fox’s combined viewership for six shows last night.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If they stick around for future episodes, NBC will have discovered a sleeper hit in a year that has already been very good for the network: It’s No. 2 in total viewers for the season, and is within striking distance of the No. 1 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic that currently belongs to CBS, which had the very big benefit of broadcasting the Super Bowl.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
