AdvertisementSupported byBy Leslie PickerAmerican Homes 4 Rent agreed Thursday to combine with American Residential Properties in a $1.5 billion acquisition, among the biggest deals yet in a year ripe with single-family home-rental consolidation.The combined company will own more than 47,000 homes in the United States, just shy of the 50,000 homes that the Blackstone Group rents through its Invitation Homes, which is the largest owner of single-family rental homes in the country.The trend toward consolidation in the single-family home rental space began in earnest this year with Silver Bay Realty Trust buying 2,400 homes from a smaller firm, the American Home, which is not associated with American Homes 4 Rent.This summer, Cerberus Capital Management acquired about 4,200 homes from BLT Homes. More recently, Colony American Homes announced in September that it would merge with Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust. Colony American, organized by Colony Capital, is one of the nation’s largest operators of single-family home rentals, ranking right behind Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent.The industry is consolidating as bulk purchases of cheap homes in the wake of the housing and foreclosure crisis has ended with the rebound in home prices in many parts of the country. Single-family home-rental operators are finding they need greater geographic diversity and heft to generate decent returns from rental income. The rebound in home prices has also tempted some smaller firms to cash out and book the profits that were made from buying homes at cheap prices.Under the terms of the deal announced Thursday, each share of American Residential Properties will be exchanged for 1.135 shares of American Homes 4 Rent, representing a value of about $19.01 a share. That price is an 8.7 percent premium over American Residential Properties’ stock price on Wednesday.The publicly traded real estate investment trusts together would have a market valuation of about $5.5 billion.“American Residential Properties has a high quality portfolio of homes which fit strategically in our markets, offering significant opportunities to capture further operating efficiencies on the combined platform,” said David Singelyn, chief executive of American Homes 4 Rent in a statement Thursday.American Homes 4 Rent’s stock declined on Thursday, while American Residential Properties gained.Shares of single-family rental-home companies that have gone public have not performed well. American Homes 4 Rent currently trades at just 30 cents above the $16 price it sold shares at in its 2013 initial public offering. The lackluster stock performance of companies like American Homes 4 Rent is believed to be one reason Blackstone is taking its time before bringing Invitation Homes to the public markets.The trend toward renting, instead of buying, which became more prominent after the housing bust in 2008, is projected to continue. The Urban Institute said that renter households would increase to almost 48 million in 2020 from 40.7 million in 2010, according to a June report.American Homes 4 Rent will keep its corporate headquarters in Agoura Hills, Calif. American Residential Properties investors will hold about 12.6 percent of the outstanding shares in the combined company. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2016.The companies said they would be able to cut out duplicative costs, such as Internet charges, property-management employees and technology.Barclays and Raymond James provided financial advice to American Residential Properties. Hunton & Williams was the legal counsel for American Residential Properties, while Hogan Lovells served as legal counsel for American Homes 4 Rent.Advertisement
