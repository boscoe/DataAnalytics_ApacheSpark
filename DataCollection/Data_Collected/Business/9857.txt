Now, TeamHealth has finally agreed to be sold, but at a large discount to that offer, which was made Nov. 2, 2015.This time, TeamHealth agreed to be sold to funds associated with the Blackstone Group for about $6.1 billion, including debt, according to a  news release Monday.Under the terms of Monday’s agreement, Blackstone will acquire TeamHealth for $43.50 a share in cash, representing an equity value of about $3.2 billion.AdvertisementIt is a return trip for the private equity firm, which bought TeamHealth in 2005 and took it public four years later.Advertisement“We are thrilled to have the opportunity to invest in TeamHealth and once again partner with such an experienced management team and high-quality business,” said Neil P.
