WASHINGTON —  Wholesale businesses in the United States modestly increased their stockpiles in January as their sales plunged at the sharpest pace in six years.Stockpiles held by wholesale businesses rose 0.3 percent in January after no change in December and a 0.8 percent increase in November, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday. Sales dropped 3.1 percent in January, after a 0.9 percent December decline.The January decline was the largest setback since sales fell 3.6 percent in March 2009, when the country was mired in recession. January represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline.Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays Research, said that because of a larger-than-expected gain in January inventories, Barclays was revising its tracking estimate for overall growth in the January-March quarter up by 0.1 percentage point to 1.8 percent. But he said a downward revision to December inventories had trimmed the estimate for fourth-quarter growth by 0.1 percentage point to 2.1 percent.AdvertisementDespite the string of declines in sales, economists remain optimistic that sales will rebound in coming months as consumer spending gets a boost from falling gas prices and healthy job gains.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The number of people who quit their jobs increased 3 percent to 2.8 million, the most in more than six years.AdvertisementWhen more workers quit it is generally a sign of confidence in the economy, because people typically leave jobs when they have another lined up, often at higher pay, or are optimistic that they can find a new position.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
