At one point, it owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds, and it said it had already recouped about £16.9 billion through share sales.“Returning Lloyds to the private sector is in the interests of the bank, taxpayers and the country as a whole,” Philip Hammond, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a news release.An offering of part of the government’s stake in Lloyds was been a crucial part of a plan by George Osborne, Mr. Hammond’s predecessor, to exit the holding.The government delayed a sale to retail investors in January because of turmoil in the markets, the second delay since 2014.Then the government changed after Britain’s vote in June to exit the European Union, with Theresa May replacing David Cameron as prime minister and Mr. Osborne stepping down.Lloyds’ share price has fallen 26 percent since the referendum, and the stock is now trading below the 73.6 pence a share the British government paid for its holdings — a crucial floor for Mr. Osborne in his efforts to reduce the government’s stake.Shares of Lloyds were down more than 4 percent in afternoon trading in London on Friday.António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, said the bank welcomed the government’s decision to resume its trading plan and return the bank to nongovernment ownership.“This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last five years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper,” Mr. Horta-Osório said.On Friday, Mr. Hammond said that now was not the right time to proceed with a retail offering because of market volatility, but he thought the government would eventually be able to recoup the money it put into Lloyds.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @Chadbray.Advertisement
