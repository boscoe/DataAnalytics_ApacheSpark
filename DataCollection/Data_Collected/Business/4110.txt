WASHINGTON — The United States economy was growing at a moderate pace through mid-February despite severe winter storms that had disrupted activity in some regions, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.The Fed survey, known as the beige book, found that six of its 12 regions had reported moderate growth with modest gains seen in most other areas. The Boston district said businesses in its area remained upbeat despite a series of huge snowstorms.Consumer spending was up in most districts, travel and tourism was increasing and manufacturing had shown solid gains, with aerospace companies in the San Francisco region forecasting a record year.In other data released Wednesday, United States businesses added more than 200,000 jobs in February for the 13th straight month, a private survey found. It was the latest sign that strong hiring should boost the economy this year.AdvertisementThe payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday that companies added 212,000 jobs last month, a solid gain, though down from 250,000 in the previous month. January’s figure was revised up from 213,000.AdvertisementAnd the Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that its services index rose to 56.9 in February, up from January’s reading of 56.7. Any reading over 50 indicates expansion.The survey suggests further growth in employment and imports, as a strong hiring streak over the last year has bolstered consumer spending.”The bottom line is that the U.S. economy remains in good health,” said Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics.The information contained in the Fed report will be used when the central bank next meets on March 17 and 18. Economists expect the Fed will not start raising interest rates until at least June.

The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 5.6 percent from 5.7 percent.February’s hiring was the slowest in nine months, according to the ADP data. Most economists have expected a slight slowdown, however, after a run of huge job gains. Employers added 423,000 jobs in November, and more than one million from November through January, the fastest three-month pace since 1997. More than three million people have been hired in the last 12 months.“Job growth is strong, but slowing from the torrid pace of recent months,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. ”Job gains remain broad-based, although the collapse in oil prices has begun to weigh on energy-related employment.” Moody’s Analytics helps compile the report.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
