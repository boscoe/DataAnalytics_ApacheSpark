The deal would value SABMiller’s stake at about $1.6 billion.Since their deal was announced last year, the two brewers have worked to win over regulators.The transaction would give the Chinese business full ownership of a beer brand that outsells better-known lines like Bud Light.“This agreement is subject to any applicable regulatory approval in China, and AB InBev and CRB will work closely together through any such process,” Anheuser Busch InBev said in a news release.The sale of SABMiller’s stake in the joint venture in China had been anticipated by analysts since the Anheuser-Busch InBev deal was announced, and is one of several transactions being undertaken in order to appease regulators.The combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller would create a beer industry giant that would have annual revenue of about $64 billion and that would account for about 30 percent of global beer sales.In November, SABMiller agreed to sell its 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to its joint venture partner Molson Coors Brewing for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch InBev.In February, Asahi Group Holdings of Japan agreed to a binding offer to buy the beer brands Peroni and Grolsch, as well as certain European operations of SABMiller, for 2.55 billion euros, or about $2.8 billion.The Molson Coors, Asahi and Snow transactions are all contingent on the SABMiller-Anheuser Busch InBev merger closing.The Snow transaction has been approved by the board of China Resources Beer, as well as by its majority shareholder. After the deal’s closing, CR Snow will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of China Resources Beer.Anheuser-Busch InBev was advised by Lazard and Merrill Lynch and the law firms Sullivan & Cromwell, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Fangda.Advertisement
