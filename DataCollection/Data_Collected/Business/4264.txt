Clark, chief executive of Blue Coat, said the deal with Bain Capital would help to set the company “on the trajectory to further grow our portfolio, better serve our customers and help us prepare to return to the public markets.”AdvertisementThe deal has not been finalized but both parties have entered a definitive agreement.Goldman Sachs advised Blue Coat, while the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is acting as legal adviser.
