The widow, Lorraine Markham, said her husband, Bill Markham, had been denied his legacy after the other inventor, Reuben Klamer, took full credit for it. Ms. Markham is seeking a declaration from the United States District Court in Providence that her husband was the sole creator of the game and that the company he left her owns the game outright. The lawsuit, filed last month, also seeks a complete accounting from Hasbro on what is owed. Mr. Klamer countersued on Thursday, saying he is the sole creator and Mr. Markham’s widow has no right to any royalties. A spokeswoman for Hasbro did not return emails seeking comment. Ms. Markham’s lawsuit said that her husband had invented the game in 1959, and that Mr. Klamer offered to market it. Mr. Klamer’s countersuit said he had developed the game and hired Mr. Markham to make the board. He said the game was revised repeatedly and Mr. Markham was not involved in that work. Advertisement
