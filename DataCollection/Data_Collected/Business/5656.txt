It was the poorest showing in a year, and down from 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter.Stocks stayed lower after the Federal Reserve downgraded its assessment of the economy and appeared no closer to raising its benchmark interest rate from close to zero.The stock market, trading close to nominal highs, is struggling to maintain momentum at the start of the seventh year of a bull market. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has gained only 2.3 percent in the first four months of the year and is fluctuating between small gains and losses. “We’re in a period of indecisiveness, where things could stay muddled for a while,” said Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial, a wealth management firm. The S.&P. 500 fell 7.91 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,106.85. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 74.61 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,035.53. The Nasdaq declined 31.78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 5,023.64.In addition to news from the Fed and on the economy, investors were also looking at the latest corporate earnings.Starwood Hotels and Resorts surged after the company’s board said it would explore a “full range” of strategic and financial options for the company. Starwood also reported earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations. The stock climbed $6.73, or 8.3 percent, to $87.53.Buffalo Wild Wings slumped $23.45, or 12.8 percent, to $160.25 after the company reported disappointing first-quarter results. The company said its net income and revenue grew, but the price of chicken wings surged, and Buffalo Wild Wings’ costs were also elevated by the chain’s expansion.Over all, company earnings are coming in better than had been expected.Just over half of the companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported their first-quarter numbers, and analysts are forecasting that average earnings will grow by just 0.2 percent, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. While that is a sharp slowdown from a 7.8 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year, it is much better than the decline of 3.1 percent that analysts had expected.The slowdown is being driven by a big drop in earnings at energy companies, caused by a steep fall in the price of oil, as well as a stronger dollar, which is eating away at the value of overseas sales for global companies based in the United States. Most investors remain confident that many of the factors weighing on the economy are transitory, and that growth will accelerate in the second quarter, said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock. If that doesn’t play out, however, trading could become more unsettled. “The narrative is that the economy rebounds in the second quarter, and earnings rebound with it,” Mr. Koesterich said. “If it wasn’t all about the weather or temporary factors,” he added, “then that is where you might get some more volatility this summer.”In other corporate news, shares of Salesforce.com surged as investors reacted to a report that the company had been approached by an unidentified suitor. A Bloomberg story, citing unnamed people, stirred speculation that Salesforce, a business software company, might be sold to a rival, Oracle, in a deal that could be worth $50 billion. Salesforce jumped $7.76, or 11.6 percent, to $74.65.In currency trading, the euro climbed to $1.1111 from $1.0974, after the weaker-than-forecast report on the United States economy.
