In July, Carlyle reported an 81 percent drop in distributable earnings — a measure of cash generated by a private equity firm and eligible to be given to investors — in its global market strategies business, in part because of $700 million in redemptions, most of it from the Claren Road fund.Albert Marino, chief operating officer at the New York-based Claren Road, declined to comment. Christopher W. Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, declined to comment.The hedge fund’s two funds — Credit Master and Credit Opportunities Master — have been buffeted by investments in energy, financials and Greece, a person with knowledge of the firm’s performance said.While the funds have performed relatively well so far this month — Credit Master is up 1.7 percent and Credit Opportunities is up 1.85 percent — they are both in negative territory for the year. Credit Master has lost 5.6 percent so far this year, while Credit Opportunities slid 6.2 percent.At its peak, the firm had more than $8 billion in assets under management.Advertisement
