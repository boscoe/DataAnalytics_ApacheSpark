It is the third complaint filed in response to the November 2014 article: Three individual fraternity members, who are now graduates, are suing for at least $225,000 each, and a university associate dean who claimed she was portrayed as the “chief villain” is suing the magazine for more than $7.5 million. A Rolling Stone spokeswoman, Kathryn Brenner, said the magazine had no comment. Rolling Stone has since retracted the article, and the magazine’s managing editor and Ms. Erdely both apologized.
