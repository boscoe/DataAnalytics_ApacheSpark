Packaged salads produced at a Dole facility in Ohio are linked to one death in Michigan, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday. The agency said 12 people in six states had been hospitalized in the outbreak since July after eating salads sold under the names Dole, Fresh Selections, Simple Truth, Marketside, the Little Salad Bar and President’s Choice. The C.D.C. said it linked the outbreak to the Dole salads this month after Ohio agriculture officials found listeria in a bag bought at a retail location. The strain of listeria was “highly related genetically” to the listeria that had made people sick. Dole has stopped all production at the Springfield, Ohio, plant and is withdrawing packaged salads on the market that were produced there. Consumers can identify the salads by the letter “A” at the beginning of the manufacturing code on the packages.A version of this brief appears in print on January 23, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Dole Salads Packaged in Ohio Linked to Listeria Death.
