A federal judge approved a $415 million settlement that ended a lengthy legal dispute stemming from claims that Apple, Google and several other Silicon Valley companies had illegally conspired to prevent their workers from getting better job offers. The settlement of a class-action lawsuit will pay more than 64,000 technology workers about $5,800 each. The complaint, filed in 2011, originally sought $3 billion in damages, which could have been tripled under American antitrust law. Judge Lucy Koh of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, who approved the settlement, said only 67 of the 64,666 workers represented in the case objected to or opted out of the settlement.A version of this brief appears in print on September 4, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Workers Awarded $5,800 Each in Settlement With Tech Giants.
