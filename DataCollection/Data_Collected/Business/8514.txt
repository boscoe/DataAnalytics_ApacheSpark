The company did not specify how long it would take for the unit to return to full production.Leaky pipes at the refinery caused wholesale gasoline prices to rise by up to 80 cents a gallon around the Great Lakes states. Michigan and Illinois drivers saw jumps of 15 to 25 cents a gallon from one day to the next, causing concern and frustration among motorists.GasBuddy.com predicts that drivers around the region should pay 20 to 50 cents less per gallon over the next few weeks as the refinery unit increases production.The national average price for a gallon of regular gas was $2.58 on Tuesday, eight cents lower than a week ago and 86 cents lower than a year ago, according to the AAA motor club.That price is the lowest for this time of year since 2004, but the numbers would have been far better had they not been skewed by the refinery breakdown and other failures and renovations at refineries in California and in the Midwest.The resumption at the Whiting refinery is particularly good news for Canadian producers because it is one of the primary processors of Canadian heavy crude in the United States. Rising inventories north of the border were forcing the price of Canadian crude to levels so low that much of the production in western Canada was no longer profitable.Advertisement
