From Feb. 9 until Aug. 9, an average of 8.2 million total viewers watched NBC’s evening news broadcast, according to Nielsen data. During the same period last year, “Nightly News” attracted an average of 8.6 million total viewers.In a news release, NBC said that its “Nightly News” broadcast had defeated its rival networks among total viewers for seven consecutive weeks, 12 of the last 15 weeks and 300 of the last 307 weeks.In February, NBC announced that it was removing Mr. Williams from the anchor chair after he fabricated his role in a helicopter attack in Iraq. Mr. Holt stepped in as anchor of the news broadcast on a temporary basis until June, when he became the permanent anchor of NBC “Nightly News.”Mr. Williams is expected to return to work, at the cable news network MSNBC, in mid-September as an anchor of breaking news and special reports. The network has not yet set a firm date for his return.Mr. Williams was an MSNBC anchor from 1996 to 2004, and his return coincides with a broader programming overhaul at the ratings-challenged network, which is shifting from its left-leaning opinion-based coverage to more hard news during the day.Year-to-date, MSNBC has averaged 328,000 total day viewers, down 7.6 percent from the same period last year, according to Nielsen data.Advertisement
