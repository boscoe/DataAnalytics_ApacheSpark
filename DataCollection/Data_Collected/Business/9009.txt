Construction activity slowed sharply last month in the Northeast and Midwest, edged downward in the West and climbed in the South.Still, homebuilding seems much stronger than a year ago, despite monthly figures that can be highly volatile. Construction slowed in part because of the expiration of tax incentives for developers in New York.“This is a mere blip on the radar,” said Tom Wind, executive vice president of home lending at EverBank. “The housing market’s underlying fundamentals remain on pace for continued recovery.”Housing starts have climbed a solid 11.3 percent this year to date. Steady job gains of 2.9 million in the last 12 months are contributing to increased demand from buyers and renters. And as the recovery from the recession has entered its seventh year, residential construction has reflected and fueled broader economic growth.Developers see favorable demographics helping to sustain demand: Approved permits rose 3.5 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.17 million.New construction has yet to fully satisfy demand, a sign that further building will most likely remain profitable.Only a 5.2-month supply of new homes is listed for sale, well below the standard level of six months usually documented in a healthy market. This shortage has led to rising prices for new and existing homes.At the same time, median rental prices are rising annually at 4.2 percent — roughly double the increase in average hourly wages — as baby boomers downsize and millennials enter the job market.Advertisement
