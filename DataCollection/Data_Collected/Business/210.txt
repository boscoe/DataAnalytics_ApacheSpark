Aldrich, the chairman and chief executive of Skyworks, said in a news release that he hoped to make the most of PMC-Sierra’s data storage and transportation capabilities. “Specifically, we plan to leverage PMC’s innovative storage systems, flash controllers, optical switches and network infrastructure solutions,” he said.Gregory S. Lang, the president and chief executive of PMC-Sierra, said in the same release, “Given Skyworks’ deep global sales channels and leadership applications support, underpinned by a world class supply chain, we could not have found a better partner.”The semiconductor industry has undergone a wave of consolidation in recent years as chip makers have expanded to keep pace with demand from customers like Apple and used mergers to cut costs by combining work forces. Mr. Aldrich said he expected savings of $75 million from merging the companies, as well as an additional $0.75 in earnings per share each year.Before the agreement between Skyworks and PMC-Sierra, deals in the semiconductor industry had already reached $98.5 billion this year, compared with $28.3 billion for the same period in 2014, according to data from Dealogic.Intel, the world’s largest maker of chips, said in June that it would pay $16.7 billion for the chip company Altera. The chip maker Avago Technologies agreed to buy Broadcom, whose chips are used in iPhones and other consumer devices, for $37 billion in May. In March, NXP Semiconductors paid $11.8 billion for Freescale Semiconductor, which began life as part of Motorola and specializes in chips for sensors and cars.The deal to buy PMC-Sierra is expected to close in the first half of 2016.Advertisement
