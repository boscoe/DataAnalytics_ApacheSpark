WASHINGTON —  The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week for a third straight week, but the underlying trend continued to point to solid improvement in the labor market.Although the economy is recovering from a soft patch at the start of the year, other data on Thursday showing weak new-home sales and manufacturing activity suggested that the rebound could lack the vigor shown after last year’s weather-induced slump in the first quarter.Growth braked sharply early this year as the economy was slammed by harsh winter weather, weak global demand and a labor dispute at West Coast ports, which has been resolved. Activity also was constrained by a strong dollar as well as lower energy prices, which have hurt profits for some companies.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 295,000 for the week that ended April 18, the Labor Department said.AdvertisementDespite the increase, claims remained for a seventh consecutive week below the 300,000 threshold, a level associated with a strengthening labor market.

But with the weakness mostly concentrated in the weather-sensitive leisure and construction sectors, economists played down the slowdown.“The trend in claims,” said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at BNP Paribas in New York, “continues to impress and runs counter to the disappointment we saw in the March payrolls report, suggesting it may be too early to draw conclusions about the strength of the labor market from that one report.”A version of this article appears in print on April 24, 2015, on Page B4 of the New York edition with the headline: Weekly Jobless Claims Rise, but Labor Market Still Shows Strength.
