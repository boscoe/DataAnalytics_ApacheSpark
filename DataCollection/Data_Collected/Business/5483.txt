The combined company would have operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.Pioneer’s operations in the United States would be jointly owned by Unicredit and the private equity firms, with Santander having no ownership role in that business.Pioneer has been part of Milan-based UniCredit since 2000.The transaction will be subject to regulatory approval and signing a definitive agreement between the companies, Santander said.Juan Alcaraz, the chief executive of Santander Asset Management, will serve as global chief executive of the combined company. Giordano Lombardo, the Pioneer chief executive and chief investment officer, will serve as global chief investment officer.Advertisement
