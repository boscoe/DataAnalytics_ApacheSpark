HONG KONG — A group of bondholders for the Kaisa Group, a struggling Chinese property developer, have rejected a proposal by the company to restructure $2.5 billion of debt, potentially scuttling a takeover deal by a larger developer, Sunac China Holdings.The group, which owns more than 50 percent of Kaisa’s bonds, considered the company’s plan “very unfair,” its lawyer said on Friday. Sunac has said that its takeover proposal is conditional on Kaisa’s resolving its debt problems.”The ball is in the company’s court to come back with a sensible counteroffer,” the lawyer, Neil McDonald, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Hong Kong, said in an interview. “We haven’t given them a deadline.”Kaisa is negotiating with its bondholders to avoid becoming the first Chinese developer to default on its offshore debt. The company, mired in crisis since local authorities blocked sales of some projects last year, had proposed that the maturity on six sets of bonds due each year through 2020 be extended by five years and that the interest rates be slashed.AdvertisementRepresentatives of Kaisa and Sunac were not immediately available for comment.Kaisa’s debt problems underscore the slump in China’s property sector, which has been hit by the slowing economy and a series of cooling measures instituted by Beijing to avoid a bubble in what had been an overheated housing market. Government data released this week showed that average new-home prices fell in February at the fastest pace on record.
                Excited by China’s property boom, wealthy investors poured money into the distressed property developer, Kaisa. Those who jumped in later have suffered.            Under Kaisa’s current restructuring proposal, about $800 million of bonds originally due in 2018 would instead come due in 2023, and the interest would be cut to 5.2 percent from 8.875 percent.AdvertisementLast week, creditors pushed for better terms from Kaisa, like a guarantee for their bonds from Sunac. Kaisa had hoped to strike a deal by Friday, well before Sunac’s July 31 deadline for any deal.Mr. McDonald said there were other potential suitors if Sunac pulled out. He declined to give details but said the bondholders did not think Kaisa would opt for liquidation.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Kaisa’s debt more than doubled to 65 billion renminbi between June and the end of 2014.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
