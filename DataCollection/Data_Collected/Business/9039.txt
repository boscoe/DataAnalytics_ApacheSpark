Lots of buzz concerning the impact of higher interest rates in the United States. A major trading partner creating shock waves in the global economy. Stock market volatility spreading around the world.Sound familiar? It certainly does to Federal Reserve policy makers, who hesitated this week about lifting their key interest rate lever from close to zero because of worries about the ripple effects of a shaky Chinese economy and uneasy global financial markets. What they remember is a situation that played out more than 20 years ago, in 1994 and early 1995.The country in question then was Mexico, as rising rates in the United States put pressure on an emerging market economy already suffering from a weakening currency and too much debt.Ultimately, Mexico had to be bailed out by the United States and the International Monetary Fund. And something like the so-called Tequila Crisis and other episodes of global economic turmoil in the 1990s are exactly what officials hope to avoid — or at least lessen — as they prepare for when the Fed finally raises rates.“There is no doubt that policy makers in emerging markets have been trembling in their boots at the prospect of a Fed rate hike,” said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor at Harvard and former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.AdvertisementIn fact, Fed policy makers mainly cited global economic conditions — not domestic ones — when they decided not to raise rates at their meeting on Thursday.AdvertisementThat was the right call, said Lawrence H. Summers, who served as Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and more recently was director of the National Economic Council in President Obama’s first term.“People often underestimate the risks, especially when you have a lot of volatility, and things can go wrong that you can’t foresee,” he said. “Given what’s happening in China, Brazil and other emerging markets, there’s still reason for being cautious if there are no signs of substantial inflationary pressures anywhere.”Much of Wall Street is now looking for the Fed to finally tighten monetary policy at its last meeting of the year in December.But if international conditions then are anything like they are now, and inflation still doesn’t pose much of a threat, Mr. Summers said, “it will be just as significant an error to move in December as it would have been to move in September.”To some observers, the delay by the Fed will help give emerging markets more time to prepare and also recover from China-induced volatility. But Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed board member from 2006 to 2008, said it could actually complicate the situation.“This exacerbates the risks and makes the communication even more difficult going forward,” said Mr. Mishkin, now a professor at Columbia Business School. “When will global conditions be strong enough to raise rates? This will create even more confusion.”Elsewhere in the world, it is no so much the initial increase itself, which is expected to be limited to a modest quarter of a percentage point, that worries experts as the prospect of further aftershocks as the Fed shifts from an easy money stance to a gradually tightening posture.AdvertisementMr. Rogoff, who wrote the 2009 book “This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly” (Princeton University Press), with Carmen Reinhart, said it was “remarkable how focused the world is on the Fed, and there’s no question emerging markets are very vulnerable right now.”
                Officials said the economy was strong enough to keep growing with a little less help from the central bank. They said rates would rise slowly, but borrowing costs already have started to climb.            These strains are evident in measures like the spread between what emerging market countries have to pay to borrow vs. what it costs the United States, as well as the rapid depreciation of some emerging market currencies.At the beginning of the year, yields on Brazilian debt were about 2 percentage points more than American bonds. That spread has since doubled, to nearly four full percentage points. Over the same period, the value of Brazil’s real has fallen by nearly a third against the dollar.That doesn’t necessarily mean that Brazil and other emerging markets are heading for disaster. Many potentially vulnerable economies are better prepared this time around than they were two decades ago, officials say.A senior Treasury Department official, for example, said on Friday that many developing nations had taken steps over the last few years to prepare for the inevitable moment when the Fed starts to raise rates. The official, made available by Treasury on condition of anonymity, said that at the recent G-20 meetings, there was more concern about the impact of China’s struggles than about actions in the United States.Mexico and Brazil, like most countries, have forgone attempting to fix their exchange rates in favor of more flexible arrangements that prevent them from having to deplete their hard currency reserves in a futile effort to preserve the dollar peg.
                More than seven years ago the Federal Reserve put its benchmark interest rate close to zero, as a way to bolster the economy. But that policy is about to change, perhaps this week.            Still, while exchange rates may be less of a worry, there is an additional factor putting pressure on emerging market economies these days: crashing commodity prices.Because commodities are their main export, Brazil, Indonesia and Russia, along with the big oil producers of the Middle East, are feeling the pain from lower prices for crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials.Advertisement“If you did a regression analysis of emerging market debt crises, the two key variables are commodity prices and global interest rates,” Mr. Rogoff said.But other analysts warn that such concerns are overblown and that further delays by the Fed in starting to “normalize” interest rates carry their own risks as well.That’s been plenty of advance notice, they say, that should have given emerging markets time to prepare for the new environment. That’s the view, for example, of Glenn Hubbard, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and is now dean of Columbia’s business school.“It’s been so well telegraphed,” Mr. Hubbard said. Whether the increase happens in October, December or next March, “it will be gradual and it’s already been priced in,” he said.Using the classic metaphor to describe the Fed’s role in preventing an economy from getting too exuberant, Mr. Hubbard said, “People will realize the punch bowl is being taken away, but it’s not like they are running out of the room with it. They can still get drinks as it’s being taken away.”When Fed policy makers do eventually decide to move, they should emphasize that it is not the beginning of a relentless new tightening phase, said Robert E. Rubin, President Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary from 1995-99.At the time of the initial rate increase, he said, Fed officials should make clear that future increases will only come if the data suggests the economy continues to strengthen and that higher interest rates and a tighter monetary policy are required to head off the clear risk of inflation.“You need to defuse inferences about monetary conditions in the future,” said Mr. Rubin, whose first major challenge after being sworn in was tackling the Tequila Crisis. “If they did that, I think it might actually reduce uncertainty and might not have the consequences that people worry about it in terms of a rate hike.”Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting from Washington.A version of this article appears in print on September 19, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Watching the Fed on Rates, and Remembering the Tequila Crisis.
