The results will be released in the third quarter of 2016.The tests will examine the financial strength of 53 of Europe’s largest banks, including 39 that are supervised by the European Central Bank, and will cover roughly 70 percent of the region’s banking sector, the regulator said.“The objective of the E.U.-wide stress test is to provide supervisors, banks and other market participants with a common analytical framework to consistently compare and assess the resilience of the E.U. banking system to shocks,” the European Banking Authority said in a news release on Thursday.In March, the regulator said it would not conduct a stress test this year but would instead conduct an exercise intended to provide detailed data on banks’ balance sheets and loan portfolios.The tests next year will be based on numbers from the full 2015 year and will examine their resilience against macroeconomic conditions and an adverse situation, such as a future financial crisis. The regulator will also examine foreign exchange lending and so-called conduct risk, or the potential impact of misconduct by a bank employee on the institution’s solvency.The European Central Bank said it would conduct its own stress tests of institutions that it regulates but that are not subject to the European Banking Authority’s examination. The central bank said that its examinations would be consistent with the methodology of the banking authority, but that it would “also give due consideration to the lower size and complexity of these institutions.”The regulator’s most recent stress tests were conducted in 2014. Those tests identified 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and would need additional buffers to be prepared for an economic downturn.The tests were conducted at the same time as a separate review by the European Central Bank, known as an asset-quality review, that focused on 130 big banks in the eurozone.The European Banking Authority’s tests included banks in Britain, Sweden and other European Union countries that are not part of the eurozone.Advertisement
