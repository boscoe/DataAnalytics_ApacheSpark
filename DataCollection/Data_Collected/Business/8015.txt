SHANGHAI — Stock prices in China fell modestly on Friday, but ended July with their worst monthly decline in six years, despite repeated government efforts to stabilize the market and prop up prices.Share prices were volatile for much of the past week, with wild intraday swings, as investors weighed the direction of a government intervention plan and the authorities vowed to root out short-sellers, or traders who bet a stock will fall, and to crack down on stock manipulation.The Shanghai composite index plunged 10 percent during the week, closing at 3,663.725. The Shenzhen composite dropped 9.1 percent, hitting 2,110.622. For the month, the main Shanghai and Shenzhen indexes were each down 14.3 percent.The sell-off and price swings have further unnerved a market that sprinted up early in the year, with prices peaking around mid-June. But shares plummeted sharply in late June and early July over concerns about a bubble and investors’ borrowing heavily to buy shares.AdvertisementAfter prices began to plunge, the Chinese government announced a raft of measures aimed at stabilizing prices and restoring confidence in the market. Those efforts seemed to work — for a while.
                The Chinese stock market rout has prompted the country’s government to act aggressively to stop the slide.            In a matter of days, there was a government-financed effort to buy up shares; a suspension of initial public offerings; and rules preventing major shareholders from selling their shares. Regulators also vowed to investigate “malicious” short-sellers and any other forces that might be driving prices down.AdvertisementThe efforts, though widely criticized by some analysts as overly aggressive interference in the market, seemed to shore up share prices, at least until last Monday. That is when a broad range of stocks fell again, sending the Shanghai composite down 8.5 percent on the day, its biggest daily drop since 2007.Almost immediately, regulators reaffirmed their commitment to stabilizing prices and said they were investigating what they called an “abnormal” stock dip. On Friday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said it was investigating automated trading and had suspended 24 stock trading accounts for “suspected irregularities.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In Hong Kong, which is under separate governance, share prices have slipped, but not as sharply. The Hang Seng index is down 13.4 percent from its peak this year in late April.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
