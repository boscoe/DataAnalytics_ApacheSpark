LONDON —  HSBC said on Monday that its second-quarter profit fell 4 percent from a year earlier as the bank overhauled its operations in an effort to cut up to $5 billion in annual costs by the end of 2017.The lender, which is based in Britain but generates more than half of its earnings in Asia, announced in June that it would shed 50,000 jobs, sell several underperforming businesses and shrink its global investment banking business.HSBC also said that it would sell its Brazilian business to Banco Bradesco for $5.2 billion.The bank said that about half of the capital it planned to redeploy after the sale or exit of businesses and other actions would go to Asia, while the rest would be spread across Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and North America.“We have commenced our work to reduce costs and expect to be able to demonstrate tangible progress in the coming quarters,” Stuart T. Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, said in a news release.AdvertisementThe bank continues to be bruised by legal and regulatory matters, and it said on Monday it had set aside an additional $1.14 billion in the second quarter for provisions, including for potential settlements of inquiries related to rigging of the foreign exchange markets.AdvertisementDouglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, said that the company’s board was “tightly focused” on delivering a return on equity of more than 10 percent by the end of 2017.“Initial progress is encouraging,” Mr. Flint said in a news release, “with the highlight clearly being the agreement reached for the sale of our Brazilian operations.”HSBC has had operations in Brazil since 1997, but the downturn in that country’s economy and rising loan defaults contributed to a $247 million loss for the bank in Brazil last year.“HSBC has been having problems with consumer debt,” said Andre Riva Gargiulo, a banking sector analyst for GBM, a brokerage firm, in São Paulo. They’ve had high default rates.”Mr. Gargiulo also said that scale was crucial in Brazil’s retail banking sector, where HSBC has been trying to compete. HSBC’s local operations were the country’s sixth-largest, as measured by assets, but it was less than a third the size of the fifth-largest, Santander’s Brazil unit.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
