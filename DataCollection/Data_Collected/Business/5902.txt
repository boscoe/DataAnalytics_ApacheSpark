Walmart, which has  395 stores in Canada, says it will buy 13 former Target stores and one distribution center in the country and hire 3,400 new employees. Walmart said it would spend $290 million to buy and renovate the stores, creating 1,500 construction jobs. Target closed the last of its 133 Canadian stores in April, laying off more than 17,000 people. A number of retailers have struggled in Canada because of regulatory pressures and competition from Walmart and others. Big Lots and Best Buy have both closed stores in Canada, and Sears sold most of its stake in its Canadian unit.An Associated Press report in the Business Briefing column on May 8 about Walmart’s purchase of 14 former Target stores in Canada erroneously attributed a distinction to the company. The largest retailer in Canada is George Weston Ltd., not Walmart. (George Weston operates such chains as Loblaw Cos. and Shoppers Drug Mart.) This correction was delayed for research by The A.P.A version of this brief appears in print on May 9, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Walmart to Buy 13 Former Target Stores In Canada.
