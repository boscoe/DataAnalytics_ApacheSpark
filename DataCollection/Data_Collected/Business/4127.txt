Goldman Sachs is moving a top executive, David Z. Solomon, from a post working with the bank’s hedge fund clients to a new position that entails working on one of Goldman’s in-house hedge funds.The bank announced the move internally on Wednesday morning. Mr. Solomon previously worked in the Goldman’s prime brokerage unit, helping hedge funds connect with large potential investors.Mr. Solomon will now work with Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, a hedge fund that was started by the firm’s traders in 2007, according to Bloomberg, which first reported Mr. Solomon’s move on Wednesday. Goldman says the fund “seeks asymmetric risk-reward opportunities to achieve equity like returns.”Goldman puts its own money into Goldman Sachs Investment Partners but is being forced to cut back its stakes in internal hedge funds by the Volcker Rule, which limits the investments banks can make with their own money.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
