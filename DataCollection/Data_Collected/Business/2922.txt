LONDON — With the dollar having recently hit an 11-year high against the euro, technology start-ups are positioning themselves to take advantage of continuing volatility in many of the world’s currency markets.That includes the London-based TransferWise, which announced on Sunday that it had raised $58 million in new round of fund-raising by a consortium of investors led by the Silicon Valley firm Andreessen Horowitz.TransferWise, one of a cluster of financial service start-ups based in London, uses peer-to-peer technology that allows individuals around the world to swap currencies without incurring bank transfer fees. London has attracted a growing number of start-ups that are offering financial services, including traditional lending and wealth management, that were once the sole domain of traditional banks. These British companies form part of a growing global trend of technology start-ups trying to gain market share from existing lenders, many of which have been hobbled during the financial crisis. That includes Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lender in the United States, whose recent initial public offering valued the company at roughly $8 billion. TransferWise, which was started by two Estonian friends in 2011 and whose backers also include Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures and Richard Branson, said it would use the new money to start offering its foreign currency services next month in United States, where it has partnered with an undisclosed financial institution, according to a company spokeswoman. The company added that its customers, primarily based in the European Union, had transferred roughly $4.5 billion through its platform during the last four years. The company said in a statement that TransferWise’s peer-to-peer technology, which allows customers to access rates that are typically more competitive than traditional banks, had saved users about $200 million in banking fees usually incurred when moving money abroad.“For too long, legacy providers’ dominance of the market has allowed consumers to be hoodwinked into paying huge hidden charges for services as basic as currency exchange,” said Taavet Hinrikus, a co-founder of TransferWise, who previously worked at Skype.A version of this article appears in print on 01/26/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: British Firm TransferWise Attracts $58 Million.
