Citigroup’s profit and revenue plunged in the first quarter, as the bank became the latest large financial institution to report lackluster results.The company said on Friday that its profit fell 27 percent, to $3.5 billion, or $1.10 a share, from the quarter a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of $1.03 a share.The bank’s revenue also cratered, falling about 11 percent from the same period a year ago to $17.6 billion.Citigroup, like other big banks that reported their results this week, was hammered by troubles in its oil and gas loan portfolio and difficult trading markets in the first quarter.AdvertisementBut unlike other large banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup has a smaller consumer banking business in the United States, a sector that is proving to be one of the few true bright spots of the year in finance.
                It is shaping up to be another grim year for the nation’s biggest banks. They were hit hard by a bad environment for trading and deal-making.            Citigroup has been trying to cash in on the strong American consumer health by revamping its credit card business. The bank’s investments in marketing the new credit card offerings, which may pay off in the future, have increased short-term expenses.The bank increased its reserves mostly to cushion against loan losses from oil and gas companies that are struggling in a bitter downturn in prices. That drove up the bank’s cost of credit by 7 percent, to about $2 billion.AdvertisementRevenue from stock trading fell 19 percent, while fixed income trading fell 11 percent.“While our market-sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we continued to make progress in several key areas,” the chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, said in a statement. “We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
