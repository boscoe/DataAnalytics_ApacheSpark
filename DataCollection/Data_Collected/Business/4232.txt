Alcoa, the big metal manufacturer best known for aluminum, is expanding its reach into the aerospace business.On Monday, Alcoa said that it would buy  RTI International Metals, a titanium producer that caters to the military, aerospace, energy and medical markets.“Alcoa is accelerating its value-add growth engine by acquiring titanium leader RTI,” Alcoa’s chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said in a statement. “We are combining two innovators in materials science and process technology, shifting Alcoa’s transformation into a higher gear.”In particular, Mr. Kleinfeld said, RTI gives Alcoa more exposure to the fast-growing aerospace market.AdvertisementAlcoa will pay 2.8315 of its shares for each RTI share, representing a purchase price of about $41 a share based on RTI’s closing price on Friday. Including the assumption of $517 million in convertible debt and $330 million of RTI’s cash on hand, the deal has an enterprise value of about $1.5 billion.AdvertisementAlcoa said that it expected cost savings of about $100 million in 2019 as a result of the deal, and that RTI would be generating $1.2 billion in revenue by then. RTI had about $794 million in sales last year, about 80 percent of which were to aerospace and military clients.“Innovation and scale are critical to winning in both the titanium and aerospace industries today, which is why this transaction is such a natural strategic fit for both RTI and Alcoa,” Dawne Hickton, RTI’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are pleased to have an agreement with Alcoa that delivers immediate value to our shareholders that appropriately reflects the strength of our business.”Greenhill and Morgan Stanley advised Alcoa, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal advice. Barclays advised RTI, and Jones Day provided legal advice.A version of this article appears in print on March 10, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Alcoa in Deal for Supplier to Aerospace Operations.
