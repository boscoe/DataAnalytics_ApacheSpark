AdvertisementSupported byBy Jessica Silver-GreenbergSantander Consumer USA reached a $9.35 million settlement with the Justice Department on Wednesday over accusations that the company, an auto lender, illegally seized cars from members of the military.The deal, which still requires the approval of a federal judge, involves the largest sum ever collected by the United States for the illegal repossession of cars, and is another setback for the giant auto lender.Under federal law, lenders like Santander Consumer USA, of Dallas, must get a court order before repossessing vehicles owned by active-duty service members.The law, called the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, recognizes that military members have to upend their lives, often at a moment’s notice, sometimes leaving their finances in peril. By requiring lenders to first obtain a court order, the law provides service members with a chance to delay or contest repossessions.But Santander Consumer, prosecutors said, failed to get those court orders, leaving service members, including some who were deployed thousands of miles away, to fight at home and abroad. Prosecutors said that the lender’s repossessions stretched over roughly five years, from January 2008 until February 2013. Santander, prosecutors said, completed 760 repossessions against service members protected under the relief act.The case, filed in Federal District Court in Dallas, also accused Santander of going after an additional 352 service members for fees that stemmed from illegal repossessions started by other lenders.John R. Parker, the acting United States attorney for the Northern District of Texas, said on Wednesday that the settlement would help “prevent such improper repossessions in the future.”The case traces to a complaint lodged with the Army Legal Assistance Program. Army Specialist Joshua Davis told lawyers that Santander illegally repossessed his car in the middle of the night while he was at basic training.“This is a just resolution that will provide service members with financial relief and help repair their bad credit caused by Santander’s improper repossessions and fee collections with respect to more than 1,100 cars,” said Stuart Delery, the Justice Department’s acting associate attorney general.Laurie Kight, a spokeswoman for Santander Consumer, which cooperated with the Justice Department, said the company strengthened its controls in 2012 to prevent improper repossessions. She noted that the majority of problematic repossessions occurred before 2012 and that “approximately one-third were accounts from other financial institutions” that were later converted to Santander loans.The settlement comes during a boom in the business of making car loans to the working poor — often people with tarnished credit who depend on their vehicles to get to and from their jobs. A surge of money from investors, hungry for higher yields in a time of persistently low interest rates, is fueling the market. But state and federal regulators are starting to question whether the red-hot market is fostering lax credit standards and, more troublingly, a growth in loans that contain falsified income or employment information.The Justice Department in Washington is spearheading an investigation, separate from the settlement on Wednesday, into whether such faulty loans are packaged and sold to investors in securitization deals, according to people briefed on the inquiries.This summer, after The New York Times reported on potential abuses in subprime auto lending, the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, sent subpoenas to Santander Consumer and G.M. Financial. The inquiry is part of a broader push, modeled on the federal investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities. The United States attorney in Detroit subpoenaed Ally Financial in December.As part of the latest settlement, Santander agreed to help repair the credit of the affected service members. The settlement also requires Santander to review its records to find any unlawful repossessions that may have occurred after February 2013.Advertisement
