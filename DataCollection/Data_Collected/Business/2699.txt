LONDON – The founder of Weavering Capital was convicted on Monday of fraud, forgery and other criminal charges related to the collapse of the hedge fund in 2009, prosecutors said.The London-based hedge fund, which at one point had more than $600 million under management, imploded after it was discovered that a multimillion-dollar trade in the firm’s flagship fund was linked to an offshore company controlled by Mr. Peterson.Magnus Peterson, 51, was convicted of eight counts, including fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading, by a jury sitting in Southwark Crown Court, after a three-month trial, according to the Serious Fraud Office of Britain.Mr. Peterson, a Swedish national who lives in Kent, is the founding director of Weavering Capital and former investment manager of the firm’s flagship fund, the Weavering Macro Fund.After the conviction, he was remanded into custody. He is to be sentenced on Jan. 23.A lawyer for Mr. Peterson did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on Monday.The Serious Fraud Office, which prosecutes financial crimes, accused Mr. Peterson of misleading investors over a six-year period and using swap trades to artificially inflate the performance of the Weavering Macro Fund.The fund collapsed during the financial crisis in March 2009, and investors lost about $536 million, the fraud office said.Mr. Peterson rewarded himself handsomely from funds received from investors, the fraud office said, receiving 5.8 million pounds, or about $9 million, between 2005 and 2009.“Whilst Mr. Peterson knew full well what the true value of the fund was when it collapsed, his investors did not,” the fraud office said in a news release on Monday. “To them, the extensive losses they suffered came as a complete shock.”
