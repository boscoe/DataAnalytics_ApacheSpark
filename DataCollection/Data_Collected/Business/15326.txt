Stephen Colbert is going live again.Following a successful string of shows during the Democratic and Republican conventions, CBS announced Wednesday that Mr. Colbert would have additional live shows following two of the three presidential debates and after the vice-presidential debate. The second presidential debate is on a Sunday, Oct. 9, when Mr. Colbert’s program, “The Late Show,” does not broadcast. (The first is on Sept. 26 and the third is on Oct. 19; the vice-presidential debate is on Oct. 4.)Mr. Colbert’s ratings spiked during his live shows from the Ed Sullivan Theater following the Republican National Convention, scoring two-month highs in total viewers. More significantly, Mr. Colbert got the sort of praise and buzz from critics that had been noticeably elusive in his first 11 months on the air on CBS. He scored viral hits with videos featuring Laura Benanti as Melania Trump and an appearance from Jon Stewart. CBS said those clips were the show’s most successful videos online since Mr. Colbert took over the show.In April, CBS shook things up by naming Chris Licht as the show runner, following months of an ever-widening ratings gap between Mr. Colbert and NBC’s Jimmy Fallon.A version of this article appears in print on August 11, 2016, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Some Live Colbert Shows Planned After Debates.
