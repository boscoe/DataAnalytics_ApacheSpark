The agency said air traffic was down 30 percent at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, 28 percent at Ronald Reagan National Airport and 12 percent at Washington Dulles International Airport from the normal average for a Saturday.On Sunday, airports in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida with flights bound for Washington reported delays ranging from 20 minutes to more than two hours.The F.A.A. said it was “continuing to diagnose the cause” of the problem.Advertisement
