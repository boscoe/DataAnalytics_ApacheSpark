LONDON — British banks may be forced to increase the capital they keep on hand by as much as $5 billion to comply with new rules intended to protect their British retail banking businesses in a financial crisis, the Bank of England said on Thursday.The central bank is requiring British lenders with more than 25 billion pounds, or about $38 billion, to wall off their retail banking operations in the country by 2019, a practice known as ring-fencing.The proposed rules are intended to shield the retail business from the impact of investment banking and other activities in the event of another global financial meltdown.The Bank of England said on Thursday that the affected banks in Britain, as a group, may be forced to increase the capital they hold by as much as £3.3 billion to meet the coming regulatory requirements, which are still being drafted.AdvertisementOn Thursday, the central bank released its estimate as part of a series of rules contemplated for putting in place ring-fencing in Britain. The proposals are expected to be finalized next year; banks can seek a waiver.Advertisement“Making our firms more resilient has been at the forefront of our postcrisis reform agenda,” Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority and deputy governor of the Bank of England, said in a news release.“Today represents an important step forward in achieving this aim,” he added. “We have provided clarity for affected banks on how we will implement ring-fencing, and this will enable firms to take substantial steps forward in their preparations for structural reform.”The new rules are expected to force changes in the British retail units of Banco Santander, Barclays, the Co-operative Bank, HSBC, the Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
