Domestic insurers have been looking to expand outside Japan, where an aging population is expected to cut into the results of insurers.This transaction is expected to significantly expand the scope of Meiji Yasuda’s offerings in the United States and to accelerate its diversification internationally. The insurer also has operations in China, Indonesia, Poland and Thailand.Under the terms of deal, Meiji will pay $115 a share for StanCorp, representing a 50 percent premium to its closing price on Thursday.“We are very pleased to welcome The Standard to the Meiji Yasuda family and to make them a key pillar of our international operations,” Akio Negishi, the Meiji Yasuda president, said in a news release. “We have been studying opportunities in the U.S. market for some time and The Standard stood out as our ideal partner.”The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016.Founded in 1906, StanCorp, based in Portland, Ore., provides a variety of insurance, retirement and investment products under The Standard brand, including mortgages. It had total premiums of $2.1 billion in 2014 and has more than 2,800 employees.In June, Tokio Marine Holdings announced that it would acquire HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billion in cash, one of a series of deals it has undertaken in the United States since 2008.Other Japanese companies seeking to grow outside their home country in recent years include Dai-ichi Life Insurance, which announced an agreement to buy the American company Protective Life Corporation in 2014 for about $5.7 billion.The Nippon Life Insurance Company, Dai-ichi and the Sumitomo Life Insurance Company have each taken stakes in several Indonesian insurers in hopes of tapping the rapidly expanding Southeast Asian market.Meiji Yasuda first entered the United States in 1976 when it bought a majority stake in Pacific Guardian Life.After the deal, StanCorp would serve as Meiji Yasuda’s primary presence in the United States and its products would continue to be marketed under The Standard brand.Greg Ness, StanCorp’s chairman, president and chief executive, and his management would continue to lead the business.“While we were not looking for a buyer, Meiji Yasuda’s proposal presented a tremendous opportunity to create value for all of our stakeholders − providing a substantial cash premium to our shareholders while enabling us to maintain our current operations and valued employees,” Mr. Ness said in a news release.Meiji Yasuda intends to finance the transaction through cash and cash equivalents on hand.As part of the transaction, StanCorp will have 25 days to solicit competing bids. Meiji Yasuda would receive a termination fee of up to $180 million if a competing bidder succeeds in buying StanCorp.Meiji Yasuda was created by the combination of the Meiji Life Insurance Company and the Yasuda Life Insurance Company in 2004, but traces its roots to 1881, making it Japan’s oldest life insurer.Based in Tokyo, Meiji Yasuda sells a variety of insurance and annuity products. It had total premiums of $28 billion in 2014 and has more than 40,000 employees.Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley and the law firm Baker & McKenzie advised Meiji Yasuda, while Goldman Sachs and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton advised StanCorp.Advertisement
