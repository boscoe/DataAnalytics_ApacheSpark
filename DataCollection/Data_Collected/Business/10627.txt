No individuals at the food conglomerate faced charges in the 2006 outbreak, which sickened at least 625 people in 47 states.Disease detectives traced the salmonella to a plant in rural Sylvester, Ga., that produced peanut butter for ConAgra under the Peter Pan label and the Great Value brand sold at Walmart. In 2007, the company recalled all the peanut butter it had sold since 2004.Leo Knowles, the president of ConAgra Grocery Products, entered the misdemeanor plea Tuesday on behalf of the Chicago-based corporation’s subsidiary.Though the Justice Department called $8 million the largest criminal fine ever imposed in a United States food safety case, it represents just one-tenth of one percent of ConAgra’s current $8 billion market capitalization. The company will also pay $3.2 million in cash forfeitures to the federal government.The case began in 2006, as doctors around the country reported severe gastrointestinal illnesses caused by salmonella. Officials traced the common factor — peanut butter — to the Georgia plant.In February 2007, ConAgra recalled its previous three years of peanut butter production, and Peter Pan vanished from store shelves for about six months. Despite the widespread illnesses, no deaths were confirmed to have been caused by the salmonella outbreak.ConAgra said that it did not know that any peanut butter was contaminated with salmonella before it was shipped. However, the plea agreement documents noted that ConAgra knew peanut butter made in Georgia had twice tested positive for salmonella in 2004. The problems were not all fixed by the time of the outbreak.None of the criminal penalties go to victims. United States District Court Judge W. Louis Sands said Tuesday that more than 150 people had filed paperwork seeking financial restitution, but that none could prove that they were sickened by salmonella caused by eating the recalled peanut butter.Advertisement
