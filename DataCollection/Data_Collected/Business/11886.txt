The European carmaker’s association, ACEA, reported that sales of Volkswagen brand cars dropped 3.8 percent from a year earlier, putting a drag on deliveries for the group, which includes the Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda brands. Away from VW’s struggles, the trade group said overall sales in Europe in January of more than one million cars were “encouraging for the near future, as the upward market trend remains stable.”Advertisement
