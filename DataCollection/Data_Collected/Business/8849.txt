Federal accident investigators said on Thursday that they found multiple breaches in the engine of a British Airways aircraft that was forced to abort its takeoff on Tuesday at the Las Vegas McCarran International Airport, suggesting the airplane had suffered an uncontained engine failure.The National Transportation Safety Board said that it also found pieces of the high-pressure compressor spool on the runway, and that it planned to take the engine apart to determine what might have caused the failure.British Airways flight 2276, a Boeing 777-200ER, was equipped with two GE90-85B engines. It was headed to Gatwick Airport in London with 157 passengers and 13 crew members. Everyone escaped, with only a few minor injuries, as fire and smoke engulfed the plane at the end of the runway.This type of episode is extremely rare as modern jet engines are designed to prevent internal parts of the engine from breaking out in an accident, lest they rupture fuel lines.A version of this article appears in print on September 11, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; British Airways Engine Ruptured, Investigators Say.
