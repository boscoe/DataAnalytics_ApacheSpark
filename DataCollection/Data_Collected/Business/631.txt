The shares opened at $60, about 15 percent higher than the offering price.The rise marks an auspicious market debut for the Italian auto manufacturer, whose supercars have been lusted over for decades. Though its production runs are limited, with last year’s at just 7,255 cars, the company’s profits have been healthy as demand for its fast, extremely expensive models has remained strong.Ferrari was pushed onto the stock markets by its corporate parent, Fiat Chrysler, which sold a 10 percent stake as part of an effort to raise money for its own revitalization plan.The initial offering raised nearly $900 million for Fiat Chrysler, which will still maintain an 80 percent stake in Ferrari — for a few more months, anyway. Fiat Chrysler plans to distribute its remaining shares in Ferrari to its shareholders next year.That means that the Agnelli family, one of Italy’s manufacturing dynasties and the majority shareholder of Fiat Chrysler, will own roughly a quarter of Ferrari outright.Piero Ferrari, the son of Ferrari’s founder, owns a 10 percent stake.A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; In Ferrari’s Trading Debut, Shares Jump 6 Percent.
