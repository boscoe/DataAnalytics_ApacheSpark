SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Brazil’s scandal-ridden petroleum giant, Petrobras, has new management and the markets are not pleased.The company announced on Friday, in a filing with Brazil’s securities regulator, the C.V.M., that the two top executives from the government-controlled Banco do Brasil would move to take the two top spots at Petrobras, also controlled by the government.Aldemir Bendine, the chief executive of Banco do Brasil, will become the Petrobras chief executive, while Ivan de Souza Monteiro, Banco do Brasil’s chief financial officer, will take on that responsibility at Petrobras.The common shares of Petrobras closed down 6.5 percent and its preferred shares closed down nearly 7 percent on the São Paulo stock exchange.AdvertisementThe company has been struggling ever since a police investigation last year revealed that suppliers bribed its executives, and that funds from inflated contracts may have been funneled into political parties that support President Dilma Rousseff.AdvertisementAt the end of January the company said that its assets might have been overvalued by over 88 billion reais ($32 billion).The company’s former chief executive, Maria das Graças Foster, resigned on Wednesday, prompting Petrobras shares to surge.Investors hoped new management would run the company more professionally. Beyond the supposed corruption, shareholders were concerned about the ways the government in recent years had used Petrobras as a tool for its broader industrial and economic policies.President Rousseff’s government obliged the company to sell gasoline at a loss to fight inflation and help ordinary workers fill their tanks. To stimulate a domestic oil services industry, it required Petrobras to prefer Brazilian suppliers, even if foreign companies had cheaper products.What troubles analysts about Mr. Bendine is that he led Banco do Brasil in much the same way as the outgoing management led Petrobras.“Aldemir Bendine always followed the government’s line very closely,” said Andre Riva Gargiulo, a banking analyst in São Paulo for GBM, a brokerage firm. As an example of what he called a politically motivated decision, Mr. Gargiulo noted how Banco do Brasil cut interest rates and eased credit requirements even as most banks pulled back on loans as the slowing economy increased the risk of lending.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If the company is unable to produce an audited earnings report by June, its bondholders will have the right to demand immediate repayment.The credit ratings agencies Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch have all downgraded Petrobras’s bonds to their lowest investment grade status.If the company’s bonds — $54.55 billion worth, Petrobras said Friday — are downgraded to junk, ripples could flow throughout global markets.An article on Saturday about a management shake-up at Brazil’s scandal-ridden petroleum giant, Petrobras, misstated the surname of a petroleum analyst with the investment consultancy Lopes Filho, who commented on the move. She is Cassia Pontes, not Portes.A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Change in Management at Petrobras Does Little to Appease Its Investors.
