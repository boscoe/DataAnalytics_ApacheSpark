LONDON — The Bermuda insurance companies PartnerRe and Axis Capital said on Friday that they would delay for two weeks shareholder meetings to approve their merger so they could explore enhancing their agreement to combine in a so-called merger of equals.The announcement came just days after the Italian investment company Exor sweetened the terms of its unsolicited takeover bid for PartnerRe.Exor has bid $6.8 billion in cash for the insurer, insisting that its deal is superior to the Axis offer.It has publicly urged PartnerRe shareholders to reject the Axis deal and has embarked on a series of meetings with its target’s investors, hoping to sway them to its cause.AdvertisementPartnerRe has said that the Exor offer provides “inadequate value” to shareholders and has urged shareholders instead to approve the deal with Axis, its preferred merger partner.AdvertisementOn Friday, PartnerRe and Axis said they were “jointly exploring enhancements to the terms” of their merger agreement.As a result, special meetings of shareholders of both companies to approve the combination will now be held on Aug. 7, the companies said. They were originally scheduled for July 24.“PartnerRe and Axis Capital are committed to ensuring that common and preferred shareholders benefit materially from the combination of the two companies,” the companies said in a news release on Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Exor remains committed to bringing its offer to fruition for the benefit of all PartnerRe.”The fight over PartnerRe comes amid a period of frenzied deal-making in the insurance sector.It also is an ambitious move by John Elkann, Exor’s chief executive and the scion of the Agnelli family that founded and still controls the Italian holding company. Exor also owns a controlling stake in the automaker Fiat Chrysler.On Tuesday, Mr. Elkann unveiled a series of revisions to Exor’s latest offer for PartnerRe, worth about $137.50 a share.Exor said it would be willing to let PartnerRe actively seek out potentially higher takeover bids through the end of August, that it would pass along the value of a $315 million breakup fee in the Axis deal if investors in both companies rejected the deal and that it would raise the dividend on PartnerRe’s preferred shares.PartnerRe and Axis agreed in January to a merger that would create a new player in the insurance industry with a combined market capitalization of more than $11 billion.AdvertisementThe combined company’s business lines would include expertise in the specialized field of reinsurance, as well as specialty insurance and life, accident and health insurance.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
