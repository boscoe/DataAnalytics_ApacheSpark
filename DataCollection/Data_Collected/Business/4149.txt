The manufacturing giant 3M, which makes Post-it notes, will take new steps to ensure that its suppliers of paper, pulp and packaging provide materials that come from sustainably logged timber. Environmental activists have accused the company of outdated practices. The company, which also makes Scotch brand tape products, will now require some 5,000 direct suppliers in more than 70 countries to provide data, including the source of their harvested wood fiber. The company says it may sever ties with suppliers that fail to meet its standards. 3M’s action is expected to have broad ripple effects because of the size of its supply network, said Todd Paglia, executive director at ForestEthics, a forest advocacy organization that had led a campaign against 3M. “No other manufacturer has adopted such a rigorous policy with such reach around the world,” he said. 3M is the latest company to take voluntary steps to reform its supply chain. In January, Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil processor, opened its supply chains to outside scrutiny in what environmentalists called an unprecedented step to help safeguard tropical forests.A version of this brief appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: 3M Moves Toward Using Sustainably Logged Timber.
