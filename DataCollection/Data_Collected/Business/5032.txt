Schoenfeld Asset Management.The move settles an unusual challenge by a United States investor against one of France’s top companies. The hedge fund, commonly known as PSAM, has pressed Vivendi for bigger payouts and the sale of the Universal Music Group.Until Wednesday, it appeared the two sides were headed toward a showdown at Vivendi’s next shareholder meeting, scheduled for April 17.In a statement on Wednesday, Vivendi said that it had agreed to pay out 6.75 billion euros, or about $7.3 billion, after holding discussions with the hedge fund in recent days. That’s up from the 5.7 billion euros that Vivendi had previously allocated.The additional money amounts to 2 euros a share, half of which will be paid in the fourth quarter and the rest in the first quarter of 2016. It will come on top of Vivendi’s existing dividend of a euro a share.Should Vivendi spend less on acquisitions than it anticipates over the next two years, the company said that it might return even more money.In return, PSAM, which controls a roughly 0.8 percent stake, agreed to withdraw a number of resolutions that it had proposed. It also plans to back all the resolutions put forward by Vivendi’s management board.“These distributions demonstrate our willingness to reach a consensus with some of our minority shareholders, even if it may result in reduced flexibility for Vivendi in the implementation of its strategic ambition to build a major media and content group,” Arnaud de Puyfontaine, the chairman of the management board, said in a statement.Vincent Bolloré, the French billionaire who is the company’s chairman and most powerful shareholder, said that he also backed the settlement.Advertisement
