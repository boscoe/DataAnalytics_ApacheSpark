LONDON — The Lloyds Banking Group said on Friday that its profit had risen 18 percent in the first half of 2015, but its results were again dragged down by provisions for a contentious loan insurance product that has cost the industry billions of dollars.The British bank said that it set aside another 1.4 billion pounds, or about $2.2 billion, to potentially compensate customers who were improperly sold payment protection insurance. Lloyds had previously set aside about £12 billion to cover potential claims.The latest provision followed a fine of £117 million in June by British regulators over the bank’s handling of complaints by consumers related to its sale of the product. António Horta-Osório, the Lloyds chief executive, has called payment protection insurance the lender’s biggest “legacy issue.”The insurance was sold broadly by banks in Britain to consumers taking out mortgages, applying for credit cards and seeking other loans. More than 45 million policies were sold from 1990 to 2010.AdvertisementThrough the end of May, banks in Britain have paid out £20 billion in claims to consumers since 2011, according to the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the industry in Britain. The complex pricing and the terms of the policies made the insurance inappropriate for many consumers, according to the authority.Advertisement“We are disappointed to announce a further provision today, but we do so from a position of financial and capital strength,” Mr. Horta-Osório said on a conference call with journalists. “For context, the number of reactive complaints continues to fall, but at a slower rate than expected.”For the six months ended June 30, Lloyds reported a profit of £677 million, compared with £574 million in the same period a year earlier.The bank said that underlying profit, which excludes asset sales and other costs, rose 15 percent, to £4.38 billion in the period, from £3.82 billion in the first half of 2014.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
