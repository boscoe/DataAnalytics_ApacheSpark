The commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is charged with signing off on member states’ budgets to ensure they comply with Union rules.The commission also said it would not recommend that Italy, Finland and Belgium be punished, despite their failure to meet deficit goals, owing to “account key relevant factors,” including the weak economic picture.In November, the commission gave France, Belgium and Italy a three-month extension on their budget deadlines.The decision “fully reflects the current economic situation,” Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for economic and financial affairs, said in a statement, adding: “The commission is demonstrating both the importance of structural reforms and the respect of our fiscal rules.”The commission said France was not off the hook, however, as officials were recommending “strict milestones for the fiscal adjustment path that will be assessed regularly,” beginning in May.Under the European Union’s Stability and Growth Pact, member states are supposed to hold their budget deficits to no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product and their government debt to a maximum of 60 percent of G.D.P.The wave of demand-sapping austerity — budget cuts and tax increases — that followed the eurozone sovereign debt crisis has largely ended, but European officials remain committed to the policy – at least in principle. Critics are fond of noting that large countries like Germany and France, which has not met the 3 percent target since 2007, have historically been given more room to maneuver than their smaller neighbors were given.Germany does not need any such leeway for now: It posted a government budget surplus of 0.6 percent of G.D.P. last year. Still, the commission on Wednesday reiterated its concern that, in light of the country’s large current-account surplus, officials in Berlin must act “so as to reduce the risk of adverse effects on the German economy and, given its size, of negative spillovers to the economic and monetary union.”For France, the commission’s decision on Wednesday was an acknowledgment that President François Hollande’s government remains deeply unpopular at home, and must walk a careful path at a time when growth is tepid and the jobless rate is over 10 percent. While Mr. Hollande has once again avoided a showdown, he probably would have preferred a three-year extension as a way to keep budget politics from being a major element in the 2017 French election campaign.Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, welcomed news of the extension, saying that with the euro weakening, interest rates at historic lows and oil prices down, France is seeing an environment that could bring “a return of growth that is indispensable for overcoming the difficulties — economic, social and budgetary — that our country faces.”Advertisement
