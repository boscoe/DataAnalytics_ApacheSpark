The identity of the buyer had been kept private after the sale was announced, which raised questions about the new owners’ transparency.In a statement that was expected to appear on the front page of The Review-Journal on Wednesday, the newspaper’s new owners said Mr. Hengel had accepted a voluntary buyout offer from the previous owners and that offers were also made to “other qualified employees.” Other employees have accepted the buyout offer, the statement said.The statement added that an interim editor would be appointed and that a search for a permanent editor would begin immediately.“We pledge to publish a newspaper that is fair, unbiased and accurate,” the new owners said in the statement. They also said they were committed to “making the new investments necessary” for the newspaper to succeed, and that they regarded themselves as “stewards of this essential community institution.”Mr. Hengel could not immediately be reached for comment.Reporters at the newspaper reacted on Twitter, posting photos of Mr. Hengel as he made his announcement. One reporter, Neal Morton, wrote that Mr. Hengel said, “I think my resignation probably comes as a relief to the new owners, and it is in my best interest and those of my family.”Reporters described the mood after Mr. Hengel’s announcement as stunned and somber.
