The sportswear maker, which bucked a trend of slowing sales of consumer goods in China with 30 percent growth in the three months that ended in August, said there was no slowdown in demand from China. “There’s an appetite for premium authentic brands in China,” Nike’s chief, Mark Parker, said on CNBC. Nike expects sales in its women’s business to reach over $11 billion in the next five years from $5.7 billion in 2015. The company’s e-commerce business, which brings in just over $1 billion, is expected to grow to $7 billion by 2020. Advertisement
