But the recommendations, called the Capital Markets Union, would improve the financial capacity of countries both inside and outside the euro area.“If we get this right, the benefits to Britain and Europe’s smaller firms could be huge, through opening up new sources of investment and growth across the E.U.,” George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a statement.Bankers in the City of London, the biggest financial hub in Europe, have long talked about opening up markets in Europe. The recommendations under consideration were made by Jonathan Hill, a Briton who last year won the coveted role on the European Commission of overseeing financial services in Europe.”My view about the City of London would be the same as my view, I think, about any financial center,” Mr. Hill told a news conference. The plan would benefit all member states, he said. “Efficient, competitive businesses” should “do well from a bigger market,” he said.After Mr. Hill’s announcement, a three-month consultation period with lawmakers, governments and businesses to draft a plan likely to include legislative proposals begins.American bankers in London and Europe have long called for the region to shift from a bank-lending economy to one driven by capital markets. Not coincidentally, such a shift would enable them to underwrite and trade the securities forming the Capital Markets Union.One reason the American economy recovered from the recession faster than Europe’s was that it “had an active capital market to help provide finance for businesses at the time when its banks were under strain,” said Chris Cummings, the chief executive of TheCityUK, a lobbying group for the financial services industry.The American private placement market, a form of direct lending typically between institutional investors and midsize firms, is almost three times bigger than that in the European Union, and debt securities markets, including the market for corporate and government bonds, are three times larger in the United States.The move toward embracing deeper capital markets also mirrors a widely held sentiment in financial circles that regulators and policy makers should shift their focus from regulating the markets to encouraging their growth.Brussels “has decided to put growth and competitiveness at the heart of its financial services policy,” said Matthew Fell, director for competitive markets at the CBI, a business lobbying group.Yet how much the initiative will help is an open question.“For those that were worried about another swath of reform coming down the track, it looks like they can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Rob Moulton, regulatory partner at the law firm Ashurst. “For investors, however, who were looking at how better to access European markets and increase diversity of their investment pools, a sigh of disappointment may be more apt.”A crucial plank of the recommendations is to make it easier to provide funding in areas like securitization — the process of slicing up loans, like mortgages, and packaging them into bondlike instruments. Regulators in Europe cracked down on securitization after the financial crisis, requiring originators like banks to retain part of the loan and to set significantly more capital aside. Banks have complained that they went overboard and tied up capital that could be used for lending.But Mr. Hill said there would be no “going back to the bad old days of subprime mortgages. Our door will remain firmly closed to the highly complex, opaque and risky securitization instruments that were of course part of the crisis.”Another plank of the recommendations focuses on prospectuses, which are expensive and detailed legal documents used by companies to raise capital. The idea here is to remove administrative burdens.There are also plans to help financiers channel investments into major infrastructure projects like roads and airports.The initiative has already encountered some opposition in Germany, where a strongly entrenched bank-lending sector fears its role could be undermined.However, Mr. Hill said, the initiative was “not meant to replace the very important source of funding that I know the banks in our system provide.”James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Jenny Anderson from London.James Kanter reported from Brussels and Jenny Anderson from London.Advertisement
