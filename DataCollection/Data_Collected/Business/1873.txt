Over 120 Boston College students have fallen ill and public health officials said Wednesday that norovirus was found at a Chipotle restaurant at the center of the outbreak. The Boston Public Health Commission said lab testing confirmed the presence of the gastrointestinal illness, which causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, at the Chipotle restaurant in the city’s Cleveland Circle neighborhood, near the Boston College campus.
