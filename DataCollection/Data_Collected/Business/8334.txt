Volkswagen and Mazda are recalling about 613,000 vehicles, several years after the automakers changed parts on new vehicles to fix the possible loss of steering or failure of airbags, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The automakers decided on a recall after the federal regulators opened investigations this year. The automakers said they were not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the problems. Volkswagen’s recall covers about 420,000 vehicles because the driver’s-side airbag may not deploy properly in a crash. They are the 2010-13 Eos and Jetta, the 2011-14 Golf GTI, the 2010-14 Passat and Tiguan and the 2010-14 CC. Mazda is recalling 2007-14 CX-9 family vans in some states because rust on a front suspension part could cause the loss of steering.A version of this brief appears in print on August 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Volkswagen and Mazda Recall Over 600,000 Vehicles.
