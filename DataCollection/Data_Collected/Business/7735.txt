LONDON — The Bermuda reinsurer PartnerRe said on Tuesday that it was willing to negotiate with the Italian investment company Exor following its latest sweetened proposal.PartnerRe also said that its board still believed that a proposed merger with Axis Capital Holdings was “superior in value, terms and certainty of closing” and continued to recommend that shareholders approve the merger at a meeting on Aug. 7.The new willingness to engage with Exor is the latest move in what has been a back-and-forth battle for PartnerRe since it first announced plans for a so-called merger of equals with Axis this year.Exor, which is controlled by the Agnelli family, unveiled its latest sweetened bid on Monday, saying it was willing to include a special, preclosing dividend of $3 a share. That effectively increased its bid for PartnerRe to $140.50 a share, Exor said.Advertisement“The board will seek to engage in negotiations with Exor, and offer Exor the opportunity to conduct due diligence, to determine whether the current offer can be improved both in its price and terms with respect to items previously identified,” PartnerRe said in a news release on Tuesday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
