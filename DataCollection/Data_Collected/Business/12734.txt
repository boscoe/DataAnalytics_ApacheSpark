PARIS — The French luxury goods maker Hermès cautioned on Wednesday that 2016 would be a “complicated year,” even as it posted strong full-year profit on the back of one of the highest levels of sales growth in the sector.Axel Dumas, the company’s chief executive, said that Hermès was bracing for volatile demand and reiterated that sales growth could be below its medium-term target of 8 percent at constant exchange rates.“There has been an economic slowdown in China, a strong dollar that held back tourist flows to the U.S., and now repeated terrorist attacks in the eurozone,” he said. “We see 2016 as a complicated year.”Mr. Dumas added that the number of tourists in France had not returned to the levels they were at before the November attacks in Paris, and he added that it was too early to gauge the impact of Tuesday’s assaults in Brussels, which killed at least 31 people.AdvertisementHermès sales rose 8.1 percent in 2015, compared with sales growth of 11.1 percent the previous year, and they were significantly higher than at rivals like Louis Vuitton and Dior, part of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton; and Gucci, which is part of the Kering conglomerate.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Hermès shares were up 2.4 percent in midafternoon trading in Paris on Wednesday.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
