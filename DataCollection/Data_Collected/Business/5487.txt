AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressFifteen years, one month and 13 days. That’s how long it took the Nasdaq to close above the nominal high it reached at the apex of the dot-com bubble.On Thursday, the Nasdaq rose 20.89 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,056.06, above its peak of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000. In many ways, the crossing of that threshold was merely ceremonial and a little psychological. Adjusted for inflation, the Nasdaq would have to climb to 6,908 to actually set a record. And this isn’t the Nasdaq of Pets.com and Webvan, when companies were valued on “cash burn rates” and “eyeballs.” The Nasdaq today, while still focused on technology companies, is more diversified. While it has been steadily climbing since 2011, its ascent isn’t the crazed surge that preceded its last record close. “It’s a major psychological barrier, but in the end, it’s just a number,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.The Nasdaq’s advance was part of a broader, modest move higher by the market.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.42 points, 0.1 percent, to 18,058.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 4.97 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,112.93. The S.&P. 500 is about four points below its nominal high on March 2.The Nasdaq’s close was a side attraction for many professional investors, who have been focused on quarterly earnings. The strong dollar has been weighing on corporations that rely on overseas sales.On Thursday, 3M, General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Caterpillar all reported their earnings and all said the strong dollar had hurt them. Procter & Gamble, whose brands include Tide detergent and Gillette razors, said its profits were down 17 percent and sales were down 8 percent from a year earlier. The company blamed the strong dollar, which makes its products more expensive when sold abroad. Procter & Gamble shares fell $2.14, or 2.6 percent, to $80.95.Another consumer products company, 3M, also reported lower profits because of the dollar. Shares in 3M, the maker of Post-its and Scotch tape, fell $5.01, or 3 percent, to $159.66.While Caterpillar, a construction equipment maker, reported a better-than-expected profit for last quarter, it said it might face bigger problems later this year as long as the dollar remains strong. Stock in Caterpillar fell 8 cents to $84.79.“The results have been pretty consistent this earnings season. If you’re an export-heavy company, your results have suffered from a strong dollar,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab.Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose $1.58, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $57.74 a barrel in New York. The advance helped lift energy stocks, which gained 1 percent. Brent crude rose $2.12 to close at $64.85 a barrel in London.Oil has been recovering slowly from the recent lows it hit in March, which investors have taken as a sign that prices are starting to stabilize after a year of declines.In other markets, the dollar fell to 119.50 yen from 119.91 yen late Wednesday. The euro rose to $1.0822 from $1.0726. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 1.95 percent from 1.98 percent late Wednesday. In metals, gold rose $7.50 to $1,194.40 an ounce. Advertisement
