PARIS — The European auto market grew last year for the first time since before the global financial crisis began, industry data showed on Friday, as consumers replaced worn-out models, and analysts expect a modest upward trend again this year.New passenger car registrations, a proxy for sales, rose 5.7 percent in the European Union last year, reaching about 12.6 million vehicles, the European Automobile Manufacturer’s Association reported from Brussels. It was the first annual expansion since 2007, when the market peaked at nearly 16 million new passenger cars.Spain led the major national markets in 2014, with government trade-in incentives helping to lift sales by more than 18 percent. Germany, Europe’s largest auto market, grew 2.9 percent. The French market remained moribund, expanding by only 0.2 percent.The main winners were down-market models like Renault’s Dacia brand, which posted a nearly 24 percent increase in sales last year. Skoda, Volkswagen’s low-cost offering, posted a 14 percent gain.AdvertisementSales ended the year with decent momentum, gaining 4.7 percent in December from a year earlier, the association said.AdvertisementStill, the industry is not out of danger yet. The stagnant economy in most of Europe, as well as crushing unemployment in countries like Greece and Spain, will continue to weigh on the market. LMC Automotive, a market research firm, estimates that European sales will gain just 1.1 percent in 2015.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In addition, many of the auto transactions came from sales to rental businesses and dealerships and from self-registrations by manufacturers. Those “disguised channels” accounted for up to 40 percent of sales in countries like Germany, Mr. Da Silva noted, and rental sales alone in Italy represented about 20 percent of cars sold there.“The full-year growth sounds less healthy in this context,” he said.
