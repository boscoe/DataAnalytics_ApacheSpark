The boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners has fired the head of its restructuring advisory practice for attempting to poach colleagues for a new firm that he was setting up, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.Michael Kramer and three other restructuring colleagues were fired for “violating their partnership and employment agreements,” according to an internal memorandum sent around the firm.The dismissals were made during the past few days, the person said. Senior executives at the firm have been contacting clients to try and maintain the relationships as the practice rebuilds under Kevin Cofsky, a managing director.The firings come as corporate restructuring experts anticipate new assignments tied to the downturn in oil prices. Many oil drillers have struggled amid the dip, with bankers and lawyers expecting a sizable number to seek Chapter 11 protection.Mr. Kramer joined Perella Weinberg nine years ago when the investment bank acquired his advisory firm, Kramer Capital Partners. He previously worked at two other boutique banks, Greenhill & Company and Houlihan Lokey.Under him, Perella Weinberg worked on matters including the Chapter 11 reorganization of Twinkies maker Hostess Brands and the out-of-court debt restructuring of the luxury department store Barneys New York. The firm also advised other parties in Chapter 11 work, including creditors of the big Texas utility Energy Future Holdings.A spokeswoman for Perella Weinberg declined to comment on the firings, which were reported earlier by The Financial Times.
