The company’s Audi luxury brand fared better, posting a gain of almost 1 percent.Altogether, sales of the company’s Volkswagen, Audi and Bentley brands fell about 16 percent during the month.Volkswagen said its sharp decline was caused, in part, by its decision to halt sales in the United States of diesel cars that do not comply with federal emissions standards.In addition, Volkswagen is under investigation by regulators in the United States and Europe for exaggerating claims about fuel efficiency and emissions on conventional gasoline vehicles.A company official reiterated previous statements that Volkswagen was working to develop repairs for the affected vehicles.“Volkswagen is working tirelessly on an approved remedy,” said Mark McNabb, the chief operating officer of Volkswagen of America.But analysts said that Volkswagen’s dismal sales performance in November was evidence that consumers were abandoning the brand in greater numbers.“Volkswagen has been hit with the double whammy of the emissions scandal and the fact they are relying on cars that nobody really wants,” said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book, referring to slow sales of its gasoline-powered cars as well as diesels.Most automakers in November benefited from healthy demand for new vehicles, particularly pickup trucks and sport utility models.Over all, the industry sold an estimated 1.32 million vehicles during the month, which represented a 1.4 percent increase from the same period a year ago, according to the industry analysis firm Autodata.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The figures are not final because technical problems forced Mercedes-Benz to delay reporting its results.The sales gain was achieved even though this November had two fewer selling days than a year ago because of a calendar quirk. Autodata said the closely watched seasonally adjusted selling rate for the month was nearly 18.2 million vehicles, compared with 17.1 million in November 2014.General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, said it sold 229,000 vehicles in November, which represented a 1.5 percent increase from a year ago.While sales of passenger cars like the Chevrolet Cruze and Buick LaCrosse fell, G.M. said sales of pickups and smaller S.U.V.s called crossovers more than made up the difference.“The phenomenal growth of crossovers in a record-setting market is the biggest sales story of 2015,” said Kurt McNeil, G.M.’s vice president for United States sales.Ford Motor, the second-biggest American automaker, said its sales rose 0.4 percent to 187,000 vehicles in November.The company reported a 10 percent increase in sales of its F-Series pickup, which was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the nation. Over all, Ford said its car sales fell almost 13 percent, while those of trucks and S.U.V.s increased more than 18 percent.Ford underscored the surging demand for trucks by announcing on Tuesday that it would invest $1.3 billion in a Kentucky factory to build a new version of its heavy-duty F-Series model. Its plans call for creating 2,000 jobs at the plant to support the new model.Other major automakers posted solid gains in November.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said its sales increased 3 percent to 176,000 vehicles during the month. While sales of its Chrysler and Dodge cars fell in November, the company’s Jeep division had a 20 percent gain.Among foreign automakers, Toyota Motor said its sales increased 3.4 percent and Nissan Motor reported a 3.8 percent gain. Sales at Honda Motor fell by 5.2 percent.Some smaller luxury brands reported exceptional gains during the month. The Volvo Group, for example, said sales increased 90 percent, and the electric-car maker Tesla Motors posted an 82 percent improvement.Yet while the industry is enjoying its best sales performance this year in more than a decade, analysts said the companies were relying on more discounts and sales promotions to maintain momentum in the market.Research firms noted that the average incentive on new vehicles exceeded $3,000 in November and that promotional spending was beginning to cut into profits.Advertisement
