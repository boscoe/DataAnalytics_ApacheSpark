LONDON – Ryanair, the largest shareholder of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, said on Tuesday that it expected the parent of British Airways to make another takeover bid for Aer Lingus as soon as this week.The International Consolidated Airlines Group, or I.A.G., made two takeover approaches for Aer Lingus, but the airline’s board rejected both. In its latest bid on Dec. 29, I.A.G. said it offered to pay 2.40 euros a share in cash, or about $2.84 a share.Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, told reporters on Tuesday that Ryanair’s board had not been approached by I.A.G., but that Ryanair would be prepared to consider an offer for Aer Lingus between €2.50 and €2.70 a share.I.A.G. has declined to comment, but another revised bid is widely expected. Any proposal to acquire Aer Lingus would require the approval of Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus, as well as the Irish government, which has a 25.1 percent stake. Ryanair has made three unsuccessful offers for Aer Lingus.Shares of Aer Lingus were down slightly, at €2.41, in afternoon trading in Dublin.Analysts have said such a deal would be attractive in part because Aer Lingus holds many takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow Airport near London, which is the main hub of British Airways.The Irish airline market, given its proximity to Britain and potential to increase British Airways’ traffic at its hub, also makes the deal attractive.I.A.G. is one of the world’s largest airline groups, carrying more than 77.3 million passengers in 2014. Its portfolio of carriers includes British Airways and two Spanish carriers – Iberia, a full-service airline, and Vueling Airlines, a low-cost carrier.A version of this article appears in print on 01/14/2015, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Higher Bid Expected.
