Roughly 21 percent are former summer interns.The position of managing director is highly coveted at Goldman, just one rung below the hallowed rank of partner. Goldman names a new class every other November and inducts them the following January, commemorating the occasion with a class photo.The promotions were announced on Thursday, after weeks of a grueling internal vetting process. This class is considerably larger than the group of 280 employees promoted in 2013, when Goldman switched its format to name managing directors and partners in alternating years.Among the promoted are 106 women, a quarter of the total and the biggest percentage in a single year. The numbers jumped the most in the investment banking division. In the securities division, including trading, 103 new managing directors were named, compared with 91 two years ago. For investment banking, there were 96 compared with 51 in 2013, and for investment management, 56 compared with 39.Fifty-four percent work in the Americas, 16 percent in Asia, 4 percent in India and 26 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The promoted “represent the best of our firm’s dedication to excellence, leadership and client service, and we wish them continued success in their careers,” Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Advertisement
