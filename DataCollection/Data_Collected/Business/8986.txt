It would be the biggest beer merger in history, one long discussed by analysts and executives in the beverage industry.But a combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller, the two biggest brewers in the world, would also bring close scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have already shown skepticism about a number of recently announced huge mergers.Still, should the two agree to combine, it would bring clear benefits to Anheuser-Busch InBev, which for two decades has been an acquisition machine that has swelled into the world’s largest brewer.Begun as a local brewery in Brazil, the company has expanded around the world with an enormous buying spree, one capped by the takeover of Anheuser-Busch in 2008, which brought Bud Light and Stella Artois under one roof.AdvertisementYet sales of traditional mega-brand beers have fallen in markets like the United States and Europe, as consumers have moved toward wine and craft brews. That has prompted the largest brewers to search for additional ways to jolt their growth.AdvertisementBuying SABMiller would give Anheuser-Busch InBev more exposure to fast-growing emerging markets, particularly in Latin American countries like Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
                The deal between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller is the latest merger of mass-market beer brands.            Moreover, SABMiller’s shares have fallen more than 11 percent in the last 12 months, making the company more vulnerable to a takeover.“We are not surprised that A.B.I. would be interested in buying SAB to create MegaBrew,” Trevor Stirling, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a research note on Wednesday.Yet joining the two companies would most likely prompt investigations from government officials around the world, given the amount of market share that the combined brewer would control.“The competitive harm is pretty scary,” said Diana L. Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute. “The concern is higher prices for consumers.”Analysts and investors have already speculated that a potential takeover of SABMiller would prompt a huge number of follow-on deals, as the two companies shed assets to win regulatory approval.One almost certain demand from the United States Justice Department, according to analysts, would be to dissolve MillerCoors, the joint venture that SABMiller formed with Molson Coors in 2008 to combine their United States operations.AdvertisementThat partnership, in which SABMiller owns a 58 percent stake and Molson Coors a 42 percent stake, owns several major brands, including Miller Lite, Coors Lite and Blue Moon.
            Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller are the world’s largest brewers. Their brands include:        Under the terms of the partnership agreement, Molson Coors has the right to make the first offer and the last for SABMiller’s stake in the joint venture should it choose to sell.Taking control of MillerCoors could yield hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings for Molson Coors, analysts have estimated. And it could give Molson Coors more control over the brewer’s operations in the United States, its biggest market.Shares in Molson Coors jumped more than 14 percent on Wednesday at the prospect of the company’s buying out SABMiller’s stake in the venture.

SABMiller’s partner in that venture, China Resources Enterprise, would most likely be interested in buying out that stake, he added.The deal is likely to face fewer regulatory problems in Europe compared with other parts of the world, including the United States and China, said Annette Schild, an expert in Brussels on European Union competition law who runs her own firm, Antitrust Law Schild. But “that does not mean there won’t be a serious investigation,” said Ms. Schild, who does not represent any of the parties in the potential deal.But any antitrust consideration in Brussels, in Washington or elsewhere might need to take into account the challenges that mass-market beer brands are facing against the rising popularity of craft beers, made by smaller, usually independent companies.Beyond regulatory approval, Anheuser-Busch InBev must also win over a number of other important players. Among them are two of SABMiller’s biggest investors: Altria, the cigarette maker, and the Santo Domingos, one of the wealthiest families in Colombia. Together, the two own 41 percent of SABMiller.James Kantor contributed reporting.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
