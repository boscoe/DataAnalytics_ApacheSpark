Stock indexes closed slightly lower Wednesday, stabilizing a day after their biggest sell-off in two months.With no obvious catalyst pushing them either way, indexes spent most of the day wavering between slight gains and losses.Investors are waiting for clues from a Federal Reserve meeting next Wednesday as to when it may start increasing interest rates. The prospect of higher rates and a surge in the dollar have been weighing on markets since indexes hit record highs last week.Stocks rose at the opening of trading and, until about an hour before the close, were holding onto their gains. The losses at the end were tiny, and energy and financial companies managed to rally.Advertisement“Investors are reassessing whether yesterday’s sell-off made sense,” said David Lefkowitz, senior stock strategist at UBS. “We still like stocks.”AdvertisementThe Dow Jones industrial average lost 27.55 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 17,635.39.

A rate increase would be the first in nine years. Low rates and other monetary stimulus have helped the S&P 500 to triple in price since the bull market began six years ago.A U.S. interest rate rise would come as Japan and Europe are struggling to grow and as China’s expansion slows. On Wednesday, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported that output in the world’s second-biggest economy rose 6.8 percent in the first two months of the year, less than expected. China is expected to slow further after growing 7.4 percent last year, the slowest rate in nearly a quarter-century.“You have three out of four major drivers of economic growth still struggling,” said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. “Can the U.S. go it alone, especially with rates heading higher?”Mr. Strazzullo said he wouldn’t be surprised if the S.&P. 500 fell 10 percent in the coming months.Mr. Lefkowitz of UBS is more optimistic. He said he didn’t think higher interest rates will hurt the U.S. economy because it has been steadily strengthening. After Tuesday’s stock market tumble, he published a report showing that, in the six months after an initial Fed rate increase going back to 1954, the S.&P. 500 has rallied an average 7.6 percent.David Lebovitz, global market strategist for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, also thinks interest rate fears are overblown. “I think a couple of months after the Fed hikes, the market will be higher,” he said.AdvertisementAs the Fed is poised to raise rates, the European Central Bank is trying to lower them. The divergent policies are hammering the euro and sending the dollar higher. On Wednesday, the euro fell to $1.0550, its lowest level since April 2003.
