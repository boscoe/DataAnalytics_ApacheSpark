Despite the ambitious goals outlined on Saturday, many analysts say they believe oil and gas will play crucial roles in the world economy for decades.The opposition Labour Party criticized the government for weakening the protection of areas that need it. “We should have a moratorium on fracking in Britain until we can be sure it is safe and won’t present intolerable risks to our environment,” said Lisa Nandy, a Labour energy spokeswoman.Britain, in a separate effort to generate greater interest in shale, is expected to soon award new licenses for shale gas and oil exploration, possibly in national parks.One of the government’s aims is to allow long, horizontal wells drilled from outside such areas to tap the oil and gas below them. The government argues that there can be little harm from such deep drilling, saying that supplies of drinking water are “normally found below 400 meters.”The government, which says that it will not allow fracking to be conducted from wells inside national parks and other protected areas, appears to be trying to find a balance between the demands of environmentalists to ban the practice entirely in parks and the oil and gas industry, which is pushing to be allowed to tap new resources.Britain is particularly interested in shale gas because it could provide cleaner fuel for generating electricity than the coal-fired plants the country plans to phase out by 2025.“We currently import around half of our gas needs, but by 2030 that could be as high as 75 percent,” Amber Rudd, the British minister for energy and climate change, said in a speech last month. “That’s why we’re encouraging investment in our shale gas exploration, so we can add new sources of homegrown supply.”Some environmental groups have been quick to criticize the government’s moves. “This could expose many of the U.K.’s most fragile and treasured landscapes to noise, air and light pollution,” Greenpeace said in a statement on Tuesday.Despite government support, the British shale industry has struggled to gain traction. Environmental groups and local opposition have contributed to slowing the allocation of exploration licenses.Few shale wells have been drilled in Britain, and only one has been fracked. That well, by Cuadrilla Resources, set off minor earth tremors in 2011, setting back the effort.The biggest obstacle to the growth of hydraulic fracturing, though, has been a lack of proof that the commercially exploitable resources exist despite studies suggesting large quantities of gas sit beneath some parts of Britain.One area the industry believes may have shale gas includes the North York Moors National Park in northeast England. “Shale rock which may be suitable for fracking is likely to exist between 1,500 and 4,000 meters below the surface” of the southern portion of the park, the park’s managers say on their website.Chris France, director of planning at the park, said that in considering whether to allow fracking, park officials would weigh the possible environmental damage against the potential economic benefits. “Absolutely economic benefits and the U.K.’s need for shale gas are very much issues we would have to take into account, “ he said by telephone.British national parks attempt to meld preserving scenic beauty and wildlife with some commercial and residential activity. North York Moors is already the site of gas production from nonshale sources, by a company called Third Energy.Among those applying for new tracts is Ineos, a petrochemical company based in Switzerland, that has several onshore and offshore gas installations in Britain.The company said on Wednesday that it expected Britain to allocate new onshore exploration licenses soon, and that it had applied “for many” of them to expand its 300,000-acre portfolio.Stephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement
