The British luxury-car maker Aston Martin has set up a venture with the Chinese consumer electronics group LeEco to jointly develop an electric vehicle. Aston Martin and LeEco said that the car would be based on Aston Martin’s Rapide S model, and that if successful the venture would develop other electric vehicles, including for LeEco. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. “It brings Aston Martin’s electric car project forward,” Aston Martin’s chief, Andy Palmer, said, adding that the new car would come to market in 2018 and be built in Gaydon, England.A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Business Briefing; Aston Martin and LeEco Plan to Develop Electric Car.
