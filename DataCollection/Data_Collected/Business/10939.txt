Lumos Labs, the developer of Lumosity “brain training” games, will pay $2 million to settle accusations it misled customers about the cognitive benefits of its online apps and programs. The Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that ads deceptively suggested that playing the games a few times a week could increase work and school performance, and even delay conditions like dementia. Lumos Labs must contact customers and offer them an easy way to cancel their subscriptions, which range from $15 to $300. The $2 million will be refunded to customers. Jessica L. Rich, director of the F.T.C.’s Consumer Protection Bureau, said the company “simply did not have the science to back up its ads.” Only products that have been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration can claim to treat or prevent serious diseases or conditions.A version of this brief appears in print on January 6, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Lumosity Game Developer Agrees to $2 Million Settlement.
