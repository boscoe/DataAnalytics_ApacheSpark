Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake eclipsed the next-largest tech buyout, the $17.5 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor — itself poised to be sold to a fellow chip maker, NXP Semiconductor.And a Dell acquisition of EMC would be the biggest technology takeover on record, according to Thomson Reuters, surpassing JDS Uniphase’s $41 billion purchase of the networking company SDL, a deal announced during the headiest days of the dot-com boom.Should Dell succeed in its quest, it would continue its campaign to swing away from the computer manufacturing that powered its rise to fame, and then later proved an anchor as smartphones and tablets began to rise.Mr. Dell has insisted that the company bearing his name is headed toward a new future built on business services, particularly “converged systems” that blend computing, storage and networking. (EMC, whose core offerings include data storage and networking, would be a boon in that effort.)Even before its buyout, Dell spent billions of dollars to buy software and networking companies to build up its enterprise services division.The company has a like-minded partner in Silver Lake, a huge tech-focused investment shop with a penchant for creative deal schemes for its portfolio companies. The firm helped build up Avago Technologies, once a portion of a Hewlett-Packard spinoff, into a big and aggressive acquirer in its own right.Nearly two years ago, Silver Lake helped finance the company’s $6.6 billion takeover of the LSI Corporation to help the chip maker move into the networking and storage semiconductor industry.That helped lead to Avago’s $37 billion takeover of Broadcom earlier this year.Advertisement
