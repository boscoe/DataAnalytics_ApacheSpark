AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressStocks were mixed on Friday because of a surprisingly strong October jobs report, leaving investors to adjust to the prospect of higher interest rates as early as next month.While the major indexes had a muted reaction to the jobs numbers on the surface, a look at the individual parts of the market showed that investors were actively reshuffling their portfolios.Dividend-paying stocks, which are typically bought for their higher-than-average payouts when interest rates and bond yields are low, dropped sharply on Friday. The Dow Jones utility index, a basket of 15 dividend-paying utility stocks, sank 4 percent.In contrast, bank stocks increased sharply as investors bet that higher interest rates would translate into higher profits, since banks may be able to charge more for lending. JPMorgan Chase rose $2.02, or 3 percent, to $68.46. Bank of America rose 64 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $17.94. And Morgan Stanley rose $1.53, or 4.5 percent, $35.42. Wall Street has been trying to guess when the Federal Reserve will finally raise interest rates. The market turmoil over the summer kept policy makers at the Fed from raising rates at their September meeting, and they decided to wait yet again at their October meeting to see more signs that the United States economy was on sure footing.By nearly every account, the October jobs report gave the Fed exactly what they wanted. The Labor Department said American employers added 271,000 jobs, far more than the most hopeful expectation, and the unemployment rate dipped to a seven-year low of 5 percent, from 5.1 percent. The burst of hiring, the most in 10 months, filled jobs across a range of industries.“This makes it pretty likely the Fed will raise rates in December,” said Priscilla Hancock, a global fixed-income strategist for J. P. Morgan Asset Management.Fed fund futures, which are securities that bet on which way the Fed will move interest rates, now show roughly a 74 percent chance of the central bank raising rates in December, up from 60 percent on Wednesday and up from well below 50 percent as recently as late summer. But the size of the predicted interest rate increase remains modest. Investors expect interest rates will go to 0.5 percent from their current levels of zero to 0.25 percent.“The Fed is still going to be extremely accommodative for investors,” Ms. Hancock said. “A rate hike in December is removing those emergency measures that the bank put into place during the financial crisis.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.9 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 17,910.33. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell less than one point, to 2,099.20, and the Nasdaq rose 19.38 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 5,147.12. The bond market’s reaction to the jobs number was far more volatile than the stock market’s. Bond prices sank as investors scaled back their holdings of Treasuries and safer investments.The benchmark 10-year United States Treasury note rose to a yield of 2.32 percent from 2.23 percent on Thursday, a big move for that security. The two-year note jumped to a yield of 0.89 percent, a five-year high for that note, from 0.83 percent the day before.The data also caused the dollar to rise sharply against its major currency counterparts. The euro fell to $1.07, its lowest level in six months, and the dollar rose against the Japanese yen to 123.19.The stronger dollar caused a sell-off in commodities as well. Benchmark crude oil fell 91 cents, or 2 percent, to settle at $44.29 a barrel. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 56 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $47.42 a barrel. Gold fell $16.50, or 1.5 percent, to $1,087.70 an ounce. Silver fell 29 cents, or 2 percent, to $14.69 an ounce. High-grade copper fell a penny, or 0.6 percent, to settle at $2.242 a pound.Advertisement
