Mr. Tsipras stressed that ”calm and determination” were needed in the final stretch of negotiations.Greece might miss a debt payment on June 5 if it fails to receive bailout funds from creditors, who are demanding that the country make reforms to its economy. It is unclear whether an agreement can be reached in time and Greece is dealing with three different institutions: the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank.Missing those payments could destabilize the country’s financial system and eventually push it out of the 19-country eurozone, a step that could shake the currency union and the global economy.The news helped the euro stabilize against the dollar after its sell-off Tuesday. The drop in the euro was partially blamed for yesterday’s stock market sell-off.Outside of Greece and the dollar, most of investors’ attention is on the Fed and when the central bank plans to start raising rates for the first time in almost a decade.

There was no major economic data on Wednesday to move the market one way or another.“It’s an old but true expression: the market likes certainty. Until we get that from the Fed, stocks are unlikely to make any headway,” said David Lefkowitz, a senior equity strategist at UBS.
