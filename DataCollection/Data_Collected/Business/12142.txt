It is not clear yet whether Honeywell would escalate its approach to a full-on hostile bid, though people close to that company said that it would remain “disciplined” in its campaign.Honeywell’s presentation confirms that its latest offer consists of $42.63 a share in cash, plus 0.614 of a Honeywell share for each share of United Technologies. At the time the proposal was made last week, the bid was valued at about $108 a share, roughly 22 percent higher than the price at which United Technologies’ stock was trading at the time.In Honeywell’s proposal, it makes the case for what it says would be a “well-balanced portfolio,” which would include almost $100 billion in combined sales across aerospace, homes and buildings, military contracting and energy.Among Honeywell’s main arguments was the $3.5 billion worth of cost savings that it calculated would come from putting the two companies together. Honeywell said that uniting the two would allow them to shed duplicative research and manufacturing costs, while creating a financially stronger company.But United Technologies’ primary response, as outlined in its own 15-page presentation, revolved around two main points: Honeywell’s offer would be rejected by government regulators, and the bid was too low.“The most recent public statements made by Honeywell and its advisers have reinforced our assessment that Honeywell simply believes it is in its interests to gloss over these fundamental transaction risks in connection with pursuing this opportunistic approach,” Gregory J. Hayes, United Technologies’ chief executive, wrote in a letter that United Technologies made publicly available.United Technologies’ own antitrust advisers have calculated that a union would lead to at least $10 billion in overlapping sales, or about 10 percent of the two companies’ combined revenues. (Honeywell has argued that less than 5 percent of their target sales overlap.)The biggest areas of overlap, according to analysts, include components for planes — a point that United Technologies illustrated with a detailed plane schematic — and heating and cooling systems for buildings.Selling off the requisite amount of businesses to satisfy antitrust regulators in the United States, Europe and China could erase any gains from a merger, people close to United Technologies said.Friday’s presentation from United Technologies also highlighted comments from the two companies’ biggest customers, suggesting wariness over a merger. “I do not see that such a combination would be in the interests of Airbus, and I am under the impression that the leadership of U.T.C. shares my assessment,” Tom Enders, the chief executive of Airbus, said in a statement this week.So far, shareholders appeared unconvinced that a deal would be reached anytime soon. Shares in United Technologies closed down slightly, at $97.66, while those in Honeywell fell just over 1 percent, to $103.02.Advertisement
