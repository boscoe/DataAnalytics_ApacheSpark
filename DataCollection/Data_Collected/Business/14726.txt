You might also have wondered if someone had removed the scaffolding that has been on the Capitol dome for two years.But many eagle-eyed viewers suspected something was not quite right, and PBS later admitted as much: It had spliced in firework footage from previous years with live shots.We showed a combination of the best fireworks from this year and previous years. It was the patriotic thing to do. #July4thPBS“Because this year’s fireworks were difficult to see due to the weather, we made the decision to intercut fireworks footage from previous A Capitol Fourth concerts for the best possible television viewing experience,” the show’s organizers said Tuesday in a statement. “We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.”The show did not inform viewers that they were watching a highlight reel of past colorful explosions. But “Seinfeld” reruns are one thing; fireworks reruns are quite another. And angry viewers vented.One user Twitter user said it “could have been announced at the time,” while another called it “a deceptive thing to do.”A PBS Twitter account cast the decision as “the patriotic thing to do,” but viewers were not convinced.Advertisement
