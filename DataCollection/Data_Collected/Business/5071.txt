And the four-week moving average of claims hit its lowest level since 2000, suggesting that an abrupt slowdown in job growth in March was most likely a fluke.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 281,000 for the week ended April 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday.It was the fifth straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold that is associated with a strengthening labor market.Average for some Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. securities.“The claims data provide no confirmation of the March employment slowdown,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.Job growth slowed sharply in March, when nonfarm payrolls increased by only 126,000, ending a 12-month stretch of employment gains above 200,000. But with the weakness mostly concentrated in the weather-sensitive leisure and construction sectors, economists played down the decrease.The tepid employment report last week joined weak consumer and business spending, industrial production and housing starts data in suggesting that the economy grew at an annual rate below 1 percent in the first quarter.Activity has been hit by a harsh winter, which is estimated to have chopped as much as seven-tenths of a percentage point from first-quarter growth.A now-settled labor dispute at normally busy ports on the West Coast, softer global demand and a stronger dollar also have weighed on the economy.Weekly number of people who have filed for unemployment benefits for the first time.Claims tend to be volatile around Easter because of the shifting nature of the holidays. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,000 last week, to 282,250, the lowest since June 2000.“If claims remain this low, and we think they might even head lower in the coming weeks, it will be hard to claim there is persistent weakness in the labor market,” said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn.A separate report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed wholesale inventories rose in February as sales remained weak, suggesting wholesalers might have little incentive to restock warehouses aggressively in coming months.Stocks at wholesalers gained 0.3 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in January. Sales fell 0.2 percent in February after declining 3.6 percent the previous month.At February’s sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, unchanged from January.Advertisement
