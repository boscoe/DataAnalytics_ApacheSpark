            Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Monday.        JULY 11, 2016
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed at a record high Monday, eclipsing the peak it hit more than a year ago.The Dow Jones industrial average was within 1 percent of its own closing high, which was also set in May last year, but the Nasdaq composite index has further to go. The Nasdaq is still negative for the year and would have to gain nearly 5 percent to regain the closing high it reached last July.The S.&P. 500 gained 7.26 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,137.16. That beat the record close of 2,130.82 it reached on May 21, 2015.The Dow rose 80.19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,226.93. The Nasdaq rose 31.88 points, or 0.6 percent, to 4,988.64.AdvertisementThe market has had a rough ride in the year since the S.&P. 500’s last record. Investors have been rattled by plunging oil prices, falling corporate earnings, fears about the possibility of rising interest rates, slowing growth in China, and, most recently, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union.AdvertisementSince the British referendum on June 23, however, many investors have come around to thinking that the consequences of the vote, known as “Brexit,” may be contained largely to Britain, and they have resumed buying stocks.Jonathan Corpina, senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners, expressed surprise that the market had bounced back so much that the S.&P. 500 had reached another record high.“If you looked at the headlines from Brexit, you’d think that the world was coming to an end,” Mr. Corpina said. “And very quickly, in a matter of weeks, that was completely erased.”Technology stocks and banks rose more than the rest of the market, while utilities and telephone companies, which investors have favored recently for their steady dividends, fell. Boeing rose $1.95, or 1.5 percent, to $132.04 and Citigroup added 31 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $42.29.This week investors are focusing on company earnings. Alcoa, the aluminum maker, reported lower profit and revenue after the closing bell on Monday, but beat expectations. JPMorgan Chase will release results on Thursday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But some investors contend the worst is over as oil prices stabilize, the jobs market strengthens and consumers spend more.“When consumers start to spend more, producers have to produce more, which means they have to hire more workers,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management. “It’s a virtuous cycle.”In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 4 percent after an election in which the ruling coalition won a resounding victory, ensuring stability and more stimulus spending for the world’s third-largest economy behind those of the United States and China.AdvertisementEuropean markets closed sharply higher. In France, the CAC 40 gained 1.8 percent, while the German DAX climbed 2.1 percent. The British FTSE 100 added 1.4 percent.
