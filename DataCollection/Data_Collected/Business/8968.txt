LubbenGiven the widespread expectation that corporate bonds and loans will soon be stress tested by rising interest rates, much to the delight of restructuring professionals everywhere, you might think that bondholders would be seeking extra protection as they approach the impending storm.But according to a recent report,  you would be wrong. The covenant quality of North American high-yield bonds reached a new record low in August, says Moody’s Investors Service. This is based on their covenant quality index, which is a three-month rolling average covenant quality score.In short, impending storm or not, it seems that the quest for a reasonable yield is still trumping all else in the debt markets. This is somewhat like knowing your car is about to crash, but declining to use the seatbelts anyway.The effect will be seen in future restructurings, where flailing companies are apt to be real basket cases by the point they actually default. With few or any covenants to breach, it takes real effort to default, after all.This comes in a world where the secured creditor is already king. Between blanket liens and asset-based loans that ensure senior creditor at the point of default, and even before, the addition of another layer of indebtedness will not help matters.The end result is that the next wave of Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases will probably feature lots of quick sales, where the company is handed over to the senior lenders. It seems doubtful this is consistent with the original vision of Chapter 11 as a means to maximize the going concern value of companies, for the benefit of all stakeholders.Can anything be done about it? In a recent article, I suggested that directors should have a fiduciary duty to think long and hard before they put liens on all of the company’s assets. But until a court adopts that position, its just another academic theory.So the answer to the question, at least is the short run, seems to be “no.”Advertisement
