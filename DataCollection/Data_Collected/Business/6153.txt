Par shareholders would receive $6.5 billion in cash and 18 million Endo shares worth about $1.55 billion.Par, whose generic drugs include versions of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Baraclude, a hepatitis B treatment, also makes branded drugs like Megace ES, a treatment for anorexia, and Nascobal, for vitamin B12 deficiency.Endo makes the painkiller Percocet and Stendra, an erectile dysfunction treatment, as well as generic pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter drugs and medical equipment.Rajiv De Silva, Endo’s president and chief, said in a news release that the transaction would build on the company’s growth in generic drugs “while also transforming Endo, creating a powerful corporate platform for future growth and strategic M&A.”Less than three months ago, Endo lost out in its bid to acquire Salix Pharmaceuticals, after it was outbid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International in March.The Par Pharmaceuticals transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies and does not require additional shareholder approval. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year and is subject to regulatory approval.Par Pharmaceutical, based in Chestnut Ridge, N.Y., was taken private by an affiliate of the private equity firm TPG Capital in 2012. It posted revenue of $1.31 billion in 2014 and employs 1,600 people.Endo said it had secured financing from Deutsche Bank and Barclays to fund the cash portion of the offer.“This is an exciting time of growth and opportunity in the generics and specialty pharmaceutical arenas,” Paul V. Campanelli, the Par Pharmaceutical chief executive, said in a news release. He said the combination would expand the scope of Par’s “rich and diversified product portfolio and R&D pipeline.”After the deal is completed, Mr. Campanelli will join Endo, where he will lead the generics business and serve as a member of Endo’s executive leadership team.Endo, based in Dublin, is a specialty pharmaceutical maker. It posted revenue of $2.88 billion for 2014 and employs 5,000 people worldwide. Its United States headquarters are in Malvern, Pa.Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Houlihan Lokey and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom advised Endo, while JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Ropes & Gray advised Par Pharmaceuticals.Advertisement
