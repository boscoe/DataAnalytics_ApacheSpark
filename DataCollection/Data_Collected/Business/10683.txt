Unsurprisingly, the majority of the most-read stories this year were about the 2016 election. Wherever you fall on the political spectrum, you may be sick of reading about politics, so we’ve added a “No Politics” filter if you’d like to skip those articles. You can also see which articles you haven’t yet read. The topic of this year’s most-read article, like last year’s, is love  this time “Why You Will Marry the Wrong Person.” (Spoiler alert: The author thinks we all do.)
The list covers Jan. 1 through Nov. 30, 2016.Looking for more stories? Read on in the best of The New York Times.Advertisement
