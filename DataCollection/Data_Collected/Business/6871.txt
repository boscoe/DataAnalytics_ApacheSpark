Senator Richard Blumenthal asked the Justice Department on Wednesday to investigate whether airlines were engaging in anticompetitive behavior and colluding to limit capacity and drive up fares. In a letter to William J. Baer, the head of the department’s antitrust division, the senator highlighted several comments that airline chief executives made at a recent industry gathering that suggested the carriers might be pursuing anticompetitive behavior. In his letter, Mr. Blumenthal quoted the presidents of Delta Air Lines, Air Canada and American Airlines, who all spoke of capacity “discipline.” The letter also noted that the airlines had become more concentrated after several mergers in recent years that were all approved by the Justice Department. “Consumers are paying sky-high fares and are trapped inside an uncompetitive market with a history of collusive behavior,” the senator said in his letter.A version of this brief appears in print on June 18, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Senator Urges Inquiry Into Airline Behavior .
