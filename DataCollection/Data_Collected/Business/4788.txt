Analysts said sellers were previously exempted from taxes only if they owned the houses for at least five years.The policy sweeteners, which were more generous than what the market had expected, confirmed rumors swirling in China on Monday that the authorities were increasing support for the flagging real estate sector. Real estate share indexes rallied sharply in Shanghai on rumors of the change. The Shanghai composite’s property index closed up more than 7 percent, its best day since 2009, while the broader index closed 2.6 percent higher.That China is now trying to lift its property market is an about-face in policy. As recently as early 2014, the authorities were waging a four-year campaign to tame an exuberant market, which pushed home prices to records.Some analysts doubted that the measures announced Monday would lead to a turnaround.“The new measures are definitely helpful, but the impact won’t be significant,” said Ada Wong, a vice president at the China Aoyuan Property Group, a developer based in Guangzhou. “This is because most of the speculative buyers have been eliminated. The market has become more rational, so sales won’t increase a lot.”Zhu Haibin, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said, “We expect the housing market correction will continue, but at a relatively modest pace through the course of this year. In our view, real estate investment growth will likely further decelerate from 10.5 percent in 2014 to about 6 percent in 2015, which will continue to drag on economic growth.”The housing market has increasingly weighed on the economy. Prices fell at a record pace in February, denting activity in industries like cement, steel and glass making.Real estate accounts for about 15 percent of the Chinese economic activity and economists have warned that persistent weakness in housing could endanger Beijing’s target of 7 percent growth this year.Investors had speculated that China would cut down payments for buyers of second homes with outstanding home loans to 50 percent. Yet while the move was more generous than many had expected, it was not clear that banks would pass on the discounts to buyers.Even before the latest relaxation, some banks were demanding down payments of as much as 70 percent, higher than a government-set minimum of 60 percent.In its statement, the central bank urged financial institutions to “support home purchases” with a combination of commercial lending and money from the national provident fund. The provident fund is a government-managed program in which all of China’s employers and employees contribute to a pool of money from which employees then borrow to buy homes.The central bank said the down payment for second-home loans by borrowers from the housing provident fund was now set at 30 percent, provided borrowers had no outstanding mortgages. First-time buyers using the provident fund need make a down payment of only 20 percent, the bank said, with all changes taking immediate effect.Advertisement
