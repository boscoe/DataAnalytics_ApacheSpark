The French telecommunications giant Orange said on Tuesday that it was in talks to acquire Bouygues Telecom, a local rival, in the latest effort to consolidate Europe’s highly fragmented cellphone market.Orange is partly owned by the French government, and is the largest mobile carrier in the country. A price war is occurring across the European Union, where operators are increasingly bundling their services — mobile, fixed-line, pay television and cable — in low-price offers for the region’s 500 million customers.Orange has more than 260 million subscribers worldwide, including 28 million in France. Bouygues Telecom has 14 million customers, all in France.Industry analysts have long expected Europe’s largest carriers, like Orange and Deutsche Telekom of Germany, to buy national rivals to reduce competition. Such acquisitions could allow them to invest more in their high-speed mobile and cable networks, which have fallen behind those of their counterparts in the United States and Japan, among other countries.AdvertisementYet such consolidation has been delayed after European antitrust officials warned that takeovers in the region’s telecom sector could lead to increased prices and a lack of choice for consumers.AdvertisementDespite these concerns, Orange and Bouygues Telecom are in discussions on a deal that would cement Orange’s position in France.While Orange did not say what any deal would be worth, local news reports suggested that a takeover would total about 10 billion euros, or $10.9 billion, with €8 billion to be paid in Orange shares and the rest in cash. That would give Bouygues a sizable minority stake in Orange.A spokesman for Orange declined to comment on the pricing.“The group is exploring the opportunities available within the French telecoms market, while keeping in mind that its investments and its solid position afford it a total independence in its approach,” Orange said in a statement.Orange said that there was no time frame for reaching an agreement, and that the talks might not result in a merger.Shares in Orange rose 0.7 percent to €15.31 in trading Tuesday in Paris, where shares of Bouygues increased 0.4 percent to €37.30.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
