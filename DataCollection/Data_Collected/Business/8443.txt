But supply remains tight, pushing up home prices and sidelining first-time buyers, who are a crucial part of a strong housing market. The share of first-time buyers fell to a six-month low of 28 percent last month.There were 2.24 million unsold previously owned homes on the market in July, down 4.7 percent from a year ago. That pushed the median home price to $234,000, up 5.6 percent from the year-ago period. Although higher prices could curb sales, they are raising equity for many owners and lifting household wealth.They also may encourage builders to ramp up construction, further bolstering the economy. Housing starts rose to near an eight-year high in July.“The market needs more new homes to be built to continue the momentum, so the trade-up buyers can find their next home and provide inventory for those looking to enter the home-buying market,” said Bill Banfield, a vice president at Quicken Loans in Detroit.In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business activity index increased to 8.3 this month from a reading of 5.7 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region’s manufacturing. While demand for manufactured goods remained weak, shipments rebounded strongly and employment in the region’s factories improved.National manufacturing activity has been stymied by a strong dollar, weak global demand and the effect of lower oil prices on the energy sector.Also on Thursday, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index declined 0.2 percent in July, after solid advances of 0.6 percent in both June and May.“Despite a sharp drop in housing permits, the U.S. L.E.I. is still pointing to moderate economic growth through the remainder of the year,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, director of business cycles and growth research at the board.The data added to solid June employment, retail sales and industrial production reports that have suggested the economy got off to a strong start in the third quarter.In a fourth report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 277,000 for the week ended Aug. 15.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 5,500, to 271,500, last week.It was the 21st straight week that the four-week average remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market.The claims data covered the week that the government surveyed employers for the nonfarm payrolls portion of August’s employment report. The four-week average of claims fell 7,000 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of healthy job gains.“These data show that companies are, for the most part, holding onto labor and reluctant to lay off workers,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. “The data are for the August payroll survey week and suggest that the trend of solid job creation remains intact.”Payrolls increased by 215,000 in July.Advertisement
