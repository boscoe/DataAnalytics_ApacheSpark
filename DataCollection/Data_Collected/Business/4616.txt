Schoenfeld Asset Management, calling for the sale of the music company. The investment firm has also demanded a higher dividend.But the conglomerate reiterated that it had no intention of selling Universal, pointing to comments by the chairman of its management board, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, at a conference last week.“The management board opposes the dismantling of Vivendi and reaffirms its desire to build a Paris-based, global industrial content and media group,” the company said in its statement.The demand by P. Schoenfeld, which owns a stake of about 1 percent, follows a spree of asset sales by Vivendi that have raised more than $30 billion. The company already has said that it intends to return about 5.7 billion euros, or $6.2 billion, to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.PSAM, as the investment firm is called, has hired advisers to prepare for a potential fight over Vivendi’s board. It isn’t normally known as an activist investor, usually focusing on betting on the outcomes of mergers.But it has occasionally flexed its muscle in other ways, including demanding a higher takeover price in the sales of Biomet and MetroPCS.Advertisement
