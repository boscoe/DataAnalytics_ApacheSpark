The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis overturned an $18.77 million award to workers at a Madison pork processing plant after a nonjury trial. It also threw out a $4.96 million award concerning a Dakota City beef processing plant, after a jury trial. Workers accused Tyson of failing to pay them properly for “K-code time,” representing pre- and post-shift activities like putting on and taking off required clothing; cleaning and maintaining equipment; and walking to and from the production line, lockers and wash stations. Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel, Judge Steven M. Colloton said he had found insufficient evidence that Tyson had agreed to pay those wages. A lawyer for workers in both lawsuits did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Tyson had no immediate comment. Advertisement
