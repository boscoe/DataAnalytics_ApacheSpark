HONG KONG — China’s slowing economy appeared to stabilize somewhat in the second quarter, defying signs of weakness in the country’s traditional industrial base and more recent turbulence in its stock market.China’s official statistics agency said on Wednesday that gross domestic product rose 7 percent in the April to June quarter from a year earlier, beating economists’ expectations for a 6.8 percent increase. That matched the economy’s performance in the first quarter, and remained in line with the government’s target for full-year growth.“The national economy has been running within the proper range and the major indicators picking up steadily,” the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday in a statement. China is “showing moderate but stable and sound momentum of development,” it added.
            Until recently, China’s financial industry outpaced the economy as a whole.        CHINESE G.D.P.

China’s housing market, which can have a broad impact on the rest of the economy, has in recent months shown signs of a nascent recovery.At the same time, data for the second quarter probably received a boost from unprecedented trading turnover in China’s stock market, which has swung in dramatic boom-bust fashion over the past few months.China’s market has partly recovered in recent days from a huge sell-off that began in June and erased several trillion dollars in market value. Shanghai shares opened more than 1 percent lower on Wednesday morning, and by midmorning had continued further downward despite the better-than-expected economic data.A version of this article appears in print on July 15, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Growth Is Steady in China.
