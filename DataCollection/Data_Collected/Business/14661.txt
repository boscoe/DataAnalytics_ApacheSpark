Resolution of the lawsuit has not been previously reported. Neither Volkswagen nor Mr. Donovan’s lawyer would comment on whether he had received any money in return for agreeing to drop the case.In a statement, Volkswagen said it continued to deny the allegations in the lawsuit.The company and Sam Morgan, Mr. Donovan’s lawyer, said in nearly identical statements that “he has now voluntarily dismissed the complaint and has agreed to cooperate fully with the company’s internal investigations.”“The matter has been resolved amicably to the satisfaction of all of the parties,” their statements said.German prosecutors said recently they were investigating whether a Volkswagen manager encouraged employees to destroy or remove documents last year, shortly before the Environmental Protection Agency publicly accused the carmaker of illegally manipulating emissions tests in the United States.The prosecutors have not said whether there was any connection between their investigation and Mr. Donovan’s claims.Follow Jack Ewing on Twitter @JackEwingNYT.OpinionThe Editorial BoardAdvertisement
