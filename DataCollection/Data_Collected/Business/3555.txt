Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan Securities analyst, estimated the loss of Costco would reduce spending on Amex cards by about $80 billion a year. Amex said on Thursday that it would hurt earnings for the next two years, sending its shares down as much as 7 percent and wiping out about $6 billion of market value. Amex said it expected earnings per share growth in 2015 to be flat to down modestly from 2014 as the company invests aggressively to prepare for the end of the contract. The agreement with Amex, the only card Costco accepts, ends March 31, 2016. Costco declined to comment. Advertisement
