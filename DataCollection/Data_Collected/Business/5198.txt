The Nasdaq fell 10.96 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,977.29.Stocks have been rising this year, but the gains have been modest as factors like labor strife at West Coast ports, bad weather, a slump in oil prices and a strengthening dollar have dug into earnings. A stronger currency makes profits earned overseas by U.S. multinationals worth less. Companies in the S.&P. 500 are expected to report a 3.5 percent slump in earnings per share in the first quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ. That would be the first quarterly drop since the U.S. was climbing out of recession in 2009.Many financial analysts and stock strategists are shrugging off the profit hit as temporary. But not everyone is convinced, says John Canally, an LPL Financial economist, and worry is beginning to creep in.“What will be the further impact of the strong dollar? If you’re an energy company, what do you do if oil prices don’t rise? There are no answers yet,” said Mr. Canally. “And that uncertainly is what markets don’t like and so trading is choppy.”The impact of stronger dollar was seen in Johnson & Johnson’s results released Tuesday. The company said a stronger dollar was partly to blame for an 8.6 percent drop in its first-quarter profit. The company also cut its full-year profit forecast.

The rebound suggests that shoppers are returning after an unseasonably cold winter froze sales.But the rise was less than economists had expected, and it follows other indicators that the U.S. economic growth is slowing. A jobs report released earlier this month showed that hiring had slowed dramatically in the March.“It’s remarkable that we’ve had relatively weak economic data but the market has held up,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. He added, “Investors are willing to look through that.”Among stocks making moves, PMorgan Chase gained 97 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $63.04 after reporting earnings rose 11 percent in the first quarter.
