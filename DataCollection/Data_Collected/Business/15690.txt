Shiller’s article on wealth inequality, while rather despairing, did present some useful thoughts on factors that could bring about a new age of deep imbalance.However, cataclysms like the Great Depression and World War II, while unleashing vast and horrendous human suffering, can lead to a rebalancing of wealth, as exhaustively documented by Thomas Piketty in “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” Mr. Piketty proposes a progressive tax on wealth. Raising income taxes is not a direct enough way to rebalance capital distribution.For purposes of national security, we need to make progress on this problem. If current trends persist, eventually conditions could mirror the extreme inequality seen in pre-revolutionary France.Frederick SchuepferHarriman, N.Y., Aug. 30To the Editor:The recent book “Raising the Floor” by Andy Stern, with Lee Kravitz, details the current and near-future problems and the evaporation of middle-class jobs.The solution? A subsidy, based on extensive analysis, for all of $1,000 a month to increase their income, funded from potentially many different sources, which are worth discussion.Dan SkwireSarasota, Fla., Aug. 29Letters for Sunday Business may be sent to sunbiz@nytimes.com.Advertisement
