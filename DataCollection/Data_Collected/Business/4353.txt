Mr. Lindsay, who has held a number of roles in a 32-year career with the bank, returns to a role he held until 2012.Replacing Mr. Lindsay will be new two co-heads of global M.&A., Robin Rankin and Greg Weinberger.Mr. Weinberger, a former lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, was most recently co-head of Americas M.&A., and before that co-head of Americas oil and gas. Ms. Rankin was most recently global co-head of retail and consumer products for Credit Suisse.Ms. Rankin becomes the latest woman to assume a top role in the traditionally male-dominated world of mergers and acquisitions.
