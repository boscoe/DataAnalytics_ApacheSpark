Wall Street has a late-in-the-week case of the Mondays.The calendar says Thursday, but the bounty of deals announced today might make an investment banker think of Monday, the day when mega-mergers are usually unveiled. A day like today, when the value of deals outpaced the average “merger Monday,” might be called “transaction Thursday.”A pair of big deals helped the day stand out. Pfizer announced a $17 billion deal to acquire Hospira, a maker of injectable drugs, and Rexam, the British aluminum can maker, said it was in talks to be acquired by Ball Corporation for about $8.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.By DAVID GELLES and KATIE THOMASIn its offer to buy Hospira, Pfizer is paying richly for what it believes will be a lucrative source of future revenue, drugs known as biosimilars.By CHAD BRAYThe bid by Ball values Rexam at about $6.5 billion and would combine two of the world’s largest makers of beverage cans, whose customers include giants like PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.A third big deal also was in the headlines today — the British telecommunications company BT said it had agreed to buy the mobile operator EE for $18.6 billion — but Thomson Reuters recorded that on an earlier date, when the two companies announced they were in talks.By MARK SCOTTThe former British telecom monopoly agreed on Thursday to buy EE, Britain’s largest cellphone network, from Orange of France and Deutsche Telekom of Germany.In total, according to the Thomson Reuters data, $25.7 billion of deals were recorded on Thursday.That is significantly above average for this day of the week. Since early 2011, an average of $9 billion of deals were announced on Thursday, the data shows.And it’s even above the average value of Monday deals since 2011, which is $17.5 billion, according to the data.In general, Monday beats Thursday by almost 2 to 1. Wall Street’s bankers are accustomed to using the weekend to put the finishing touches on deals before they are announced. An aggregate total of $3.7 trillion of deals have been announced on Monday since early 2011, compared with $1.9 trillion on Thursday.The biggest “transaction Thursday” since 2011 came on Feb. 13, 2014, when $75.2 billion of deals were announced, a level that would be impressive even on a Monday.On that day, Comcast announced a deal to buy Time Warner Cable for more than $45 billion in stock. That transaction has yet to close, and investors appear to be nervous about its prospects.
