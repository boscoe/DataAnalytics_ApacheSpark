That was slightly below economists’ expectations for a pace of 5.06 million units.“The still-tight mortgage credit conditions and more challenging first-time home buyer affordability that were revealed by the failure of home sales to continue recovering last year remain serious concerns as we head into 2015,” said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.First-time buyers made up 29 percent of transactions in December as well as for the year as a whole, well below the level needed to lift growth in the housing market.For all of 2014, sales of existing homes fell 3.1 percent, the first annual drop in four years. The housing market has struggled to maintain momentum since stagnating in the second half of 2013 after an increase in mortgage rates.At December’s sales pace, it would take around four months to clear all available houses from the market, down from about five months in November and the quickest since January 2013.However, a recent decline in mortgage rates, an easing of lending standards and the resurgent health of the American economy over the last few months have generated optimism that sales could strengthen this year.And the outlook for the economy remains upbeat. In a separate report, the Conference Board said its Leading Economic Index, a composite average of economic indicators, rose 0.5 percent last month after a 0.4 percent increase in November.December’s jump was driven by gains in most of the index’s components, suggesting the short-term outlook is getting brighter and the economy is continuing to build momentum, the Conference Board said.A third report showed that manufacturing continued to expand in early January, though at a slower pace than in December.The financial data firm Markit said its preliminary manufacturing purchasing managers index for the United States fell to 53.7 in January, matching the 2014 low last January when severe weather reduced economic activity.A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity. Factory employment increased for a 19th consecutive month, but new orders were the lowest in a year.“The slowdown is being led by a weakening inflow of new orders, but the good news is that demand remained strong enough to drive yet another month of robust job creation at factories,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London.Advertisement
