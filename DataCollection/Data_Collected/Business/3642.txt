GREEK BAILOUT TALKS COLLAPSE  |  European officials handed Athens an ultimatum on Monday: Agree by Friday to continue with a bailout program or risk the funding that the country needs to avoid a default, James Kanter and Liz Alderman write in The New York Times. The demand appeared to be part of a strategy by eurozone creditors to get Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to back away from their anti-austerity pledges. In exchange, eurozone officials said they would consider rolling back some of the austerity terms at a later date. The strategy appears to have backfired. Mr. Varoufakis said Athens viewed such promises as “nebulous,” and he accused Greece’s European partners of reneging on an earlier proposal that would have formed the basis of an accord. He said he was ready on Monday afternoon to sign a deal that was apparently put forward by Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. For their part, the Europeans continued to view the demands by Athens as intransigent. Earlier Monday, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, told German radio that he was “very skeptical” about the chances of a deal. In a New York Times Op-Ed article on Monday, Mr. Varoufakis took issue with commentary that suggested he was “devising bluffs, stratagems and outside options” to improve a weak hand. “I am convinced that we have one option only: to shun any temptation to treat this pivotal moment as an experiment in strategizing and, instead, to present honestly the facts concerning Greece’s social economy, table our proposals for regrowing Greece, explain why these are in Europe’s interest, and reveal the red lines beyond which logic and duty prevent us from going,” he added.The stalemate agitated markets on Tuesday. Stocks in Asia edged down slightly, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index down 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed up 0.24 percent after opening slightly lower. In Asia, the euro weakened by about 0.2 percent against the dollar in early trading before recovering to rise slightly. Markets in Europe were mixed, with Greek markets among the worst hit.

SHIFTING ROSTER AT WALL STREET TASK FORCE  |  Over the last year, eight prosecutors have departed an elite Wall Street task force at the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, most landing at big law firms, Ben Protess and Matthew Goldstein write in DealBook. And the current chief of the unit is now fielding interest from multiple firms, people briefed on the matter said. “All the job hopping has fed speculation about the future of a division that has become a crown jewel of the Justice Department and a central plank in the legacy of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan,” Mr. Protess and Mr. Goldstein add.
The departures, along with a recent appellate court ruling that reined in insider trading prosecutions, have raised the question of whether the unit has hit a wall, Mr. Protess and Mr. Goldstein write. But the answer is no, according to current and former prosecutors. The departures, they say, reflect the natural ebb and flow in the Justice Department’s roster. Across the legal world, lawyers are leaving public service for private law firms as the economy gathers steam and as demand for white-collar specialists grows from Wall Street firms and other companies facing government investigations. A crop of hungry young talent is filling the gap.
“The turnover coincides with the reality that the pipeline of insider trading cases has slowed and cases arising from the financial crisis are all but resolved. Few prominent securities trials are scheduled for early this year,” Mr. Protess and Mr. Goldstein write. Some prosecutors have suggested that the Wall Street unit, known as the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, is just as active but in less visible ways. For instance, the unit is quietly building investigations into money laundering on Wall Street, including one at Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest bank.



 LIBERTY GLOBAL AS PREY  |  Liberty Global, the international cable and wireless operator, has operations in more than a dozen countries and a market value topping $40 billion. But Michael T. Fries, the company’s chief executive, sees himself as an underdog taking on entrenched European telecommunications giants, DealBook’s David Gelles writes. This strategy has been so successful that after several acquisitions, Liberty Global itself is reported to be a takeover target.
“Any such deal would cost tens of billions of dollars and would reshape the global telecommunications landscape,” Mr. Gelles writes. It also would require the blessing of its chairman, John C. Malone, who controls the voting shares. Even with annual revenue of more than $20 billion and well-known international brands, Liberty Global has “largely flown under the radar in the eyes of consumers and analysts,” Mr. Gelles adds. “Its disparate brands prevent it from being viewed as a monolith, and it does not advertise itself in a united way as one European behemoth.”
But that may be about to change. Years of acquisitions have exponentially increased the company’s size and clout, and rumors that Vodafone was considering it a takeover target have intensified interest in the company. That deal may not happen, but analysts speculate that a larger company ‒ perhaps even Comcast or AT&T ‒ could make a play for Liberty Global in several years.

SECRECY OVER HOUSING CRISIS BAILOUT  |  The government is taking “extraordinary measures” to keep secret the deliberations surrounding a 2012 decision to expropriate all the earnings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants that succumbed to the 2008 financial crisis, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. What is it trying to hide? That is the question being asked by a Fannie and Freddie shareholder who has sued the government over the 2012 profit grab, Ms. Morgenson writes. The investor contends that the move amounted to an improper taking of its property. The government disagrees.
The lawsuit traces back to the taxpayer bailout during the crisis that amounted to $187.5 billion to shore up the companies. Initially, Fannie and Freddie had to pay interest on the loan. But in August 2012, the Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency changed the agreement and began sweeping all the companies’ profits into the Treasury. Since then, Fannie and Freddie have been immensely profitable. In response, one shareholder, the Fairholme Fund, sued the government in July 2013, contending that the sweep was unjust.  
From the outset, the government demanded extreme secrecy in the case. Lawyers at the Justice Department secured confidential treatment of almost all the 150,000 pages of documents submitted by the Treasury and F.H.F.A. by late January. Previously undisclosed court records show that the Justice Department has asserted presidential privilege to prevent 45 documents from being produced. These materials ‒ emails, draft memos and news releases ‒ were created by officials at the Treasury Department and the F.H.F.A., the overseer of Fannie and Freddie since their collapse.
