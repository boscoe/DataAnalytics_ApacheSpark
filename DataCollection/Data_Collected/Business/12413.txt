Other market operators with big options venues include the Chicago Board Options Exchange and BATS Global Markets.I.S.E.’s exchanges represent more than 15 percent of all trading in United States stock options, according to a statement by Nasdaq.Nasdaq will also acquire I.S.E.’s stake in the Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s biggest clearinghouse for equity derivatives, doubling its holdings to 40 percent.“The equities options business has been core to our long-term strategy, and we believe an essential component to the strength of the Nasdaq franchise,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said in a statement. “I believe this transaction advances our ambitions with all our stakeholders, including clients and shareholders.”Nasdaq has struck four acquisitions since the beginning of 2015, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, including those of the private-market operator SecondMarket and the news release publisher Marketwired.The transaction is expected to close by year-end.Advertisement
