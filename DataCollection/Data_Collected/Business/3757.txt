Still, it was the 12th consecutive profitable quarter for the government-controlled company. On Friday, Fannie also said that it would pay a dividend of $1.9 billion to the Treasury next month. Fannie will have paid $136.4 billion in dividends, exceeding the $116 billion it received from taxpayers during the financial crisis. Fannie Mae reported net income of $14.2 billion for all of 2014, down sharply from $84 billion in 2013. The decline in long-term interest rates last year brought losses on derivatives, used to hedge against rate swings. Fannie’s losses on derivatives reached about $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and around $4.8 billion in 2014. Fannie and Freddie Mac, which on Thursday posted net income of $227 million, together own or guarantee about half of all American. mortgages, worth about $5 trillion. Advertisement
