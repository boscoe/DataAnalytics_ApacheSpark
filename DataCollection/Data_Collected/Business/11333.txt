Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended Jan. 16, the highest reading since early July, the Labor Department said. It was the second straight week of gains. “The picture does not look great,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank. “Unemployment claims need to come back down in a hurry to make us sure that the jobs market has not lost its edge.” The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 6,500 to 285,000 last week, the highest since mid-April.
