That was a surprise after strong job gains in October. Consumer discretionary stocks including Netflix and Amazon slipped.Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management Research, said the confidence report was a surprise because consumers had a lot of reasons to feel good right now.

Higher oil prices mean increased fuel costs, and they also leave consumers with less money for travel. The sector was also battered by a global travel warning from the State Department and the drop in consumer confidence, which suggests that Americans might become nervous about spending money on vacations.The State Department advised travelers that groups including the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Boko Haram continue to plan terrorist attacks, and Americans should be particularly alert around the holidays. Helane Becker, an analyst for Cowen & Company, said bookings might slump after that warning, but any dip probably would not last long.“There’s usually a decline in bookings in the short term,” she said. “I suspect that people who have planned their vacations around the holidays will continue to go, but perhaps people who are booking will stay stateside or not go at all.”Priceline sank $24.14, or 1.9 percent, to $1,240.18 and a competitor, Expedia, shed $3.65, or 3.7 percent, to close at $121.27.
