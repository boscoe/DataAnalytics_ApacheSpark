SAN FRANCISCO — What briefly appeared to be a potential bidding war for Affymetrix, a genetics analysis technology maker, fizzled out on Monday after the company chose to stick with a takeover bid from Thermo Fisher Scientific over a higher bid from a Chinese-backed suitor.In a statement, Affymetrix reiterated its support for the $14-a-share offer from Thermo Fisher that it accepted in January.Hours later, Origin Technologies, a shell company financed by the Chinese private equity firm SummitView Capital, withdrew its offer of $17 a share.Last week, Affymetrix delayed a meeting on the Thermo Fisher transaction after Origin, a shell company run by executives of another genetics analysis company, raised its 11th-hour takeover bid to $17 a share, from $16.10 a share.AdvertisementIf Origin had won, its executives would have merged Affymetrix with their own company, Centrillion Technology Holdings.But after studying the new bid, Affymetrix said it still had concerns about Origin’s offer.In particular, Affymetrix said that it was worried about the ability of Origin’s financial backer, SummitView Capital, to finance the offer. Moreover, Affymetrix said that it was worried about any review of the transaction by a government panel that examines deals for national security issues.Ultimately, Affymetrix concluded that Thermo Fisher’s bid, while $3 a share lower, remained the superior proposal.“The board is firmly committed to maximizing value for our stockholders,” Frank Witney, Affymetrix’s chief executive, said in a statement.Thermo Fisher said in a statement on Monday that it was confident its deal would be approved by Affymetrix shareholders.AdvertisementThe president of Origin, Wei Zhou, said that he was disappointed about the decision. Origin also complained that it was asked, during discussions with Affymetrix, to place hundreds of millions of dollars in an American escrow account by Monday, a demand Origin deemed “unrealistic.”“We disagree with Affymetrix’s assessment of the perceived risks of our proposal,” Mr. Wei said in a statement. “It is an unfortunate outcome.”A vote on the Thermo Fisher bid is scheduled for Thursday.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
