General Motors has another ignition switch problem that can cause engines to stall, but one was discovered before anyone got hurt. The automaker is recalling 3,300 big pickup trucks and S.U.V.s mainly in North America to fix the ignitions, which can get stuck in the “start” position and slip into “accessory” if jostled. That causes engines to shut off and disables power steering, power brakes and possibly the airbags. The problem is similar to one in older G.M. small cars that cost the company billions of dollars and forced it to admit it knew of the trouble but did not recall the cars for a decade. This time, an employee who had the problem with his truck reported it through a program that rewards workers for reporting safety issues.A version of this brief appears in print on October 17, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: G.M. Recalls Trucks In New Ignition Switch Issue .  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
