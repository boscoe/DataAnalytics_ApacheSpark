Deutsche Wohnen said late on Wednesday that it had failed to reach that minimum level.“Given that the minimum acceptance threshold regarding the takeover offer for Conwert shares has not been reached, the offers for Conwert’s convertible bonds as well as the anticipatory mandatory offer for the relevant shares of ECO Business-Immobilien AG are no longer effective,” Deutsche Wohnen said in a news release.Deutsche Wohnen had offered €11.50 a share in cash for all the outstanding shares of Conwert. Shares of Conwert fell less than 1 percent to €11.41 in late-morning trading in Frankfurt on Thursday.As part of the transaction, Deutsche Wohnen intended to make a simultaneous offer for ECO Business-Immobilien, an office property manager that is 95.8 percent owned by Conwert. Deutsche Wohnen then planned to sell ECO after the Conwert transaction was finalized, because Deutsche Wohnen did not see it as a strategic fit.The bid to acquire Conwert failed despite support from two of the company’s largest shareholders, Haselsteiner Familien-Privatstiftung and the investor Karl Ehlerding. They had agreed to sell stakes that together represented about 25 percent of the company’s shares.Conwert’s management saw the failure of the deal “as a mandate from shareholders to continue to improve profitability and, as announced, to review the financing structure in order to start a significant reduction in interest costs,” the company said in a news release late on Wednesday.Conwert said that it expected further consolidation in the property sector in Germany and Austria.“The administrative board and executive directors will strive to achieve the best possible results for shareholders in the course of this consolidation process,” Conwert said.Deutsche Wohnen is focused primarily on managing and developing residential properties. At the end of 2014, the company managed 147,105 residential units and 2,063 commercial properties.Advertisement
