A new agreement between Greece and its lenders helped lift the stock market on Monday, extending the market’s winning streak to a third day. The deal for a new loan package is aimed at keeping the country in the euro, but many hurdles remain.Major indexes headed higher at the opening bell, following solid gains in Europe, then kept climbing throughout the afternoon. Nearly three stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, and every sector in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished with gains.Nine hours after a self-imposed deadline passed, European officials announced the breakthrough on Greece early Monday. The tentative agreement removed an immediate threat that the country would default on its debts. In exchange for a three-year loan program, the deal requires Greece’s Parliament to pass tax increases and other key demands from its lenders into law by Wednesday.“Our markets have reason to cheer,” said Tim Dreiling, senior portfolio manager at the U.S. Bank’s Private Client Reserve. “It’s a reprieve from worry for a few days at least.”
