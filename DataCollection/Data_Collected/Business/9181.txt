OSLO — Norway’s central bank reduced its main interest rate on Thursday for the second time in four months, sending its currency tumbling, and said it might lower rates more than previously anticipated in the coming year as growth prospects have weakened.Oil and natural gas companies, which generate a fifth of the Nordic economy’s output, have been canceling investments and laying off thousands of workers, preparing for an extended period of low crude oil prices.“The current outlook for the Norwegian economy suggests that the key policy rate may be reduced further in the coming year,” the governor of the bank, Oystein Olsen, said in a statement.“It is a new era for the Norwegian economy. We are no longer in a league of our own,” he said, adding that the bank did not discuss keeping rates at the same level.AdvertisementThe Norwegian krone tumbled 3 percent against the euro, after markets were surprised by the move.Only six of the 18 economists polled by Reuters had expected a rate cut. The other 12 had all seen the bank keeping its main rate at 1 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
