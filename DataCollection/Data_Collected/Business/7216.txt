The payroll processor ADP said that businesses added 237,000 jobs last month, compared with 203,000 in May. That is the most since December. The report buoys evidence that rising consumer spending and a healthy housing market are supporting more hiring. Americans have spent freely in recent months, and home sales are running at their best pace in eight years. Construction companies added 19,000 jobs last month, while retail, shipping and utility companies gained 50,000. On Thursday, the government will issue its official jobs report for June. Economists forecast that it will show that employers added 233,000 jobs. The ADP survey covers only private businesses, however, and frequently diverges from the official figures.A version of this brief appears in print on July 2, 2015, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: ADP Reports 237,000 Jobs Added by Businesses in June.
