Etihad — and its rivals, Qatar Airways and Dubai-based Emirates — are rapidly expanding, funneling mainly long-haul passengers and cargo through their growing Gulf hubs. Airlines in the United States have criticized the carriers, saying they were distorting the market by benefiting from unfair state subsidies — a charge the Gulf airlines denied. Etihad’s president and chief, James Hogan, described the opposition as an “unprecedented” challenge. Etihad’s revenue for the year increased to $7.6 billion from $6 billion in 2013. Advertisement
