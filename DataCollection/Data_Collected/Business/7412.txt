WASHINGTON —  Federal Reserve officials spent their most recent policy meeting, in June, preparing to raise interest rates later this year.Officials liked the look of recent economic data, including early signs that wages were starting to rise more quickly, according to an official account the Fed released on Wednesday after a standard delay.The meeting predated the collapse of negotiations between Greece and its creditors, and the continuing descent of the Chinese stock market, but its tone and more recent public remarks of Fed officials suggest that the central bank is still likely to raise rates this year unless the domestic economy is significantly disrupted by global events.John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, said on Wednesday in Los Angeles that he was just waiting to make sure the economy actually improves in line with the Fed’s expectations.Advertisement“While my forecast looks great, I am wary of acting before gathering more evidence that inflation’s trajectory is on the desired path,” he said.AdvertisementThe account did not address the exact timing of an initial interest rate increase. Some analysts said the description of the meeting suggested the Fed remained on course to raise rates as soon as September.“By September, Greece will either be a ward of the eurozone or out,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, referring to the group of nations that use the euro currency. “Either way, the dust will have settled and the Fed will focus on domestic data.“Growth will be stronger than they expect, unemployment will be lower and wage gains will be faster.”Fed officials have concluded that economic problems during the winter months were overstated, reflecting methodological problems in the government’s measuring sticks rather than an actual downturn.“Real activity in the first quarter was likely stronger than the then-current official estimate,” the Fed’s meeting account said.Mr. Williams said on Wednesday that his staff had calculated that the economy actually expanded by about 1.5 percent in the first quarter, compared to the most recent report by the Commerce Department, which estimated a slight decline in economic activity.The account also cited a “substantial” improvement in labor market conditions over the last year. In particular, it noted signs that increased demand for labor had “begun to result in a firming of wage increases.”AdvertisementThe pace of wage increases remains slow by historical standards. But officials have said that faster wage growth would offer an important indication that the labor market was finally returning to full health, and also that higher rates might be necessary to control inflation.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, was described as ready to act. Nonetheless, the minutes noted that he “expressed a willingness to wait another meeting or two for additional data before raising the target range.”Officials continue to predict that inflation will begin to pick up, rising back toward the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy.The internal debate about the timing of rate increases is focused in part on whether the Fed should start moving as inflation begins to pick up, or whether it should wait until inflation is rising more quickly.Officials also anticipated the possibility of new problems in Europe and China. “Many participants expressed concern that a failure of Greece and its official creditors to resolve their differences could result in disruptions in financial markets in the euro area, with possible spillover effects on the United States,” the account said.The International Monetary Fund has argued in a series of publications that the Fed should wait until next year to start raising interest rates. There is little evidence, however, that Fed officials are listening.“All in all, things are looking good,” Mr. Williams said in his speech Wednesday. “I can’t tell you the date of liftoff, but I can say that it’s going to be an interesting rest of the year for monetary policy.”AdvertisementFed policy makers continued at the June meeting to fine-tune their plans for the first rate increase in almost a decade.The committee agreed to release an “implementation note” alongside its normal policy statement, detailing the technical steps the Fed would take to raise its benchmark interest rate. That would allow the Fed to adjust those details at subsequent meetings without changing its stated goals.The Fed also said it would tweak the way that it calculates its benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, reporting the median rather than the average interest rate for loans between banks in the federal funds market. Volume in that market has diminished since the financial crisis. The change may reduce reported volatility.A version of this article appears in print on July 9, 2015, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Minutes of Meeting Show Fed Is Still Looking at Raising Interest Rates This Year.
