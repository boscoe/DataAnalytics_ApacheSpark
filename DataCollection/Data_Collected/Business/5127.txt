CreditKendrick Brinson for The New York Times        INDIO, Calif. —  As the gates to Coachella opened Friday and thousands of fans began to stream across the grass of the Empire Polo Club here, Paul Tollett, the impresario behind the music festival, was as calm as could be.His phone beeped constantly with last-minute crises — one performer, George Ezra, got laryngitis and canceled — yet Mr. Tollett, wearing sunglasses and a black Dodgers cap, stayed mellow during his one last loop around the venue before the fields filled up with nearly 100,000 revelers.“We were up late last night, of course,” Mr. Tollett said, “but it seems like everything’s in place.”The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival has just finished its first weekend, with AC/DC, Drake, Jack White and more than 160 other acts. It will return with an identical three-day lineup on Friday.AdvertisementNow in its 16th year, Coachella has firmly settled into the formula that has made it the nation’s premier pop festival: high-profile performances, celebrities galore and a constant on-the-ground fashion show — all with a backdrop of pastel-hued desert scenery that plays well on social media.AdvertisementLast year’s edition of Coachella sold $78.3 million in tickets, far more than any other festival, according to the trade publication Pollstar. Since it began, Coachella has presided over a vast shift in the concert industry that has pushed large, destination festivals — once a minority on the American scene — into the forefront. That has given Coachella a rare power in the music business to serve as the anchor for a world tour, a great place for an artist to build buzz or one where an act can reshape a career altogether.“It almost matters too much,” Flying Lotus, a producer and D.J. who has appeared at Coachella multiple times, said before his show Friday night. “This is one of those festivals where the whole world is watching.”With increased competition from Live Nation Entertainment and SFX Entertainment, each of which has dozens of festivals, Coachella’s dominance is now being challenged as never before. But, so far, it is holding strong: This year’s event has sold out once again, Mr. Tollett said.Coachella was once a long-shot. In its first incarnation in 1999, the festival lost about $800,000 and nearly bankrupted its promoter, Goldenvoice, of which Mr. Tollett is now chief executive. But since returning in 2001, it has steadily won over fans and the music industry through news-making moments like Daft Punk’s performance in a giant LED-lit pyramid in 2006, and a virtual Tupac Shakur in 2012, the same year the festival expanded to two weekends.“When they started out, people thought they were nuts, and then when they didn’t make money, they said, ‘I told you so,’ ” said Tom Windish, a leading independent booking agent whose firm, the Windish Agency, has 36 acts on the bill this year. “It wasn’t until many years later that they realized it’s a gold mine.”In 2007, Goldenvoice introduced Stagecoach, a country music festival held at the Empire Polo Club in late April, which helps amortize its production costs.Mr. Tollett, 49, is modest about Coachella’s success, describing it as a natural progression from his early days promoting punk shows in Southern California in the 1980s. Goldenvoice is now owned by AEG Live, the second-largest promoter in the world after Live Nation, and Mr. Tollett has a 50 percent ownership stake in Coachella, he said.Advertisement“You do a small show, the next one gets bigger,” Mr. Tollett said while walking the grounds early Friday. “It’s punk rock at first, then the next thing you know it’s alternative, then it’s a little electronic, and then the next thing you know you’ve got all these skills and a staff and a whole festival.”As he spoke, Mr. Tollett adjusted a garbage can with graffiti on one side and took a call about a refrigerator in the vendors’ area that seemed to be displaying unauthorized logos. He sent an employee to check it out.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

While a standard weekend ticket costs $375, V.I.P. access — which comes with a shaded lounge and special viewing areas — is $899. Among the super-perks on offer are a $225 gourmet dinner and a $7,000 air-conditioned “safari tent” for two.Mr. Tollett noted the importance of V.I.P. packages for raising revenue but said he took pains to make sure the event remained affordable.“We could add $100 to the ticket, and it would not affect the sales at all,” he said. When asked why he doesn’t do so, he said, “I don’t want it to be all richies.”Coachella has come to represent a kind of lifestyle brand as much as a music festival, with a look somewhere between thrift-store hippie and an Art Nouveau nature goddess. This year H&M, a longtime sponsor, introduced a fashion line meant to capture the aesthetic for customers everywhere. The festival grounds are also dotted with whimsical art pieces in iridescent colors like a giant, swaying caterpillar that by Sunday transformed into a butterfly.The combination of must-see performances and must-be-seen fashion and celebrity-spotting helps Coachella sell most of its tickets long in advance. Kendall Krieger, an 18-year-old from Chicago making her second visit, said that when she bought her ticket she did not know who the performers would be.“I would have come either way,” she said. “It’s just cool vibes here.”Coachella’s ability to sell tickets so quickly, and to all but guarantee its performers abundant media attention, gives it tremendous negotiating leverage with acts and their agents. In what has become an annual ritual, Coachella announces its lineup in early January; other festivals around the country then follow.Coachella has an advantage because it takes place early in the year, but Mr. Tollett acknowledged there were restrictions in the festival’s booking contracts preventing many of its biggest names from announcing their involvement with other festivals first. That has caused friction in the industry, but Mr. Tollett said it was done to preserve the surprise after what could be months or even years spent trying to lure a particular act to the stage.Advertisement“There are so many artists, thousands and thousands of them,” Mr. Tollett said. “I’m looking for around 150 that are somewhat fresh.”He added: “I have no gun to anyone’s head. But if a band calls and says, ‘We have all these other festivals we want to announce first,’ I say: ‘Let’s do you next year. I’m O.K. with that.’ ”Music executives say it may become harder for Coachella to preserve its power as other promoters build competing festival networks. Last year Live Nation bought C3 Presents, the company behind Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits, and SFX Entertainment has built up a portfolio of dozens of electronic dance events, a genre long crucial to Coachella’s success.In response, Goldenvoice and AEG have expanded their own portfolio with events like Firefly in Delaware, Hangout in Alabama and Bumbershoot in Seattle. But Mr. Tollett seemed unfazed by questions about competition.“A festival’s currency is its uniqueness,” he said, “so you have to do what you can.”As he finished his walk around the grounds, Mr. Tollett was stopped by a Goldenvoice employee on a bicycle, who had tracked down the refrigerator and confirmed that its brand logos were not allowed on the grounds. They would be covered up, he said.A version of this article appears in print on April 13, 2015, on Page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Coachella Festival Fends Off Rivals With Fresh Acts and Eye on Style.
