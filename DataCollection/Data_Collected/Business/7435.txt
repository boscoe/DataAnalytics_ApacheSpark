WASHINGTON —  The number of people seeking unemployment benefits rose last week to the highest level since late February, but the increase was probably more the result of temporary auto plant shutdowns than any underlying labor market weakness.The number of people filing applications for unemployment benefits rose by 15,000 to 297,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That is the highest weekly total since 327,000 applications were filed in the week of Feb. 28.Even with the recent increases, benefit applications, which are a proxy for layoffs, remain at levels that reflect a labor market that has been posting solid employment gains. The four-week average for claims, which smooths out some of the volatility, rose to 279,500, up slightly from 275,000 the previous week. It was the highest level for the four-week average since early May.One of the states posting a large jump was Michigan, home to many U.S. auto plants, which typically shutdown in the summer to retool for a new model year.

Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the jobless claims data would be distorted for a few weeks.Advertisement“We have no reason at all to think that the underlying trend in claims has changed and once the shutdowns are over we’d expect claims to revert to 280K or so,” he said in a research note. “In the meantime, anything can happen over the next couple of weeks.”AdvertisementThe number of people receiving benefits stood at 2.33 million for the week ending June 27, up from the previous week but 9.9 percent lower than a year ago.Other labor market indicators have not performed as well — a fact that the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Janet L. Yellen, often cites in explaining why the central bank has not yet begun raising interest rates.In June, wage growth stalled, with hourly wages up just 2 percent over the past 12 months. And the unemployment rate fell for the wrong reason: Many people out of work apparently got discouraged and gave up looking for a job.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
