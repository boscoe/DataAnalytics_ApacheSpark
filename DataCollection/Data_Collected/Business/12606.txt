The deal is the last that SoundCloud needs to legitimize itself with the major powers of the music industry, after similar arrangements with Warner Music, Universal and Merlin, a collective of independents.With these deals in place, SoundCloud — which offers more than 100 million songs free — is clear to offer its long-promised version for paid subscribers, and said in a statement that this version would be released “later this year.” Record companies favor paid platforms over free ones, which are typically supported by advertising, because they pay higher royalty rates.“This agreement creates a business framework for the use of Sony Music songs on the SoundCloud platform that meets the needs of our artists and labels and supports the growth of SoundCloud through its new premium on-demand music tier,” Dennis Kooker, Sony’s president of global digital business and United States sales, said in a statement.The deal will cover the licensing of Sony’s music around the world. It could mean that a free version of SoundCloud would have just a sampling of Sony’s music, while a majority of its music would be available on a paid version of the service.The new arrangement ends an acrimonious fight for SoundCloud. Last year, Sony removed the music of many of its artists from the platform, including Adele, Kelly Clarkson, Hozier and Kesha. But the move angered some of Sony’s artists, including Madeon, a French D.J. and producer, who wrote in a Twitter post that the label had removed his music “against my will.”SoundCloud, which went online in 2008, began as a “YouTube for music,” allowing artists and the creators of various other kinds of audio content, like podcasts, to easily post material and share it through social media. It was embraced by dance D.J.s and hip-hop musicians, and now says it has 175 million users each month.But as the site grew, it also became a target for the music industry, because SoundCloud’s music — including countless dance remixes and mash-ups — was unlicensed and therefore paid no royalties. It began running ads in 2014, and has since been signing up various labels for licensing deals.As the streaming business grows, others are starting to challenge SoundCloud’s advantage in the dance and hip-hop worlds. The site Mixcloud has emerged as a major competitor, and this week Apple Music struck a licensing deal with Dubset Media Holdings, a digital distributor, that should allow Apple to stream remixes and other songs.Advertisement
