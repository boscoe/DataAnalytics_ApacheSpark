It was the latest development in a constitutional crisis that began when the conservative nationalist Law and Justice party, winner of October’s parliamentary election, appointed five judges to the 15-member court. The appointments were labeled illegal by opposition leaders and set off major public protests. The amendment signed into law by President Andrzej Duda, a close ally of the party, requires the court to adopt most rulings by a two-thirds majority with at least 13 judges present. In the past as few as five judges could be assigned to and vote on any particular case. Advertisement
