AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters Canada, a major exporter of beef, said on Friday that it had found a case of mad cow disease in a beef cow in Alberta, the first in the country since 2011. A statement from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said that no part of the cow had reached the human food or animal feed systems and that exports should not be harmed. Mad cow is formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a progressive, fatal neurological disease. The agency said it was seeking to confirm the age of the animal, its history and how it became infected. “The investigation will focus in on the feed supplied to this animal during the first year of its life,” agency said. Canadian exports were badly hit in 2003 after the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy was found on a farm. Canada subsequently tightened its controls and many nations have since resumed the beef trade with Canada. Advertisement
