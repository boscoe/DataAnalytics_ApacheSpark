It honors Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes by Allied tribunals after World War II, along with millions of common soldiers and sailors killed in that conflict and others since the 19th century.Television news showed fire trucks and police vehicles gathered near the shrine’s southern gate, and bomb squad members donning protective gear.The authorities received an emergency call around 10 a.m. from a visitor reporting a loud bang and smoke emanating from the men’s side of a public restroom just inside the gate, the news media reported. Several outlets said batteries and a pipe, possibly from a pipe bomb, were found inside.The shrine has been the target of violent attacks before, though they have been small in scale. In 2013, the Foreign Ministry petitioned the South Korean government to extradite a Chinese citizen suspected of having set fire to part of the shrine two years earlier, before fleeing to South Korea. A South Korean court rejected the request.Last year, an unemployed 25-year-old man arrested at the shrine on suspicion of arson told the police that he was trying to commit suicide, in what appeared to be a misguided effort to be included among the shrine’s honorees, newspapers reported at the time.Monday was a national holiday in Japan, and the explosion occurred just after a ceremony in which newly harvested rice was presented to the spirits of the dead. Some families had also taken their children to the shrine for ceremonial blessings. After the explosion, the shrine closed its main hall to visitors and turned away families seeking the blessings, the news media reported.OpinionHoward W. FrenchAdvertisement
