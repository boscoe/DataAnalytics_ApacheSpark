The decision, exempting the doctors from a blanket ban in force for 15 years, is the latest in a series of recent steps to relax constraints on Palestinians entering Israel.The Israeli authorities have been easing some restrictions as a way of improving conditions for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, even as relations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders remain charged.An Israeli spokesman estimated that as many as 100 doctors would be allowed to drive their cars, bearing Palestinian license plates, to their workplaces, but not anywhere else. The doctors make up a small fraction of the 55,000 Palestinians who have permits to work in Israel.After the second Intifada uprising began in 2000, Israel banned all Palestinian vehicles from leaving the West Bank, one of a number of measures intended to keep militants and suicide bombers from reaching Israeli communities. The uprising mostly faded away a decade ago.In recent weeks, the Israeli military has begun allowing West Bank men over the age of 55 and women over 50 to pass through checkpoints simply by presenting their identity cards. The minimum age for a work permit has also been lowered, to 22 from 24.The decision announced on Tuesday comes amid a dispute over some $100 million in monthly tax revenue that Israel collects on behalf of Palestinians, but has been withholding since January as punishment for the Palestinians’ joining the International Criminal Court.Israeli officials said in late March that they would hand over the withheld money, but the transfer has been delayed as Palestinian and Israeli officials argue about what amounts should be deducted for unpaid utility bills.Advertisement
