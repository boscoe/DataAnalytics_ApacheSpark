Mélanie Joly, the minister of Canadian heritage, also announced that a national competition would be held to pick a design to replace the current plan, which includes concrete structures dotted with pixels that, in renderings, form an image of a mass grave. Many architects, Ottawa’s mayor and the chief justice of the Supreme Court were among the opponents of the original plan. The design and site were selected largely without public review. The new government said that it would provide only a fraction of the money promised by the Conservatives for the project. Advertisement
