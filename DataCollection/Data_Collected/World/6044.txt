Indonesian officials said Friday that search and rescue teams had detected pinging from the black box recorders of AirAsia Flight 8501, which crashed into the Java Sea on Dec. 28 with 162 people aboard. Tatang Zainuddin, deputy chief of operations for the National Search and Rescue Agency, said a research ship from Indonesia’s Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology had picked up pinging from the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders on Thursday afternoon. He said that the Sampson, an American Navy destroyer, had also detected the pinging. He said the authorities had not yet determined the exact coordinates of the black boxes. The bodies of 45 victims had been reovered as of Thursday.A version of this brief appears in print on January 9, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Indonesia: Teams Detect Pings at AirAsia Site.
