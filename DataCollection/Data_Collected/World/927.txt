IRNA, the state news agency, reported a scuffle between two lawmakers — Hamid Rasaei, a hard-liner, and Nader Qazipour, who supported the deal — that prompted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif to leave the building.Other hard-line representatives were seen crying after the approval of the agreement, which passed with 161 votes in favor, 59 against and 13 abstentions, IRNA reported.The next steps call for Iran to curtail its nuclear program, prepare for a more rigid inspection system and answer outstanding questions to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iranian officials say this process will take two and a half months.A short overview of highlights from the Iran nuclear pact.On Monday, the deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said that international sanctions would be removed as soon as Iran fulfilled its duties, the news agency Tasnim reported.Hard-line representatives said in the Iranian news media that they spoke for Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that they had been denied the right to make amendments to the legislation.IRNA reported that members of Parliament had prepared about 100 amendments, but that only one had been debated and passed.One hard-line lawmaker, Mehdi Kouchakzadeh, held up a poster accusing the head of Parliament, Ali Larijani, of arranging the vote in advance in cooperation with Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council.The decision not to allow the representatives to discuss amendments was made without consulting the supreme leader, Mr. Kouchakzadeh told the semiofficial Fars news agency.Ayatollah Khamenei ordered Parliament last month to vote on the agreement, raising fears that the debate would provide a platform for hard-line opponents of the pact.The deal is supported by President Hassan Rouhani, who will appear in a live television interview on Tuesday night, IRNA reported. A spokesman said the appearance would cover foreign policy, the economy and culture.Advertisement
