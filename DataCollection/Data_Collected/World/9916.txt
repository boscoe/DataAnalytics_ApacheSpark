The judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, gave the Defense Department 60 days to appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in 2004 seeking the release of the photos. Judge Hellerstein ruled last August that the government had failed to show how the photos would endanger American soldiers, but allowed it to submit more evidence. He said Friday that the additional evidence had failed to change his decision. Advertisement
