No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. The extremist group Boko Haram, which is waging an insurgency to establish an Islamist state, mainly operates in the three northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, but its fighters frequently set off bombs in other states. It was the second attack in two days in Gombe. Advertisement
