The case has highlighted growing tensions in France between the country’s commitment to free speech and the desire to prevent hate crimes.Mr. M’bala M’bala’s brand of comedy has been widely condemned, while at the same time gaining support from some French Muslims, disgruntled youth and members of the far right. He lamented in 2013 that a prominent Jewish journalist had not died in “the gas chambers.”All the while, Mr. M’bala M’bala has argued that his dark humor is not anti-Semitic but rather aimed squarely at the French establishment.The Strasbourg court disagreed, and it said in its decision that the offending scene could not be construed as entertainment and that it instead resembled a political meeting that, under the pretext of comedy, promoted Holocaust denial.The performance, even if satirical or provocative, the court found, was not protected under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, on the right to freedom of expression. “Disguised as an artistic production,” the court said, the performance “was in fact as dangerous as a head-on and sudden attack.”Mr. M’bala M’bala’s defenders argue that he is being subjected to a double standard and that the hate-speech laws have not been employed to prevent insults against Islam. They point, for example, to caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that were published in the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which was targeted in terrorist attacks in France in January.Advertisement
