Bahrain says Iran is trying to foment unrest among its majority Shiite population, a charge Iran denies. Ahmed al-Hammadi, a public prosecutor, said in a statement on BNA that two defendants were present at the sentencing and that the rest were tried in absentia. The statement said the five communicated with members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps with the aim of carrying out attacks on banks and public buildings. On Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said it had arrested 47 members of a group it said had ties to “terror elements in Iran” and was also plotting attacks. Advertisement
