HONG KONG —  The captain of a ferry that collided with another passenger vessel in 2012, leaving 39 people dead in Hong Kong’s worst maritime accident in decades, was found guilty of manslaughter on Saturday.Lai Sai-ming, captain of the Sea Smooth, a passenger ferry, was convicted of 39 counts of manslaughter by a Hong Kong jury. Chow Chi-wai, the captain of the other boat involved in the collision, was acquitted of manslaughter but convicted of the lesser charge of endangering the safety of others at sea, The South China Morning Post reported.The vessel captained by Mr. Chow, the Lamma IV, a passenger boat owned by an electric company, sank quickly after being struck by the Sea Smooth, a scheduled ferry, on the night of Oct. 1, 2012, China’s National Day holiday. The Lamma IV had been shuttling employees of the electric company and their family members from Lamma, an outlying island where the company operates a power station, to Hong Kong’s Central district to watch a holiday fireworks show. All 39 people who died were aboard the Lamma IV.The collision, which took place just off the coast of Lamma, was the deadliest maritime disaster in Hong Kong since 1971.During the trial, Mr. Chow and his lawyers argued that they had followed international conventions for avoiding collisions at sea by turning to starboard, or to the right. That action was ineffective, his lawyers argued, because Mr. Lai, in contravention of the rules, had turned to port, or left, The Post reported. The Sea Smooth struck the port side of the Lamma IV, puncturing its watertight compartments.The manslaughter charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, The Post reported.A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Ferry Captain Is Convicted in Hong Kong.
