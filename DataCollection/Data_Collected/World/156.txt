At least 25 people died and as many as 600 people were missing after a huge mudslide in Guatemala buried dozens of houses in a town near Guatemala City, the capital, the authorities said Friday. Heavy rains unleashed a torrent of boulders and mud on Thursday night in Santa Catarina Pinula, which is just a few miles outside the capital, a spokesman for the country’s disaster agency said. At least 25 people were injured, the official said. Emergency personnel and soldiers dug through rubble on Friday looking for survivors, while the authorities set up a shelter to help about 50 people who lost their homes in the disaster, one of the worst in recent memory in Guatemala.A version of this brief appears in print on October 3, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Latin America; Guatemala: Hundreds Are Missing After Mudslide.
