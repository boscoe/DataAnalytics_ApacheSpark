He did not elaborate on what the exact legal status would be.Turkey’s government has long refused to officially recognize Alevi houses of worship, arguing that Alevism, which is rooted in Shiite beliefs, is a branch of Islam and not a separate religion.“There is a single house of worship in Islam — the mosque,” Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then the prime minister, said in a speech in 2012. Cemevis, he said, were cultural houses.The Alevi minority, which is the second-largest religious community in Turkey, after Sunni Muslims, have long sought legal status for their cemevis and have requested the tax-exempt status granted other places of worship in Turkey.In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Turkey’s failure to exempt the cemevis from paying utility bills was a violation of the articles on discrimination in the European Convention on Human Rights.Mr. Davutoglu also called for the opposition to support a new Constitution to replace the current one, a product of a military coup. “In its place, let us together compile a modern, democratic, liberal constitution, which all would be proud of,” he said.Advertisement
