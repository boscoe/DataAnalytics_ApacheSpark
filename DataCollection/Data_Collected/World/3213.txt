SHANGHAI —  The sister ship of an American guided missile destroyer that sailed last month in waters claimed by China is in Shanghai for a weeklong port visit, in a sign that although the United States strongly disagrees with actions by China in the South China Sea, their two navies still value good relations.The commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, Adm. Scott H. Swift, had flown to Shanghai on Monday to be on board the visiting ship, the Stethem, when it arrived.He said he was invited to China a month ago — relatively short notice for such a high-level visit — by a Chinese vice admiral, Su Zhiqian. Their meeting on board the Stethem on Tuesday stretched from a scheduled 30 minutes to two hours, Admiral Swift said.“We acknowledged the policy differences between our two countries, but we have a responsibility as maritime commanders that friction points in policy don’t become friction points at sea,” the admiral said in an interview with reporters on the Stethem.AdvertisementAdmiral Swift assumed the command of the Pacific Fleet in May, and this is his first visit to China.“As you would expect in any deepening relationship, you would focus on those areas that you have in competition: It’s the same in my relations with my wife,” he said. “I would love it if our whole relationship was built on those areas where we are completely in agreement and collaborative on.”Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We have maintained great restraint with the aim to preserve peace and stability in the South China Sea.”Admiral Swift said his conversation with Vice Admiral Su concentrated on maritime matters, not policy.
                China has been feverishly piling sand onto reefs in the South China Sea for the past year, creating seven new islets in the region. It is straining geopolitical tensions that were already taut.            He said the vice admiral did not bring up whether China would introduce an air defense zone over the South China Sea, as it did over the East China Sea in 2013.AdvertisementCountries use such zones to deflect civilian aircraft from other nations for security reasons.And Admiral Swift said he did not tell Vice Admiral Su if there would be more freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea.The arrival of the Stethem is part of an annual roster of ship visits negotiated between the United States and China for vessels to dock at each other’s ports. Three American Navy ships have visited China this year, and Chinese ships have visited Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and San Diego recently, a United States Navy spokesman said.“Ship visits are part of the annual U.S.-China military-to-military plan negotiated at the government level,” said the spokesman, Cmdr. Clayton Doss.“Parity and reciprocity are the guiding principles, and like port visits anywhere, these provide opportunities for sailors to interact with their P.L.A. Navy counterparts,” he said, using the initials of the People’s Liberation Army.As the Stethem docked at the Wusong military port in northern Shanghai on Monday, Chinese sailors held a banner welcoming it in Chinese and English. That the ship was berthed at a military facility was a first, Admiral Swift said.In the past, American naval vessels have docked at Chinese commercial ports.A Chinese frigate, the Xuzhou, guided the Stethem as it made its way up the channel to the dock.The crew of the Stethem will conduct drills and search and rescue operations with their Chinese counterparts. Plans also call for teams from both sides to play basketball.Admiral Swift, the second most powerful United States Navy officer in the Pacific, is scheduled to travel to Beijing on Wednesday for a meeting with Adm. Wu Shengli, the commander of the Chinese Navy.AdvertisementAdmiral Swift’s tone on Tuesday was much more subdued than it was during a visit he made to Australia last month, when in an indirect but firm reference to China, he said: “Some nations view freedom of the seas as up for grabs, as something that can be taken down and redefined by domestic law or by reinterpreting international law.”On Tuesday, the admiral discussed the social rapport between the Americans and the Chinese. When he walked into a reception for the American visitors hosted by the Chinese on Monday night, sailors from each side were mixing with one another rather than standing on opposite sides of the room.“I thought that was a positive development, especially in light of the Lassen,” Admiral Swift said.Yufan Huang contributed research.A version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Navy Ship, Bearing a Message of Good Will Despite Tensions, Docks in China.
