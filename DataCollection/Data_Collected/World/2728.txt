CAIRO — The Egyptian military on Tuesday released the journalist Hossam Bahgat, hours before planned demonstrations in Cairo, London and other cities to call for his freedom.Mr. Bahgat, 36, founded a highly respected human rights advocacy group, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, in 2002. Over the last two years, he has become a leading investigative journalist in Egypt, writing in English and Arabic for the online news organization Mada Masr.Egyptian military intelligence had summoned him on Sunday morning for interrogation about a recent report he had published describing criminal convictions against 26 military officers for plotting a coup. He had been detained since then and was under investigation by a military prosecutor on charges of publishing false news harmful to national security, a crime that under Egyptian law can be punished with a jail sentence.It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Bahgat could still face those charges after his release, friends of his said on Tuesday. His friends said that he had called one of them after being released from a military intelligence building unexpectedly, and that he was taking a taxi to meet them.A version of this article appears in print on November 11, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Middle East; Egypt: Military Releases Journalist.
