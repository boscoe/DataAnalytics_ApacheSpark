Mr. Sorochenko told reporters that the wide dispersion meant that the plane disintegrated before the pieces fell to earth.Russia said that a bomb brought down the jet.The head of the Federal Security Service, Alexander Bortnikov, said “an improvised explosive device” had detonated soon after the plane took off.“The plane disintegrated in midair, which explains the widely scattered fuselage pieces,” Mr. Bortnikov said, according to the Interfax news agency.Experts have focused on the idea that a bomb brought down the plane ever since it went down on Oct. 31. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL,  claimed responsibility for the attack within hours, although it did not provide any proof.The announcement from the Kremlin was the first, clearly definitive statement from the Russia that the plane was brought down by a terrorist act, although leaders had been moving in that direction.By Karen Zraick, Karen Yourish, Tim Wallace, Joe Burgess and Larry BuchananAdvertisement
