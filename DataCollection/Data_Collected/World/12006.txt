His announcement on Saturday that he would run for another term in June set off the unrest among critics who say he is breaking the Constitution and a peace deal that ended a civil war 10 years ago. Both limit the president to two five-year terms. The president’s spokesman called the protests an “insurrection.” The presidency said three people were killed and 15 police officers were hurt during clashes in Bujumbura, the capital, on Sunday.
