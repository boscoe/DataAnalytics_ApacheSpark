China claims self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve unification.Taiwan’s president, Ma Ying-jeou, who led the Kuomintang until last year, has pushed for closer trade ties with China during his two terms. But that effort has set off protests in Taiwan and contributed to a sharp defeat for his party in local elections in November.In 2005, Lien Chan, then the chairman of the Kuomintang, traveled to China to meet the Communist Party’s general secretary at the time, President Hu Jintao, the first such meeting between the two parties’ leaders since 1945. Such meetings have been held occasionally in subsequent years, but leaders of the two parties have not met since 2009.Advertisement
