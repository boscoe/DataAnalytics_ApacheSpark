Hwang Boo-gi, a vice minister of unification, led the South Korean delegation that crossed the border on Friday morning.“There are many issues to discuss between the South and North,” Mr. Hwang told reporters before leaving. “We will do our best to tackle one issue at a time.”Formally, the Koreas have been in a state of war for more than 60 years, the Korean War having ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. They seemed headed toward an armed clash as recently as August, after the South accused the North of planting land mines that maimed two of its border guards, which the North denied.In October, both sides revived a program of reuniting family members separated since the Korean War.
