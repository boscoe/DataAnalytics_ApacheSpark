A 14-year-old British boy has been charged with encouraging and inciting terrorist attacks in Australia, Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service said Thursday. The British police said the boy was arrested on April 2 after counterterrorism officers examined “a number of electronic devices” that revealed communication with a man in Australia. That set off an operation that culminated last week in the arrest of five teenagers in Australia who were accused of planning a terrorist attack. The boy will face two charges of inciting terrorism overseas.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
