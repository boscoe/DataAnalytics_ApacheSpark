The letter by veterans of the clandestine Unit 8200 claimed that its work harmed innocent people, amounted to “political persecution,” and made it more difficult to resolve the underlying conflict. The military said that the refusal violated its “standards and morals,” and questioned why the complaint was aired publicly rather than through the chain of command. The military “views with great severity any attempt to elude mandatory military service especially when the act is intended to make a political statement,” its statement said. A leader of the reservists’ group, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the military prohibits members of 8200 from being identified publicly, said “the army is trying to make the issues that we were trying to raise go away by making us go away.” Advertisement
