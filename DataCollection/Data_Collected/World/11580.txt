Pakistan’s Maritime Security Agency also seized eight boats belonging to the fishermen, who it said had strayed into Pakistani waters. The fishermen were handed over to the police in the port city of Karachi. Such arrests are frequently carried out by both countries; the maritime border in the Arabian Sea is poorly defined and many fishing boats lack the technology needed to be certain of their precise location. The fishermen often languish in jail because the poor diplomatic relationship between Pakistan and India makes it difficult to resolve the cases. Pakistan released 172 Indian fishermen in February as “a good-will gesture” but arrested 45 others last month. Advertisement
