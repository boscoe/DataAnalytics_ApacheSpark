The police said he appeared to have been hit by police fire during the attack.The Israeli who was fatally stabbed was not immediately identified, but an official at the hospital where he died said he was a 45-year-old father of seven.The police said the assailants were residents of the Qalandia refugee camp, between Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah.The stabbing took place outside the Jaffa Gate, an entrance to the Old City near the line where the predominantly Palestinian area of East Jerusalem meets the predominantly Jewish western part of the city.The walled Old City contains some of the most significant Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites and is a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims, particularly during the Christmas period. It has also been a focus of recent tensions and violence. The recent surge of attacks was initially fueled, at least in part, by a dispute over Al Aqsa Mosque compound, a contested holy site revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount.Palestinians using knives, guns and vehicles as weapons have killed 19 Israelis, an American student and a Palestinian resident of the West Bank in scores of attacks in Jerusalem, the West Bank and in cities around Israel since Oct. 1. About 130 Palestinians have been killed during the same period, according to Palestinian officials, up to two-thirds of them while carrying out, trying to carry out or, according to the police, intending to carry out attacks. Others were killed in violent clashes with Israeli forces in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.Nevertheless, Israel’s Ministry of Tourism said it was expecting tens of thousands of people to visit the region during the Christmas period.Last week, a Palestinian man rammed a car into a crowd of Israelis at a Jerusalem bus stop, injuring several, including an 18-month-old child.Palestinian officials and human rights groups have accused the Israeli police and security forces of using excessive force against Palestinian assailants, of being too quick to shoot and in some cases of killing them even after they no longer posed a threat.In October, an Eritrean asylum seeker was shot by an Israeli security guard — who apparently mistook him for a Palestinian assailant during a gun attack at a bus station in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. The Eritrean was then beaten by a mob and died of his injuries.The internal police investigations department of the Israeli Justice Ministry questioned an officer this month about reports and video footage indicating that he had shot and wounded a 16-year-old Palestinian girl wielding a pair of scissors on a main Jerusalem street after she was already on the ground.The circumstances in which the civilian was hit by police fire during the attack on Wednesday were not immediately clear, and the police said there would be an investigation. But the Jerusalem district police chief praised the border police officers who responded to the attack, saying that their rapid action prevented the stabbing of additional passers-by.Advertisement
