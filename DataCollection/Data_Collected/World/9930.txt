Most of the evidence against the men, Chiheb Esseghaier, a Tunisian graduate student in Montreal, and Raed Jaser, a stateless Palestinian with previous criminal convictions, were recordings secretly made by an F.B.I. agent who posed as a wealthy American businessman who held radical political and religious views. The two men are to be sentenced next month. Advertisement
