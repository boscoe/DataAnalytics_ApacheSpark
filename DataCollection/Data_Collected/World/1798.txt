The party got 235 seats in the 460-seat lower house and 61 of 100 seats in the Senate — the strongest position any single party has ever had in post-Communist Poland. The party supports increasing state intervention in the economy to help families and the poor and has criticized the current governing party, Civic Platform, for agreeing to accept about 7,000 migrants as part of a European Union resettlement plan. Law and Justice has vowed to place higher taxes on large, foreign-owned corporations and banks to pay for benefits like free medications for people over 75 and a reversal of a higher retirement age. The departing government had increased the retirement age to 67; Law and Justice has said it will restore it to 60 for women and 65 for men. Advertisement
