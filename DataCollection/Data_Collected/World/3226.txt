The Cunard White Star liner Samaria, her gray hull and super-structure melting into the gray sea, was two days out of Liverpool, without escort, on Nov. 10 when the rhythmic sound of plane motors far off brought her passengers racing to their lifeboat stations, their lifebelts adjusted, eyes fixated on the approaching specks. The next day the passengers learned from the ship’s officers that German bombers had attacked another ship, twenty minutes’ flying time from the Samaria, and had been driven off. The other ship was not identified. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 20, 1940
