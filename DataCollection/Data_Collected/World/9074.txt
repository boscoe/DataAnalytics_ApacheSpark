PESHAWAR, Pakistan —  Education officials in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province have renamed more than a hundred schools in honor of the children killed last year in a Taliban attack on an army-run public school in Peshawar, the provincial capital.In an official notification, the Directorate of Elementary and Secondary Education announced late Thursday that 107 schools had been renamed for students of the Army Public School. The official death toll from the Dec. 16 massacre at the school now stands at 152, among them 136 students, including two who recently died of their wounds, a district official in Peshawar said.“This is momentous,” said Muhammad Tufail, whose 15-year-old son, Sher Shah, was among those killed. A school in his native village has been renamed in honor of Sher.“Naming an educational institution after the victims will help their memory live on,” Mr. Tufail said. “This is a befitting tribute to the great sacrifice these students have made for the nation and the children’s right to education.”Pakistan’s federal government has already announced that the country’s highest civil award will be conferred posthumously on the victims of the massacre.A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Pakistan Honors Victims of a Massacre.
