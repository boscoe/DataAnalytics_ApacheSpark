An update on the fighting in South Vietnam in 1965. British Pathé.HONG KONG — North Vietnam is severely strained by the simultaneous effort of fighting the war in South Vietnam and coping with American bombing of the North. Washington and Hanoi are presently engaged, among other things, in matching resources in their efforts to prevent the other’s victory in South Vietnam. North Vietnam is closed to almost all impartial observers. But scholars and political analysts in Hong Kong keep a constant watch on developments there. These observers can confidently draw broad pictures which have, in the past, proved substantially accurate. North Vietnam is hurting on a number of fronts. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 1, 1965
