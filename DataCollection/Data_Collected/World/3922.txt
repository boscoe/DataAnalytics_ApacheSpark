A security drill at a Nairobi university on Monday was mistaken for a terrorist attack, leading to the death of a staff member and injuries to 37 people. As the police carried out the training exercise at Strathmore University, many students and staff members believed they had to flee for their lives, with some people jumping from tall buildings, said the university’s communications director, Betty Ngala. Video images showed terrified students and staff members standing on window ledges. An unidentified staff member was killed, and about 15 people were taken to hospitals for treatment. Most of them sustained broken bones after “jumping from high floors,” Ms. Ngala said. An additional 22 people were treated for less severe injuries at the scene. Students said they had been startled by what they thought was gunfire, which led them to rush to escape. The exercise, the university said in a statement, was intended to test “the preparedness of the university community and emergency team in the event of an attack.” The statement added, “Unfortunately some students and staff panicked.”A version of this brief appears in print on December 1, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Kenya: One Dies and Dozens Are Hurt as Campus Drill Is Mistaken for Attack.
