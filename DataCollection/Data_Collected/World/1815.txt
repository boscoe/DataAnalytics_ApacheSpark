LONDON —  Unelected, overcrowded and with an age profile similar to many retirement homes, Britain’s House of Lords nevertheless has a gift for surviving, and recently shrugged off the resignation of one senior member who was caught snorting cocaine with a prostitute.But the chamber may now be facing an altogether bigger challenge to its power, after confronting Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative government this week and derailing planned budget cuts that opponents say unfairly target the poor.On Tuesday, Mr. Cameron’s office announced a review of the powers of the House of Lords, to try to ensure that there is no repeat of two votes on Monday when the chamber voted to delay the social welfare reductions. Although the Conservatives hold an outright majority in the House of Commons, they do not in the House of Lords and can be outvoted if the opposition Labour Party and the center-left Liberal Democrats join forces there.That act of rebellion has left George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, with a political headache and a hole of up to 4.4 billion pounds (about $6.7 billion) in his plan to balance the country’s budget.AdvertisementBut the dispute has also revived a national debate about the role of the House of Lords, which has survived a century of debate over its purpose, while becoming the largest legislative assembly in the world outside China, with 816 voting members.Advertisement“Personally I think the House of Lords is a basket-case institution,” said Patrick Dunleavy, professor of politics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who joked that “a great hall of the people” might soon be needed to accommodate the members, who cannot all be seated in the gilded, ornate chamber.“But it does have occasional relevance,” he added, “and Monday night was one of those rare moments.”That is not the view of Mr. Cameron’s ministers, who believe that the Lords, known as peers, overstepped a constitutional boundary, by breaking an unwritten rule under which the second chamber does not reject any financial measures already approved by elected lawmakers.By contrast, Professor Dunleavy said he agreed with senior peers who cited technical reasons to justify Monday’s vote, namely that the welfare cuts were proposed not by an act of legislation, but by a regulation.This type of standoff has occurred periodically since the House of Lords accepted junior status in Parliament to elected lawmakers in the House of Commons more than a century ago.Over the decades several governments have promised to turn the House of Lords into an elected chamber, though none have followed through.The chancellor of the Exchequer told the House of Lords in Britain on Tuesday that he would continue his reform efforts after the chamber blocked part of his budget plan.Changes have been made, including limits on the role of hereditary peers whose right to legislate derives from their genes. At one point the numbers were declining and even its critics acknowledge that the House of Lords does much solid work, revising legislation and compiling committee reports.AdvertisementAt the same time it is an old legislature in every sense. A report by the Electoral Reform Society earlier this year (and before the last addition of numbers in September) said that more than half of its members were 70 or older, and that just two were younger than 39.Then there was the resignation of Lord Sewel, who was the chairman of a Lords committee responsible for upholding standards among members. He relinquished his job when the newspaper The Sun on Sunday accused him of snorting cocaine off the breasts of a prostitute, and released a video that showed him consuming a white powder.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And they get a public platform and an opportunity to shape laws, without the bother of having to fight an election.Yet the system is now under acute pressure because the makeup of the House of Lords is badly out of kilter with that of the elected House of Commons. Although the Conservatives won May’s general elections, they do not have a majority in the House of Lords.Labour, which was in power from 1997 to 2010, and able to nominate many lords in that era, has 214 members of the House of Lords. The Conservative government has 249. The centrist Liberal Democrats have 112 members. By contrast, there are only eight Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons.Mr. Cameron could nominate dozens more members to give himself a clear majority — but a further expansion of a bloated legislature is unlikely to prove popular with the public.And experts doubt that a review of the power of the Lords would provide any easy answers to a problem that generations of British politicians have examined, and then decided to duck.Advertisement“My prediction,” Professor Dunleavy said, “is that the review of the powers of the House of Lords will be launched, and will gradually peter out with some obscure rule changes no one cares about.”Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
