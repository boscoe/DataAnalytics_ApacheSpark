ISTANBUL — The Turkish police arrested an armed man on Thursday after he tried to attack a palace complex near the prime minister’s office in Istanbul.The man, who is suspected of being a member of a terrorist organization, threw two homemade grenades at police officers in front of the Dolmabahce Palace. When the bombs failed to detonate, he tried to shoot at the officers with a gun, the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency reported. No injuries have been reported.Dolmabahce Palace was once the residence of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.It was not immediately clear whether Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was in his office at the time of the attempted attack.Istanbul’s police chief, Selami Altinok, told reporters that the assailant was a former convict and a suspected terrorist, who was imprisoned from 2003 to 2006. He did not disclose the charges against the man or reveal his identity because an investigation was still underway.“Two hand grenades that he hurled against the police on duty did not explode,” Mr. Altinok said. “He was quickly overpowered.”The man was found to be carrying an automatic weapon and a pistol, but security forces in the area quickly mobilized and seized the weapons, local news media reported.A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Turkey: Police Arrest Armed Man After Attack Near the Premier’s Office.
