UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations has decided to appoint an independent panel to look into the killing of one of its peacekeepers last week on the restive Israel-Lebanon border, the organization’s top official for peacekeeping operations, Hervé Ladsous, said Wednesday.The peacekeeper, a soldier from Spain, was killed amid fighting between Hezbollah militants and Israeli forces last Wednesday. Spain last week said Israeli artillery was responsible for the soldier’s death, and a senior United Nations official offered the same explanation at a private meeting of the Security Council, diplomats said.The board of inquiry is to establish the sequence of events and who is to blame — and potentially demand financial compensation. The United Nations has the discretion to appoint such a panel, comprising independent experts, when its own personnel or property are damaged.“This has become standard practice in these types of incidents and we trust that the board, which is in the process of being constituted, will complete its work in a timely and efficient manner and in full consultation with all parties,” said Mr. Ladsous, the under secretary general in charge of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.A similar panel was appointed in November after United Nations facilities came under fire during the war in Gaza between Hamas militants and the Israel Defense Forces.In this case, the board is separate from an investigation by Mr. Ladsous’s department, scheduled to be completed by the end of this week.A version of this article appears in print on February 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Panel to Look Into Peacekeeper’s Killing.
