The bill will give many of the legal rights afforded to married couples to an estimated two million Chileans. Most of those expected to benefit from the civil unions are heterosexual couples, though the move is also seen as a big step forward for gay rights. The bill now heads to President Michelle Bachelet to be signed into law. Chile, one of Latin America’s richest countries, is heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, which has traditionally considered homosexuality sinful. A government spokesman said, “This is a legal status that does not discriminate and that will be applied to all types of couples, and most importantly, that recognizes the different types of families we have in our country.” Advertisement
