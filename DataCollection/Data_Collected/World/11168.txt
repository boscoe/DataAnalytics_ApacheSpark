BAGHDAD —  Islamic State fighters launched a heavy attack on government-held territory in Anbar Province late on Thursday and on Friday, killing 25 Iraqi police officers and soldiers, and then 15 family members of local police officers, according to Iraqi officials.The attackers overran large parts of Albu Faraj, a town just north of the provincial capital, Ramadi, less than two days after officials in the province declared that they had begun an offensive against the extremists to the east of the capital, police officials in Ramadi said.A convoy of police reinforcements sent to Albu Faraj was attacked by a suicide bomber, wounding Maj. Gen. Kadhim al-Duleimi, the Anbar Province police commander, the police officials said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity as a matter of official policy.The attack continued into Friday afternoon, they said. Officials were still trying to determine how many of those who had been taken to a hospital in Ramadi from the attack in Albu Faraj had died.AdvertisementAlso on Friday, two bombs went off in Baghdad in the morning, according to an official with the Ministry of Interior, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to give information to the news media.AdvertisementIn one of the Baghdad attacks, a suicide bomber targeted a restaurant in the northern part of the city, which at the time was frequented by Shiite militiamen taking a break from the fighting. Seven were killed and 16 were wounded, the official said.The other Baghdad attack involved a bomb planted in a parked car in the Karada neighborhood, on the predominantly Shiite eastern side of the capital. Five civilians died and 12 were wounded.Despite heavy fighting in northern Salahuddin Province and around Tikrit in March, as well as continued skirmishes in Anbar Province, Baghdad remained the deadliest place in the country in both civilian and military casualties, according to United Nations officials.Of the 997 Iraqis killed in March, 729 were civilians, the United Nations said. Baghdad had the highest civilian death toll, with 362 killed, and Anbar had the second highest, with 237 killed.Hundreds of families fled the fighting in Albu Faraj, and the extremists were said to have overrun half of the community, although they did not come close to the Anbar Operations Command, the joint headquarters for Iraqi security forces. The headquarters are adjacent to Albu Faraj, a suburb of Ramadi on the opposite side of the Euphrates River from the city center.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

There was no way to independently verify the claim, but the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has carried out such vengeance attacks against the relatives of its enemies.Officials said two federal police brigades were sent as reinforcements to the fight in Albu Faraj on Friday.On Wednesday, the chairman of the Anbar Provincial Council announced that a long-awaited major offensive had started with a government attack on Islamic State positions in Sajariya, east of Ramadi. But top Iraqi officials said that attack was isolated and not part of their expected major offensive, which many predict will not begin until after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi returns from a visit to Washington on Tuesday.The offensive in Sajariya halted on Friday morning, according to a provincial councilman, Farhan Mohammad, when Iraqi forces ran out of ammunition.AdvertisementMaintaining logistical support for the Iraqi military and the police has been a major challenge, with their systems plagued by corruption and mismanagement.Iraqi employees of The New York Times contributed reporting from Baghdad and Ramadi.A version of this article appears in print on April 11, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: ISIS Strikes Iraqi Town, Exacting Deadly Toll.
