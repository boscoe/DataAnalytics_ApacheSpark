PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Dozens of militants and Pakistani soldiers have died in fierce fighting as part of a new effort by the military to gain control of the Tirah Valley, a notorious militant sanctuary on the border with Afghanistan, Pakistani civilian and military officials said Wednesday.The army is seeking to build on last year’s offensive against militants in North Waziristan to seize control of Tirah, a remote valley controlled by the pro-Taliban group Lashkar-i-Islam and a smattering of smaller militant groups, some of which have pledged allegiance to Islamic State.At least 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed in three days of battle for control of Ghulam Ali Sar, a strategic ridge overlooking the Peshawar plains and parts of the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, a senior Pakistani security official said.At least 12 other soldiers, including two officers, were seriously wounded in the fighting, in which the ridge changed hands several times before being finally captured by the military, he said.AdvertisementThe official, like others interviewed about the fighting, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss a continuing operation. Officially, the military claimed to have lost just seven soldiers.In a statement on Wednesday, the army press office said that military jets had killed 30 militants and destroyed two ammunition dumps during operations in Tirah.AdvertisementTirah, an area of dense forests and craggy mountains stretching across several hundred square miles, was once a notorious hub of drug smuggling. In recent years, it has become a major stronghold of Pakistani militants and, by Pakistani estimates, is currently home to about 2,500 foreign and local fighters.The Pakistani Taliban and some allied groups were forced to abandon their base in North Waziristan after a military operation there last summer, although that has not stopped them from carrying out bombings in the rest of Pakistan.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
