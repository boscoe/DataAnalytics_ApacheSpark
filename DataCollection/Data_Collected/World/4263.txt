WASHINGTON — Extension of American aid to beleaguered countries of Europe was indicated from two sources today [Dec. 7]. In an exchange of telegrams with King George II of Greece, made public this morning, President Roosevelt promised that the United States would seek means of helping that nation ‘‘which is defending itself so valiantly.’’ At the same time Cordell Hull, Secretary of State, confirmed reports that Spain was negotiating for a $100,000,000 loan from this nation, although he said no final agreement had been reached. The Greek King, in a message sent to the president on Tuesday, expressed his deep appreciation of the sympathy being extended his countrymen by the people of the United States. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 8, 1940
