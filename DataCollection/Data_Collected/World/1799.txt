Tiempo said Tuesday in an editorial that the closing was the result of “economic asphyxiation” caused by the freezing of bank accounts linked to the family of former Vice President Jaime Rolando Rosenthal. In October the United States Treasury Department accused him, his son Yani Rosenthal and nephew Yankel Rosenthal of laundering money for Central American drug syndicates through accounts in the United States. The Rosenthals have denied the allegations. Advertisement
