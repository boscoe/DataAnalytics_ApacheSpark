PARIS —  Saïd Kouachi, one of the gunmen who killed 12 people at the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo, was buried Friday evening in Reims, a city in northeastern France, where he had settled several years ago, the city’s mayor, Arnaud Robinet, said on Saturday.Mr. Kouachi and his younger brother Chérif were killed in a police assault on Jan. 9 in the northern city of Dammartin-en-Goële, two days after the attack on the newspaper.State officials arranged the burial of Mr. Kouachi’s body in an unmarked grave in an area designated for Muslims in one of the city’s cemeteries, Mr. Robinet said, adding that he was informed of Mr. Kouachi’s funeral by a letter from the local prefect. The site of the burial was kept secret for security reasons.“I am angry,” Mr. Robinet said. “But the state ordered me to accept, and I did.”On Thursday, Mr. Robinet and other mayors in France voiced concern about having terrorists buried in their cities. Many feared that the graves could become places of pilgrimage for other extremists or spur violence.AdvertisementChérif Kouachi will be buried in a Muslim plot in Gennevilliers, a Paris suburb, at the request of his wife, Izzana Hamyd, a city official said.“He was living here,” said the city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. “Even if it doesn’t please us, we respect French law,” he said.AdvertisementAs police investigators continue to search for potential accomplices of the three men who killed 17 people in the attacks, plans for burying the body of the third gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, remain unclear.A version of this article appears in print on January 18, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: For Charlie Hebdo Gunman, a Discreet Burial in Reims.
