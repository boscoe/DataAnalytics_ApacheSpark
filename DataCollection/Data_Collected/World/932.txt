CreditSebastian Scheiner/Associated Press        JERUSALEM — The bus was just rounding a corner in East Jerusalem when two Palestinians armed with a gun and a knife tried to commandeer it and shot and stabbed its passengers, witnesses said.It was one of four attacks Tuesday by Palestinians in Jerusalem and another city 40 miles away that killed three Israelis and wounded more than 20. The most intense eruption so far in two weeks of escalating violence alarmed an already tense Israel.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held an emergency meeting of his cabinet and early Wednesday, the government said that it had authorized the police “to impose closures on, or to surround, centers of friction in Jerusalem,” meaning some Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem, and that property of those who committed attacks would be confiscated. It also said that perpetrators from Jerusalem would have their right to live in the city revoked and that army units would help the police in cities and along roads.“We are in a struggle, a struggle for us all, and we will face it together,” Mr. Netanyahu said in the Knesset, Israel’s Parliament, during a break in the hourslong emergency meeting.Advertisement“We are focused on our mission to fight the murderers and inciters and I am confident that the actions we take will lead to the other side’s recognition that terrorism does not pay,” he added.AdvertisementMinutes after the bus attack, in what may have been a coordinated assault, a Palestinian worker for the Israeli telephone company rammed his company vehicle into pedestrians at a bus stop in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of West Jerusalem, then got out and hacked them with a meat cleaver. Police officers killed one of the bus attackers and wounded the other, while a security guard fatally shot the phone company worker.One of the two Israelis killed on the bus was identified as Haviv Haim, 78. The Israeli killed by the phone company worker was identified as Rabbi Yeshayahu Krishevski, 60.Palestinians also carried out two stabbings in Ra’anana, a normally tranquil, suburban city of 80,000 northeast of Tel Aviv that is home to many American immigrant families. The perpetrators in both attacks were captured, the police said.The State Department condemned Tuesday’s attacks “in the strongest terms” and called on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides to take steps to restore calm and prevent actions that could escalate tensions.The outbreak of violence on Tuesday came after four stabbing attacks on Monday in Jerusalem, including one in which a 13-year-old Israeli Jew riding his bicycle was critically wounded by two Palestinian cousins, 13 and 15. The younger assailant was hit by a car and severely hurt as he tried to flee, the police said, while the older one was fatally shot by officers, prompting outrage.Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, called the killing of the 15-year-old a “heinous crime” and compared it to an episode widely seen as having helped incite the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in 2000.“If the Israeli government continues with this escalation of this dangerous method of executions, the region will be in a position that cannot be controlled, and everyone will pay a heavy price,” Mr. Rudeineh said in a statement.AdvertisementRiyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, sent the Security Council an urgent letter on Monday night listing numerous cases in which Israeli forces fatally shot attackers, as well as people protesting against Israel’s occupation in the West Bank and rushing toward the fence that separates Israel from the Gaza Strip.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At least 11 of those suspected of being assailants have been shot dead by Israeli security forces or, in one case, a victim who pulled out a pistol. Most of the attacks have been in Jerusalem.Adding to the unfolding sense of chaos, the police reported on Tuesday that a Jewish resident of Kiryat Ata in northern Israel stabbed another Jew, apparently mistaking him for an Arab, in what was suspected to be a botched revenge attack. Protests continued in the West Bank on Tuesday, and along the border fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel.A Palestinian man was fatally shot during clashes with Israeli forces near the wall separating the West Bank city of Bethlehem from Jerusalem. Wafa, the official Palestinian news agency, identified the man as Moataz Zawahra, in his late 20s. Medical officials said a bullet had pierced his lung.In a speech at Harvard, Secretary of State John Kerry said he would soon travel to the Middle East in the hope of easing tensions.In Jerusalem, the morning began with scenes reminiscent of the second Palestinian intifada, which waned in 2005 — sirens screaming by; a bus with shattered windows.Golan Cohen Gabai drove past and saw the commotion on the No. 78 bus between mostly Jewish Armon Hanatziv and predominantly Palestinian Jebel Mukaber, areas of East Jerusalem.Advertisement“I saw one of the terrorists in the driver’s seat, trying to hijack the bus, so I blocked it with my car,” Mr. Cohen Gabai recounted on Israeli television. One of the assailants came at him, he said, describing how he sped off as the police arrived.“It started with knives, then cars and now guns,” said Aliza Ben Zichri, 59, a local resident who rushed to the scene after hearing gunfire. “Why not put them under curfew?” she asked, referring to the city’s 300,000 Palestinian residents. “I should be able to walk freely.”Ahmed Rajabi, 30, a resident of Jebel Mukaber who works at a nearby carwash, said, “We’ve always lived together. I don’t know how such a thing happened. We don’t agree with all this.”Irit Pazner Garshowitz contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on October 14, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Attacks by Palestinians Kill 3 Israelis and Wound More Than 20.
