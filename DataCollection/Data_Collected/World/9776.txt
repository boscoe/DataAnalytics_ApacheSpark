MOSCOW —  As President Vladimir V. Putin led Russia in celebrating the first anniversary of its annexation of Crimea on Wednesday with a rally and concert, Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine warned that a cease-fire there was at risk of collapsing because of a dispute over political autonomy for regions in the war zone.The rally was held just outside the Kremlin walls, right near where the Russian opposition leader Boris Y. Nemtsov was shot to death last month in the country’s most brazen political assassination since Mr. Putin took office in 2000.Some people attending the rally stood on the very bridge where Mr. Nemtsov was shot in the back while walking home from a restaurant, and some posed for pictures by the piles of flowers that mourners had placed there. Mr. Nemtsov was a sharp critic of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, and the spectacle of a nationalist celebration at the scene of his death drew some anger.Russia has paid a stiff price for its annexation of Crimea: a raft of economic sanctions imposed by Europe, the United States and other nations, and increasing political isolation, including expulsion from the Group of 8 industrial powers.AdvertisementBut Mr. Putin suggested Wednesday that it was all worth it, telling a crowd of several thousand that the seizure of Crimea had not been merely about territorial expansion but about restoring an important part of Russia’s historical identity.Advertisement“This was not simply about land, of which we have no shortage as it is,” he said. “The issue at stake was the sources of our history, our spirituality and our statehood — the things that make us a single people and a single, united nation.”Mr. Putin, who reappeared on Monday after dropping out of public view for more than a week without explanation, added: “Friends, we in Russia always saw the Russians and Ukrainians as a single people. I still think this way now.”As he spoke, there were some chants of “Russia! Russia!”People in the crowd carried banners proclaiming messages like “We’re happy together” and “Crimea and Sevastopol are the cradle of the Russian spirit!”Although many Russians enthusiastically supported the annexation of Crimea, not everyone at the rally agreed. One man, who gave his name as Aleksei Ivanov, said many people seemed to have been forced to attend.“It’s obvious that the absolute majority of people did not come here of their free will,” he said. “It’s clearly all for the media.”
                How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.            Mr. Putin also signed a 25-year agreement on Wednesday with the president of South Ossetia, a breakaway region of Georgia, that creates a common security space and allows citizens to move freely across the shared border.Critics of the agreement said it was tantamount to a Russian annexation of South Ossetia, over which it fought a brief war with Georgia in 2008.AdvertisementRussia has fiercely supported the idea of political autonomy for the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, which it views as a hedge against Ukraine’s fully integrating with Europe. Some Ukrainians say they believe Mr. Putin wants to turn the eastern part of the country into a gray zone similar to South Ossetia and another Georgian breakaway parcel, Abkhazia, that Russia can control.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A law passed this week by the Ukrainian Parliament included a provision stating that autonomy would be increased only after elections held in accordance with Ukrainian law, which would give that control to the government in Kiev.The Parliament speaker, Volodymyr Groysman, a close ally of the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, said the legislation sought to execute the Minsk agreement, “which the world defined as a baseline for the settlement of unconcealed Russian aggression in Ukraine.”But Aleksandr V. Zakharchenko and Igor V. Plotnitsky, the nominal political leaders of the two separatist republics, said the law violated the Minsk accord and could lead to new fighting.“The conclusion is obvious: Kiev does not want peace,” Mr. Zakharchenko and Mr. Plotnitsky said in a joint statement on Wednesday. “If that’s what they want, there will be new battles — as many times as necessary for the total destruction of the Ukrainian party of war.”In particular, the two men said that the accord required Kiev’s representatives to discuss with the separatists how the elections would be held, that cities retaken by the Ukrainian Army should also be given special status, that the special status had been delayed in taking effect, and that Kiev had called for peacekeepers to be stationed in eastern Ukraine.“Each of us sees the document in his own way,” Mr. Zakharchenko told journalists in the town of Debaltseve. “I see it as the following: Remove all troops from here, end military activity, and we’ll take all of our cities where referendums were held.”That would include cities like Mariupol, an industrial hub on the Sea of Azov, as well as Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, former separatist bastions that the government retook in bloody fighting last summer.According to Denis Pushilin, another rebel politician, the process of carrying out the cease-fire “has practically halted” because, he said, referring to the contested regions of Ukraine, “its basis, the law on Donbass’s special status, is virtually being annulled by Poroshenko’s amendments.”Andrew Roth and Sophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: A Year After Seizing Crimea, Putin Celebrates as Ukraine Seethes.
