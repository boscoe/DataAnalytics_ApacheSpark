An Egyptian criminal court sentenced 22 people to death on Monday after convicting them of storming a police station outside Cairo and killing an officer on July 3, 2013 — the day the military overthrew Mohamed Morsi, the Islamist president. The Giza court said eight of the defendants were sentenced in absentia on charges that included murder, attempted murder, possession of unlicensed firearms, destruction of property and vandalism. The ruling, which can be appealed, also sentenced a minor to 10 years. Mr. Morsi himself faces a verdict on Tuesday over accusations that he was responsible for the killing of protesters while president. The ruling will be the first in several trials against him.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
