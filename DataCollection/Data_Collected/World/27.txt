AdvertisementSupported byWorld BriefingBy Agence France-Presse The Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik has said he is ready to go on hunger strike until death if he is not treated better in prison. Mr. Breivik, who killed 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in 2011, is serving a 21-year sentence that can be extended if he is still considered a danger to society. The News site Nettavisen reported Tuesday that it had received an “open letter” addressed to media outlets and penal authorities in which Mr. Breivik, 36, complains about the conditions at Skien prison in southeast Norway. He has described his solitary confinement as a form of torture, but exhausted his legal options last year when the police closed a preliminary investigation into his complaint. Mr. Breivik’s lawyer was not available for comment on Wednesday, and the Norwegian authorities do not usually discuss conditions of detention. In January 2014, Mr. Breivik wrote to Agence France-Presse with a list of 12 demands that included an upgrade of his PlayStation 2 games console to a PlayStation 3. Advertisement
