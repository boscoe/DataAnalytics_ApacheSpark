The priest, Msgr. Krzysztof Charamsa, had worked at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican’s doctrinal arm, since 2003. He was also dismissed from his jobs teaching theology at pontifical universities in Rome. Monsignor Charamsa, 43, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in an interview published Saturday that he was gay and had a partner. The church teaches that homosexuality is not a sin but that homosexual activity is, and priests take vows of celibacy. Monsignor Charamsa, above, also held a news conference with his partner and gay rights activists. The Vatican said the dismissal had nothing to do with Monsignor Charamsa’s reflections on his personal life, which it said “merit respect.” But it said that giving the interview had been “grave and irresponsible” given its timing just before a synod of bishops who will discuss family issues, including the church’s position on gays.
