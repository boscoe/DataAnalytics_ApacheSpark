Commander Richard Walton of Scotland Yard’s counterterrorism unit said a Libyan man in his 50s was arrested Thursday on suspicion of conspiracy to murder the officer, Yvonne Fletcher. A man and a woman, also Libyans, were arrested on a lesser charge of money laundering in relation to the case. Ms. Fletcher was killed and 10 people were wounded on April 17, 1984, when someone opened fire with a submachine gun from inside the Libyan People’s Bureau on St. James’s Square in London. She was policing a large demonstration opposed to the Libyan ruler at the time, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. A 10-day siege followed the shooting before 30 people holed up inside were deported to Libya.
