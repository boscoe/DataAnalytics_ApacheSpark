The Islamic State group said Thursday that a woman it described as the widow of the French gunman responsible for a deadly siege at a Paris supermarket last month — a woman who is now among France’s most wanted fugitives — was living among the group’s followers, presumably in Syria or Iraq. The assertion by the Islamic State, published in an English-language version of its online jihadist propaganda magazine, is believed to be the first time the group has said anything concerning the whereabouts of the woman, Hayat Boumeddiene, 26. French officials suspect that she was an accomplice of the gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, killed in a Jan. 9 shootout with the French police. The article asserted that Mr. Coulibaly had arranged for her travel to lands controlled by the Islamic State before the attack. She was quoted as saying that she was happy to be living in an area controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and was quoted as advising other women followers of the group to “be bases of support and safety for your husbands, brothers, fathers, and sons.” Turkish officials have said that Ms. Boumeddiene traveled to Turkey from Spain before the Paris attack and entered Syria through a Turkish border crossing on Jan. 8, one day before the supermarket siege.A version of this brief appears in print on February 13, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: ISIS Releases Interview With Woman Who Fled France.
