After years of trying to balance security needs with privacy rights, the European Union agreed Friday on a system to share airline passenger information, paving the way for closer scrutiny of extremists. Spurred into action by the attacks in Paris, European Union interior ministers moved to grant law enforcement agencies access to information gathered by airlines, like names, travel dates, itinerary, credit cards and contact details. Under the deal, details would be collected from European carrier flights entering or leaving the E.U., as well as from flights between member countries. Charter flights will be included, and all the information will be kept on file for six months. Étienne Schneider, the deputy prime minister of Luxembourg, who led the meeting in Brussels, expressed pride that “after so many years of negotiations we have now been able to conclude an agreement.” The proposal was first made in 2007, and it languished in the European Parliament for more than two years as E.U. lawmakers struggled to strike the right balance between security concerns and people’s privacy rights. The assembly must still endorse the deal, but that appears to be a formality and is likely to happen within the next month.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
