Gen. Gilbert Diendéré, who took power in a recent short-lived coup, is now in custody, the Ministry of Defense said Thursday. General Diendéré, who stepped down after about a week in power, was handed over to the gendarmerie, said the ministry spokesman, Boureima Ouedraogo. The general had sought refuge at the Vatican Embassy after the army on Tuesday opened fire on his supporters in the presidential guard to force them to disarm, a person who works closely with the clergy said. Under a peace deal they were required to disarm. General Diendéré took power on Sept. 16 but stepped down after pressure from the West African regional bloc, Burkina Faso’s military and citizens. The transitional government was reinstalled Sept. 23. The government said that General Diendéré and his accomplices would receive a fair trial.A version of this brief appears in print on October 2, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Burkina Faso: Coup Leader Is Detained.
