The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Ronald Reagan was taking part in a military exercise with South Korea in the Sea of Japan on Thursday when a pair of Russian bombers flew within one nautical mile of the ship, the Pentagon said. In response, the carrier scrambled four F/A-18 fighter jets to escort the Russian bombers, which came in at an altitude of about 500 feet, from the area, according to the Pentagon. Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, said the incident did not result in a “significant confrontation.” A Pentagon statement said the Defense Department “characterized this interaction as safe.” The United States and Russia spent weeks recently thrashing out an agreement to keep their aircraft apart in the skies over Syria, where militaries from both countries are conducting airstrikes. But run-ins between American and Russian forces in the skies and waters off the coast of East Asia are rare, and the region is not the flash point of current tensions between Moscow and Washington.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
