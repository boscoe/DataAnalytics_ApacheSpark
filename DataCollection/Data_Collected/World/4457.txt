Ebola viruses that sickened many people during the height of the epidemic in Liberia can be traced back to a single case of the disease probably introduced from Sierra Leone, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Cell Host and Microbe. “The data are consistent with the vast majority of cases in Liberia coming from a single event,” said Jason T. Ladner of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases. The virus then spread from Liberia back into Guinea, where the current epidemic was first identified. Scientists analyzed genomic sequences from 140 blood samples, nearly 2 percent of all reported cases in Liberia, collected over 11 months, after a smaller outbreak had been controlled. Liberia had no new Ebola cases last week, and a recent cluster was most likely linked to a rare case of transmission from a survivor, officials said Wednesday.A version of this brief appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Researchers Trace Virus’s Path.
