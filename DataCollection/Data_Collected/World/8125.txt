Mexican officials say two worn-out bolts on a gas tanker truck caused a leak that resulted in a deadly explosion at a Mexico City maternity hospital on Jan. 29. The results of the investigation highlighted the unsafe conditions of many propane tankers. The city’s chief prosecutor, Rodolfo Rios, said Monday that two bolts on the truck had cracked, allowing a gasket to blow out partially. The subsequent leak set off an explosion and fire that killed five people, injured dozens and destroyed most of the Hospital Materno Infantil Cuajimalpa. Mr. Rios also noted that one bolt was the wrong size, and that the truck’s meter had been altered to shortchange customers. Experts said wire and Teflon tape had been improperly used on parts of the truck’s valves.A version of this brief appears in print on February 17, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexico: Bad Bolts on Gas Tanker Led to Blast That Killed 5 at Hospital.
