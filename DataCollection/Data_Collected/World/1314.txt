Chinese universities are vastly expanding online courses aimed at foreign students, hoping to promote Chinese culture and values around the world. One of the first attempts, “Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought,” offered this fall by Tsinghua University, drew more than 3,100 students. The course is one of 45 classes offered by mainland Chinese universities on edX, a joint venture by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The course studies the theories and policies of Mao Zedong, the Communist leader who founded the People’s Republic of China in 1949. A version of the course is a requirement in all Chinese universities and is widely loathed by students as boring political indoctrination that is irrelevant to life in modern China. Test your knowledge of the chairman’s philosophy by taking the quiz below. | Related Article »
