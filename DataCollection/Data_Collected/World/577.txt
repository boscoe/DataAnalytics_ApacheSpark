The United Nations Security Council is poised to adopt a resolution on Friday authorizing European militaries to “inspect” and “seize” ships suspected of being used for human smuggling, but only in the international waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The draft resolution offers less than what European leaders originally wanted, which was the Council’s blessings to conduct military operations along the Libyan coast, on land and water. It specifies that the authorization is for the “specific purposes” of stamping out human smuggling operations, but only in a specific part of the Mediterranean, according to a draft copy obtained by The New York Times. The Europeans have said they will take migrants found on board to Italy and allow those who have a refugee claim to apply for asylum. The internationally recognized government of Libya gave its blessings to the draft measure this week, which compelled the last holdouts on the Council to come to an agreement.A version of this brief appears in print on October 9, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: United Nations; A Plan to Impede Human Smuggling.
