RAMALLAH, West Bank — A Palestinian leadership body called Thursday night for curtailing longstanding security coordination with Israel, but left decisions on when or whether to take such a step to President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee.The move, in the form of a resolution by the P.L.O.’s central council, was another escalation in a cycle of retaliation between Israel and the Palestinians over the past several months. It was framed as a response to Israel’s withholding since January of $127 million a month in taxes it collects on the Palestinians’ behalf — itself a punishment by Israel for the Palestinians’ joining the International Criminal Court, where they hope to pursue war crime accusations against Israeli officials.“We are being forced to take these steps because of these unilateral Israeli steps, which is killing the Palestinian state and killing our hopes,” said Assad Abdul Rahman, a member of the central council who attended its two-day convention here in Ramallah that led to the resolution.“In the end, you are pushing us to cancel security coordination because you have not upheld any agreement except the security coordination,” he said.AdvertisementFor years, Palestinian security forces have cooperated with Israelis, sharing intelligence information, coordinating arrests and containing demonstrations in the West Bank. Israelis see the arrangement as critical to their security, but it has also helped Mr. Abbas maintain order and suppress the activities of his political rival, Hamas.AdvertisementCoordination began in the 1990s following the signing of the Oslo Accords, but was cemented in 2007 after Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip.Since last spring’s collapse of American-led peace negotiations and the summer war between Hamas and Israel, Mr. Abbas has faced increasing pressure from the public and other Palestinian leaders to halt all coordination.American officials had urged Mr. Abbas not to take any significant action before Israel’s March 17 elections. The council’s resolution is essentially advisory, since it included the caveat that it would be executed by the P.L.O.’s executive committee, with no timetable specified.Still, it promises to further heighten tensions.In a statement, the council summarized 10 resolutions it passed, including the suspension of “all forms of security coordination, given Israel’s systematic and ongoing noncompliance with its obligations under signed agreements, including its daily military raids throughout the state of Palestine, attacks against our civilians and properties.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Western diplomats fear that continued withholding of the taxes could ultimately cause the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and unleash unrest across the West Bank.AdvertisementThe Israeli government recently directed that some $300 million of the Palestinian tax money be used to offset huge Palestinian debts to the Israeli electric company, which had reduced power to the northern West Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin.Palestinian leaders last month ordered shopkeepers to empty their shelves of Israeli foodstuffs, and some activists dumped a truckload of Israeli milk and yogurt in a square.But Israel has also taken some steps to soothe the situation. Earlier Thursday, it announced that it would import produce from Gaza for the first time since 2007, starting with tomatoes and eggplant next week.A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: P.L.O.
