BEIJING — In the latest outburst of violence in China’s troubled Xinjiang region, security forces shot and killed six men on Monday after they attacked police officers not far from the Silk Road city of Kashgar, a government website reported.The report, on the Tianshan news portal, said that the police opened fire on a man near the commercial center of Shule County who was wielding an ax while trying to set off explosives. It said another five men, described as “mobsters,” were subsequently shot to death as they, too, attacked the police.The authorities said the men had explosives “on their bodies,” but they did not provide further details. There were no other casualties reported, said Tianshan, which did not identify those accused of being the assailants.In a posting on its microblog account, the state-run Xinhua news agency said that the police at the scene had also discovered explosives inside a minivan that was parked nearby.AdvertisementIn recent months, more than 100 people in Xinjiang have been killed during clashes between Chinese security forces and ethnic Uighurs, a largely Muslim, Turkic-speaking people who have long bridled under Beijing’s governance of the region.AdvertisementThe episode on Monday occurred in Kashgar Prefecture, an impoverished stretch of southern Xinjiang whose population is nearly 90 percent Uighur and less than 10 percent Han Chinese, the nation’s predominant ethnic group.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But human rights advocates call such claims exaggerated as part of an effort to obscure what they describe as a slow-boil, homegrown insurgency inflamed by policies that repress religious practices and seek to dilute Uighur culture.“Charges of so-called terrorism attacks are just China’s excuses for using excessive force,” Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman based in Germany for the World Uyghur Congress, said in an email. “It’s China’s provocative policies that are instigating the unrest.”A man who answered the phone at the Shule County public security bureau hung up when asked for information about the episode.Government censorship of the Chinese news media and restrictions on foreign reporters who travel to Xinjiang make it difficult to learn more about such episodes, but reports of them have surged despite an increasingly heavy police presence.A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: China: Xinjiang Violence Leaves 6 Dead.
