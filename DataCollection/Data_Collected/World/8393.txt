Investigators were still trying to determine the total amount missing, said the central bank director for Afghanistan’s southwestern region, Fazel Ahmad Azimi. The Kandahar raid is believed to have been carried out by a senior official at the bank with the help of his son and brother-in-law, who were also on the staff, Mr. Azimi said. The theft at the branch in Spinbaldak near the border with Pakistan was discovered on Thursday, and investigators say they believe that the suspects escaped to Pakistan. Advertisement
