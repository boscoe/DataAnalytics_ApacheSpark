Foreign volunteers helped migrants arriving on the Greek island of Lesbos on Thursday, a day after the Greek Coast Guard saved some 240 migrants after their boat capsized off the island.ATHENS —  Greek rescuers recovered four bodies off the island of Lesbos on Thursday, bringing the death toll from the sinking of a large smuggling vessel to seven, with dozens more feared missing, officials said.The bodies, of two children and two adults, were discovered a day after the Greek Coast Guard mounted one of its biggest rescue operations this year, involving a large wooden vessel that capsized in high winds while trying the short but perilous crossing to Greece from Turkey.Greece has long been a favored entry point into Europe for the seemingly endless influx of people who are risking their lives to flee war or seek a better life. Most of them try to continue their journeys to more prosperous nations in Western and Northern Europe.SERBIABlack SeaBULGARIAMACEDONIAIstanbulALBANIAGREECEIonian SeaLesbosTURKEYAthensAegean SeaCRETEMediterranean Sea150 MilesOCT. 29, 2015
Rescuers saved 242 people on Wednesday, but the bodies of a man and two children were pulled out of the Aegean Sea that day. Thirty-four people are still feared missing, according to an official at the Greek Shipping Ministry, who said weather conditions had worsened.Advertisement“It’s another very difficult day; the wind is very strong,” said the official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity.AdvertisementTelevised images on Wednesday showed doctors and volunteers trying to revive unconscious children and adults on the island’s shores.The coast guard was working in cooperation with the European Union’s border monitoring agency, Frontex, and two helicopters and several fishing boats joined Greek patrol vessels as the search continued on Thursday.Four more migrants were feared missing from wrecks in other parts of the Aegean, the ministry official said.“In total, 15 people, including 10 children, have been found dead in five incidents over the past 24 hours,” the official said, adding that the coast guard is “on permanent standby” and that the toll could rise.Thousands of migrants came ashore this summer on the Greek island of Lesbos, a popular tourist destination. Some of them had to walk more than 40 miles to get to the main port of Mytilene.“Every day, we have boats coming over,” the official said. “There are lots of people in transit in very difficult conditions.”The worsening weather does not appear to have deterred the migrants, who are often packed into unseaworthy vessels by smugglers.The Greek authorities have appealed for additional support from the European Union, and more than a half-million migrants have arrived in the country this year.The European Union has pledged additional financial support for Greece, which has promised to host up to 50,000 migrants by the end of the year. But Athens has suggested that the country’s creditors should ease their demands for austerity measures in exchange for a recent bailout, in compensation for Greece’s efforts to address the migration crisis.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
