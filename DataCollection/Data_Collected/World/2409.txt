Mr. Adeeb is the second vice president to be impeached in three months. He is accused of planning to kill President Abdulla Yameen in an explosion on his speedboat on Sept. 28. Mr. Adeeb has denied involvement in the blast. The president, who was not hurt in the blast, has declared a state of emergency, saying the explosion and the subsequent discovery of an arms cache indicated that there were threats to national security. The government has called the explosion an assassination attempt. The F.B.I., which investigated the explosion at the governmentâ€™s request, said it found no evidence that it was caused by a bomb.
