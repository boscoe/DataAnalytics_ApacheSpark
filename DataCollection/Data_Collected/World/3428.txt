JERUSALEM —  Four Israelis, including a 13-year-old girl, were stabbed and wounded in southern Israel on Saturday before the assailant fled, setting off a manhunt, the police said.The attacks appeared to be ideologically motivated, rather than criminal, a police spokeswoman, Luba Samri, said. She added that the police were searching for the attacker in the city of Kiryat Gat.The attack appeared to be part of a recent outbreak of violence ignited by tensions surrounding a Jerusalem holy site. Since September, Palestinian attacks have killed 17 Israelis, mostly in stabbings, and 52 Palestinians said to be attackers were killed.A version of this brief appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page A16 of the New York edition with the headline: Stabbing Assault Wounds 4 Israelis.
