A spokesman for the Red Cross in South Sudan said the organization had pulled 36 bodies from the wreckage, including those of children.“Some were underneath, some were outside, scattered,” said the spokesman, Maju Hillary. “The whole area was littered with parts of human beings.”He added that there could be more bodies buried under the debris.South Sudan’s military spokesman, Col. Philip Aguer, said the aircraft’s pilot reported only 12 passengers on board upon takeoff. A presidential spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny, told Reuters that the plane was carrying 18 people, including six foreign crew members, and that all but three had died in the crash.At least one adult and a toddler reportedly survived the crash, officials said.Photographs showing debris from the aircraft scattered along the banks of the Nile were posted on social media sites on Wednesday. Images showed the tail of the fuselage protruding out of a verdant canopy of banana trees and forest.South Sudan achieved independence in 2011. One of the least developed countries in the world, it has a grievous aviation safety record. Skeletons of airplane fuselages litter numerous airports across the country, including the one in Juba.The flight had been headed to strategic oil fields in the Upper Nile region of the country, where there is a large South Sudanese military presence.Colonel Aguer, the military spokesman, said that the fatalities included South Sudanese soldiers, as well as civilians, and called the crash “shocking.” He also said that the flight manifest was being checked to identify those on board.It is common in South Sudan for friends and family members of soldiers or flight crew members to squeeze on board cargo flights for quick transport.“People here travel whenever they get a plane,” Colonel Aguer said.The aircraft, according to an aviation database, was a Soviet-era Antonov 12BK propeller plane and belonged to Allied Services Ltd., a company operating in the country. According to the database, the aircraft first flew in 1971.Soviet-era aircraft are popular across sub-Saharan Africa, bought and leased both by international agencies and local companies, which often have tight budgets and loose regulations.The cause of the crash remained unknown late on Wednesday, and repeated efforts to reach the airline were unsuccessful.Advertisement
