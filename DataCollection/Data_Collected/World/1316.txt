LONDON — The horror inspired throughout Great Britain by the execution of Miss Cavell, the English nurse, was voiced by the Bishop of London, who said that the cold-blooded murder of the poor English woman who had nursed hundreds of wounded German soldiers and who had been deliberately shot in Brussels by a German officer would run the sinking of the Lusitania a very hard race in the opinion of the civilized world as the greatest crime in history. The report of how Miss Cavell was shot in the early hours of the morning is one of the blackest chapters in Germany’s black war history.  — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 22, 1915
