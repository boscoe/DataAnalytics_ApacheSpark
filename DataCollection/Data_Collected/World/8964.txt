Rebels of Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate and other radical Islamic factions carried out an assault on Wednesday on a government intelligence building in the northern city of Aleppo, blowing up part of it, two activist groups said. The Aleppo Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain and monitors the conflict with the help of contacts in Syria, said a blast hit the Air Force Intelligence branch in the Zahra district. The observatory’s director, Rami Abdurrahman, said 20 government soldiers and 14 militants had been killed in the attack, which was led by the Nusra Front, a group that has links with Al Qaeda, and other radical Islamic armed groups. Aleppo has been divided between rebels and government troops since mid-2012, and fighting has destroyed much of the city.A version of this brief appears in print on March 5, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Syria: Rebels Attack Intelligence Office.
