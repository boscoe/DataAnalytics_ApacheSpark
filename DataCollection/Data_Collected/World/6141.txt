Libya’s factions have agreed to a new round of negotiations backed by the United Nations to try to end the conflict that is destabilizing the country after its civil war ousted Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. The meeting, announced after the United Nations envoy, Bernardino León, met rival parties in Libya, will take place in the next week in Geneva, the United Nations mission said in a statement on Saturday. Libya has been divided by conflict since the overthrow of Colonel Qaddafi, with two rival governments and two parliaments, each backed by competing groups of former rebel fighters. The statement did not specify who would attend the talks or give an exact date. But it said the meeting would seek to address the formation of a unity government, the drafting of a new constitution and the ending of hostilities.A version of this brief appears in print on January 11, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Libya: Rival Factions Agree to Negotiations, U.N.
