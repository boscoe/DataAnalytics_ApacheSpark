An Italian journalist said Monday that he would not appear before Vatican magistrates to be questioned in a criminal case over leaked confidential documents. The journalist, Gianluigi Nuzzi, whose book “Merchants in the Temple” was published last week, received an official summons from the office of the Vatican prosecutor to appear Tuesday morning to be interrogated in the case against a Vatican monsignor accused of leaking documents. Mr. Nuzzi, who has himself been placed under investigation in the case, accused the Vatican legal system of punishing journalists and criminalizing the publishing of news. His book details waste, mismanagement and greed in the Vatican. Officials at the Vatican have denounced the book and arrested two members of a commission created to examine mismanagement and to recommend reforms. They were accused of leaking documents.A version of this brief appears in print on November 17, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Italy: Reporter Rebuffs Summons by Vatican for Questioning on Leaks.
