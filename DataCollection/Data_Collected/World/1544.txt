BAGHDAD —  Gen. John R. Allen had a clear mission when the White House picked him last year to serve as the Obama administration’s point man for the campaign against the Islamic State: Assemble an international coalition to vanquish the militants.But as General Allen is preparing to vacate his post in a few weeks, the administration is facing an unanticipated problem: There are now two international coalitions, the 65-member group General Allen helped create, and Russia’s new alliance with Iran and the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.On Friday, the White House officially announced the departure of General Allen, who resigns in mid-November to help run a security program at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based research organization. His position will be filled by Brett McGurk, his State Department deputy who has long focused on Iraq.As he made his final visits to the Middle East this month, General Allen sought to shore up the American-led coalition in the face of the unexpected challenge by Moscow.AdvertisementIn a meeting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq, General Allen received assurance that a new “coordination center” the Russians had established here with Iraq, Iran and Syria would not organize military operations but would limit itself to sharing information about the militants.AdvertisementAnd this week, General Allen tried to reassure officials in the Sunni monarchies in the Persian Gulf that the United States would not join forces with the Russians in Syria or tacitly support their actions.“The message was that we will deconflict with the Russians in Syria but not cooperate militarily,” General Allen, a retired Marine officer, said in a telephone interview.“One had hoped that the Russians would bear down on Daesh as they said they would and publicly commit themselves to transition away from Assad,” he added, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIL and ISIS. “None of those things have happened.”General Allen’s diplomatic role began 13 months ago as the White House was scrambling to respond to the Islamic State’s sweep through northern Iraq and its capture of Mosul, one of Iraq’s largest cities. He received a call from Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, who asked if he would serve as special envoy charged with building a coalition against the Islamic State.General Allen was well known to the Obama administration. He had commanded the American-led coalition in Afghanistan and had developed a plan to help secure the West Bank during Secretary of State John Kerry’s effort to facilitate a peace settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. He agreed to take the envoy post for six months with the option to extend.Unlike in Afghanistan, there was no ready-made NATO alliance to fall back on: The coalition would need to be built from scratch. Bureaucratic politics at home were also a challenge. Power was centralized at the White House, and the State Department and Pentagon had strong differences over how to respond to the Syrian crisis.Over the past year, the basic infrastructure for confronting the Islamic State has been put in place. The coalition General Allen helped assemble grew to 63 nations and two organizations, the European Union and the Arab League. Working groups were set up to crack down on the militants’ finances, stop the volunteers attracted to them and counter their extensive use of social media.
            The United States, Iraq and their allies are engaging the Islamic State on multiple fronts in an attempt to weaken the militants' defenses.        50 MILESKobaniTURKEYHasakaMosulAleppoErbilThe U.S. is arming Syrian Arab fighters who will join Kurdish combatants to attack Raqqa. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias, aided by U.S. airstrikes, retook the Baiji oil refinery from ISIS on Friday after contesting it for more than a year. Deir al-ZourHawijaISIScontrolareasIRAQHomsIRANTikritPalmyraLEBANONSYRIAIraqi forces have encircled Ramadi, which is defended by 600 to 1,000 militants, with the support of U.S. airstrikes and the Iraqi air force. DamascusBaghdadFallujaJORDAN50 MILESKobaniTURKEYHasakaMosulAleppoErbilThe U.S. is arming Syrian Arab fighters who will join Kurdish combatants to attack Raqqa. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias, aided by U.S. airstrikes, retook the Baiji oil refinery from ISIS on Friday after contesting it for more than a year. Deir al-ZourHawijaISIScontrolareasIRAQHomsTikritPalmyraLEBANONSYRIAIraqi forces have encircled Ramadi, which is defended by 600 to 1,000 militants, with the support of U.S. airstrikes and the Iraqi air force. BaghdadFalluja50 MILESTURKEYKobaniIraqi forces andShiite militias, aidedby U.S. airstrikes,retook the Baiji oilrefinery on Friday.SYRIAISIScontrolThe U.S. is armingSyrian Arab fighterswho will join Kurdishcombatants toattack Raqqa.PalmyraTikritHawijaIRAQBaghdadIraqi forces have encircledRamadi, which is defendedby 600 to 1,000 militants.JORDAN50 MILESTURKEYIraqi forces andShiite militias, aidedby U.S. airstrikes,retook the Baiji oilrefinery on Friday.SYRIAISIScontrolThe U.S. is armingSyrian Arab fighterswho will join Kurdishcombatants toattack Raqqa.TikritHawijaIRAQIraqi forces have encircledRamadi, which is defendedby 600 to 1,000 militants.Some progress has been slow. The “stabilization” group,” led by Germany and the United Arab Emirates, has been discussing ways to ensure that the millions of Iraqis who fled the fighting have a safe and functioning city or town to return home to once those areas have been recaptured. As much as $80 million is required to meet current needs, according to the United Nations, but only $30 million has been pledged. To help protect Iraqi returnees, the Italian Carabinieri is training Iraq’s provincial police. Though the Italians are planning to increase their efforts, the number of police officers they have trained is just 246, and half of those are federal police officers.AdvertisementOne of General Allen’s most important accomplishments has been getting Turkey to allow its air bases to be used for allied airstrikes in Syria, the result of long months of negotiation. American A-10 attack planes are based in Incirlik, in southeast Turkey, which will enable the United States to accelerate the pace of airstrikes in Syria and support the new effort by Syrian Arab militias and Kurdish fighters to put pressure on Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State’s self-styled caliphate. If need be, the coalition has access to two more Turkish bases at Batman and Diyarbakir.Access to the bases will also make it easier to provide air cover for Arab militias that are to help control the Syria-Turkey border and curb the flow of fighters under the coalition plan.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

While Russia and the United States both insist that they are interested in a political solution to the Syrian crisis, their clashing interests suggest that a diplomatic resolution is more distant than ever.Looking back, General Allen said that many of the pieces had been put in place to step up the military and economic pressure on the Islamic State. But he acknowledged the most decisive steps lay ahead.“We’ve been trying to set the conditions for where we can bring coalition pressure to bear across ISIL’s entire surface area,” he said. “And as I depart, that’s finally emerging, and will be the focus of the second year.”A version of this article appears in print on October 24, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline:  U.S. Leader in ISIS Fight Is Leaving as Russia Enters .
