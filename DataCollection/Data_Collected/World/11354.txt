More than 8,000 schools were reopening, although attendance at many was poor amid some skepticism that the crisis was over. Unicef helped train 9,000 teachers in Ebola prevention and safety, it said, and is supplying schools with cleaning equipment and 24,300 hand-washing stations. The Ebola outbreak is estimated to have killed 10,587 people, mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberian schools reopened earlier this year. Advertisement
