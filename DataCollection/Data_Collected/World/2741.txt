MOSCOW — The Soviet Union took another stab at inter-planetary space exploration today [Nov. 12] — a field in which it has been unsuccessful for four years — with the launching of what is called the ‘‘Venus-2’’ spaceship to the earth’s cloud- covered ‘‘sister planet.’’ The 2,123-pound craft got off to a good start on its three- and-a-half-month flight to Venus, and then Tass, the government news agency, announced that it had been launched. Venus-1 was launched on Feb. 12, 1961, but its radios went dead about two weeks later. After that first failure, Soviet space engineers failed on at least four more occasions, according to American sources, to send rockets toward Venus. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 13, 1965
