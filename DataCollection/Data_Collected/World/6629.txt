A court on Monday convicted a former police official of crimes against humanity and homicide in the 1980 siege of the Spanish Embassy that ended in a fire, killing 37 people, including diplomats, Guatemalan politicians and student and rural activists. Among the dead was the father of the Nobel Peace laureate Rigoberta Menchú; he was a member of an indigenous group that seized the embassy to protest the military’s brutal campaign against Indian villages as part of its battle against leftist rebels. The three-judge tribunal ruled that the official, Pedro García Arredondo, 70, the leader of a special police investigative unit, cut off negotiations, ordered officers to attack the embassy and prevented anyone from leaving after the fire broke out. The cause of the fire has never been determined. Mr. García was sentenced to 90 years in prison for his actions in the embassy fire and the killing of two students at a subsequent mass funeral. He is already serving a 70-year prison sentence for his role in the 1981 disappearance of a student leader.A version of this brief appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Guatemala: Former Police Official Is Convicted in 1980 Embassy Siege.
