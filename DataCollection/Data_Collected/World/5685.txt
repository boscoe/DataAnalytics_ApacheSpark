No group immediately claimed responsibility for the assault. But it bore the hallmarks of the Shabab, the Somali Islamist militant group. The attack on Thursday took place in the village of Mangai in Lamu County, the areaâ€™s police commander, Ephantus Kiura, said. The Shabab have said they will continue their assaults to persuade Kenya to pull its troops out of Somalia, where its forces have joined other African Union troops battling the militants.
