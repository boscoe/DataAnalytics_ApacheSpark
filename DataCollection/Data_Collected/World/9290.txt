The former first lady Simone Gbagbo was sentenced Tuesday to 20 years in prison for her part in Ivory Coast’s postelection violence four years ago, which killed more than 3,000 people. An Ivorian court found her guilty of undermining state security, though her lawyer, Rodrigue Dadje, called it a “purely political decision.” Former President Laurent Gbagbo awaits trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of war crimes. Violence erupted after Mr. Gbagbo refused to accept his defeat in 2010 elections and rebels gave their support to Alassane Ouattara, now president. The Gbagbos were arrested in 2011 after French troops and United Nations peacekeepers backed by pro-Ouattara forces stormed a bunker where they had been holed up in Abidjan.A version of this brief appears in print on March 11, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Ivory Coast: Former First Lady Sentenced to 20 Years.
