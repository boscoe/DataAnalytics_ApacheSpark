The Court of Justice agreed with a challenge to the applicability of the amnesty law filed by relatives of the victims, and it ordered the proceedings to resume. The plaintiffs made the verdict public late Tuesday. The ruling was issued Nov. 27 but not publicly released. Mr. Bouterse and 25 allies from his time as a military dictator in the 1980s avoided trial until 2007 on charges stemming from the abduction and killing of 15 prominent opponents. Mr. Bouterse returned to power in 2010 when he was elected president by Parliament. Two years later, lawmakers passed an amnesty law and the case stalled. Mr. Bouterse has accepted what he called “political responsibility” for the killings of the journalists, lawyers and union leaders by the military, but he said he was not present when they took place. Witnesses in the trial have disputed that claim. Advertisement
