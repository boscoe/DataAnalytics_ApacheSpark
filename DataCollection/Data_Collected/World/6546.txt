BEIJING —  Chinese authorities confirmed on Saturday that 22 people had died after a tugboat with an international team capsized on a test voyage in eastern China.Four Singaporeans, an Indian, an Indonesian, a Japanese and a Malaysian were among the dead in the accident on the Yangtze River, and the 14 other victims were Chinese, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.The newly built, 98-foot-long boat, the Wanshenzhou 67, was on a test voyage on Thursday in the Fubei Channel of the river in Jiangsu Province when it suddenly overturned.The ship’s owner, parts suppliers and engineers were among the 25 people aboard for the test.Three people were rescued, all Chinese, including one man who was freed when rescuers cut through the bottom of the boat’s hull early Friday — 14 hours after it went down.AdvertisementAn official at the Jiangsu maritime search and rescue center, who declined to give his name, confirmed that 22 people were dead.Swift currents hampered the rescue operation, and it was not until Saturday morning that rescue teams were able to pull the vessel to the surface and then to shallow waters for a thorough search inside.AdvertisementThe 368-ton ship was built by the Anhui Bengbu Shenzhou Machinery Company.A version of this article appears in print on January 18, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Tugboat on Test Run Capsizes, Killing 22 People in East China.
