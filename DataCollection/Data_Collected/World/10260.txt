ROME — Italy’s highest court postponed until Friday its ruling on whether to uphold the murder convictions of Amanda Knox and her Italian former boyfriend.A daylong hearing on Wednesday was insufficient for lawyers to plead their cases in the complicated case, which has already gone through several degrees of judgment.Prosecutors and defense lawyers reiterated and challenged many of the arguments that made the 2007 murder of a British student, Meredith Kercher, a headline-grabbing case. The Court of Cassation in Rome was mobbed by members of the news media, and the presiding judge, Gennaro Marasca, moved the proceedings to the court’s grand hall because the scheduled courtroom was too small to hold the many observers.Defense lawyers for Raffaele Sollecito, Ms. Knox’s former boyfriend, will give their statements on Friday morning before the court retires to deliberate. A ruling is expected later that day.A version of this article appears in print on March 26, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Italy: Ruling Delayed in American’s Case.
