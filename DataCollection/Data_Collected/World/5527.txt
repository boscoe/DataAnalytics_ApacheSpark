NEW YORK — A great fight has taken place with the Indians at Wounded [Knee] Creek, and there has been much loss of life. Big Foot, having declared that he was ill, surrendered with 150 of his braves to Major Whiteside and the Seventh Cavalry. Finding, however, that the remainder of the Indians were unwilling to give up their arms, the cavalry, which was five hundred strong, surrounded them and closed on them to within gun reach. Suddenly the braves, snatching their guns from beneath their blankets, poured a concerted volley into the troops, who were taken unawares. Four or five of the United States soldiers were killed, and over forty were wounded, many of whom will die. It is computed that two hundred Indians were killed. — The New York Herald, European Edition, Dec. 31, 1890
