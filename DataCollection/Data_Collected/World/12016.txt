Underlying themes include the deadly assaults by extremist militant groups and criminal organizations like drug cartels, as well as the press intimidation and coercion by governments.Christiane Amanpour, a CNN journalist, wrote in the report’s foreword: “From government surveillance and censorship to computer hacking, from physical attacks to imprisonment, kidnapping and murder, the aim is to limit or otherwise control the flow of information — an increasingly complicated effort, with higher and higher stakes.”The report’s essays include an examination of how journalists have become subjects in violent propaganda videos, most notably the beheadings of James Foley and Steven J. Sotloff last summer by the Islamic State militant group in Syria.Other essays examine how journalists deal with the stresses of physical threats and how autocratic governments jail and intimidate journalists deemed to be security threats. The report also includes a look at different types of censorship practiced in Hong Kong, India, Libya, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and West African countries affected by the Ebola epidemic.The Committee to Protect Journalists, based in New York, compiles databases aimed at measuring threats to press freedom around the world. They include country-by-country information on journalists who have been killed or imprisoned. Last week, in advance of its annual report, the group released a list of the 10 most censored countries.Advertisement
