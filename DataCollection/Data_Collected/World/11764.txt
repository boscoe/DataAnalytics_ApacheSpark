Crews worked around the clock to complete roads and passes leading to the Expo site, about six miles from Milan’s city center.In central Milan, too, celebrated for its fashion and design, bright orange construction barriers with the ubiquitous Expo logo are in vogue, cordoning off piazzas, monuments and boulevards.With only days to go before the opening of the fair on May 1, many Italians are fretting: Will the Expo be ready to welcome the 20 million people who are expected to attend the six-month event?Speaking like a man used to such questions, Mayor Giuliano Pisapia brushed off the worries. “No world’s fair has ever started with everything ready,” he said in a recent interview. Dismissing alarmist, and now regular, newspaper reports filled with concerns about Italy’s image abroad, he added, “Everything that is supposed to be ready will be ready.”But the path to the grand opening of Expo Milano 2015 has been filled with bumps, many of which are deeply familiar to Italians: delays, cost overruns and the arrests last year of Expo officials and contractors on corruption charges.And even as the event has been embraced as an opportunity to show off Italy’s pride, its excellence in food, controversy surrounded the decision to allow companies like McDonald’s to join the fair’s numerous partners.The scandals and disarray have raised the stakes for the international event, which Italy is hoping will deliver an economic jolt, if only a temporary one, after years of lackluster growth. Officials are counting on the fair to generate about 10 billion euros, or $10.7 billion, for the city, half of which will come from foreign businesses. It is also expected to create roughly 19,000 jobs on the site and four times as many jobs outside the exhibition area. A successful Expo, officials believe, could lure foreign investors to Milan on a permanent basis.For those involved with the Expo project, its success is a question of “bella figura” for Italy, the need to present itself at its best. It is also a redemptive response to the naysayers who were critical of the project from the start, accusing organizers of slapdash planning and ineptitude. Several large projects that were to be part of the Expo never materialized, critics note. And even the minutiae are wanting.“It’s just not possible that two weeks before the event, there aren’t better street markers leading to the site,” said Luca Beltrami Gadola, who has been tracking and critiquing the evolution of the Expo on the blog Arcipelago Milano. “This denotes pure disorganization; it has nothing to do with dishonest deals.”Like other critics, he says that Italy’s bureaucratic burdens, which generate a “do nothing” mentality, leave the country “culturally unprepared when something important happens.”Mr. Pisapia said the criticism was overstated. “Great strides” have been made, he said, adding that when he became mayor in 2011, almost three years after Milan was chosen to host the world’s fair, a site for it had not yet been selected.Now workers are putting the finishing touches on 53 national pavilions and structures for participating international groups, corporations and nongovernmental organizations, as well as for roughly 150 restaurants, exhibition areas and an arena, each based on the Expo’s official theme: “Feeding the planet, energy for life.”But the corruption scandal, in particular, stung this city, the country’s economic capital, which is still trying to shake off its association with the Clean Hands investigation of the 1990s that decapitated the Italian political class. More recent scandals prompted the Italian government to appoint an anticorruption commissioner, Raffaele Cantone, to monitor all major public contracts in the country.The decision appears to have borne fruit. Closer scrutiny of Expo contracts helped speed up construction at the site and “avoided potential irregularities,” Mr. Cantone said.Italy also asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to measure its progress in fighting corruption, and the organization validated Italy’s procedures, Mr. Cantone said.The issue of food has been particularly contentious. After Expo officials announced in late February that McDonald’s would be an official sponsor, alongside partners like Coca-Cola, exhibitors like Slow Food, an international movement that advocates local and quality foods, protested.“The presence of McDonald’s means that the planet can continue to gorge itself on fast food or junk food — call it whatever you like — without concern for our own well-being,” the Slow Food association said in a statement. Including such multinationals at the fair gave the message that “feeding the planet or fattening it, caring for it or depleting its resources, seems to be the same thing,” Slow Food said in the statement.Expo officials are confident that everything will fall into place once the event opens and the debates on the Expo’s theme of food begin in earnest.Thousands of events have been scheduled on the sidelines of the fair, transforming Milan into “a big stage in which the world represents itself,” said Claudio Artusi, the outside events coordinator. Attractions like scientific debates, congresses, concerts and art exhibits, are intended to keep Expo visitors longer.The city has identified Leonardo da Vinci — who lived at the court of Ludovico Sforza, duke of Milan, for roughly 16 years — as its “hero,” Mr. Del Corno said, aiming to ignite the same kind of creative energy “and thirst for knowledge” that fueled Leonardo’s genius. An exhibition of the artist’s works, arguably the most important ever in Italy, just opened at Palazzo Reale.The Milanese, long accustomed to the throngs of visitors that invade the city for the Salone del Mobile, an annual design fair, and for various fashion weeks, mostly worry about traffic jams and having their movements restricted by tighter security.Some shopkeepers complained that the Expo site was too far from the city center to make much of an economic impact, while others, closer to the exhibition site, complained that their business had been hurt by years of construction and other work.Others were more optimistic.“Most people know that something underhanded happened with the contracts on the site,” said Valentina Dispensieri, the owner of a wine shop in Milan. “But lots of people think that the Expo is a good opportunity to showcase a better way of life, paying attention to what you eat and produce in the most sustainable way possible.”Advertisement
