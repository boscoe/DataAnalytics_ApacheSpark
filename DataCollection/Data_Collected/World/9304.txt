Mofeed al-Hasayna, the Palestinian minister of public works, said construction would begin in two days, but noted that the Qatari project would cover only a fraction of the 130,000 homes hit by Israeli strikes last summer.Qatar’s $1 billion is part of $5.4 billion pledged by international donors last fall in Cairo both to rebuild Gaza and to prop up the Palestinian Authority, perpetually in budget trouble. Palestinian officials have complained for months that few donors have fulfilled their pledges, stalling reconstruction, amid continuing conflict between the government and Hamas, the Islamist faction that dominates Gaza.Advertisement
