Mme. Sarah Bernhardt, who recently arrived in Paris to rehearse her new play, has announced that she will leave on December 25 for her postponed American tour. Though the great artist had just come from the theatre fatigued from the daily rehearsals, she received a Herald correspondent at her home on boulevard Pereire, and talked at length of her trip to America. ‘‘I do not know yet exactly what my répertoire will be,’’ said Mme Bernhardt. ‘‘I may give ‘Les Cathéderales,’ a new play in verse by Eugène Morand with music by Gabriel Pierné. The fact that many men of my supporting company are fighting for their country and four have already been killed will necessarily limit my répertoire. It is almost impossible to find a leading man, so I shall have to choose acts from different plays where I shall appear largely alone, and certain parts will have to be filled by women.” — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 2, 1915
