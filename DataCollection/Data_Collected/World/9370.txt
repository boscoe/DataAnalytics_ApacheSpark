He said that the robbery appeared to have been intricately planned and executed.Paris has been shaken by a series of brazen smash-and-grab robberies in recent years around the Place Vendôme.Last March, masked robbers armed with a pump-action gun and an ax struck Colette, an emporium of cool, smashing a display case of watches and fleeing on a motorcycle with luxury watches worth more than $645,000.In 2008, in another wealthy neighborhood, four men, three of whom were dressed as women, attacked a Harry Winston jewelry store, escaping with sacks of emeralds, rubies and diamonds valued at more than 80 million euros, or about $105 million at the time. Eight men, including a security guard who worked at the store, were recently tried and convicted of the crime and sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 years.Advertisement
