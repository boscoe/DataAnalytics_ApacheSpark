Hundreds marched Monday in Kabul, the Afghan capital, demanding justice for a woman beaten to death on Thursday by a mob over false allegations she had burned a Quran. The mob of men beat the woman, a religious scholar named Farkhunda, 27, threw her body off a roof, ran over it with a car, set it on fire and threw it into the Kabul River near one of Kabul’s most renowned mosques. She was buried amid a huge public outcry on Sunday, her coffin carried by women’s activists who defied the tradition of men-only pallbearers and funerals. Protesters who gathered Monday  demanded that the government prosecute all those responsible for her death. The attack was captured by cellphone cameras and has been widely distributed on social media. Kabul’s police chief, Abdul Rahman Rahimi, said that 18 people had been arrested and that all had acknowledged their role in the killing.A version of this brief appears in print on March 24, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Afghanistan: Justice Sought for Woman Killed by Mob.
