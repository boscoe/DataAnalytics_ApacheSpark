BERLIN —  How to get along in Germany: Follow its laws, including showing respect for all religions, especially in the case of Jews, to whom the country has a historical obligation. Don’t be late. Do shake hands. And learn a few basic phrases, from “Cheers” to “I don’t eat pork.”These are among the tips in a new guidebook intended to help immigrants adapt to life in Germany.With figures released Thursday showing that some 758,400 asylum seekers arrived in Germany in the first 10 months of the year — 181,000 in October alone — officials face the daunting task of integrating people from vastly different cultures, who speak different languages and are largely Muslim, into a mainly Christian nation.The latest tool is a bright-blue, 142-page book, “Germany: First Information for Refugees.” Written in German and Arabic, it is available for about $10 in bookstores and free online.“We hope this book will serve as an initial contribution to integration,” Manuel Herder said in a statement. His company published the book with funding from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which is close to the governing Christian Democratic Union.AdvertisementThe book addresses the rule of law, the role of the police and cultural norms, especially those that could pose conflict for a largely Muslim refugee population. It also provides a legal definition of who is a refugee in the eyes of German law, and what happens if this status is not granted.
                The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.            In the “Home and Car” section, one of “33 Useful Tips” notes that “many Germans value cleanliness and order, especially in their homes.”AdvertisementWhat may sound like clichés or parodies are meant as practical advice to help newcomers avoid conflict while paving the way for their integration — a sore point for Germans, who in the past have made little effort to enfold immigrants, on the theory that they would not be staying long. This was especially true of migrants from southern Europe and Turkey who were recruited to fill jobs in factories in booming West Germany in the early 1960s.“It was assumed that many of them would go back home again, but many have remained over generations,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an address last month. “Consequently, we are handling it very differently.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

More training will be available to help refugees get jobs, and hundreds of children are receiving welcome classes or other services to help them integrate into schools.Public television stations have produced guides in German, Arabic and English, and last month, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper published a special edition in Arabic.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
