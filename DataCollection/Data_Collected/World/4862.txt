NEW YORK — The French chief hired to add some spice to White House state dinners by President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy in 1961 has submitted his resignation. The chef, René Verdon, said today [Dec. 17] he did not like what had happened to the White House cuisine since the Johnsons moved in and that he would be leaving at the end of the year. Mr. Verdon said he did not mind what the first family wanted to eat for their own meals but added: ‘‘I don’t want to lose my reputation.’’ He said it was ‘‘very lousy’’ to have frozen foods in the president’s house. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 18, 1965
