A State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said the Saudis should review the case of the blogger, Raif Badawi, who was arrested in 2012 and charged with such offenses as cybercrime and disobeying his faith. He was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison, a fine of more than $266,000 and 1,000 lashes. Amnesty International said Mr. Badawi, who had run a website that included articles critical of senior Saudi religious figures, was to undergo the first round of 50 lashes on Friday. Advertisement
