WASHINGTON — The United States has sent fourteen of its best scientists to Central and South America to work with specialists of those countries in developing a rubber supply for the Western Hemisphere. Faced with the threat of having rubber imports from the Dutch East Indies and Africa cut off by the European and Asiatic wars, officials of all the Pan-American republics are co-operating. It should be possible to develop plantations which would be producing rubber within five years, the earliest time at which young rubber trees can be tapped, says Dr. Loren G. Polhamus, rubber expert of the Department of Agriculture. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 28, 1940
