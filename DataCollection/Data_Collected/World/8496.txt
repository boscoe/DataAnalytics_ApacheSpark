Three jailed Mauritanian antislavery activists began a hunger strike on Monday to protest “squalid conditions” and abuse by the prison authorities, their campaign group said in a statement. Biram Dah Abeid, the runner-up in presidential elections last year, is serving two years in prison, along with an aide, Bilal Ramdane, and Djiby Sow, a rights campaigner. The men were sentenced for “belonging to an illegal organization,” the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement, among other charges. Amnesty International says the activists were arrested while trying to educate people about land rights in the west African country, which did not abolish slavery until 1981. Campaigners say the government has failed in the past to acknowledge the extent of forced labor, a particularly sensitive issue in Mauritania.A version of this brief appears in print on February 24, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Mauritania: Antislavery Activists Begin Hunger Strike Over Prison Conditions.
