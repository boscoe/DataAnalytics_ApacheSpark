Secretary of State John Kerry held his first meeting with his Iranian counterpart on Monday since an initial nuclear accord was announced in Lausanne, Switzerland, early this month.Yet while the main focus was on overcoming the obstacles to a final agreement to constrain Iran’s nuclear program, the crisis in Yemen also cast a shadow over the meeting.“I am confident that Yemen will be mentioned,” Mr. Kerry told reporters shortly before meeting with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran.“Yemen’s future should be decided by Yemenis,” Mr. Kerry added, “not by external parties and proxies.”AdvertisementMore than 1,000 people have been killed since Houthi rebels, who practice a variant of Shiite Islam, swept from Yemen’s north, taking advantage of years of infighting among Sunni leaders. A coalition of Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia, is trying to push back the Houthis, who American officials assert have been sent arms and money by Iran.AdvertisementLast week, Saudi Arabia announced that it was shifting to a new phase of military intervention in Yemen in which its airstrikes might be suspended if the Houthis ceased their attacks. But the clashes and the bombing have continued.On Monday, Jamal Benomar, the departing United Nations envoy on the crisis, warned of a new danger — that efforts to impose an arms embargo on Yemen might worsen the humanitarian crisis.Mr. Benomar said that he had told the Security Council in a private meeting that the application of a new targeted arms embargo “could inadvertently restrict the flow of much-needed commercial goods and humanitarian assistance to Yemen, including food, fuel and medical supplies among others.”So far, there are no signs that the differences over Yemen have interfered with the United States’ and Iran’s push for a nuclear agreement, which has a deadline of the end of June for completion. Iran badly wants economic sanctions to be lifted as soon as possible as part of a nuclear accord.And the Obama administration has been at pains to persuade Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states that its quest for a nuclear agreement does not mean that it is naïve about Iran’s support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, its backing of militias in Iraq or its aid to the Houthis.Yet the crisis has underscored the sharp divide between the United States and Iran on regional issues, even though they share a common foe in the Islamic State.In his remarks on Monday, Mr. Kerry defended Saudi Arabia’s handling of the crisis, saying the Saudis had been prepared to engage in political talks until the Houthis pressed their offensive.

Mohammad Ali Jafari, head of the 150,000-strong Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, said that the Saudi airstrikes were “shameless.” He asserted that the Saudi leadership was on the verge of collapse and would be toppled soon, “God willing.”General Jafari is officially in charge of protecting Iran’s revolution and leadership, and of directing the regional efforts of the elite Quds Force, the unit involved in supporting, advising and, some say, leading Shiite and other militias in the region.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Afterward, a State Department official said little beyond calling the meeting “productive.”The Obama administration’s efforts to negotiate deeper cuts in the nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia have been stymied by Moscow. So Mr. Kerry announced a modest gesture to try to show that the United States was still interested in more far-reaching measures. The dismantlement of nuclear warheads that are being taken out of service, Mr. Kerry said, would be stepped up by 20 percent.Mr. Zarif used his speech to the nonproliferation treaty conference to lash out at Israel. Israel’s “possession of nuclear weapons,” he charged, was the greatest danger to the treaty.Michael R. Gordon reported from New York, and Thomas Erdbrink from Tehran.
