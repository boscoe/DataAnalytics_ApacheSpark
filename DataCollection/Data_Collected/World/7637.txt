MUNICH — Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was assailed by hard-liners in Tehran last month for talking a widely photographed walk in Geneva with Secretary of State John Kerry during a break in their talks on Iran’s nuclear program.Conservative Iranian lawmakers even signed a petition asking Mr. Zarif to appear before Parliament to provide an explanation. “There is no conceivable ground for intimacy between the foreign ministers of Iran and America,” said the petition, Reuters reported at the time.On Friday, Mr. Zarif, who has a well-deserved reputation as a smooth-talking diplomat who likes to banter with Western reporters, was much less visible.Mr. Zarif and his team met with Mr. Kerry and his aides for more than an hour on the sidelines of a security conference here. Helga Schmid, a senior European Union diplomat, also attended the session.AdvertisementThere was no walk this time, and a small media pool of photographers and reporters was not allowed to observe the customary handshake and greetings at the start of the session. American officials made it clear that was Iran’s decision.The Iranians had a limited amount of time and “wanted to use the time to focus on substance,” said a senior State Department official, who declined to be identified in accordance with the agency’s protocol for briefing reporters.AdvertisementThe United States, its negotiating partners and Iran are racing to meet a late March deadline for concluding the framework of an agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
