WASHINGTON — The American Red Cross announced today [Dec. 4] that war prisoners in European camps will receive 5,000 packages of food before the end of the year as a result of an urgent request of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. The shipment will be the first of what is to be known as a ‘‘prisoners-of-war package service,’’ the Red Cross said. The Red Cross announced that food would be sent first because of the great need, but that later shipments would include clothing also. The food now is being purchased and will be packed by a merchandising firm for the Red Cross. The parcels will weigh eleven pounds each, will cost approximately $2.75 and will contain evaporated milk, oatmeal, cheese, sardines, oleo margarine, dried fruit, corned beef, orange juice, sugar, cigarettes and vitamized dry beverages requiring only the addition of water. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 5, 1940
