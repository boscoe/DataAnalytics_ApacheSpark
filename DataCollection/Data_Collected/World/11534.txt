While Saudi Arabia’s ambassador in Washington offered an upbeat assessment this week of the air campaign in Yemen led by his nation, calling it “very, very successful,” civilians living under bombardment for more than three weeks expressed terror and despair in messages posted online.
            My life In #Yemen, no Electricity, no water, no food no security, no work. We're dying every day.        
            I hear heavy air strikes, heavy explosions today so close to my house in #Sanaa
#Decisive_Storm International aid agencies estimated on Friday that more than 1,000 people had been killed in the past month. Dramatic evidence of the scale of the destruction — shared on Twitter by Mohammed al-Asaadi, a political activist in Yemen’s capital, Sana — showed missiles leveling a presidential palace in the southwestern city of Taiz.

It is a symbol of pride. #Yemen pic.twitter.com/INMRwWSgHY Residents of Taiz reported heavy fighting on Friday between army troops supporting the country’s Saudi-backed president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who has taken refuge in Saudi Arabia, and an alliance of Houthi rebels and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.

            Saudi warplanes destroyed today this republican palace in Taiz central Yemen to scare Houthis! pic.twitter.com/PyrAcbGShe From the early hours of Friday, and continuing throughout the day, residents of Sana reported that the intense bombardment there was taking a psychological toll.
            Children are extremely terrified; neighbors are quiet tonight than usual. The entire #Sanaa is in dark for four nights. #Yemen needs peace.        
            After all of this is done. The Saudis better pay for PTSD treatment of 26 million Yemenis. No kidding!        
            24 nights straight of heavy bombing. More than any human could take. Two million Sanaa residents are asking this tonight: and then what?

            Sana'a dark sky just lit up with a mid night sun (missile) that hit Faj Attan hill now. #Yemen Dispatches from the southern city of Aden, where supporters of a southern separatist movement have taken up arms against Houthi rebels, also painted a grim picture of residential neighborhoods turned into war zones. Among the fighters there were some residents of the central district of Al Mualla who took up arms against the rebels from the north.
