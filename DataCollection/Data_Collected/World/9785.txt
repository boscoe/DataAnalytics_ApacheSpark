ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan hanged nine prisoners on Wednesday as part of a broader acceleration of executions that has drawn loud protests from human rights groups.The executions raised to 48 the total number of prisoners put to death since December, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty. The pace of executions drastically quickened this week. Twelve prisoners were hanged on Tuesday, and the Interior Ministry indicated that 40 more executions were planned for the coming week.But officials say that one prisoner scheduled to be hanged on Thursday had been given a reprieve: Shafqat Hussain, who was 14 when sentenced to death in 2004 after being convicted of murdering a 7-year-old boy. Rights groups have held the case up as an example of Pakistan’s flawed judicial system; advocates say that Mr. Hussain confessed to the killing after days of torture by the police, and that he had been denied proper legal representation for years.Mr. Hussain’s appearance on the schedule of executions this week led to an outcry by family members and rights advocates who had been following his case.His mother, Makhni Begum, pleaded for his life on Wednesday. Hours later, the government said that it had postponed Mr. Hussain’s execution pending a review.An article on March 19 about the hanging of nine prisoners in Pakistan misstated the year that one prisoner, Shafqat Hussain, who was given a reprieve, was sentenced to death. It was 2004, not 2001. (The error was discovered only recently, when an editor was working on a follow-up article.)A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Pakistan Hangs Nine Prisoners.
