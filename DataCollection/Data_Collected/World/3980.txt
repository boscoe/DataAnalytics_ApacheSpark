It is the first major retreat in Cuba’s policy of allowing unrestricted travel, put in place in 2013. The government announced that health professionals in specialties that had been drained by large-scale emigration would now be required to get permission from Health Ministry officials to leave the country. The measure potentially affects one-tenth of the country’s work force. Advertisement
