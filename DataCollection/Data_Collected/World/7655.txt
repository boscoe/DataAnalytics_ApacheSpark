HONG KONG — East Timor’s prime minister, Xanana Gusmão, submitted his resignation Friday as the government began a political restructuring meant to ease the young country’s often-fraught politics.Mr. Gusmão, 68, was a leader of East Timor’s movement to gain independence from Indonesia and served as the country’s first president, from 2002 to 2007, before spending seven years as prime minister.In a statement announcing Mr. Gusmão’s move, Minister of State Agio Pereira said, “Members of government, staying, leaving and incoming, are all working together, prioritizing the national interest.”Mr. Gusmão’s replacement has not been announced, but the structural reshuffling is expected to bring more opposition figures into the government.A former Portuguese colony, East Timor was invaded by Indonesia shortly after declaring independence in 1975. Its citizens voted to secede from Indonesia in 1999, and it became a state in 2002.Though rich in natural gas, the country has struggled with widespread poverty, corruption and periods of political instability and street violence.A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: East Timor: Prime Minister Steps Down.
