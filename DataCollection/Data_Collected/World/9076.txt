BAGHDAD —  Iraq’s largest offensive against Islamic State militants came a step closer to the city of Tikrit on Friday, with Shiite militiamen and Iraqi troops advancing into the town of Dour, according to Iraqi state television.Dour, just south of Tikrit, is home to Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, the highest-ranking member of Saddam Hussein’s government who was never captured after the 2003 American-led invasion. A prominent figure in the ruling Baath Party, he went on to make common cause with Islamist insurgents against American occupying troops and is now believed to be an ally of the Islamic State.Despite setbacks in some villages over the past four days, the Islamic State fighters have managed to hold on to Tikrit, using suicide attacks and roadside bombs to augment their defense against a pro-government force of at least 30,000, most of them from Iranian-backed Shiite militias. The militias have played a crucial role in halting the Islamic State’s march through Iraq. But their close ties to Iran, and allegations that they have killed Sunni civilians in revenge attacks after taking over some areas, have raised fears that the militias’ counteroffensive into Iraq’s Sunni heartland could worsen the sectarian strife that the Islamic State seeks to exploit.“You must always act with self-control and avoid any emotional reaction when you lose one of your beloved ones,” Iraq’s most senior Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali Sistani, said in a Friday sermon read by an aide. “You must protect the families that the enemy uses as human shields.”
                Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.            The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has proved its ability in the past to fight on multiple fronts and appeared to do so again in recent days. Militants carried out attacks on security forces in the western province of Anbar even as the group’s fighters retreated in neighboring Salahuddin Province, leaving booby-trapped houses and roads behind to try to slow government advances.AdvertisementOfficials said that the Islamic State killed a number of pro-government forces in Anbar around the town of Karma on Thursday, and that in response, the army and air force bombarded those areas, prompting some families to flee.AdvertisementAyatollah Sistani’s Friday sermon also appeared to give the government a nudge on the need to give sufficient financing and supplies to Sunni tribes in Anbar Province, another stronghold of the Islamic State.“Many tribes in Anbar who are showing a patriotic attitude against ISIS are complaining from the shortage in weapons and ammunition and foodstuffs,” the sermon said. “They might be tempted to change their attitude.”Iraqi state television said Sunni tribal fighters played a role in the advance in Salahuddin Province. Militia leaders said their main role was to provide intelligence and basic information.Omar al-Jawoshy and Ahmed Saleh contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an employee of The New York Times from Salahuddin Province.A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Iraqi Forces Said to Near ISIS-Held Tikrit.
