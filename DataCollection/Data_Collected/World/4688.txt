VICHY — Pierre Laval is out as French Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister. Premier Marshal Henri Pétain proclaimed this change in the government to the French people in a broadcast tonight [Dec. 14], declaring that he was ‘‘taking a decision which I believe to conform to the interests of the country.’’ Pierre-Etienne Flandin has been named Foreign Minister. There will be no Vice-Premier in the reconstituted government. Pétain will remain as both Chief of State and Premier. The eighty-four-year-old marshal told the French people over the radio that France’s relations with Germany would remain unchanged. It was revealed also that Pétain, before making his broadcast, had sent a personal message to Fuehrer Adolf Hitler confirming his (Pétain’s) intention of pursuing a policy of Franco-German rapprochement. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 15, 1940
