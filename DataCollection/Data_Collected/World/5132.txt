LONDON — From Norway to Italy, Royal Air Force bombers blazed a trail of fire and destruction last night [Dec. 21] as they ranged across the Continent to strike at oil supplies and war industries of Germany and her Axis partner. While some of the large forces taking part in the night’s work attacked targets in the industrial Ruhr, central Germany and German-occupied countries, including Norway, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, others flew to Venice for the first time in the war and raided docks and factories at near-by Port Malghera. According to the Italian high command the British raided also the Adriatic port of Fiume, at the Italo-Yugoslav border. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 23, 1940
