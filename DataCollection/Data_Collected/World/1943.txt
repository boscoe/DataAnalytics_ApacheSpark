Twenty peacekeepers detained Monday by rebels in South Sudan were released on Thursday, the United Nations said. But the rebels were still holding 12 contractors, said a United Nations spokesman, Stephane Dujarric. A barge carrying fuel and equipment was traveling on the Nile, Mr. Dujarric said, when it was blocked by more than 100 heavily armed men. They detained the peacekeepers and crew, he said, and took the fuel. A version of this brief appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; South Sudan: Rebels Free Peacekeepers.
