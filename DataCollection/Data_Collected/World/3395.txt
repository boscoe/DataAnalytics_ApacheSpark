Fire yesterday practically destroyed the annex of the Bon Marché, the great store on the left bank of the Seine so well known to all residents in the American Quartier Latin of Paris. The upper floors of the annex, which is situated at the corner of the rue de Sèvres and at the rue du Bac, were used as a war hospital, nearly 200 wounded soldiers being tended there. Exciting scenes occurred during the rescue of these helpless heroes, and the doctors and nurses of the hospital showed remarkable devotion. Every man was safely transferred to the neighboring Hôpital Laënec, in the rue de Sèvres. The conflagration meanwhile assumed gigantic proportions, and firemen were summoned from every station in the city to fight the flames. The alarm was given at half-past three in the afternoon the whole building was blazing. The burning goods caused a thick, black smoke to accompany the flames, and six firemen were overcome by these fumes. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 23, 1915
