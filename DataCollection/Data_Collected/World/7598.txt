LONDON — The former glam rocker Gary Glitter was found guilty on Thursday of sexually abusing three young girls decades ago, and he could spend the rest of his life in prison.Paul Gadd, 70, whose stage name is Gary Glitter, was convicted by a London jury of one count of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13 between 1977 and 1980. He was acquitted of three other counts and left the courtroom blowing kisses. He will be sentenced at the end of February.Prosecutors said that Mr. Gadd abused his access to young fans to assault them, and they described how Mr. Gadd had tried to force himself on a girl, who was younger than 10 at the time, in the mid-1970s. The victim came forward 20 years after the episode, after Mr. Gadd was jailed for some months in 1999 when he admitted possessing 4,000 images of child pornography.He was deported from Cambodia in 2002 and convicted in Vietnam in 2006 of sexually abusing two girls, for which he was sentenced to jail. After returning to Britain, he was placed on the Sex Offenders Register for life.Mr. Gadd was arrested as part of a police operation begun in the wake of sex abuse claims against the BBC star Jimmy Savile, who died in 2011. The former radio D.J. Dave Lee Travis, the Australian entertainer Rolf Harris and the celebrity publicist Max Clifford have been convicted of sexual offenses.A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Britain: Ex-Star Convicted of Sex Abuse.
