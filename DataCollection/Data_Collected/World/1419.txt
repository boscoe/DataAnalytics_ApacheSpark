Students demonstrating against a proposed tuition increase had confrontations with the police outside Parliament in Cape Town.JOHANNESBURG — Riot police officers and students protesting against tuition increases clashed on Wednesday outside the Parliament building in Cape Town, the latest in a series of student demonstrations that have gripped South Africa this year.Police officers fired stun grenades and tear gas as hundreds of university students tried to force their way into the building as the finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, delivered a speech about the national budget. Television coverage of the protests showed officers holding shields and students, some of them hurling water bottles at the police. Officers and students shoved one another in the tense standoff.Blade Nzimande, the minister of higher education, could be seen using a megaphone to try to speak to the crowd of thousands, but his words were drowned out by the protests.Demonstrations have roiled several South African universities this year, often revolving around economic and racial issues. Wednesday’s protest appeared to have been led by students at the University of Cape Town, considered the country’s best university and the focus of many intense demonstrations this year.Protesters have criticized the university, as well as the country’s other leading universities, of having failed to sufficiently increase the percentage of black students and faculty members a generation after the end of apartheid.In recent days, students have shut down several universities as part of their opposition to planned tuition increases. Mr. Nzimande has said this week that increases would be capped at 6 percent for 2016, but the South African Students Congress is opposing any increase.A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Africa; South Africa: Students and Police Clash.
