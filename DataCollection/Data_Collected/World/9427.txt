The government’s Center for Food Safety found three samples of vegetables from Japan with “unsatisfactory” levels of radioactive contaminants in March 2011, the month that nuclear reactors in Fukushima, northeast of Tokyo, suffered partial meltdowns following a powerful earthquake and tsunami.Five years after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the northeast Japanese coast, Japan has not fully recovered.Other samples of Japanese food have occasionally been found to have low levels of radiation since the Fukushima disaster, the Hong Kong food center said.Some tea samples were found in Japan with radioactive contamination in the months immediately after the earthquake and tsunami. Tea plants can live at least 30 years and sometimes much longer.The importer of the tea sampled in Hong Kong withdrew it from the market.Advertisement
