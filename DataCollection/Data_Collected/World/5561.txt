INTENDENTE ALVEAR, Argentina — A federal judge threw out charges on Tuesday against Argentina’s president, Mauricio Macri, in an illegal phone-tapping case that has hung over him for years. The judge, Sebastián Casanello, dismissed charges that Mr. Macri participated in a wiretapping scheme that date to his tenure as the mayor of Buenos Aires.Mr. Macri, who began his four-year presidential term this month, was indicted in 2010 by a judge who accused him of directing a scheme to tap the phones of Sergio Burstein, a leader of relatives of victims of the bombing of a Buenos Aires Jewish center in 1994, and Néstor Daniel Leonardo, Mr. Macri’s brother-in-law. Mr. Macri denied the charges, saying they were invented by his political opponents.There was no clear evidence against Mr. Macri, Judge Casanello wrote in his ruling. Jorge Palacios — Mr. Macri’s former police chief, who is suspected of executing the scheme in large part — and other defendants are to go to trial in 2017.A version of this article appears in print on December 30, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Argentina: Case Against President Is Dismissed.
