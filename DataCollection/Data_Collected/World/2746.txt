The ease of creating informal roads through the flat, sandy desert in northern Syria could limit the effectiveness of an American-backed offensive to cut off a key Islamic State supply route. The operation seeks to retake control of the highway between Raqqa, the Islamic State’s capital in Syria, and Mosul, the largest city controlled by the group in Iraq.

As the Islamic State captured parts of Syria and Iraq, it avoided opposing forces and supplied sleeper groups by driving trucks across the landscape on zigzagging, informal roads. Satellite images of the area south of Sinjar show a number of local roads its fighters can use instead of the highway.

The secondary roads are slower, and they could flood in winter rains, but they will be sufficient to continue the flow of supplies from Raqqa to Mosul, according to Michael Knights, a military expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.“The only way to cut off this area is to establish military outposts within line of sight of each other, covered by a generous allocation of airpower,” he said.But the highway is critical to Kurdish and Iraqi forces, which rely on heavier fighting vehicles rather than the small bands of trucks used by the Islamic State. Kurdish fighters are accustomed to the mountainous terrain north of Sinjar, where driving off-road is impossible.“ISIS can just drive across the desert, but Kurdish and Iraqi military forces rely on roads and highways for tanks and other heavy equipment,” said Patrick Martin, a researcher at the Institute for the Study of War. There are well over 100,000 miles of unpaved roads weaving in and out of unpopulated areas in Syria and Iraq.
