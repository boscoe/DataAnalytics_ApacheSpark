JERUSALEM — The Palestinian Authority has paid its employees 60 percent of their December salaries, using loans to make up for a shortfall caused by Israel’s withholding of $127 million in tax revenue it collects on the Palestinians’ behalf.Israel halted the monthly transfer of taxes as punishment for the Palestinians’ move to join the International Criminal Court. Palestinian leaders have called the move “piracy.”A spokeswoman for the authority said the partial payment, made two weeks late, to some 150,000 workers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was financed with a series of bank loans.Arab nations have pledged $100 million as a safety net but have not yet provided any money. The payments only exacerbated tensions between the authority and Hamas, whose 40,000 workers in Gaza have not been paid for months and have been largely on strike since Sunday.Gaza news sites said 205 Palestinian Authority employees who are aligned with Muhammad Dahlan, a rival of President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, also did not receive paychecks. One Dahlan supporter, Nedal Khudra, called this “a new massacre” by the authority.Majd Al Waheidi contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Palestinian Authority Uses Loans to Pay Employees.
