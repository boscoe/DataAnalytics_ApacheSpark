The Islamic State has lost 14 percent of the territory it held in January, according to an analysis by IHS, a defense research firm. Airstrikes and ground offensives have forced the group to withdraw from some areas, but it has also made new gains.

Kurdish forces, backed by air support from the American-led coalition, regained control of some areas near the Turkish border. But the extremists’ grip on the major cities of Raqqa, in Syria, and Mosul, in Iraq, remains unchallenged. The group also still holds sections of the Syrian border with Turkey.TurkeyHasakaGainedby ISISLost by ISISMosulErbilControlledby ISISAleppoRaqqaIraqSyria20 MILESTurkeyHasakaLost by ISISMosulControlledby ISISRaqqaIraq20 MILESTurkeyHasakaLost by ISISMosulControlledby ISISRaqqaIraqControlling territory is a key part of Islamic State strategy because it feeds the group's caliphate rhetoric, which attracts foreign fighters. Territory is also a major source of revenue from taxes and fines that the group imposes.In November, Kurdish and Yazidi fighters gained control of Sinjar, in Iraq, and of parts of a strategic road between Syria and Iraq. That has made it more difficult for Islamic State fighters to travel between the two countries, but the group still controls smaller roads in the region.SINJAR MOUNTAINMosulHighway 47Section controlledby Kurdish and Yazidiforces since NovemberSYRIAIRAQLocal roadsSINJAR MOUNTAINMosulHighway 47Section controlledby Kurdish and Yazidiforces since NovemberSYRIAIRAQLocal roadsSYRIALocal roadsIRAQSINJAR MOUNTAINMosulHighway 47Section controlledby Kurdish and Yazidiforces since November“When they come under pressure, they don’t fight to the end. They withdraw and counterattack somewhere else,” said Columb Strack, an analyst for IHS.An example of that strategy was seen in May, when the group was losing control of areas near the border of Syria and Turkey. Instead of staying to defend the region, Islamic State fighters redoubled offensives on other front lines. The group was able to take over Palmyra, in central Syria, a city of historical and strategic importance, and Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, a Sunni-dominated area in Iraq. Both cities were previously under the control of each country’s government.SyriaControlledby ISISLost byISISHomsPalmyraLEB.Gainedby ISISIraqDamascus20 MILESSyriaControlledby ISISHomsPalmyraLEB.Gainedby ISISIraqDamascus“If they can move into these Sunni areas, it’s much easier for the Islamic State to gain traction and expand,” Mr. Strack added. “It’s much harder for them to hold on to Kurdish territory. In Sunni areas, in some places, the population welcomes them.”Another strategy used by the group is to shift attention from front lines by conducting bombings and assassinations inside enemy territory.TurkeyISIS activity fromNov. 1 to Dec. 14Currently underISIS controlIRANHasakaMosulErbilAleppoRaqqaKirkukIraqPalmyraHomsLEBANONBaghdadSyriaDamascusRamadiData includes assassinations, public executions, bombings and other activities by ISIS fighters as well as attacks by other actors against ISIS.ISRAELJORDANTurkeyISIS activity fromNov. 1 to Dec. 14Currently underISIS controlHasakaMosulErbilAleppoRaqqaKirkukIraqPalmyraHomsLEBANONBaghdadSyriaDamascusRamadiData includes assassinations, public executions, bombings and other activities by ISIS fighters as well as attacks by other actors against ISIS.JORDANISIS activity fromNov. 1 to Dec. 14Currently underISIS controlTurkeyMosulAleppoRaqqaHomsIraqLEB.SyriaRamadiDamascusBaghdadJORDANData includes bombings, assassinations, public executions and other activities by ISIS fighters as well as attacks by other actors against ISIS.ISIS activity fromNov. 1 to Dec. 14Currently underISIS controlIRANTurkeyMosulAleppoRaqqaHomsIraqLEB.SyriaRamadiDamascusBaghdadJORDANData includes bombings, assassinations, public executions and other activities by ISIS fighters as well as attacks by other actors against ISIS.A mix of Iraqi government forces and Shiite militias pushed the terrorist group out of Tikrit, in April, and Islamic State fighters are currently surrounded in Ramadi.TikritLost byISISControlledby ISISGainedby ISISIRANIraqBaghdadRamadi20 MILESTikritLost byISISControlledby ISISGainedby ISISIraqBaghdadRamadiAlthough militias were helpful in halting ISIS fighters, it will become more difficult for the militias to fight as they move farther from their home regions and into areas where they do not have the support of the local population. The use of paramilitary forces also raises sectarian tensions. Shiite militias in Iraq were accused of destroying hundreds of Sunni houses and businesses after retaking Tikrit.After months of trying to regain control of Ramadi, Iraqi security forces were finally able to surround it in early December. This week, government forces advanced into the city center.ContestedAlbu FarajIslamicStatecontrolAlbu JalibIraqigovernmentcontrolRamadiTamimGovernmentadvance in lateDecemberAnbarUniversityThe Iraqi government is present in contested areas,but continues to face resistance.1 MILEContestedIslamicStatecontrolIraqigovernmentcontrolRamadiGovernmentadvance in lateDecemberThe Iraqi government is present in contestedareas, but it still faces resistance in those zones.ContestedIslamicStatecontrolIraqigovernmentcontrolRamadiGovernmentadvance in lateDecemberThe Iraqi government is present in contestedareas, but it still faces resistance in those zones.ContestedIslamicStatecontrolIraqigovernmentcontrolRamadiGovernmentadvance in lateDecemberThe Iraqi government is present in contestedareas, but it still faces resistance in those zones.ContestedIslamicStatecontrolIraqigovernmentcontrolRamadiGovernmentadvance in lateDecemberThe Iraqi government is present in contestedareas, but it still faces resistance in those zones.Analysts say that the largest challenge ahead may be uprooting the group from Raqqa, its de facto capital, and from Mosul, the largest city under its control. The United States-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes in the region for more than a year, but a ground attack on either city is unlikely anytime soon.10 MILESMaps are equal scaleKurdish controlKurdishcontrolISIScontrolSyriaMosulRaqqaISIScontrolIraq10 MILESMaps are equal scaleKurdish controlISIScontrolSyriaRaqqaKurdishcontrolMosulIraqISIScontrol“I don’t see any imminent likelihood that ISIL will be eliminated,” said Michael E. O'Hanlon, an analyst for Brookings Institution, using another acronym for the group. “Mosul is more likely to be a project for later in 2016, once there’s some more opportunity to rebuild the Iraqi Army.”Additional work by Sarah Almukhtar and Tim WallaceAdvertisement
