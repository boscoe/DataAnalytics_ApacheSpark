ROME —  It seems there is a conflict with “deconfliction.” So, hello, “basic technical discussions.”The Obama administration on Wednesday rejected the notion that the United States and Russia were coordinating their side-by-side military campaigns in Syria, as American officials took pains to distance themselves from a combined ground and air offensive undertaken by the Syrian government and backed by Russian warplanes.Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter sharply took issue with suggestions, particularly in the Arab world, that the United States was cooperating with Russia, and he insisted that the only exchanges that the Pentagon and the Russian military could have on Syria at the moment were technical talks on how to steer clear of each other in the skies above the country.All last week, senior defense officials had described such discussions as “deconfliction” talks, but on Wednesday, as Russian jets pounded groups opposed to Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, and as Mr. Assad’s government embarked on a ground offensive, Mr. Carter downgraded even the semantics used to describe any Russian and American information-sharing.AdvertisementInstead, Mr. Carter called the conversations — which aren’t really even taking place yet — “basic technical discussions on safety procedures for our pilots over Syria.”
                A drastic escalation of fighting in Aleppo has shattered a partial truce.            He added pointedly, “That’s it.”His remarks came at a news conference in Rome with the Italian defense minister, Roberta Pinotti, before he flew to Brussels to confer with NATO partners on Russia and Syria. The remarks underscored an increased frustration within the administration, and particularly at the Pentagon, over what defense officials say has been Russian intransigence in responding to a Pentagon proposal on how American and Russian pilots can avoid each other in the skies over Syria.AdvertisementLast week, the administration used the terms “deconflict” and “deconfliction” again and again, after Russia began airstrikes in Syria — where the United States and members of an American-led coalition have long been conducting their own air campaign against the Islamic State.Secretary of State John Kerry called for “a military-to-military deconfliction discussion.”President Obama and Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, “agreed that it would be important to begin conversations on a practical, tactical level to deconflict coalition and Russian military activities inside of Syria,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, helpfully added.Pentagon officials said that for them, “deconfliction” meant simple things like deciding which language the two armed forces would communicate in, what radio frequency pilots would use and how they would go about sharing Syrian airspace. That, the officials said, was the sum of the initial American proposal to the Russians last week.The Air Force has used “deconflict” to describe efforts to reduce the risk of collision in combat airspace by separating warplanes’ flight paths. So Pentagon officials, at least, sounded at ease with the term, as the press secretary Peter Cook did last week when he said, “The purpose of these deconfliction discussions will be to ensure that ongoing coalition air operations are not interrupted by any future Russian military activity, to ensure the safety of coalition aircrews and to avoid misjudgment and miscalculation.”Well, no more.On Wednesday, the Pentagon dropped deconfliction from its lexicon after Russian officials said they had received no answer when they asked the United States to identify armed groups other than units of the Syrian Army that were fighting the Islamic State — so as to avoid them in airstrikes.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with his defense minister, Sergey K. Shoigu, on Wednesday to discuss military action in Syria.“If there are some forces — that also have weapons in their hands and are on the ground fighting, as the coalition says — with the Islamic State and they should not be touched, then wonderful,” said Maria Zakharova, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman. “Give the list, give the call signs of these people, tell us where are they located, explain why they shouldn’t be touched. Indeed, this information is not provided.”AdvertisementUnited States officials said the last thing they were going to do was provide coordinates for where American-backed opposition groups were, lest they be bombed by the Russians as part of Moscow’s goal of protecting Mr. Assad.And Pentagon officials said that until Russia got behind the American position that the campaign against the Islamic State should occur alongside an effort to remove Mr. Assad from power, they would limit any talks with the Russians to simply those about what frequencies their pilots should communicate on.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But ideally we would want to know more about what they are targeting and why, and that does not seem to be happening.”Andrew E.
