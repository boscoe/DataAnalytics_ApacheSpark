A Moscow appeals court on Tuesday upheld a suspended three-and-a-half-year prison sentence against Aleksei A. Navalny, a leader of Russia’s opposition to President Vladimir V. Putin who was convicted last year of fraud in a case widely seen as politically motivated. The court also released Mr. Navalny, an organizer of an opposition rally planned for March 1, from house arrest.

Mr. Navalny called his brother “a hostage.”A version of this brief appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Russia: Court Upholds Activist’s Suspended Sentence.
