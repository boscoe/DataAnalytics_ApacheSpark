The United States is proposing the creation of a United Nations sanctions committee for the South Sudan crisis and says an arms embargo is possible if the warring sides cannot stick to a peace deal. A draft resolution circulated Tuesday among United Nations Security Council members did not explicitly name South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, or the rebel leader Riek Machar as targets for sanctions that would include an asset freeze and travel ban, but it said people affected could include “leaders of any entity.” The resolution would not impose sanctions but would set up a mechanism for doing so.
