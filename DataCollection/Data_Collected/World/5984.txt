Foreign Minister Neneh Macdouall-Gaye named nine men she said had assaulted the presidential palace in the capital, Banjul, on Dec. 30, including Lt. Col. Lamin Sanneh, who led the elite State Guard before being dismissed and fleeing abroad. The minister’s statement was the first in which the government identified him publicly. She also named Njaga Jagne, a retired United States Army captain, and Papa Faal, a former Army sergeant, as well as members of Gambia’s security forces. Colonel Sanneh and Mr. Jagne were among four suspects killed when palace guards repelled the attack; one person was captured. Officials in the United States have charged two American citizens — Mr. Faal and Cherno Njie, a Texas businessman — in the plot. Mr. Jammeh took power in a coup 20 years ago and since then has stifled dissent in this West African nation. A failed coup plot in 2006 led to a crackdown and some executions, according to rights groups. Advertisement
