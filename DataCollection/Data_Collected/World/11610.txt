The civil war in Libya has made it easier for smugglers to transport people through the country. As a result, the number of people fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East to reach Europe via the Mediterranean Sea has surged since last year. So far this year more than 1,800 migrants may have drowned attempting the journey.

As the refugee surge continues, debate is growing in the European Union about the lack of unified immigration policies and funding for migrant rescue operations. European foreign and defense ministers agreed on May 18 to use naval forces to intercept and disrupt ships used by smugglers.
