The Interior Ministry said a police officer died from wounds suffered in the attack on his patrol in eastern Cairo’s populous Ein Shams district. One of the injured was a civilian, the ministry said. Egypt’s official news agency, MENA, reported earlier that security forces had sealed off the area, diverted traffic and searched for other bombs. An Egyptian militant group, Ajnad Misr, said on its Twitter account that its members had targeted the security forces as they were heading to the nearby Alf Maskan district, the scene of near-weekly clashes between the security forces and Islamist demonstrators. Subsequent protests in the district were dispersed by the police. Advertisement
