The wreckage was located by sonar equipment, but divers had not yet been able to examine it because of high waves and perilous currents, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency.“The four objects are in the priority search area,” Henry Bambang Soelistyo, the head of the agency, told reporters in Jakarta on Saturday.On Friday, officials said that they had recovered 46 bodies and identified three by the end of the sixth day of search operations.An Indonesian official told a local television station that some of the bodies were still belted into their seats.The official, Marsma Supriyadi, director of operations for the search and rescue agency, said eight of the bodies that had been recovered were sent to Surabaya, the capital of East Java.Advertisement“With luck we’ll find more because search operations are continuing,” he told reporters in Pangkalan Bun, close to the site where wreckage from the airliner was discovered Tuesday.AdvertisementAirAsia Flight 8501, en route to Singapore, crashed Sunday with 162 people aboard, about an hour after leaving Surabaya on what was supposed to be a flight of about 90 minutes. On Friday, Indonesia’s transportation ministry said that AirAsia had not been authorized to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route on Sundays and that the airline’s flights on that route had been suspended.Mr. Supriyadi, of the search and rescue agency, said three bodies had been positively identified after forensic examinations, including DNA and dental tests. The three were an AirAsia flight attendant and two passengers, he added.Indonesia’s health minister, Nila Moeloek, said Saturday that autopsies would be performed on some of the bodies brought to Surabaya, in the hope that the findings would shed light on what happened to the plane. She said that some of the victims’ families would not permit autopsies for religious or cultural reasons.
