Jewish settlers threw stones at American consular officials on Friday during a visit the officials made to the West Bank as part of an investigation into claims of damage to Palestinian agricultural property, the Israeli police and Palestinian witnesses said. A police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld, said the settlers threw rocks at the officials who had traveled to the area near the Jewish settlement of Adi Ad to look into Palestinian claims that settlers had uprooted scores of Palestinian olive trees the day before. He said that the Americans left the area and that the police had opened an inquiry after the filing of an official complaint. The State Department said it was “deeply concerned” by the attack.A version of this brief appears in print on January 3, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: West Bank: Settlers Throw Stones at American Consular Officials.
