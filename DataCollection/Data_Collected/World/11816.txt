They stood in the port one morning this week along with their husbands in the rising heat and humidity, figuring out what to do next.Thousands of people are making similar plans to leave Yemen, where the fighting seems to have spread everywhere at once, in a matter of weeks. More than 150,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, fleeing to other cities or into the unforgiving countryside, while others have crossed the borders to neighboring Saudi Arabia or Oman.AdvertisementA further 10,000 refugees have taken to boats in the last month, according to the International Organization for Migration. The numbers are nowhere near as large as those trying to reach Europe across the Mediterranean. But in a country under aerial bombardment by a Saudi-led military coalition and torn by civil war, many are having trouble reaching the boats. Relief workers say they are preparing for the numbers to swell, if conditions should ease, and are concerned about the safety of the voyage as more boats make the crossing.AdvertisementDebarking that morning was Abdu Hussain Ismail, a plumber from Djibouti who had gone to the Yemeni capital of Sana in search of work.But work became harder to come by in Sana, paralyzed by shortages of electricity and water, and by the fear of the airstrikes, and he had run out of money.Haykal Saleh worked as a security guard at the American Embassy in Yemen until it closed in February, when the Houthi rebels took control of the capital. The embassy had continued to pay his salary, he said, but Sana was no longer safe for his family, including his young daughter, who clung to his hand everywhere he went.“Very bad,” was the best description Mr. Saleh could manage of the weeks that had passed. “This war is very, very bad.”Last year was the deadliest year on record for people crossing the Gulf of Aden, with more than 240 migrants perishing. Yet, almost all of them left from the Horn of Africa, trying to reach Yemen, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency.People are now running the other way, their numbers constrained by a war that has made it hard to reach the sea.Fuel is in short supply, roads are dangerous to travel and some ports, like the southern city of Aden, have been transformed into battlefields.AdvertisementMilitiamen have prevented people from leaving in places, and the Saudi-led military coalition is imposing a naval blockade of the country.Even so, many are making the calculation it is more terrifying to stay in the violence-racked country than to flee.
                There were about 17 times as many refugee deaths from January to April this year as there were during the same period last year.            The refugees who arrived on the boat on Monday carried scalding memories of airstrikes and gunfire, as well as a healthy measure of disgust at the various Yemeni factions and foreign countries whose feuds, they said, had endangered the country.The boat carried about 160 people who had traveled inland from Sana, the capital in northern Yemen, to the port at Mokha. Many had passed through the city of Taiz, just as heavy fighting broke out there. The journey to the port in Djibouti was supposed to take 12 to 14 hours, but there were unexplained delays.The rate for passage has steadily gone up, to as much as $200 a person these days from about $50 a person, according to aid workers. But many of the businessmen who owned the boats had let those who could not pay ride free, several people said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ali Almasri, 28, a mechanical engineer, spoke angrily about the Saudi airstrikes, including a bombing that struck a weapons depot near his house in Sana, sparking a huge explosion that killed at least 25 people.Speaking of the Saudi role in Yemen, he said, “We believe they don’t want stability.”But Shawki Abdullah, a 44-year-old architect from southern Yemen who sat next to Mr. Almasri, said he supported the airstrikes, which he hoped would help southerners gain a state that was independent from the north.They were united in grief over what happened to the country and the deaths of friends. But as the war continues, “It widens the rift between us,” Mr. Abdullah said.The boat that arrived on Monday was filled with Yemenis with second passports or foreign citizens, for whom Djibouti was home or just a transit point.AdvertisementOther Yemeni citizens registered with the United Nations and were taken to camps outside the small town of Obock, where they were housed, for the moment, in an unfinished orphanage and a sports stadium, cared for but stranded in the remote, seaside town.Many of the refugees in the camps were residents of Aden, the scene of the fiercest fighting in Yemen’s conflict, where everyone seemed preoccupied with the safety of someone left behind.For Hassan Farid Abdullah, a medical lab technician, it was his father, a judge, who had received threats from men he had sent to prison but who had been released as the country descended into chaos.His father told Hassan to take his brother and sister abroad, and they found a ride on a boat with journalists who were returning from a brief trip to Aden.Ahmed Kulaib, who traveled to Djibouti with his wife and brother after catching a ride on a Russian naval ship, broke down after a brief phone call with his mother, who was still in Aden.They were unable to move around the city, she told her son. They were unable to find food. “It is a catastrophe,” Mr. Kulaib said, when he had recovered.Another group of young men sat in a tent at the stadium, recalling their recent days of fighting in Aden against the Houthis, the rebel group whose takeover of large parts of Yemen helped start the latest conflict.Amad Ali, 25, claimed he had killed people in combat and seemed haunted by what he had seen. “I’m alone here,” he said. “My father told me to run. Yemen is not safe.”A version of this article appears in print on April 24, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Fighting Prompts an Exodus From Yemen, Often on Boats.
