HARWICH, England — The seadogs of Britain are no longer a figure of speech at Harwich, one of England’s large eastern naval bases. In this busy port, nearly every trawler has a dog — some as many as three. More than fifty canine seagoers, plus a large number of cats, are aboard ships. The nucleus of this collection was formed at Dunkerque, where dogs swam after soldiers and were hauled aboard the outgoing ships. Since then the number has reached such proportions that the admiral of the fleet is making plans for a dog show. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 7, 1940
