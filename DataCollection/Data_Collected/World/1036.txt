Mr. Besigye, of the party Forum for Democratic Change, is being detained in his home near the capital, Kampala, as a preventive measure “to ensure that there is no breach of peace,” said the spokeswoman, Polly Namaye. Mr. Besigye was arrested because he planned public rallies — and not the indoor meetings for which he had received approval — in eastern Uganda, Ms. Namaye said. The Ugandan police have been accused of brutally breaking up rallies held by supporters of Mr. Besigye and former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, who also is running for president in next year’s election. This is the fourth time Mr. Besigye has run against President Yoweri Museveni, who has held power since 1986. Advertisement
