The accused priest, Msgr. Jesús Delgado, 77, the archdiocese’s vicar general until his suspension, played a crucial role in the effort to canonize Archbishop Óscar Romero, who was assassinated in 1980. “We ask for forgiveness from the victim and from society,” said Msgr. Rafael Urrútia of the archdiocese. Advertisement
