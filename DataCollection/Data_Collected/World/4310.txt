PARIS — The Paris Musicians Union, with French government backing, has launched a campaign to replace many American jazz performers here with French musicians. The drive, aimed at foreigners in general but largely affecting American Negro musicians, is violently opposed by some of the owners of leading jazz clubs. Intended to provide permanent work for French players, it has already resulted in orchestra changes in some clubs and in the surveillance of nightspots by Ministry of Labor inspectors counting foreigners. The campaign would allow one or two foreign headliners to continue playing in each club. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 9, 1965
