Gunmen attacked the headquarters of the South Western State government in Baidoa, killing at least four government soldiers and two civilians, a Somali official said Thursday. Three of the gunmen were also killed in the morning attack, said a local official, Ahmed Mohammed. Two explosions went off at the gate of the headquarters of the government offices followed by gunmen shooting their way onto the premises, said Capt. Hassan Hussein, a police official in Baidoa. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but it is similar to those carried out by the Shabab, an Islamist extremist group. Mr. Mohamed said two civilians believed to have been trying to steal the attackers’ car died after it was detonated by remote control.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
