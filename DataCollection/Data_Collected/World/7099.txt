Many of the children have never been to school, fighting instead for years for a rebel militia.“These children have been forced to do and see things no child should ever experience,” said Unicef’s South Sudan representative, Jonathan Veitch.Unicef officials said the rest of the children would disarm over the next several weeks, bringing a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy landscape.South Sudan has been upended by civil war for more than a year, with thousands of civilians killed and more than one million displaced. The oil-rich country, one of the world’s least developed, won its independence from Sudan in 2011 and has received billions of dollars in Western aid, especially from the United States.But in December 2013, intense clashes broke out between longstanding rivals in the government, quickly setting off a broader conflict between South Sudan’s two largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and the Nuer, after their leaders began feuding.Since then, international mediators have tried repeatedly to broker a peace agreement. They have suggested forming a power-sharing government between South Sudan’s current leaders, who are dominated by Dinka politicians, and the Nuer commanders who staged an insurrection.But the two sides remain distrustful, and skirmishes continue to break out.“I don’t have a lot of hope in the process,” said one Western official who works on South Sudan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the mediation process.The rebel leaders sign agreements one day, then discredit them the next, he said.“Nobody’s interested in developing the country,” he said. “Look at the place — education, health, roads. What’s been done? This is all about power.”The children who disarmed on Tuesday were part of another ethnic group, the Murle, who have also been dragged into the conflict, first as rebels, then joining the government. Unicef said it was trying to reunite the children with their families, and would then introduce them to education and training programs.Advertisement
