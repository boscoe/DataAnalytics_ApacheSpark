What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts:

While it has attacked 2,600 Islamic State targets, it has not directly attacked the Syrian government and it is backing rebel groups only with money, arms and some training.Russia, Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah want to keep Mr. Assad in power, for now. Russia, in coordination with Syrian ground forces, has aimed the vast majority of its airstrikes at rebel positions.The Islamic State, meanwhile, wants to both unseat Mr. Assad and create a caliphate stretching beyond Syria’s borders into Iraq and other countries.Rebel groups made majorgains in this area this year.TURKEYHasakaKURDISH CONTROLAleppoISISCONTROLRaqqaIdlibIRAQREBELCONTROLLatakiaDeir al-ZourSyriaGOVERNMENTCONTROLHomsPalmyraMediterraneanSeaLEBANONThe government lostPalmyra to ISIS in May.Control as of Oct. 9GovernmentRebelISISKurdsDamascusSparselypopulated areasISRAELJORDAN50 MILESRebel groups made majorgains in this area this year.TURKEYHasakaKURDISH CONTROLAleppoISISCONTROLRaqqaIdlibIRAQREBELCONTROLLatakiaDeir al-ZourSyriaGOVERNMENTCONTROLHomsPalmyraLEBANONThe government lostPalmyra to ISIS in May.Control as of Oct. 9GovernmentRebelISISKurdsDamascusSparselypopulated areasISRAELJORDAN50 MILESHasakaAleppoRaqqaLatakiaDeir al-ZourSyriaHomsPalmyraSparselypopulatedareasDamascusGovernment controlRebel controlISIS controlKurds controlRussian airstrikes, Sept. 30-Oct. 12Russian ground positionsRussian airstrikes,Sept. 30-Oct. 12AleppoRaqqaSyriaGovernmentareasDamascusRussian ground positionsRussia has bases and advisers in several government-controlled locations.

They all believe ISIS poses a threat to them in their own countries.“Most people are realizing now that the best way of dealing with the Islamic State is to contain them,” said Columb Strack, an analyst at IHS Janes, a defense research firm. “If you contain them and start hitting their economic sources, the idea is that in a few years they will collapse from within. That seems what the Americans are going for.”But because the war against the Islamic State is just one among many, cutting off the group’s resources has been difficult.  Porous Turkish borders and private Arab dollars have helped the Islamic State’s rise.For Syria’s allies, especially Russia, the Islamic State is just one of many insurgent groups that they have called terrorists. While some Russian airstrikes have hit areas controlled by the Islamic State, most have targeted rebels groups.Kurdish fightersIslamic StateMAIN AdversariesAlliesTense relationsUnitedStatesRebelfightersConcernAlliesTurkeySyriangovernmentKurdishfightersIslamicState MAINAdversariesAlliesTense relationSConcernUnitedStatesAlliesRebelfightersTurkeySyriangovernmentNearly 30 million Kurds live in territories divided across Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran, and they want more autonomy in those countries, or even a state of their own. The conflict in Syria has given them an opening toward achieving those goals.American airstrikes against the Islamic State, coordinated with Kurdish fighters, have helped the Kurds seize a broad stretch of territory along the Turkish border. Those gains have increased tensions with Turkey, a major American ally, which has been fighting a bitter war with Kurdish separatists for decades.U.S. airstrike locationsKurdish territorialgains since JanuaryKobaniHasakaAleppoRaqqaLatakiaDeir al-ZourSyriaHomsPalmyraISISareasDamascusKurdish territorialgains since JanuaryKobaniAleppoRaqqaSyriaDamascusAs their offensives cross paths, all of these   run the risk of their battles colliding.
