The Roman Catholic Church traditionally dedicates January to peace themes.But last year, the gesture of good will became a public relations disaster for the Vatican. After the children with Pope Francis tossed a pair of doves from the window, first a gull and then a crow swept down and attacked the doves.Information about the fate of those doves was not available.Advocates for animals who were demanding an end to the release of doves swiftly appealed to Francis. He is the first pontiff to adopt the name of Francis of Assisi, the saint who was famed for his love for birds and other creatures of the wild.“Here’s the balloons that mean ‘peace,’ ” Francis said Sunday when children in the square let go of their balloons.Gulls nest atop the colonnade of St. Peter’s Square, not far from the Tiber River, and scavenge for garbage. One animal advocacy group likened freeing doves in Rome to issuing a death sentence for the birds.Pope John Paul II began the tradition of releasing doves to draw attention to the need to work for peace in the world. The Vatican did not mention last year’s incident when it said in a statement on Sunday that children would release balloons, including a hot-air balloon containing messages of peace. One of the children at the window read a speech about peace.Advertisement
