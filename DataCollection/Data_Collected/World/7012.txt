Prosecutor Maria Navarro also asked the court to detain Capt. Francesco Schettino and seize his passport and navigation license, saying he is a flight risk. Captain Schettino is being tried for manslaughter, causing the shipwreck and abandoning the ship while many passengers and crew members were still aboard. Captain Schettino has said he saved lives by steering the liner toward shore after it hit rocks that were not on his charts. He has accused his crew of botching his orders. The defense is expected to respond in court starting Feb. 9, with a verdict expected after that. Advertisement
