WASHINGTON —  The Malaysian authorities have arrested a 20-year-old man who the Justice Department said Thursday ran an Internet hacking ring in Kosovo that provided stolen personal information of more than 1,300 American service members to the Islamic State.In a complaint unsealed in federal court in Northern Virginia on Thursday, the Justice Department alleged that the Kosovar, Ardit Ferizi, hacked into the server of a company based in the United States, stole the personal information and gave it to the Islamic State to use against the service members.
                The Islamic State aims to build a broad colonial empire across many countries.            The complaint alleges that Mr. Ferizi gave the information to Junaid Hussain, a former leading member of the CyberCaliphate, an Islamic State unit that broke into the United States Central Command’s Twitter and YouTube accounts this year. The Islamic State hoped that its supporters in the United States would use the information to attack service members, the complaint says.Mr. Hussain was killed in an American drone strike in Syria in August. His unit has been credited with the Islamic State’s adept use of social media to recruit fighters and spread propaganda, and his activity was increasingly linked to plots carried out far from the battlefields in Syria and Iraq.The United States is seeking to extradite Mr. Ferizi and charge him with providing material support to the Islamic State, the complaint said.A version of this article appears in print on October 16, 2015, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: Malaysia Arrests a Kosovo Hacker Linked to ISIS .
