A leader of Al Qaeda’s North Africa group says the Islamic extremist group Al Mourabitoun is joining it, describing the recent attack on a luxury hotel in Bamako, the Malian capital, as its declaration of unity, an organization that tracks jihadi websites said Friday. The organization, the SITE Intelligence Group, said Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, leader of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, confirmed the unification in an audio speech distributed Thursday. SITE also said Al Mourabitoun later released an audio speech saying the Mali-based group is joining the Qaeda branch. Al Mourabitoun was the first Islamic extremist group to claim responsibility for the Nov. 20 Radisson Blu attack, which killed 20 people. It said it had worked with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Other extremist groups also declared responsibility. Malian authorities said they had arrested two men in connection with the attack. Al Mourabitoun, or the Sentinels, was formed by the Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a former leader in the Qaeda branch.A version of this brief appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Mali: Militants Merge With Al Qaeda.
