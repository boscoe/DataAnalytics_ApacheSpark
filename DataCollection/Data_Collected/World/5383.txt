CAIRO — Unheard of things are happening in Egypt. For the first time in 13 years since the revolution, there is no talk of pie in the sky and a glorious socialistic future just around the corner. Instead, the masses are being told to tighten their belts today and that tomorrow may be grimmer, not better. For the man in the street, the change is expressed in the simple fact that suddenly life has become more expensive. He now gets one less piece of bread for his money, sugar is up two cents a pound and cigarette prices are up five cents a pack—the fourth rise in five years. For the man who can read between the lines, the change is more dramatic and, if he is in the upper income bracket, even more expensive. It was well expressed in two lengthy speeches by the new premier, Zakkaria Mohieddin. Mr. Mohieddin was installed last September by President Gamal Abdel Nasser to win back the confidence of the West and to prevent the economic collapse of the country. Whether he will succeed in either task is still very much up in the air. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 28, 1965
