VENICE — There was a raid upon Venice last night by enemy aeroplanes, which, with its intervals, lasted two hours and a half. The bombs thrown struck the Scalzi Church, the fine monumental construction on the Canalazzo. The splendid ceiling, with Giambattista Tiepolo’s magnificent fresco, ‘‘Il Transporto della Santa Casa,’’ a valuable painting by the master, was completely destroyed. Other bombs fell in the Piazzetta di San Marco, near the Palazzo Zecca, which was built by Sansovino. Several of the bombs fell in the basin. The enemy, irritated by his failure on the front in the Alps, is making attacks upon the wonderful City of the Lagunes, which receives the attack with admirable serenity. In the first attack a bomb struck the roof of the Scalzi Church and caused the fall of the ceiling ornamented by Tiepolo. An incendiary bomb fell in the Piazetta di San Marco without causing damage. Five other bombs fell in the water or in parts of the city where they caused very slight damage. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 26, 1915
