GAZA — Very little of Abu Shadi Shenbari’s family home remains in Beit Hanoun, in the northern Gaza Strip. Only a concrete bathroom wall was left standing when Israeli forces flattened the neighborhood near the border with Israel during the war with Hamas last summer.Though Mr. Shenbari had all but abandoned that last panel of erect concrete, in recent days he began building a wood and wire-mesh fort with a flimsy nylon roof to protect the bombed-out bathroom wall, which is now home to a 10-foot-tall depiction of a kitten.The spray-painted mural was created by the elusive British graffiti artist Banksy, who slipped in and out of Gaza in February, leaving his mark on three slabs of rubble left from Israel’s 50-day fight with Hamas, the Islamic group that controls Gaza.Gaza residents, largely preoccupied with the slow pace of reconstruction after a cold and wet winter in this impoverished and isolated Palestinian coastal strip, have been waking up to the value of the Banksy artworks that appeared amid the ruins.“If I had enough money, I would buy a glass showcase and put it in there,” Mr. Shenbari said by telephone of the now celebrated mural. “I would turn it into a museum so that the Americans and people from other countries could come and visit it. For me, it is Palestinian heritage.”AdvertisementThat heritage is open to dispute. Last month, another Banksy work in Gaza — an image of a weeping Greek goddess that he had spray-painted on the iron door of another destroyed home — became the subject of a legal contest between the homeowner and an opportunistic Gaza artist. Rabie Darduna, whose home was destroyed save for the iron door, said he did not know that pieces by Banksy had sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars abroad when he agreed to sell his door as scrap to a local Gaza artist, Belal Khaled.AdvertisementMr. Khaled paid a mere 700 shekels (about $180) and said he wanted to protect the goddess mural.Hamas sent police officers to confiscate the door. Its ownership and value are to be settled in court.Mr. Shenbari, guardian of the kitten mural, said he had not been aware of the value of Banksy’s works before the furor over the goddess door.
                The damage to Gaza’s infrastructure from the current conflict is already more severe than the destruction caused by either of the last two Gaza wars.            He said the basic chicken-coop-like structure he had built around his wall was meant to keep the mural visible while protecting it from people’s touch, and from Hamas, though it is unlikely that some wire and wood would prevent the Gaza authorities from expropriating the wall should they decide to do so.“It is private property,” said Mr. Shenbari, who used to live in the one-story, four-room house with 16 other members of his family. “Can anyone come and take the wall of your bathroom?” he asked.Mr. Shenbari said he watched as Banksy, who has never revealed his identity, created the image of the kitten in about 40 minutes in February. The kitten appears to be toying with a ball made of coils of metal that Mr. Shenbari said Banksy had collected from the rubble.“Banksy asked us to protect his privacy, and we promised our loyalty,” Mr. Shenbari said, adding that his children brought the artist tea and water while he worked. “He told us to let the people of Palestine know that his art is dedicated to them.”On his website, Banksy said he had wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on his website, “but on the Internet people only look at pictures of kittens.”AdvertisementBesides the kitten and the weeping goddess, Banksy painted another mural in Gaza that shows children swinging from an Israeli military watchtower as if it were a carousel.“It is a message to Israel and the whole world that Israeli wars in Gaza left nobody safe, including kittens,” Mr. Shenbari said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

More than 70 people, most of them soldiers, were killed on the Israeli side.Rasha Abu Zayed, an artist who owns the Atelier Center for Arts and Education in Gaza City, said Banksy’s visit had caused a stir in the artistic community and had even drawn the attention of the Hamas authorities, not generally known as art mavens.“The Hamas government does not understand or appreciate art,” Ms. Abu Zayed said. “But look at what they did last month,” she said, referring to the seizure of the painting of the weeping goddess.Majd Al Waheidi reported from Gaza, and Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem.A version of this article appears in print on May 1, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Banksy Finds a Canvas, and a New Fan Base, in the Ruins of Gaza .
