UNITED NATIONS —  The skies over Syria are crowded with foreign warplanes. Tens of thousands of civilians are on the run. The Islamic State has executed terrorist attacks on three continents in three weeks.And yet world powers with deep stakes in the bloody four-year-old conflict in Syria have, for the first time, signed up to an ambitious timeline that requires getting their allies on the battlefield to put down their weapons and start talking — by the start of the new year.So how do they get from here to there, and what would it take to reach even a limited cessation of hostilities?The path to any cease-fire and political talks is long, diplomats say. And it is lined with uncertainty and danger, not least for the United Nations, which must do much of the maneuvering.AdvertisementAccording to the ambitious pledges made by world leaders last weekend in Vienna, the United Nations is supposed to convene talks among Syrian government and rebel representatives by Jan. 1. And it is supposed to give its blessings to a new mission to monitor a cease-fire. Who would sign up for such a mission in Syria remains a mystery. And the Security Council is in no rush to authorize a mission until there is a cease-fire to monitor.AdvertisementThose same leaders, including the bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia, are due to meet next in mid-December. The United Nations mediator, Staffan de Mistura, says he hopes they will choose to meet in Paris. On Thursday, he described the prospects of a cease-fire as “more likely — I’m not saying guaranteed — but more likely than before.”Inside Syria, hopes for even a limited local truce were dashed just hours before.There had been reports during the week that several major rebel factions, including Jaish al-Islam, backed by Saudi Arabia, were trying to reach a 15-day cease-fire deal with the government in the besieged and bombarded area known as East Ghouta, an expanse of suburbs that adjoins the capital, Damascus, but has long been cut off by the conflict. The proposed truce would have allowed humanitarian aid to get in and civilians to get out, according to several antigovernment activists in the area.
                What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.            By Thursday, no agreement had been reached, and each side accused the other of refusing to accept the deal.There have been brief local truces before. One example that Mr. de Mistura cited as a model was a local deal struck in September between Ahrar al-Sham, backed by Qatar, and Iranian officials, who support the government. It involved an exchange of territory and an exchange of populations, depending on whether they were Sunni or Shiite, and in so doing raised the dangerous specter of forcibly moving Syrians based on their sect.Any nationwide cease-fire, Mr. de Mistura was quick to note, would have to be brokered by those countries that made the pledge in Vienna — “the very countries supporting, sponsoring various sides of the conflict.”“They were all in that room.”The one concrete achievement that diplomats repeatedly cite is that all the countries involved were in the room at all, chiefly Saudi Arabia and Iran, both patrons of the war. Moreover, the Paris attacks have led to a reluctant convergence of interests: Russia and France, which agree on very little regarding the future of Syria, have both carried out airstrikes this week on Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold.There was a glimmer of diplomatic consensus as well. France on Thursday proposed a Security Council draft resolution that calls on countries around the world to “take all necessary measures” to destroy the Islamic State’s “safe haven” in Syria and neighboring Iraq. Russia signaled that it could support the idea.AdvertisementStill, no one sounds bullish on the prospects of a cease-fire or genuine political talks anytime soon. As one United Nations diplomat put it, “There are many things that can go wrong.”First, who would be covered by a cease-fire? So far the world powers have agreed only that neither the Islamic State nor its outlawed cousin, the Nusra Front, can join the truce because they are on the United Nations’ list of banned terrorist organizations. That list could grow. Russia has targeted several other rebel groups, and this week, its foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said his country was going after “all who one way or another practice and preach terrorist ideology.”
                Diplomats from more than a dozen countries are meeting in Vienna on Saturday for talks on ending the Syrian civil war. Here is a rundown of what these countries want in these talks.            Jordan is expected to host a meeting of military and intelligence experts to negotiate a complete list. Whether it will include hard-line Islamist groups supported by powerful Persian Gulf countries is certain to be a point of contention. Saudi Arabia plans to host a separate meeting of Syrian opposition groups in mid-December, diplomats said.Second, how would a cease-fire monitoring mission work?There is little appetite for a traditional observer mission of blue berets under United Nations command, diplomats here said. That was tried in 2012 and quickly abandoned. One possibility is that regional countries with a stake in Syria’s future will monitor a cease-fire. Another option is that the parties on the ground will monitor a truce themselves, reporting violations to a United Nations-endorsed body.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Iran, his principal backer on the battlefield, insists that he must be allowed to run in future elections, which are envisioned, optimistically, for 2017. Western powers insist that Mr. Assad has no place in his country’s long-term future, though they no longer insist that he must exit at the beginning of a political transition.“There cannot be long-term peace with Assad, but on the other hand there cannot be a peace process that stipulates that Assad must go,” said Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the president of the International Crisis Group, based in Brussels. “How you square that circle has been the issue from the beginning and still is.”For now, the United States and Russia have agreed to set that question aside, but they can set it aside only for so long. The airstrikes on the Islamic State could strengthen Mr. Assad’s position militarily and, in turn, harden his stance at the negotiating table — and that, diplomats and analysts warn, would result in the worst sort of blowback.“Any perception that we are cutting a deal with Assad at the expense of the vast majority of Syrians, and certainly its Sunni majority, would be a strategic victory for Islamic State,” Mr. Guéhenno said.As world leaders bicker, the misery of the Syrian people becomes more acute. The head of the United Nations relief efforts, Stephen O’Brien told the Security Council on Monday that barely two-thirds of Syrian children were immunized against preventable childhood diseases in 2015. Five years ago, nearly all children in Syria were been immunized. All told, 13.5 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian aid, and there is not nearly enough funding to pay for it.Their suffering is bound to worsen. The fighting is likely to intensify, diplomats said, as the parties to any potential cease-fire try to strengthen their bargaining positions.Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.A version of this article appears in print on November 20, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: World Powers Set High Goals for Syria Cease-Fire, but Pitfalls Await .
