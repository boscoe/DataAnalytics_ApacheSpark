“If you wanna know what China’s gonna do,” watch this video on the 13th Five-Year Plan. For years, China’s propaganda machine was mired in the 1950s, stuck producing propaganda posters in the socialist realism style. Now, a new video has brought the world’s biggest publicity machine to a new era. 1973.There’s the old Volkswagen bus. The folksy singers. The guitar. In the spirit of Marlo Thomas’s “Free to Be … You and Me” or the animated shorts from ABC’s “Schoolhouse Rock!,” China brings you:The 13th Five-Year Plan. Or, in Chinese, “Shi San Wu” (十三五). Chorus:“If you wanna know what China’s gonna do, best pay attention to the Shi San Wu. The Shi San Wu. The Shi San Wu.”The singers pronounce “wu,” the Chinese number five, more like “oooo.”Maybe because it rhymes better with “poo.” That’s important, because as the song explains, many people help make up the five-year plans that to this day, long after the demise of the Soviet-style planning government, still guide the country’s economic and social development.What kind of people?“There’s doctors, bankers and farmers, too. And even engineers who deal with poo.”The video was produced by the same Chinese studio that in May released a video about China’s love of Vladimir V. Putin ahead of President Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia. That spot was backed by the state-owned Shanghai Media Group. A link to the 13th Five-Year Plan video was posted on Twitter by Xinhua, the state news agency.
