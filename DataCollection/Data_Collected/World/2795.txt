They feared that Mr. Andree, an asthmatic who has survived cancer, could be subject to a public flogging as part of his sentence and that he might not survive it, although there was no indication that he was about to receive that punishment.“I’m pleased that he has returned home to be reunited with his family, bringing to an end an extremely tough time for him and his family,” Mr. Hammond said in a statement, adding that the release reflected the strong ties between Britain and Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia is Britain’s biggest market for arms exports and its most important trade partner in the Middle East.Relations between the two countries were strained in October after the government canceled a 5.9 million pound, or nearly $9 million, deal to provide “training needs analysis” for Saudi prisons on the same day that Mr. Andree’s family made its concerns publicly known.Opponents of the deal argued that it was inappropriate given the kingdom’s human rights record, including its treatment of prisoners and those who breach the country’s harsh religious laws.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
