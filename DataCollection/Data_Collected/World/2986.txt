Poroshenko said during a trip to Lviv in western Ukraine. “It will become an effective deterrent to aggressors.” Earlier this year, Ukraine received radar systems designed to counter mortar fire. Nonlethal aid also included body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, rations and tents. Advertisement
