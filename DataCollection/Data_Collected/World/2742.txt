LONDON — Mr. Winston Churchill, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who was First Lord of the Admiralty until the formation of the Coalition Ministry, has resigned office and will rejoin his regiment in France. Mr. Churchill, in tendering his resignation, said that his chief reason for resigning was that Mr. Asquith, who had promised six weeks ago to make him a member of the new War Council, had not seen his way to do so. Mr. Churchill, therefore, declined to remain any longer in well-paid inactivity. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 13, 1915
