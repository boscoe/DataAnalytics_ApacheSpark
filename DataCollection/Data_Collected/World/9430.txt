NEW DELHI — The roof of a cement factory collapsed Thursday afternoon in the southwestern Bangladeshi city of Mongla, killing at least six people and leaving scores more in the wreckage, a government safety official said.Around 40 people were rescued in the first hours after the roof collapsed, but as night fell, as many as 70 remained trapped in the collapsed structure, said Mahboob ul-Allam, senior assistant secretary in Bangladesh’s disaster management department. Part of the factory, which is run by the army and located about 200 miles from Dhaka, the capital, was under construction, he said.The cause of the collapse is being investigated.Two years ago, a similar collapse focused global attention on unsafe conditions in Bangladesh’s garment industry, which handles orders for many of the world’s top brands and retailers. More than 1,000 people were killed in that collapse, which a government report attributed to substandard construction materials and blatant disregard for building codes.A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Bangladesh: Deadly Factory Accident.
