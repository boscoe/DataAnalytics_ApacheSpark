JAKARTA, Indonesia —  AirAsia Flight 8501, which crashed in the Java Sea on Dec. 28, was allowed to take off from Surabaya, Indonesia, even though it did not have all the required clearances from regulators to fly that day, the Indonesian Transportation Ministry said on Monday.The ministry said it was suspending several officials for allowing the flight to take off. And it said it had issued regulations requiring airlines operating in Indonesia to brief their pilots on weather conditions before each takeoff, a practice followed in many other countries.Djoko Murjatmodjo, the ministry’s acting director-general of civil aviation, said at a news conference that the new regulations were issued Dec. 31. The cause of the crash has yet to be determined, but experts say it appeared that stormy weather encountered by the plane may have played a role.Mr. Murjatmodjo said the ministry ordered the Surabaya airport to suspend officials who were on duty in key positions related to flight operations and air traffic control when Flight 8501 took off bound for Singapore. AirAsia officials declined to comment on the suspensions.AdvertisementOfficials have said that AirAsia had permits to fly the popular Surabaya-Singapore route on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, but later changed its schedule to fly on other days of the week, The Associated Press reported. Flight 8501 took off on a Sunday.AdvertisementMr. Murjatmodjo said that while Singapore officials had approved the Sunday flight, Indonesia had not, and the aviation agency used incorrect information in granting Flight 8501 a takeoff slot.He said other airlines and airports across the country will also be scrutinized to see if they have been cutting corners in similar ways.
