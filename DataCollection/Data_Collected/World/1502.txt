The attackers — two Palestinian men, about 20 years old, from the West Bank village of Surif — were shot by police officers at the scene, the authorities said. One was killed, and the other was seriously wounded.The police said the two attackers had first tried to board a school bus but disembarked after the passengers suspected that they were about to commit violence and then began shouting. The police said both men had been wearing T-shirts under their shirts bearing the emblem of the military wing of Hamas, the Islamic militant group.In a separate event, soldiers shot and killed a Jewish man in Jerusalem late Wednesday night. Witnesses and the police said the man was scuffling with the soldiers and had tried to choke one of them and grab his weapon. Initially, witnesses said, the man was mistakenly assumed to be a Palestinian assailant.“It seemed a million percent to be a terrorist,” one witness, identified only by his first name, Gadi, told Israel Radio. “When I saw his hand around the soldier’s neck, I was sure it would be a knife next. That was the feeling.”At one point during the altercation the man had shouted “I am the Islamic State,” the police said, referring to the extremist group also known as ISIS and ISIL. The police added that the case was under investigation.Advertisement
