He added that the Foreign Ministry was convinced that the Czech citizen had not been killed in the attack.Libya’s state oil company said that at least seven foreigners, who also included a citizen of an African country, were missing.“Foreigners from an Austrian oil services company operating in the field are still missing since the time of the attack,” said a National Oil Corporation spokesman, Mohamed el-Hariri. “We do not know their fate.” In Vienna, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that a 39-year-old Austrian working for an oil field management company was among the missing.Four years after the ouster of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya is caught up in a conflict between two rival governments and their armed forces, who are fighting to control the country’s oil wealth.The chaos has allowed militants from the Islamic State and Ansar al-Shariah to gain a foothold in the country.
