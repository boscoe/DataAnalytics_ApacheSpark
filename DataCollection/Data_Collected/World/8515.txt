Speaking to reporters in London over the weekend, he warned that the authority could cease to function if it did not receive funds soon. He added that it could “even decide to disband as a result of their economic predicament, and that could happen in the near future if they don’t receive additional revenues.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, leader of the conservative Likud Party, is considered unlikely to resume the transfer of tax revenues before Israeli elections scheduled for March 17. Mr. Netanyahu is competing for a third consecutive term.But with the center-left Zionist Union, which advocates a resumption of negotiations for a Palestinian state alongside Israel, running neck and neck with the Likud in the polls, the Palestinians are not expected to make bold moves in the next few weeks, either.The Israeli power company, which supplies most of the electricity to the West Bank, said it decided to limit the supply to the districts of Nablus and Jenin for less than an hour on Monday afternoon given the Palestinian Authority’s debt, which has been building over a number of years, and is now at a peak of 1.9 billion shekels, or around $490 million. Over the last year, the company said, it has issued warnings and tried to find an arrangement to reduce the debt through contacts with the Israeli government and international bodies, to no avail. The company said it has been stopped in the past from taking the step of reducing supply for political reasons. There have, however, been proposals in Israel to divert some of the withheld Palestinian tax revenue toward paying down the debt.Mr. Netanyahu’s office issued a brief statement saying that the company had decided to take the power-reduction step independently and not at the government’s instruction.A spokeswoman for the Israel Electric Corporation, Dalia Bodinger, said the company would “continue to reduce the supply from time to time with the goal of reaching an arrangement to stop the debt from growing further and to begin to reduce it.”Ghassan Shakaa, the mayor of Nablus and the head of the West Bank’s northern electricity board, described the step as “drastic” and said the disruption caused some factories to halt work.In a telephone interview, Mr. Shakaa denied that the Nablus and Jenin districts owed any money, though he said they had received an outstanding bill for 49 million shekels. He said it would take some time to collect the money and appealed to Palestinian citizens and institutions in the West Bank to pay their bills.Said Ghazali contributed reporting.Advertisement
