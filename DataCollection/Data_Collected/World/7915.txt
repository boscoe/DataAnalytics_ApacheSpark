HONG KONG —  Ten of 49 TransAsia Airways pilots failed emergency proficiency tests ordered by the Civil Aeronautics Administration of Taiwan after a deadly plane crash in the capital, Taipei, last week, the aviation regulator announced on Wednesday.The results were another black mark for TransAsia, Taiwan’s third-largest airline, which has had two deadly crashes in less than seven months. The aviation authority said it was planning to increase the testing of pilots and aircraft at the airline in an effort to improve safety.The pilots of the airline’s ATR turboprops who failed the test will be suspended pending further training in handling emergency situations, the aviation authority said. It said an additional 19 pilots still had not taken the test and could not fly until they had passed.Video from a driver’s dashboard camera captured the moment a Taiwanese TransAsia Airways plane with 58 people on board crashed into a Taipei river.After the crash last week, TransAsia canceled dozens of flights while its ATR fleet was inspected and its pilots tested. The test failures will result in continued restrictions on its flights as the Chinese New Year approaches, and the aviation authority said it would ask other domestic airlines to add flights.AdvertisementInitial findings about the Feb. 4 crash of TransAsia Flight 235 indicated that the twin-engine turboprop suffered a loss of power to one engine shortly after takeoff. The plane is capable of flying on a single engine, but the pilots may have then cut fuel to the other engine, leaving the aircraft with no means of propulsion.AdvertisementAt least 42 of the 58 passengers and crew members on board were killed when the plane clipped an elevated highway and then slammed into a river. Fifteen people survived, and one person remains missing.TransAsia said on Wednesday that it was offering compensation of 14.9 million Taiwan dollars, or about $472,000, to the family of each dead passenger.In July, 48 people were killed when a TransAsia flight crashed while trying to land in bad weather on an outlying island.A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Many Pilots Fail Safety Test at TransAsia.
