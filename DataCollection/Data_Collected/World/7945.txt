CreditAdriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times        CHILPANCINGO, Mexico —  A former cattle trader juggles two cellphones to direct truckloads of armed volunteers who have replaced the meager police forces across a swath of small towns.A potential mayoral candidate plans to campaign almost entirely from his apartment, risking little of the usual glad-handing with voters on the street, because he fears for his life.Protesters rattle the gates of military bases and have evicted mayors from about half the state’s town halls.As election season begins in Guerrero, what has been at best a tenuous hold on order in Mexico’s most violent state is fast disintegrating.AdvertisementAfter the disappearance of 43 students from a rural teachers college last September — believed to be the victims of an alliance among drug gangs, local politicians and the municipal police — activist groups have sworn to disrupt the June elections in the name of the missing students.Advertisement“The no-election movement could gather strength,” said Juan Angulo Osorio, the editor of El Sur, a Guerrero newspaper. “It’s seen as the only way to punish the politicians.”At the same time, frustration with the inability of the authorities to rein in organized crime groups, which traffic heroin and create terror through kidnapping and extortion, is leading a growing number of communities to take control of their own security.Fueling the anger is evidence that neither the state of Guerrero nor the federal government acted on repeated warnings of the connection between a local cartel and the mayor of the city of Iguala, where police officers fired at and killed some students before dozens of them disappeared.The case “is the detonator of a crisis of institutions,” said Rogelio Ortega, the state’s interim governor.“The issue of organized crime and its penetration into institutions isn’t just the heritage of Iguala,” he said. “It’s broader, it’s more extensive — in Guerrero and the country.”The federal government has tried to put the case of the missing students to rest. Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam has said that confessions and physical evidence have confirmed that the students were detained by Iguala police officers on the orders of its mayor, José Luis Abarca, and handed over to members of the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, who killed the young men and then burned their bodies.The same day the government declared that the students were dead, President Enrique Peña Nieto said that Mexico “must advance with greater optimism.”AdvertisementBut few here believe Guerrero will move on.“Guerrero’s disgrace is that there are many Abarcas,” said Mr. Ortega, a university professor appointed after the previous governor stepped down in October, discredited by his ties to Mr. Abarca.At the center of the tumult are the families of the students, all young men, who wait at the college’s bare-bones campus in the village of Ayotzinapa, a 20-minute drive from the state capital here. Mothers sit embroidering under the shade of an arched metal roof over a basketball court as though sheer tenacity will conjure their sons’ return.The government is trying “to stop the families from mobilizing,” said Melitón Ortega, the father of Mauricio Ortega, 17, a missing first-year student. “They want us to resign ourselves,” he said. “We say ‘no.’ Until they identify them, we want them to look for the students alive.”Last week, an expert Argentine forensic team following the case for the families raised questions about the government’s conclusion, pointing to inaccurate DNA testing and the failure to guard the site where the government says the young men were killed. On Monday, Mr. Murillo Karam’s office defended its investigation and shot back that it was “not acceptable” to “try to sow doubt.”So far experts have identified only one missing student, Alexander Mora Venancio, 19, from bone fragments at the site.But his relatives remain skeptical of the government. “We don’t know if what they told us is true,” said his older brother, Hugo, at the family’s home in El Pericón, about 75 miles from here.The protests will continue, he promised: “Should we just be quiet? We have to find the way so that they know we are not satisfied.”Mexico CityMEXICOGUERREROChilpancingoAyotzinapaXalpatláhuacPacific OceanAcapulco50 MilesUNITED STATESGulf of MexicoMEXICOPacific OceanDETAILStill, the rhythm of village life carries on. The Mora family was busy with the corn harvest, shucking the ears and stacking them in a storeroom.AdvertisementFarther east, in Xalpatláhuac, where four of the missing students are from, the village was swept up in a raucous celebration of the Virgin of Guadalupe.But Leydi González Parral, whose two brothers are missing, stood tight-lipped in the doorway of her grandmother’s small house. The investigation needs to go further, including into her brothers’ school, to understand what happened, she said, adding, “They have to look in other places.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A showdown was averted, and the government offered to plan a visit. The families argue that they were promised access to all the military facilities in the state.Abel Barrera, the founder of Tlachinollan, a human rights group that represents the families, said that the protests were an expression of anger at helplessness in face of organized crime and its political allies. “There is no unifying agenda,” he said. “Now, it’s a moment of reaction for self-defense.”Students from Ayotzinapa and elsewhere have swelled the demonstrations. The state teachers union has expressed solidarity and attached the students’ case to their unrelated demands to roll back an education overhaul. And some teachers have burned state government buildings and cars, evicted mayors from about half the state’s town halls and routinely block the highway that runs from Mexico City to Acapulco, the state’s largest city.“There is a crisis of credibility,” said Mr. Ortega, the interim governor and a former student activist himself. “ ‘Whatever you say, I don’t believe you.’ And this exacerbates the conflict.”He has been trying to defuse the unrest, negotiating with protesters to lift the blockades. But as the elections approach, Mr. Ortega said, he will enforce the law and protect the voting. The federal police have begun to oust highway protesters, and reinforcements arrived to guard the offices at the national electoral council.As the parties line up their candidates, though, many of the faces are linked to the disgraced former governor, Ángel Aguirre, who remains a power broker. His brother and nephew were arrested this week on corruption charges. Some angry citizens hope to oust this old guard.AdvertisementA year ago, Pioquinto Damián, a Chilpancingo businessman, faced off with the mayor, Mario Moreno, in public and accused the police here of being infiltrated by a drug gang, Los Rojos.An hour later, gunmen attacked the sport utility vehicle he was riding in with his family and killed his daughter-in-law. He believes that he was the intended target. The state prosecutor cleared the mayor and blamed Los Rojos.“The social conflict is so great that the government’s security forces aren’t enough,” Mr. Damián said.The only way to disentangle city hall from organized crime is to run for mayor himself, Mr. Damián said. But he plans to conduct a peculiar campaign, hunkered down in his third-floor apartment with a police guard and appearing unexpectedly at his own campaign rallies — “like a ghost.”In rural areas, many people have lost all faith in the elected authorities.Two years ago, community police forces, which first developed in indigenous villages in the 1990s, began to multiply. Armed with shotguns, volunteers succeeded in running criminal gangs out of small towns and won the loyalty of many residents who distrust the police and the military.In Tecoanapa, the local militia found a safe house at the edge of town with signs of torture and makeshift graves in the underbrush.“All of Guerrero has become a clandestine graveyard,” said Ernesto Gallardo, a commander of the community police forces.Despite an influx of federal police officers into Guerrero since the students disappeared, new militias continue to form, joining one or another of several rival alliances.AdvertisementMr. Gallardo, a man who carried his self-appointed authority with ease, argued that the community police do not intend to supplant the government. But there seemed to be little other sign of authority.Volunteers made rounds on pickup trucks around the well-tended town, often stopping to hear people’s concerns. They staffed road checkpoints and stood guard when school let out.“When the government does not do its job, we will take its place,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on February 13, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexican Towns Galvanized by Tragedy.
