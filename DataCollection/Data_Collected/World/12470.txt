The May 7 vote is expected to result with no party winning an overall majority. The outcome is likely to be either a weak minority government or a coalition government, and could ultimately determine whether Britain stays in the European Union.

Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats run the current coalition government. Ed Miliband is the leader of the Labour Party. Nicola Sturgeon, who has emerged as a national political force, heads the Scottish National Party. Nigel Farage leads the anti-immigration, right-wing U.K. Independence Party.

According to the latest polls, Mr. Cameron’s Conservative Party will win the most seats, but fall short of a majority. The Liberal Democrats are likely to lose seats, making a renewal of the current two-party coalition unlikely, but are expected to be part of the next government no matter who is prime minister.  Mr. Miliband is believed to have the most options for cobbling a coalition together with smaller parties. His hopes for a solid majority have been undermined by the Scottish National Party, which is expected to trounce the Scottish Labour Party, while Mr. Cameron’s have been damaged by the rise of the U.K. Independence Party.The only thing that seems certain is a hung Parliament and a period of coalition negotiations, during which Mr. Cameron will remain prime minister and try to hold on to his job.
              
              
            

Europe’s Future To placate the right wing of his party, Mr. Cameron promised to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the European Union and then to hold a referendum on whether to stay in it. Taxing the Wealthy Mr. Miliband has said a Labour government would try to increase the top rate of income tax, abolish “non-dom status,” which allows some wealthy people to avoid paying taxes on foreign income, and tax homes worth more than 2 million pounds (about $3 million). Scottish Independence The expected success of the Scottish National Party, whose prime goal is Scottish independence, is likely to renew the independence movement.
              
              
            

British politics has been dominated by the Conservative and Labour parties for the past 100 years, but recently the main parties have had to fend off challenges from growing regional and fringe parties. There have been only four general elections since 1918 in which neither party secured an overall majority of seats, and it looks as if this year’s election will be the fifth. In 2010, the Labour Party, after 13 years in power, lost to the Conservatives, who won just 306 seats — 20 seats short of a majority. Within five days, the Conservatives struck an unlikely alliance with the centrist Liberal Democrats to form the first coalition government since World War II, and Mr. Cameron replaced Gordon Brown of the Labour Party as prime minister.
