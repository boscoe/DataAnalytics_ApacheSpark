Iran has started cutting back on some nuclear technology, which could be re-engineered to make nuclear weapons, in line with a deal it signed with six world powers, a report by the United Nations’ nuclear agency said Wednesday. But diplomats familiar with the report cautioned that Iran was keeping thousands of machines on standby that could be used for military purposes. The report, by the International Atomic Energy Agency, shows that since October, Iran has reduced the number of centrifuges it uses to enrich uranium, which can produce nuclear fuel, isotopes for research or the core of an atomic bomb, depending on the degree of enrichment. But the diplomats, who demanded anonymity because they were not authorized to comment on the report, said all of the machines that had been taken out were idle. The thousands of centrifuges that were spinning uranium into enriched levels used for fuel are no longer online but remain on standby and can be restarted on short notice.A version of this brief appears in print on November 19, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Nuclear Equipment Is Cut Back.
