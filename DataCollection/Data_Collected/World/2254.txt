Syrians have been a main component in Europe’s refugee crisis. Propelled by fear and desperation, the huge flow of refugees has faced one hurdle after another.

Syrians in the Turkish border town of Akcakale. There are 2.2 million Syrians in Turkey, which started imposing travel restrictions this summer.

Two years into the Syrian conflict, Jordan and Lebanon began restricting the entrance of Syrians.

Most Syrian refugees are living in cities and informal camps. Unable to work legally, many are begging. Below, women from Raqqa, Syria, fed their children in Akcakale.

In July, the United Nations, short of funds, cut food assistance for 1.3 million Syrians in the region. More than 300,000 refugees had their food rations cut for the remainder of the summer.“For many refugees, the cuts in food assistance are just the straw that broke the camel’s back, triggering their movements,” said Dina El-Kassaby, a spokeswoman for the World Food Program.In October, the European Union bolstered its support for the food distribution program. Still, funds are expected to last until only January. After that, the future of the program is uncertain.

Greece and Bulgaria, members of the European Union, built fences and increased security along their borders with Turkey. But more than 600,000 migrants and refugees used sea routes this year, taking advantage of the dozens of Greek islands that sit just a few miles from Turkey in the Aegean Sea.

As the crisis worsened this summer, some wealthy nations took steps to accommodate more refugees, but those efforts have not met the need. The United States said it would increase the number of refugees it would take annually to 100,000 from 70,000, but that change would only happen in 2017. Germany has already received more than 570,000 migrants this year, many of them Syrian, but that is far fewer than the number in Syria’s neighboring countries. Lebanon alone has more than one million refugees.Germany has also been trying to convince Turkey to seal its borders and stop the refugees before they reach Greece. As a reward, Germany has hinted at an expedited path for Turkey to join the European Union.Meanwhile, Syria remains deeply fractured. The growing involvement of Russia and the United States in the conflict has increased the death toll. Experts say that even if a peace deal were sealed among the main warring factions, it could take years for the fighting to end.
