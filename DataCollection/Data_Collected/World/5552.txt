The inauguration of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré drew officials from eight other West African countries and thousands of supporters, news services reported. Mr. Kaboré, a former prime minister, won an election last month that outside observers described as the first free and competitive vote in the country in decades. Burkina Faso’s former leader Blaise Compaoré was deposed in October 2014 after protests over his attempt to amend the Constitution and extend his 27 years in power. This month a military court in Burkina Faso issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Compaoré, who lives in exile in Ivory Coast, in connection with the 1987 assassination of Capt. Thomas Sankara, the country’s revolutionary leader. Mr. Compaoré has denied involvement in the killing. Advertisement
