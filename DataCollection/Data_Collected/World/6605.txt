JERUSALEM — The would-be jihadists trained for battle by slaughtering sheep and riding horses at a farm in the Galilee region of northern Israel with hopes of joining the Islamic State group in Syria, according to the Israeli Shin Bet internal security agency and court documents released Sunday.The men, seven Arab citizens of Israel, most arrested in November and December and residents of Galilee, have been charged with membership and activity in an illegal organization, support for a terrorist organization and efforts to contact a foreign agent — namely the Islamic State, the extremist group that has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq. The group, which aims to reinstate a caliphate and is notorious for its beheadings, has been officially outlawed in Israel since September.Lawyers representing several of the men said that they were being held for their beliefs and that they did not present any real security threat to Israel.
                Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.            The disclosures came after an Israeli court lifted an order that had kept the case under wraps. An eighth Israeli Arab from the Negev desert in southern Israel, who recently completed medical studies in Jordan, has also been charged with supporting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, and was intending to go fight in Syria, according to the authorities.AdvertisementThe dominant figure among the seven suspects from Galilee, Adnan Ala al-Din, is a lawyer who is about 40 years old and a resident of Nazareth. Another man was doing an apprenticeship as a pharmacist when he was arrested. Two of the seven were brothers, a third was their cousin and a fourth was engaged to one of their sisters. The last man was a friend of the two brothers.AdvertisementOne of the brothers, Karim Abu Saleh, in his early 20s, was detained in July at Ben-Gurion International Airport as he was about to depart for Syria, presumably via Turkey. Mr. Ala al-Din had helped put him in touch with people who could get him into Syria, and he was carrying about $9,000 collected from members of the Galilee group, part of which was intended as a contribution to the Islamic State, according to official documents.Israeli security officials say they know of at least 30 Israeli Arabs who have gone to fight with rebel groups in Syria, including the Islamic State, a phenomenon that Shin Bet has described as marginal. But Israelis were shocked when they learned that a Bedouin doctor from the Negev, Othman Abd al-Kayan, had been killed in August while fighting with the Islamic State in Syria. Dr. Kayan had studied medicine in Jordan, returned to Israel and shortly before his disappearance in May worked as an intern in Barzilai Hospital in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon.In addition, the Israeli security services said that in November they had cracked a three-member Palestinian cell identified with the Islamic State in the volatile West Bank city of Hebron.But an organized cell among Israel’s Arab citizens, who make up about a fifth of the country’s population and who have rarely participated in armed attacks against the state, is more unusual.The Galilee suspects held secret meetings, according to the documents, and learned, among other things, how to prepare and properly throw a firebomb.Mr. Ala al-Din, the lawyer, is said to have presented himself as the senior commander of the Islamic State in Palestine and exhorted the others to carry out military activities and attacks against Jews. Mr. Abu Saleh, who was detained as he tried to depart for Syria, is also said to have admitted that he tried to obtain weapons to be used against the Israeli security forces and members of Israel’s Druse community.How has ISIS, a 21st-century terrorist organization with a retrograde religious philosophy, spread from Iraq to Syria, Libya and beyond?Mr. Abu Saleh told Mr. Ala al-Din that he could be squeamish at the sight of blood, according to the charge sheet. The two discussed his faintheartedness and came up with the idea of slaughtering sheep as part of their training, in case he was called upon to kill heretics or nonbelievers in Syria. Several of the suspects bought sheep from a livestock farmer in the Galilee village of Kafr Manda and practiced butchering them at a farm owned by Mr. Ala al-Din.AdvertisementMr. Ala al-Din, who used to work for the Israeli public defenders’ office, is representing himself in court. At a hearing on Sunday he told the court, “I believe they are putting my faith on trial here rather than me,” and noted that the suspects are not being charged with carrying out any acts.Ahmad Masalha, a lawyer representing Mr. Abu Saleh, his brother and his cousin, said all seven suspects were “salt of the earth” people whose only crime was that “they believe in the religion of Islam and believe in certain ideas.”Mr. Masalha told Army Radio that his clients supported the idea of a caliphate “not in Israel but in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and the Arab countries.”A version of this article appears in print on January 19, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Eight Israeli Arab Men Are Charged With Aiding Islamic State.
