Ferdinand of Bulgaria has thrown off the mask. Although, according to the latest news from Sofia, he continues to profess that the Bulgarian mobilization is exclusively a precautionary measure, the Bulgarian attack on Servia has begun. A Servian boat carrying munitions of war has been captured on the Danube by Bulgarians, and Bulgarian troops have crossed the frontier and attacked a Servian contingent near Kniajevatz, a point some forty kilomètres from Nish. After such an act of hostility no further pretence of “neutrality” is possible. It remains to be seen how this development will affect the policy of Greece. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 13, 1915
