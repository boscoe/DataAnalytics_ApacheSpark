President Andrzej Duda of Poland has pardoned a former head of the country’s anti-corruption agency who had been found guilty of abuse of power. Mariusz Kaminski, the former official at the Central Anticorruption Bureau, was sentenced in March to three years in prison but had appealed. On Tuesday a presidential adviser, Andrzej Dera, told reporters, “In the president’s view, this case had a political character,” adding that people who fight corruption “deserve special protection.” Critics have said that Mr. Kaminski and his associates pursued graft with excessive zeal and that they sometimes hounded innocent people with methods that circumvented laws. Mr. Kaminski is close to Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the conservative Law and Justice party, which has just returned to power after winning an Oct. 25 parliamentary election. Poland’s new prime minister, Beata Szydlo, has named Mr. Kaminski to take responsibility for the secret services.A version of this brief appears in print on November 18, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Poland: Ex-Chief of Anti-Graft Agency Is Pardoned in Abuse-of-Power Case.
