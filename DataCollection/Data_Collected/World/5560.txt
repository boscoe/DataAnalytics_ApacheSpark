It said it was investigating the cases of at least seven journalists who died in the Philippines under unclear circumstances.While the number of journalists killed in Syria has fallen compared with recent years — 17 in 2014, 29 in 2013 and 31 in 2012, according to the group’s accounting — the decline partly reflects the reluctance of many news organizations to risk sending staff members there because of war, lawlessness and the threat of abduction and death. Many Syrian journalists have fled into exile.The decline also reflects what the group called the difficulties of researching cases in Syria and other places upended by violent conflict, including Iraq, Libya and Yemen.In the Middle East, the group said, it “received reports of dozens more journalists killed, but is unable to independently confirm that the individuals have in fact died, and if so, whether journalist work was the reason.”Journalists who dared to try to document atrocities by the Islamic State extremist group seemed to be singled out this year. In October, the Islamic State killed two Syrian journalists, Fares Hammadi and Ibrahim Abdel Qader, who were both living in Turkey. Mr. Qader was a co-founder of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, an activist group that opposes the Islamic State and was recently honored with the Committee to Protect Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award.Another member of Mr. Qader’s group, Ahmad Mohammed al-Mousa, was killed on Dec. 16 in Idlib, in northern Syria. And on Sunday, a Syrian journalist who had directed a documentary film about Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently was killed in Gaziantep, in southern Turkey, a day before he and his family were to fly to France, where they were seeking asylum. Unconfirmed accounts said he was shot.Advertisement
