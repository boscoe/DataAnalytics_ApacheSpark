The government had sought to keep the letters out of the public domain for fear that publishing them might damage perceptions of Charles’s neutrality. The letters, said to contain strong personal views, were deemed too sensitive by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who vetoed their release in 2012. The decision would seem to conclude a lengthy freedom of information battle by a newspaper, The Guardian, to obtain the “black spider” memos, which are named after the prince’s distinctive handwriting. An appeals court overruled Mr. Grieve last year. Advertisement
