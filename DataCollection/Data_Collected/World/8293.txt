The state government said the protesters tried to attack the Coke offices late Wednesday “to damage the facilities.” It said the demonstrators, including teachers’ college students and unionized teachers, threw gasoline bombs that burned a police officer. Three other police officers were injured, along with two reporters and four protesters. Social unrest after the disappearance of 43 students in September has paralyzed parts of Guerrero. Police officers reportedly detained the students in Iguala, not far from Chilpancingo, then turned them over to a drug gang that apparently killed them and burned their bodies. Since then, protesters have been accused of taking over tollbooths and robbing delivery trucks for money to support their cause. Advertisement
