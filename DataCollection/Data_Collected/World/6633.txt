Canadian soldiers exchanged fire with Islamic State fighters in Iraq over the past week, a commander said Monday. The officer, Brig. Gen. Michael Rouleau, the commander of Canadian special operations forces, said his troops were advising Iraqi officers “at the front lines” when the soldiers came under machine-gun and mortar fire. “That resulted in the immediate requirement to return fire,” he said. Canadian snipers, he said, then “neutralized” the fighters of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. He did not say how many Canadians were involved nor did he say how many attackers were killed. As many as 69 Canadians are providing training and advice to Iraqis.A version of this brief appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Canada: Troops Clash With ISIS in Iraq.
