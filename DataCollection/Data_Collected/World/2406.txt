A Bosnian court on Thursday sent an Islamic State supporter to jail for seven years for encouraging, organizing and recruiting volunteers for extremist activities in Syria. Judge Amela Huskic said that the defendant, Husein Bosnic, portrayed himself as a religious authority and lured believers into joining the Islamic State group. At least six of his recruits died on battlefields in Syria. Mr. Bosnic was arrested last year along with more than a dozen other suspects during a police crackdown on Islamic State supporters. He was sentenced under a new law introduced last year to prevent people from fighting foreign wars. Prosecutors said during the trial that 94 Bosnians had gone to fight in Syria. Their records show that 56 of them have returned, while 26 died there.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
