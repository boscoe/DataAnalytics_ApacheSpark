Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies are pushing back against Iran’s influence in the region, and fear that a Western deal to restrict Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for removal of economic sanctions will further strengthen Tehran’s power. At the same time, many of them are fighting ISIS, a group Iran is also trying to destroy.

Iran has extended its influence around the region by supporting Shiite opposition groups and conducting military operations in a handful of countries.

Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition of Arab countries in military operations against the Houthi movement in Yemen. The formation of the coalition led to the creation, announced March 29 at an Arab summit in Egypt, of a unified Arab military force to counter Iranian influence and Islamic extremism.

The United States and Iran both have military operations against the Islamic State in Iraq, though American officials insist they are not cooperating with Iran. Jordan has conducted airstrikes as part of an American-led operation, which includes many other Western countries as well.
