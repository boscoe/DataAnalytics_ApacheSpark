China’s military announced last year that it was changing its recruiting standards, to admit enlistees who were slightly stouter than their predecessors. The idea was to ensure that the supply of new cadets would not be restricted by the growing waistlines of young Chinese.But the People’s Liberation Army does not want its soldiers to let themselves go. A new policy for military fitness training says that strict guidelines for body weight will be put in place, and that meeting those guidelines will be a consideration in determining promotions, according to a report on Friday on the website of the military’s official newspaper, People’s Liberation Army Daily.The guidelines were recommended by the four main departments of the People’s Liberation Army: the General Staff Headquarters, the General Political Department, the General Logistics Department and the General Armaments Department. The report did not list specific weight targets for soldiers.
The announcement set off a round of online jokes about one of the People’s Liberation Army’s most famous, and famously rotund, soldiers. In 2010, the Academy of Military Sciences in Beijing confirmed that Mao Xinyu had become the youngest major general in the Chinese Army, despite being conspicuously overweight and often appearing stuffed into his too-small uniforms. The promotion of General Mao, a historian at the academy who studies his grandfather, Mao Zedong, was criticized as evidence of nepotism.That line of criticism surfaced again with news of the new weight requirements. “So this means the heavier you are, the higher you climb, like Mao Xinyu,” one commenter wrote on the microblog service Sina Weibo.
