The fire on the platform in the offshore Guneshli field broke out Friday when an underwater gas pipeline was damaged in a heavy storm. The workers got on to two lifeboats, officials said, and ships were sent to pull them to shore. But late Friday a hook holding one of the lifeboats popped open and the boat fell into the stormy sea, according to a joint statement issued Saturday by Socar, the country’s emergency services and the prosecutor general’s office. A nearby ship was able to rescue three workers from that lifeboat and retrieve the body of one who died. The workers in the other lifeboat were rescued on Saturday, officials said. Advertisement
