BEIRUT, Lebanon — At least six people were killed in airstrikes in northern Syria on Saturday, including a family of five and a rescue worker who was fatally wounded while searching for victims, according to a spokesman for the rescue workers and a local antigovernment activist.It was not immediately clear who carried out the airstrikes, which hit rebel-held areas in Idlib Province that are being bombed regularly by both the Syrian government and Russia, which entered the war last week. Russian officials have said they are fighting the Islamic State extremist group, but dozens of Russian airstrikes have targeted other antigovernment militants.The killing of the rescue worker highlighted the persistent danger emergency medical workers and medical professionals face in Syria’s war, and elsewhere, from aerial bombing. The attack came on the same day that an apparent American airstrike damaged a hospital in Afghanistan, killing at least 19 people, including 12 hospital staff members.
                Over four years of war has forced more than four million to flee the country, fueling a migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe.            The Syrian rescue worker, Issam al-Saleh, a member of the White Helmets civil defense organization, was the 108th member of the group to be killed so far during the Syrian conflict, according to James Le Mesurier, a spokesman for the group. Mr. Saleh, 29, had worked for the group for a year and a half, and had two young children, Mr. Le Mesurier said.AdvertisementAmer Bakri, an antigovernment media activist in Idlib, said the airstrike that killed Mr. Saleh was among a half-dozen bombings that hit a poultry farm in the Ihsim region, where people who fled their homes had taken shelter. After a series of airstrikes around noon, the White Helmets volunteers went to the farm to look for survivors, he said.AdvertisementVideos recorded by the volunteers showed what happened next. One of the videos shows people searching through rubble before the roar of an airstrike close by. Another silent video shows the rescue workers stumbling through orchards filled with smoke and coming upon a man, presumably Mr. Saleh, with a gaping wound in his right leg. The other victims of the strike include a mother and four of her children, according to activist groups.The attack followed a pattern that has come to be known as the double tap: Warplanes bomb an area, then bomb again, often after rescuers have arrived. People in insurgent-held areas say the technique has been frequently used by Syrian government warplanes.Another airstrike on Saturday landed near a hospital in rural Latakia, near Syria’s border with Turkey, damaging the facility but apparently causing no injuries, according to local activists. Tim Shenk, a spokesman for Doctors Without Borders, said that the group once ran the hospital but handed over control to local groups last year.Hwaida Saad reported from Beirut, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.
