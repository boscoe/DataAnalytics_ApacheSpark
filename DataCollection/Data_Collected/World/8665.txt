A court sentenced a nurse to life in prison on Thursday for killing patients at a clinic with overdoses of heart medication that he confessed to administering because he enjoyed trying to revive them. The Oldenburg regional court found the 38-year-old nurse guilty of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and another of serious bodily harm, said a court spokesman. Prosecutors had accused the man, identified only as Niels H., in line with German privacy rules, of three murders and two attempted murders at a clinic in the town of Delmenhorst. But he may have killed more. He said that he intentionally brought about cardiac crises in some 90 patients and that 30 had died. The police are investigating about 200 deaths that occurred at hospitals where he worked.A version of this brief appears in print on February 27, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Germany: Nurse Guilty in Clinic Deaths.
