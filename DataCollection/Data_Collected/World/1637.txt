Fuehrer Adolf Hitler and Marshal Henri Pétain, French Chief of State, have reached an accord in principle for Franco-German co-operation ‘‘to reconstruct peace in Europe,’’ according to a communique issued after a Cabinet meeting late this afternoon. Paul Baudouin, French Foreign Minister, resigned Saturday night and his post will be taken over by Vice-Premier Pierre Laval. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 27, 1940
