The dynamite attack in Hamdallahi on the mausoleum of Cheick Amadou Barry, an important Islamic religious leader in the 19th century, mirrors similar ones that were carried out in northern Mali in 2012 when jihadists seized control of the major towns there. The mausoleum destroyed Sunday was part of a historic village that is a national heritage site. It was nominated in 2009 to be recognized by Unesco, the United Nations cultural agency. Advertisement
