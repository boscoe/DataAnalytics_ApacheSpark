BRUSSELS —  Gathering in Brussels, European foreign ministers scrambled on Thursday to hold a united front against Russia over Ukraine, calming worries that the election of a far-left government in Greece hostile to sanctions could upend Europe’s policy toward Moscow.This week’s victory of the anti-establishment Syriza party in Greece had been widely seen as enhancing dogged but previously unsuccessful efforts by Russia to divide members of the European Union and undermine the bloc’s sanctions policy.In the end, however, Greece backed away from strong statements denouncing sanctions and joined other countries in the 28-member bloc in a unanimous vote in favor of expanding a list of sanctioned individuals, mostly Russians, and of work to prepare “any further action” to pressure combatants to respect a stillborn truce agreement from last year.Greece also joined other countries in endorsing a six-month extension of sanctions imposed last March that would otherwise have soon expired.AdvertisementThe acquiescence of Greece’s new leftist government was greeted optimistically as a sign that, despite the tough words issued from Greek officials in recent days, Athens would continue to work with its European Union partners, including, perhaps, on its debt obligations.AdvertisementThe Greeks “deleted a few words, but that is not a big deal,” Linas A. Linkevicius, the foreign minister of Lithuania, said in an interview. He said the gathering of foreign ministers had been far less contentious than expected, as the Greeks had been “forced to change their stubborn position” and muted their hostility to extending sanctions over Ukraine.Federica Mogherini, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, said at a news conference that while “sticking to their position, their attitude was extremely constructive.” The unanimous vote, she said, showed that “one thing I can be happy about tonight is that we kept our unity.”Ms. Mogherini called the emergency meeting of foreign ministers in response to a rocket attack by Russian-backed rebels on Sunday that killed as many as 30 civilians in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. That day, Greek voters gave an emphatic victory to Syriza, a party that has a long history of close relations with Russia and hostility to the European Union’s policy on Ukraine.On Wednesday, Greece’s newly appointed energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, said, “Greece has no interest in imposing sanctions on Russia,” according to the semiofficial Athens News Agency. “We have no differences with Russia and the Russian people,” he added.Diplomats and analysts speculated that Greece’s tough words against sanctions could be a bargaining ploy aimed at winning concessions from Brussels on a bailout package whose terms the new government wants to renegotiate.But Syriza’s sympathies for Russia long predate this week’s sparring on debt. Visiting Moscow last year, Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s new prime minister, spoke strongly against sanctions and echoed Moscow’s line that Ukraine was to blame for violence because it had sheltered “neo-Nazi” fascists in government ranks after the ouster of President Viktor F. Yanukovych.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Putin and tightly restricted access to Europe’s capital markets by Russian banks and energy companies.But Greece’s opposition to the sanctions had stirred fears that the new government would undermine what, since last summer, has been an unusual display of unity by Europe’s normally fractious and indecisive nations.Greece has the Eastern Orthodox faith in common with Russia, and its people often view Moscow with far more sympathy than do most other Europeans, particularly those in countries invaded or occupied by the Soviet Union. Russia has sought to cultivate ties with anti-establishment parties on both the left and right, seeing them as a useful battering ram against the European Union’s stand on Ukraine. But Syriza is the first of these political groups to gain power, and its victory, said Ms. Paul, the analyst, will be an important test of “whether Putin’s strategy of divide and rule works.”A version of this article appears in print on January 30, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Greece Steps Back Into Line With European Union Policy on Russia Sanctions.
