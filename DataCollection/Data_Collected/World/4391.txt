The lawmaker, Khalida Jarrar, is a popular figure in the West Bank, known for fiery speeches against Israel. She is a senior member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a secular faction that opposes peace with Israel. The group, which was involved in hijackings and other attacks in the 1970s, has scaled back its militant activities in recent years. Palestinians say Ms. Jarrarâ€™s prosecution was political. The Israeli Army said she was convicted Sunday, under a plea deal. The army said also she had called for Palestinians to kidnap Israeli soldiers. Advertisement
