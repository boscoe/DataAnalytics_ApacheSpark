The priest, the Rev. Wojciech Gil, is charged with committing 10 crimes, most of which relate to the molestation of boys under the age of 15. If convicted, he could serve up to 15 years in prison. During the trial, Father Gil for the first time since his arrest did not deny the charges, the court spokeswoman said, but it is unclear whether he pleaded guilty. Under Polish law, a defendant can offer to serve a jail term for some crimes without admitting to any guilt. The trial resumes on Wednesday. Advertisement
