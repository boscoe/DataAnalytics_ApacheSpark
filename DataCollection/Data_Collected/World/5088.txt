LONDON — In the House of Commons this afternoon, Mr. Asquith moved a supplementary army vote for the addition of 1,000,000 men to Britain’s armed forces. The Premier stated that Great Britain had at the present time a fighting force in the various theatres of war of more than 1,250,000 men. The wastage of men was enormous, and they should aim potentially at securing every man of military age who was physically qualified. Commenting upon the recent recruiting campaign, the Premier expressed his great appreciation and admiration of Lord Derby’s efforts and added that the response from all parts of the Empire had been a magnificent exhibition of patriotism and self-denial.— The New York Herald, European Edition, December 22, 1915
