CAIRO — A Cairo court on Monday ordered the release of the jailed adult sons of Hosni Mubarak, the former president of Egypt, who was forced from office in 2011, Egyptian state media reported.The sons, Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, were convicted in May, along with their father, on charges of siphoning off millions of dollars in public funds for personal use. With the wealth they amassed during their father’s rule, the sons came to symbolize the cronyism and corruption of the ruling elite during the Mubarak era.The sons were given three-year prison sentences. The court ruled on Monday that, taking into account time when they were detained before trial, their sentences had been served.The sons are still on trial in a separate financial corruption case. Their father remains in custody at a military hospital in Cairo.A version of this article appears in print on October 13, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Egypt: Court Orders Mubarak’s Sons to Be Released.
