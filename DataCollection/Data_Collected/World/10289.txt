Other suspects are sought in the attack in West Bengal on March 14, in which the chapel was ransacked, religious items were destroyed and cash was taken. The nun, who is in her 70s, was hospitalized, but she has since recovered and been discharged. One of the suspects denied the rape charge, but he acknowledged that he was part of the gang that attacked the school, the police said. Advertisement
