Israel is beginning a campaign to lure Russian tourists, marketing the country as an alternative to Turkey and Egypt even as it grapples with its own wave of violence, Israeli tourism officials said Thursday. The campaign was prompted in part by the recent bombing of a Russian airliner in Egypt and the downing of a Russian warplane that Turkey claimed strayed into its airspace. Russia has responded by suspending flights to and from Egypt and imposing sanctions on Turkey that include a ban on the sales of tour packages. Both countries normally attract several million Russian tourists each year. Israeli tour operators are offering Russians vacations at a Red Sea resort and packages that include stops in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and at the Dead Sea.A version of this brief appears in print on December 4, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Israel: Campaign Aims to Attract Russian Tourists.
