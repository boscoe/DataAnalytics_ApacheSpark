Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter made a subtle jab at China on Thursday by flying onto an American aircraft carrier in the contested waters of the South China Sea. Mr. Carter and his Malaysian counterpart, Hishammuddin Hussein, landed on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt as it sailed about 70 miles northwest of Borneo. Mr. Carter was clear about the signal he was sending by visiting amid rising tensions with China. “There’s a lot of concern about Chinese behavior out here,” he said, referring to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Malaysia is among several countries that claim a portion of the South China Sea and disagree with China’s building of artificial islands. The United States and others in the region are concerned that China is trying to establish a de facto 12-mile territorial zone around the artificial islands by building airstrips and other facilities for military forces.A version of this brief appears in print on November 6, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Pentagon Chief Raises China Concerns.
