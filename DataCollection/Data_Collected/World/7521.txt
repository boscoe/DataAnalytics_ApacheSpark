The ruling followed a 15-month investigation into the party, which is widely regarded as one of Europe’s most violent far-right groups. The defendants include 18 Golden Dawn lawmakers who were elected to Greece’s Parliament in the 2012 general elections, including two who have since left the party, as well as 54 members or supporters of Golden Dawn. Golden Dawn dismissed the charges, saying the party and its supporters are victims of “persecution” and a “political frame-up.” Advertisement
