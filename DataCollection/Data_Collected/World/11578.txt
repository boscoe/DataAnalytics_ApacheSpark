Gunmen from the Shabab, a Somali Islamist group, killed a regional lawmaker on Saturday in the capital, Mogadishu, the group and officials said. The lawmaker, Aden Haji Hussein, a legislator from the semiautonomous Puntland region, was shot outside a hospital where he had taken his wife, witnesses and a police officer said. Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, the Shabab’s spokesman for military affairs, said Shabab gunmen carried out the attack. “We shall continue killing the enemies,” he said by telephone. The group was driven out of the capital in 2011. But it still carries out attacks in Somalia, and has struck across the border in Kenya, including an attack this month at a university in northeast Kenya that left more than 140 people dead.A version of this brief appears in print on April 19, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Somalia: Regional Lawmaker Killed.
