The two men, Vujadin Popovic and Ljubisa Beara, were high-ranking officers with the Bosnian Serb army that overran Muslim forces and United Nations troops in the Srebrenica enclave in July 1995 and later killed about 8,000 Muslim men and boys. The presiding judge reaffirmed their life sentences. Two other Bosnian Serbs had their sentences of 35 and 13 yearsâ€™ imprisonment upheld, and one had his 19-year sentence cut by one year. Two more Bosnian Serbs were convicted at the original trial. One of them did not appeal and the other has since died. Advertisement
