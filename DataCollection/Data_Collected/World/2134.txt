SYDNEY, Australia —  Malcolm Turnbull has ended the use of knights and dames as part of the Order of Australia, in a rebuttal of the leadership style of his predecessor, Tony Abbott.Mr. Turnbull, who was sworn in as Australia’s 29th prime minister on Sept. 16, said in a statement that the awards were “not appropriate in our modern honors system.”He said that his cabinet had discussed the awards and that he had asked Queen Elizabeth II of England to remove the titles from the Order of Australia, which honors Australians for their service. Australia is a Commonwealth nation, and Queen Elizabeth is its head of state. The queen agreed to the recommendation, he said.Last year Mr. Abbott, a staunch monarchist, reinstated the titles after they were phased out decades ago. In January, he awarded Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and the husband of the queen, with an Australian knighthood.That decision, which Mr. Abbott called a “captain’s pick” — or one made with little consultation with his own conservative Liberal Party colleagues — drew intense criticism and preceded a challenge to his leadership in February.Mr. Abbott survived, only to lose a second contest on Sept. 14 to Mr. Turnbull.Since taking office, Mr. Turnbull has promised he would consult more with colleagues, an implicit criticism of Mr. Abbott.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
