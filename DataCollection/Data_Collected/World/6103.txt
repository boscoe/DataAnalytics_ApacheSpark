On Tuesday, a woman detonated explosives in a police station in Istanbul’s tourist district, Sultanahmet, and blew herself up. One police officer died in the attack and another was wounded. The outlawed Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party claimed responsibility and identified the suicide bomber as Elif Sultan Kalsen. But Ms. Kalsen’s family said that the body that was shown to them was not their daughter. On Friday, the group retracted its claim that it carried out the bombing. It said it had made a mistake because the bombing corresponded with an attack it had planned in the same area. It did not offer details about its planned attack. The Turkish news media has reported that the bomber was a Russian citizen of Chechen descent. An investigation is underway, the Interior Ministry said. Advertisement
