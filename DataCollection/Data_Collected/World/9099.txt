The missiles shall rein upon thy who claim alliance, watch your heads,” the agency said. Another read, “Department of Defense has no defenses.”In the statement from the British agency, Jeffrey Thorpe, special agent in charge at the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Defense Department, said the arrest showed the “commitment and the joint ongoing efforts among international law enforcement to stop cybercriminals in their tracks.”“D.C.I.S. special agents will use every tool at their disposal to pursue and bring to justice those that attack the Department of Defense,” he added, using an abbreviation for his unit.Andy Archibald, deputy director of the British crime agency’s National Cyber Crime Unit, said that the arrest was one of 57 this week across Britain for digital offenses, the result of a collaboration between “law enforcement, industry and government, that is at the heart of fighting cybercrime.”“Criminals need to realize that committing crime online will not make them anonymous to law enforcement,” Mr. Archibald said in a statement. “We are continuously working to track down and apprehend those seeking to utilize computers for criminal ends, and to disrupt the technical networks and infrastructures supporting international cyber crime.”Advertisement
