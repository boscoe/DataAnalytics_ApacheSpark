The following excerpts are from an interview about how to defeat the Islamic State with Imam Mohamed Magid, the spiritual leader of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, a large Muslim community in Sterling, Va. He has been working with other Muslim leaders and government agencies on countering radicalization. This year, he traveled to Nigeria, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia to discuss counterrecruitment and deradicalization strategies with religious and government leaders in those countries.“ISIS is the one that is saying, ‘We have something to offer you: a sense of purpose, a sense of fulfillment.’ That is what is missing.“We need to have a strong religious identity that calls people to action, but action in a way that is constructive, not destructive, and promotes life, not death.“We have to analyze violent extremism based on the mental state, and the psychological and social environment that people are in so we can stop it. We can’t just say they have a twisted ideology.“The question is, what makes them receptive to it?”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
