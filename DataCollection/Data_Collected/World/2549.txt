The helicopter crashed on May 12 after picking up five civilians injured during a magnitude 7.3 earthquake that struck the country that day.Pilots who were flying in earthquake-affected areas in May described a landscape rife with dangers: active landslides, volatile weather and steep mountainous ridges. The terrain and weather were so treacherous that it took nearly three days to find the wreckage of the helicopter, around 11,000 feet and eight miles north of Charikot, an area hard hit by the second earthquake. Raging thunderstorms and below-freezing temperatures prevented teams from immediately recovering the bodies. Six American Marines, two Nepalese Army officials and five civilians were on board the helicopter.Brig. Gen. Sudheer Shrestha, who led a team from the Nepalese Army that was involved in the investigation, said that the findings would most likely have “legal implications,” and could help to determine who would compensate the families of the deceased.The Americans visited the families of the Nepalese officers and the civilians, General Shrestha said in a telephone interview, “and they’re very much aware that they’re not from a rich background; they have a heartfelt feeling for them.”But compensation for the families was a delicate matter because any action taken by the Marines could set a precedent for future episodes, the general said.Advertisement
