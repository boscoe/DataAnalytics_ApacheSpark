A three-judge panel ruled that Mr. Nasheed, the countryâ€™s first democratically elected president, issued an illegal order to detain the judge in 2012. Mr. Nasheed, who was elected in 2008 but forced to resign in 2012, has denied ordering the arrest. His supporters say the charges are aimed at eliminating him as a challenger against President Abdulla Yameen in the 2018 presidential election. Advertisement
