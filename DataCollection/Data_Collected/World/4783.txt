She said the preschool teacher, 45, was in the hospital for his wounds, which were not life-threatening, and was being questioned further.Earlier in the day she said he had described the attacker as saying, “This is Daesh, this is a warning.” Daesh is an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.The teacher said that the assailant was wearing a balaclava and gloves and that he then fled.The authorities took the teacher’s claim seriously, beginning a hunt for the assailant as the Paris prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation for attempted murder.Based on information provided by the teacher, the top government official for the Seine-St.-Denis administrative department, Philippe Galli, told reporters that the assailant had entered the preschool around 7:10 a.m. and had attacked the teacher in his classroom with the box cutter and a pair of scissors that he had found on the school premises. The teacher had said that no children or other members of staff had been present at the time, Mr. Galli said.Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the French education minister, said that the authorities closed the preschool in response to news that there had been an attack, but that it would reopen on Tuesday. She said that the government would continue to bolster security in schools.France has been under a state of emergency since coordinated attacks in and around Paris last month left 130 dead and more than 350 wounded. The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the assaults, which involved several teams of gunmen and suicide bombers.Kimiko De Freytas-Tamura contributed reporting from London.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
