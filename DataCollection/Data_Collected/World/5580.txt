The disaster on Friday at the gypsum mine in Shandong Province killed at least one worker. Nine others are still missing, and 11 made it to safety or were rescued early in the search. Infrared cameras detected the surviving miners on Wednesday, and rescuers were drawing up plans to pull them to safety, said state broadcaster China Central Television. The rescuers sent provisions underground to the trapped men, China’s official Xinhua News Agency said. The workers were weak from hunger but otherwise were in good health, CCTV reported. They told rescuers they were in passages underground that were intact. Two days after the collapse, the mine’s owner died in what appeared to be a suicide. Advertisement
