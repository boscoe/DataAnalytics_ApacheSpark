Cuban and American scientists could now share information on, say, the endangered oceanic whitetip shark, he said, or on the behavior of invasive species.The agreement could also clear the way for American philanthropists who are eager to fund Cuban conservation efforts but have been wary of political pitfalls, Mr. Whittle said.Advertisement
