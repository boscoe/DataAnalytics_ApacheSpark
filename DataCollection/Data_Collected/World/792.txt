BAGHDAD — The Iraqi military said Sunday that it had attacked a convoy in Iraq’s western Anbar Province that included Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State militant group.But an American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was discussing intelligence reports, said the United States had no information to confirm that Mr. Baghdadi or any other senior Islamic State commanders had been targeted or struck in western Iraq in recent days.The Iraqi military establishment claims periodically that senior Islamic State commanders have been killed, apparently as a means of raising morale.The statement, which appeared to take the United States by surprise, said that Iraqi aircraft had struck “the convoy of the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi while he was heading to Karbala to attend a meeting with Daesh commanders.” Daesh is an Arabic name for the Islamic State.Residents in western Iraq said there had been an airstrike in recent days, which set off rumors that Mr. Baghdadi or other senior militants might have been hit.“We have no information to corroborate that report,” a Pentagon official said of the Iraqi Defense Ministry’s statement.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
