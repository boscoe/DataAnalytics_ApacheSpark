BEIRUT, Lebanon —  Anti-government activists in Syria said Tuesday that a chlorine bomb attack by government forces on a northwestern village overnight had killed six people and filled clinics with choking victims.While the death toll was relatively low, the reports of the attack, in Idlib Province, came less than two weeks after the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution condemning the use of chemicals as weapons in Syria and threatening action in the case of new violations.Videos posted online showed medics in gas masks dousing victims with water and children lying immobile on hospital beds with foam around their mouths. They also showed what activists said were the remains of two improvised bombs that had been dropped on the village of Sarmeen, in Idlib, late Monday.
                A look at the conflict that has dismembered Syria and inflamed the region with one of the world’s worst religious and sectarian wars.            The dead were identified as Waref Mohammed, who repaired cellphones, and his mother, wife and three children, according to a friend of the family reached through Skype who gave only his first name, Moawiya. He said the family had been hiding in their basement, where the gas settled, choking them to death.AdvertisementThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks the conflict from Britain through contacts on the ground, also reported the attack and casualties.AdvertisementThe Syrian state news agency, SANA, had no report, but an unidentified military official quoted by Reuters dismissed the Sarmeen accounts as propaganda.“We confirm that we would not use this type of weapon, and we don’t need to use it,” Reuters quoted the official as saying.The conflict is entering its fifth year with over 220,000 killed, communities destroyed and little indication that the multifaceted war between the government, rebels and extremist groups like the Islamic State will end soon.Disagreements among world powers have hampered efforts to end the war, although the Security Council has passed resolutions seeking to ease civilian suffering.Anti-government activists have been reporting small-scale attacks by government forces with chlorine gas and other noxious substances for over a year.In September, a fact-finding mission from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded that chlorine had probably been used on three villages in northern Syria last year, killing 13 people.

It did not assign blame for the attacks, but the chemicals are usually dropped in improvised bombs from helicopters, which only the Syrian government has.AdvertisementThe government and its ally Russia have denied using chlorine as a weapon, blaming insurgents for the reported attacks.At the United Nations, Samantha Power, the American ambassador, said diplomats were looking into the new reports.An American official said the O.P.C.W. had to investigate before the Security Council could act.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Somini Sengupta from the United Nations.A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Fatal Chemical Attack Reported in Syria.
