MUGLA, Turkey — Turkey is ready to conclude an agreement this month to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels as part of the American-led effort to combat Islamic State fighters, a senior Turkish diplomat said Monday.The military training, which will take place in Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, is scheduled to start in late March, the official said.“Initially, the training will be for three years, and the current target is to train 15,000 people, 5,000 each year,” said the senior official who spoke on the condition of anonymity as a matter of diplomatic protocol.“A limited number of American officers will come here to provide the training,” the official added.AdvertisementThe training will be a joint effort directed by American and Turkish military officers.Turkish and American officials have not yet completed all the details on training methods and the selection criteria for the groups to be trained, the official added.AdvertisementTurkish officials say that once trained the rebels will fight against the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, as well as the forces of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Turkey has called for Mr. Assad to step down as part of a comprehensive strategy for peace in the region.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
