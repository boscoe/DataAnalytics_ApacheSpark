Such an inquiry into the opposition leader, Julio Borges, a member of Parliament, could signal a wider crackdown. Pedro Carreño, who heads the Socialist bloc in Parliament, said on Twitter, “Proof was presented,” without giving details. Critics of Mr. Maduro accuse him of trying to distract Venezuelans from an economic crisis and intimidate the opposition before elections later this year. Government officials and the state news media have claimed that Mr. Borges and the arrested mayor, Antonio Ledezma, have a history of plotting violence against the government. Advertisement
