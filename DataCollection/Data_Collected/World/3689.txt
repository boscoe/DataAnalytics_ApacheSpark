One hundred million dollars is the financial goal of the American Red Cross Society, announced yesterday [Nov. 9] at a meeting held at the residence of Mrs. Whitelaw Reid, 451 Madison Avenue. A movement was also started to place all war relief societies organized here since the outbreak of the war under the direct control of the Red Cross. Miss Mabel Boardman, head of the Red Cross organization, said she hoped the money would be given as an endowment fund to place the society on the same basis as the Rockefeller and Carnegie funds. She urged every man, woman and child in this country to join the Red Cross and give $1.50 a year to help in this new movement for preparedness. Mr. Joseph H. Choate presided at the meeting. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 28, 1915
