The voice recorder was freed from beneath the heavy wreckage of a wing early in the morning from a depth of about 98 feet, a day after the aircraft’s flight data recorder was recovered. “Thank God,” Mr. Budiono said. “This is good news for investigators to reveal the cause of the plane crash.” The device will be flown to the capital, Jakarta, to be downloaded and analyzed with the other recorder. Since it records in a two-hour loop, all discussions between the captain and co-pilot should be intact. The plane disappeared from radar 42 minutes into a flight from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore on Dec. 28. All 162 people on board were killed, but only 48 bodies have been recovered so far. videoAdvertisement
