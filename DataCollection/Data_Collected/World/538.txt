Gilbert Diendéré, led an uprising of the Presidential Security Regiment, the creation of Blaise Compaoré, who was the president for 27 years until mass protests ousted him from power last year.Djibril Bassolé, a former foreign minister, faces the same charges as General Diendéré. Two other politicians, Léonce Koné and Hermann Yaméogo, have been detained on suspicion of having been involved in the coup, as have several officers from the regiment.The coup, which began on Sept. 16, killed 14 people and injured 251 others, according to an accounting by the prime minister, Lt. Col. Isaac Zida, who was briefly overthrown, along with the interim president, Michel Kafando. After being restored to power, they ordered the abolition of the regiment.Advertisement
