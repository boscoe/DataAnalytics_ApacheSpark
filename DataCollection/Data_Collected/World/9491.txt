He declared that they had a better reputation than other militias and that their participation would tone down the sectarian flavor of the fight.Compared with other militia leaders, Mr. Sadr has been seen as being less close to Iran recently, and his fighters have not been accused in recent abuses.Hakim al-Zamili, the leader of Mr. Sadr’s parliamentary bloc and the head of the Parliament’s security and defense committee, said that in his visits to Anbar and other provinces struggling with Islamic State, he was repeatedly told: “You have strong fighters and trainers who haven’t made any violations. Why don’t you take part in the battles?”He said Mr. Sadr was also concerned that the expected battle for Mosul was being delayed and wanted to offer the assistance of his forces.Iraqi government troops would be unlikely to mount an assault on Mosul without the participation of the militia forces, whose numbers are much greater than that of the regular armed forces, which largely evaporated in the north when the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, attacked. But United States officials have balked at direct cooperation with Shiite militias — Mr. Sadr’s fighters killed many American troops during their occupation of Iraq — and at being advised by Iranian military officials, who are playing a leading role.Some of the Sadr fighters were assigned to protect Shiite shrines in the city of Samarra, south of Tikrit, where in 2006 Qaeda-linked Sunni insurgents blew up the revered Askariya shrine, igniting a round of sectarian reprisal killings.Iraqi Sunnis have harbored fears of reprisals from the Shiite-dominated Iraqi forces in the Tikrit campaign, but images broadcast by state television on Friday showed Sunni residents of the village of Alam on the city’s northern outskirts greeting forces joyfully.Ahmed Salah contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an employee of The New York Times from Salahuddin Province.Advertisement
