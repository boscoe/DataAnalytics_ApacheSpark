KEY WEST, Fla. — The price to bring Cuban refugees out is $50 a head if the U.S. boat captain is unlucky. If he has a good day, the price is $100. Prime Minister Fidel Castro is seeing to it that there is no lack of business. He promised on Sept. 28 that any Cuban who wanted to leave could do and so far he seems to be keeping his word.“If you get over there (Camarioca, the Cuban embarkation point) and don’t have a full load for the trip back, Castro’s fellows will hustle you up some passengers,” said boat captain Tony Tarracina. No one in Washington has figured out yet why Mr. Castro is letting his people go. But, whatever his reason, Mr. Castro seems to be serious. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 19, 1965
