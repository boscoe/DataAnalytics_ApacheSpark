The United States Embassy in Beijing recorded on Monday night a PM2.5 index of more than 400, a hazardous level of particulate matter that poses serious respiratory risks in the general population. The city is on its second-ever red alert until Tuesday.

Cold weather conditions also trap pollutants close to the ground, according to Dr. Rohde.But this winter has been worse than 2014 for some cities in the Northeast.  Changchun, Shenyang and Harbin have had higher pollution spikes than last year — sometimes higher than Beijing.These dramatic pulses of pollution in the Northeast often happen during the onset of winter as provinces turn on the coal-burning public heating systems because the initiation process for starting a larger boiler is often inefficient and can generate a higher level of pollutants, Dr. Rohde said. He added that when the boiler startups coincide with stagnant weather conditions, like in 2015, the pollution surges can be especially bad.China has gone from having monitors for small airborne particulate matter in only 47 cities in 2002 to monitors in 367 cities in 2015.300Cities monitoring air pollution
