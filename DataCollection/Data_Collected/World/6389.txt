Sri Lanka released 572 prisoners and reduced terms for others on Wednesday in connection with Pope Francis’ visit and his proclamation of the country’s first saint. The prison commissioner general, Chandraratne Pallegama, said, “All this was done to mark the visit by His Holiness.” The country usually releases prisoners convicted of minor offenses on its independence day, Feb. 4. Earlier on Wednesday, the pope held an outdoor Mass before more than half a million people to make Joseph Vaz, a 17th-century missionary, the island nation’s first saint. Francis told the huge crowds that religions must unite to heal war wounds, and capped his visit with an unannounced visit to a Buddhist temple.A version of this brief appears in print on January 15, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Sri Lanka: Prisoners Freed in Honor of Pope’s Visit.
