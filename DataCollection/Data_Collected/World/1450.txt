ROME — The attention of Italy is turned more intently upon the Balkans than upon the negotiations in France between Nazi Germany and the Vichy government. The greatest stress was laid in political circles today [Oct. 23] on the coming visit to Rome of Gen. Ion Antonescu, new Rumanian dictator co-operating with the Axis, who is to arrive Nov. 1 for a ten-day visit. Gen. Antonescu’s coming visit ‘‘is the first official manifestation of the friendship between Legionary (Iron Guard) Rumania and Fascist Italy,’’ foreign correspondents were informed. ‘‘Without making indiscreet prophecies, it may be inferred safely that among the subjects to be discussed during his visit will be the Vienna arbitration and its results; the removal from Rumania of all British influence and maneuvers, and the political and spiritual rapprochement of Hungary and Rumania so desired by the Axis.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 24, 1940
