Two Dutch peacekeepers died Tuesday in a helicopter crash during a military exercise in northern Mali, Dutch and United Nations officials said. The two-man crew of the Apache helicopter performed a “hard landing” during the drills near Gao, in the country’s north, the United Nations force said in a statement. The Dutch defense chief, Gen. Tom Middendorp, said, “Everything points to this being an accident.” General Middendorp identified the victims as Capt. Rene Zeetsen, 30, and First Lt. Ernst Mollinger, 26, part of the force trying to stabilize Mali.A version of this brief appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Mali: 2 Peacekeepers Die in Crash.
