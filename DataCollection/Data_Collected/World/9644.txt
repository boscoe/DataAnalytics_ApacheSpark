Kirkpatrick Militants identifying themselves as the Sinai Province of the Islamic State said  Monday that they had captured the engine of an American-made M60 tank from the Egyptian military in an ambush. A spokesman for the Egyptian armed forces said no engine had been taken. The militants, who went by the name Ansar Beit al-Maqdis before they pledged their loyalty last fall to the Islamic State, have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in a campaign against the military-backed government. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has declared an all-out war on the militants around their base in the North Sinai, but has nonetheless struggled to end their attacks. The militants posted six pictures on Twitter of what appeared to be the engine, describing it as “spoils” of an ambush on “the apostate army.” Advertisement
