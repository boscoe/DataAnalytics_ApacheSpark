The official, Jan Eliasson, the United Nations deputy secretary general, said that during a recent visit to the Middle East he had found “interest” in negotiations from both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are leading members of the military coalition, as well as from Iran, which is allied with the Houthis.Mr. Eliasson also said there were discussions underway to ease a coalition maritime blockade of Yemen that has prevented fuel, food and other goods from reaching the country and has helped cause a growing humanitarian crisis.Advertisement
