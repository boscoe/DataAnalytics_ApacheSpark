BRUSSELS — Belgium officially told Austria today that it disapproved of the acquittal in Vienna yesterday of a former Nazi accused of murdering seven Belgian resistance fighters during World War II. Foreign Minister Paul Henri Spaak told the Austrian embassy of his government’s ‘‘surprise and emotion’’ over the acquittal of Robert Jan Verbelen, a former major in the Belgian SS branch who became a naturalized Austrian after the war. Belgium had convicted him in absentia and sentenced him to death in 1947. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 23, 1965
