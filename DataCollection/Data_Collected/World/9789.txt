Pope Francis, an outspoken advocate for the rights of the poor, will visit the United Nations during its annual conclave of world leaders in September, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Wednesday. Francis will be the fourth pope to visit the United Nations in its 70-year history.A statement issued by Mr. Ban’s office said the pope would meet with Mr. Ban, hold a town hall meeting with United Nations staff, and address the broader membership of the General Assembly.The pope’s visit is scheduled for Sept. 25, a day after he addresses the Congress in Washington.The September gathering will most likely be unusually packed this year because of the United Nations’ 70th anniversary. Governments are expected to adopt binding agreements on climate change and set new development targets for the next 15 years.Hovering over the session are the war in Syria, the spread of Islamic jihadists across the Middle East, along with an ethnic war in the world’s newest nation, South Sudan.AdvertisementThe Vatican is influential at the United Nations, particularly in shaping international agreements on sexual and reproductive rights.Pope Francis has said he intends to push for international commitments this year to curb greenhouse gases and help poor countries protect themselves against climate-related hazards. He has spoken out for the need to address global inequality, and has sharply urged European countries to accept more refugees fleeing war in the Middle East and North Africa — all issues that are central to discussions at the United Nations.Advertisement“The Secretary-General is confident that His Holiness Pope Francis’s visit will inspire the international community to redouble its efforts to achieve human dignity for all through ensuring greater social justice, tolerance and understanding among all of the world’s peoples,” Mr. Ban’s office said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
