The United Nations said Tuesday that at least 15 people with albinism, including children, had been attacked — and in some cases abducted, killed and dismembered — over the past six months in eastern Africa, where albino parts are prized by practitioners of witchcraft. Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid al-Hussein, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement that he was horrified at the “stunningly vicious attacks,” which have surged in Tanzania, Malawi and Burundi. Albinism, a hereditary condition, has been linked by researchers to inbreeding. In Tanzania there is one case per 1,400 people, versus one in 20,000 in the West. The persecution of albinos has been a longstanding problem in the region. Witch doctors will pay as much as $75,000 for a complete set of albino body parts, according to a landmark report from the Red Cross.A version of this brief appears in print on March 11, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Albinos Are Being Hunted in Eastern Africa, U.N.
