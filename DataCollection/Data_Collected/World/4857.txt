HONG KONG —  A Beijing court has commuted to life in prison the suspended death sentence given to Gu Kailai, the wife of one of China’s most prominent politicians, for the murder of a British business associate, according to the Chinese state-run news media.Xinhua, the state news agency, had posted documents Monday from the Beijing High People’s Court stating that the court was set to decide on the commutation, based on a recommendation from the prison where Ms. Gu was being held. Xinhua later updated its post with a document from the court, dated Friday, that commuted Ms. Gu’s sentence.Ms. Gu, the wife of the former commerce minister, Bo Xilai, was found guilty of murdering a family business associate, Neil Heywood, by poisoning him in a Chongqing hotel room in late 2011. She received a death sentence with a two-year reprieve when she was convicted in August 2012. Mr. Bo, who was removed from the ruling Politburo in the wake of the revelations, is serving a life sentence for taking bribes, embezzlement and abuse of power.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
