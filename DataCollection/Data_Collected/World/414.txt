Seven British refugee children went to a National Broadcasting Company studio in Rockefeller Center last night to speak with their parents in London by two-way radio. The conversations were broadcast over station WJZ and the NBC red and blue networks. The youngest broadcaster was four-year-old John Arlingham Toye, son of Geoffrey Toye, radio censor of the Ministry of Propaganda in London. John told his father that America is a fine place and that his tricycle runs well in Central Park, but before he said good by he asked, ‘‘When can I come home on the clipper?’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 8, 1940
