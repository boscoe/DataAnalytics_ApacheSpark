Alfredo Romero, the leader of the human rights group Penal Forum, said on his Twitter account that the 12 protesters were freed but would have to appear in court. For more than a month, Venezuelans have been suffering from chronic shortages of basic goods, and the scarcity has forced shoppers across the country to line up in front of stores before dawn. While the scattered unrest is a far cry from large demonstrations that rocked the country for four months in 2014, it comes amid growing frustration over the current economic crisis. Advertisement
