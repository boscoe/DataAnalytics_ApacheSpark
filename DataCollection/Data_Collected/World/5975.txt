An article published Wednesday by Xinhua, the state news agency, cited a foreign ministry spokesman discussing the soldier’s death. “Chinese police immediately arrested him after the incident,” the spokesman, Hong Lei, said, according to Xinhua. “The runaway was injured during the process and died after treatment failed.” Mr. Hong said the murders by the soldier, which took place in northeast China near the North Korean border, were an individual criminal case. Earlier this week, Chinese officials said they had lodged a formal diplomatic complaint with the North Korean government. Advertisement
