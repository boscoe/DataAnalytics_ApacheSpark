KirkpatrickA Cairo court on Tuesday acquitted former President Hosni Mubarak’s longtime interior minister of the last of several criminal charges that have kept him behind bars, opening a potential path to his release.The acquittal of the former minister, Habib el-Adly, is the latest in a long string of rulings since the 2013 military takeover that have exonerated former officials jailed after the Arab Spring uprising in Egypt. Other decisions, meanwhile, have sent many of the uprising’s young leaders to prison.Mr. Adly presided over Egypt’s notoriously brutal internal security forces from 1997 through 2011, and he was among the most widely loathed figures in the Mubarak government. During the 2011 uprising, demonstrators demanded his execution.He was acquitted on Tuesday of charges that he had improperly awarded a $12 million contract for the manufacture of license plates to a German company without an open bidding process. An appeals court had overturned a previous conviction on the charges and ordered a retrial.Another court had already cleared Mr. Adly of charges that he directed the killing of unarmed civilian demonstrators during the 2011 protests. He was tried alongside Mr. Mubarak, and last fall, a court dropped the charges against both men.Mr. Adly may face other corruption charges, but he has exceeded the maximum period of incarceration without a conviction allowed under Egyptian law.Advertisement
