The young Holocaust diarist Anne Frank most likely died a month earlier than previously believed, the Frank museum in Amsterdam has concluded. Tuesday was 70 years since March 31, 1945, when she was thought to have died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. The timing of her death, from typhus, was established by the Dutch Red Cross, which visited the camp after it was liberated by British soldiers on April 15, 1945. Using new witness testimony and documentation related to Anne and her sister, Margot, including a transport list from Feb. 7, 1945, the museum now believes the two sisters died in February, Erika Prins, a researcher at the museum, said Wednesday.A version of this brief appears in print on April 2, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; The Netherlands: New Details on Date of Anne Frank’s Death.
