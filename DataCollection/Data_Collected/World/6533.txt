But many Yazidi villages remain under the control of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Yazidi beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions. Islamic State fighters say Yazidis must embrace their radical version of Islam or die. The group has also forced captured Yazidi women and girls to marry its fighters.Advertisement
