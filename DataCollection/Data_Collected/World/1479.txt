MEXICO CITY — During the 17 months that Mexico’s notorious drug kingpin, Joaquín Guzmán, was in the country’s most secure prison, he met frequently with one of his lawyers.Yet the pair were not planning a defense strategy; they were plotting the trafficker’s escape, Mexico’s attorney general said late Wednesday.
                See the route that Joaquín Guzmán Loera, a drug kingpin known as El Chapo, used to escape from Mexico’s most secure prison.            It was the lawyer who was in charge of executing the plan to break Mr. Guzmán, known as El Chapo, or Shorty, out of the Altiplano prison through a mile-long tunnel, according to the attorney general, Arely Gómez. He helped execute every detail of the complicated plan, like the purchase of property outside the prison where the digging of the tunnel began and arranging for a Cessna jet to spirit Mr. Guzmán to the remote northwest mountains after his July 11 escape.“Guzmán managed to escape from prison, but neither he nor those who helped him will escape justice,” Ms. Gómez said as she announced the arrests of the lawyer, Oscar Manuel Gómez, who represented Mr. Guzmán and met with him in prison, and five other people in the escape conspiracy. Also charged were a brother of Mr. Guzmán’s young wife; the man believed to be the architect behind the elaborate tunnels across the United States border that became the trademark of Mr. Guzmán’s trafficking network; Mr. Guzmán’s longtime pilot; and a friend from Mr. Guzmán’s stay in another prison, which also ended with his escape in 2001. The sixth person was accused of falsifying documents on the purchase of the property outside the prison.AdvertisementThe tunnel designer “organized and directed” the construction of the tunnel leading to the prison, the authorities said. Ms. Gómez did not release the suspects’ names, but they were published by Mexican news media. Deputy Attorney General Gustavo Salas did not dispute those names during broadcast interviews on Thursday.Closed-circuit video shows the moment Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the drug lord known as El Chapo, disappeared from his cell. Additional video shows the tunnel he used to escape.After Mr. Guzmán slipped into the tunnel opening in the floor of his shower, he walked through the tunnel with the help of his brother-in-law, Ms. Gómez said. He then traveled by car to the city of San Juan del Río, a drive of less than two hours. Two Cessnas were waiting at an airstrip, one presumably a decoy. By the time the alarm was raised at the prison — almost three hours after he disappeared — Mr. Guzmán was in the air. Thirty-four people have been charged so far in the escape, officials said, and with the most recent arrests, almost all of them have been detained.AdvertisementMany of those accused of helping Mr. Guzmán to flee were responsible for keeping him locked up, including Valentín Cárdenas, the former director of the prison, and Celina Oseguera Parra, who was in charge of Mexico’s federal prison system.Mr. Salas said the two officials even ordered “cosmetic construction work” at the prison to cover up the sounds made by Mr. Guzmán’s accomplices as they burrowed under the prison’s walls. “If just one of the people who are now detained had not carried out the corresponding part of the plan, the escape would have been avoided,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on October 23, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: 6 Arrested, Including Lawyer, in Mexican Drug Kingpin’s Escape .
