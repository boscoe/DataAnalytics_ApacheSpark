Mr. Habré lived freely in Senegal until he was detained in June 2013. Mr. Habré’s trial would be the first in Africa to rely on “universal jurisdiction,” under which any country’s national courts can prosecute the most serious crimes committed elsewhere by a foreigner and against foreign victims, the monitoring group Human Rights Watch said.The trial is expected to begin in May or June. In 1992, a Chadian truth commission formed by Mr. Déby reported that Mr. Habré’s government was responsible for an estimated 40,000 deaths.“After so many years, Habré’s victims are now on the verge of seeing justice done for what they have endured,” said Jacqueline Moudeina, lead lawyer for some of the surviving victims. “Getting Hissène Habré before a court is an enormous victory for justice.”The commission said Mr. Habré’s political police force “distinguished itself by its cruelty and its contempt for human life.” Mr. Habré’s defense team has derided the case as political, emphasizing that Mr. Déby’s government has been a major donor to the prosecution. Mr. Habré received substantial support from the United States and France during his years in power because he was seen as a counterbalance to other leaders in the region, including Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, Human Rights Watch said. Advertisement
