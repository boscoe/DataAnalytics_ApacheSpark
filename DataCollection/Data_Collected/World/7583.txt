Officials from the United Nations and the World Health Organization expressed concern on Thursday over data showing the first weekly rise in new Ebola cases this year, countering the downward trend in the disease that has ravaged three West African nations.The 124 new cases — 39 in Guinea, five in Liberia and 80 in Sierra Leone for the week ended Feb. 1 — amounted to a relatively small increase from the 99 new cases the week before, and paled in comparison with the hundreds of new cases per week that traumatized those countries and alarmed the world in the later months of 2014.Since then, a global outpouring of money and resources has helped to severely limit what has been the worst Ebola outbreak in history, with more than 22,000 cases and nearly 9,000 deaths. Attention has refocused in the three countries on trying to restore a semblance of normalcy.However, the weekly increase in new cases, although small, was worrisome for a few reasons, said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the World Health Organization special representative on Ebola, and Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations special envoy on Ebola.AdvertisementSpeaking at a joint news conference in Geneva that was posted on the health organization’s website, they said some of the new cases in Guinea and Sierra Leone were patients who had not been on lists of people monitored for possible infection. These contact lists, used by epidemiologists, are a crucial part of the strategy to eradicate the disease.

That will make identifying, isolating and treating patients even more difficult, especially in remote areas.

Dr. Nabarro said an additional $1 billion was needed under a plan to vanquish Ebola by midyear. “We have not had to get fussed because people have promised money and haven’t given it,” he said. “All we’re saying is, please continue that generosity because the job is absolutely not finished.”Both officials said the practice of touching and washing the infectious bodies of dead Ebola victims at clandestine burials was a resilient source of transmission.Advertisement“It’s not easy to persuade people to change burial practices,” Dr. Nabarro said, “and I think we all appreciate asking people to do so is asking a lot of them.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In Sierra Leone it reached 57 percent, also double the previous figure.“When all cases are coming from the contact lists, it’s almost under control,” Dr. Aylward said.Nick Cumming-Bruce contributed reporting from Geneva.A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Small Rise in New Cases Shows Ebola Hanging On.
