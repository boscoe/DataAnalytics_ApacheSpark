Others, they said, were timed to explode after he left them at locations including government buildings, malls, a hospital and a prison.Police officials said the suspect was driven by personal grievances against neighbors and the local authorities. “An initial investigation also shows that Wei Yinyong had conflicts with villagers nearby and relevant units because of quarry production,” the report said.In recent years, a number of deadly attacks in China have been linked to men who used explosives to seek revenge against the government and others for perceived injustices.Internet censors have been working quickly to delete information about the most recent blasts, which occurred at the beginning of a weeklong national holiday. According to an online report published on Friday morning by the newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily, which was later deleted, five people died in one of the explosions on Wednesday, at a dormitory of the local animal husbandry bureau. Among the dead were a male medical worker in his 30s, the man’s father and two elderly women, the newspaper said.A woman who answered the phone at the Liucheng County Propaganda Department on Friday refused to reply to questions about the bombings. “We are only allowed to speak with Xinhua and CCTV,” she said, referring to China’s state television network.Adam Wu contributed research.Advertisement
