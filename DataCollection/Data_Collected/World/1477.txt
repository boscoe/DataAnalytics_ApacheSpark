BEIRUT —  At least seven hospitals or medical facilities in Syria have been hit by airstrikes since Russia entered the civil war there, killing at least four people, according to an international human rights group and Syrian relief workers.The latest strikes occurred Tuesday, when warplanes struck the town of Sarmin, in Idlib Province, killing a physiotherapist and a guard at the local field hospital administered by the Syrian American Medical Society, the society said in a statement.It was impossible to independently confirm who had carried out that attack and earlier attacks on medical facilities in Hama, Latakia and Aleppo Provinces. Physicians for Human Rights, the group that documented the seven attacks, said Russian warplanes were responsible, citing evidence including information released by the Russian Defense Ministry that indicated its warplanes were flying missions near the medical facilities.
                Over four years of war has forced more than four million to flee the country, fueling a migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe.            The bombings are among hundreds of attacks on health facilities since war broke out in Syria in March 2011. Some 679 medical workers have died, according Physicians for Human Rights. The group said that 90 percent of the attacks had been carried out by the government of President Bashar al-Assad and amounted to war crimes. Russian forces entered the conflict about three weeks ago.AdvertisementThe latest attacks in Syria come amid growing international alarm at the threats faced by medical workers in conflict zones.AdvertisementEarlier this month, a United States airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan killed at least 22 hospital staff members and patients. In Yemen, hospitals and clinics have been repeatedly hit by airstrikes carried out by a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition, as well as shelling by the rebel group known as the Houthis.Widney Brown, the director of operations for Physicians for Human Rights in New York, said that aside from statements from the Defense Ministry, other factors pointed to Russia’s involvement in the latest attacks in Syria, including the distinctive formations of its fighter jets.While the Syrian government had deliberately targeted medical facilities, “with the Russians, we were hoping there would be a more responsible approach,” Ms. Brown said.A version of this article appears in print on October 23, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Group Cites 7 Attacks on Hospitals Across Syria.
