Arab politicians said they were responding to overwhelming public preference for a joint list, which the party leaders hope will increase voter turnout.“For the first time, we are sending a message to the Arab public that unity is power, unity of a minority, of all the parties that represent the minority,” Ahmad Tibi, a physician and member of Parliament who is fourth on the new list, said on Israel Radio. “Despite the disagreements between the parties, we succeeded in bridging the gaps, made concessions to achieve our goal.”Arabs, known also as Palestinian citizens of Israel, make up 20 percent of the population, and their parties currently hold 11 of Parliament’s 120 seats. The new 3.25 percent threshold, up from 2 percent, puts individual Arab factions — along with other small parties — in danger of exclusion.Mr. Tibi, who has served in Parliament since 1999, and other Arab members hope to form a so-called preventive bloc or blocking majority to stop Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from forming the 61-seat coalition required to give him a fourth term. They say they would not join a government led by Mr. Netanyahu’s prime challengers, Isaac Herzog and Tzipi Livni of the newly named Zionist Camp, but could form an alliance with them to help lure centrist parties to their side.About 56 percent of eligible Arab-Israelis voted in 2013 and 53 percent in 2009, compared with about 70 percent of Jews, an imbalance the Arab leaders are keen to erase to expand their potential influence.Several recent polls have shown that as many as four in five Arab voters preferred a single list, but the results also indicate that more voters were likely to show up on Election Day if there were competition between two lists. “I’m not sure, incidentally, that this unity will in fact increase the voter turnout,” Amal Jamal, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University, warned on Friday on Israel Radio.“It is natural that they have different worldviews and different voters,” Professor Jamal said. “On the other hand, the Arab public expects this to be more on the level of principle, based on a working plan that will dictate how the Arab representatives will act in the Parliament, and not that the package fall apart after the elections. If they want voter turnout to increase, and it is important that it does, then it is important that they start laying down the guidelines for how they will work together and which goals they will set.”Advertisement
