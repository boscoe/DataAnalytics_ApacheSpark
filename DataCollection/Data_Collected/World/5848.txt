Libyan officials apologized for the bombing. A military spokesman, Ahmed al-Mesmari, said jets struck the vessel twice off Derna before the government learned that the vessel had been commissioned by the local power station. But the state-run National Oil Corporation said that it had informed all parties that it had contracted the ship. Advertisement
