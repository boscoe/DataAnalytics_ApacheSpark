A proposal that the United States make a $2,500,000,000 loan to the British government and take as security a lien on the British Empire’s gold production over the next five years was laid before a closed meeting of bankers, industrialists and economists here last week by Marriner S. Eccles, chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System. Mr. Eccles, who spoke at a dinner meeting of the National Industrial Conference Board here, suggested a loan to Britain secured by the empire’s gold production as a means of sterilizing part of the gold which could be expected to flow into the United States. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 4, 1940
