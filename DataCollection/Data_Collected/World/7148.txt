A brief article in Granma, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, reported late Tuesday that Mr. Castro had had a “friendly conversation” that day with Frei Betto, a leftist Dominican friar who wrote a book in the 1980s on Mr. Castro’s views on Christianity, “Fidel and Religion.” Granma did not publish a photograph of the meeting. On Monday Granma published Mr. Castro’s first remarks on the restoration of diplomatic relations with the United States, which was announced in December. His lack of comment then fueled intense speculation that he was dead or so mentally frail that he could not comment. Advertisement
