ROME — The diplomatic offensive launched by the Axis powers against Great Britain after the meeting between Benito Mussolini and Fuehrer Adolf Hitler at Brenner Pass is believed here tonight [Nov. 27] to have ended for the time being. Tension in Rome over a possible imminent spread of war in the Balkans also has passed suddenly. In the highest diplomatic circles, it was said today that no signing of any agreement by either of the Axis powers with Bulgaria was likely soon. Turkey, armed to the teeth under martial law and moving up fresh divisions toward the Bulgarian border, may also be expected to remain out of the war for some time. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 27, 1940
