In results announced by the country's electoral commission, President Alassane Ouattara won a landslide victory and a second five-year term.ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast —  Alassane Ouattara has been re-elected to a second term as the president of Ivory Coast in the first peaceful presidential election in the country in more than two decades. The provisional results of the Sunday election, announced by the Independent Electoral Commission on Wednesday morning, declared Mr. Ouattara the winner with 83.7 percent of the 3.1 million votes counted.The Constitutional Court must certify the electoral results for them to become official.Mr. Ouattara, 73, an American-trained economist and a former top official at the International Monetary Fund, has guided an economic recovery with growth rates surpassing 8 percent. His challenge will be to sustain such growth and spread it evenly across all regions as he tries to reconcile this still-divided nation.
                Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.            Starting in 2000, civil war and violence tore Ivory Coast, the world’s largest cocoa producer, into two factions, culminating in bloody clashes that left 3,000 people dead in 2011, after President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down to let Mr. Ouattara succeed him. It took an international military intervention to remove Mr. Gbagbo, who faces trial before the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges relating to the 2011 violence.Turnout was around 54 percent, the electoral commission said. That had become a significant question, after opposition leaders called for a boycott to protest what they termed an “electoral masquerade.”Pascal Affi N’Guessan, the candidate for the former governing party, the Ivorian Popular Front, which Mr. Gbagbo founded, came in second, with 9.3 percent. Mr. N’Guessan had criticized the handling of the election, saying that up to three million new voters had been excluded from participating because the voter lists were frozen during the 2011 violence.Many observers have begun to look anxiously to the next elections, scheduled for 2020, as there is no clear successor to Mr. Ouattara. The Ivorian Constitution provides for a two-term limit, and an age limit of 75, for presidential candidates.A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: President Wins a Second Term in Ivory Coast.
