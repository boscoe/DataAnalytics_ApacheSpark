PRAGUE — Reversing course after a storm of criticism, President Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic said on Friday that he had decided not to attend a military parade in Moscow on May 9 after all.Other European Union leaders are boycotting the parade, which commemorates the end of World War II in Europe 70 years ago, because of Russia’s annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.Mr. Zeman, who had said he would attend, announced on Friday that he would take part in other commemorative events in the Russian capital but would skip the parade.Jiri Ovcacek, the president’s spokesman, said that Mr. Zeman had made his decision independently, and that he had not been influenced by pressure from other Czech political leaders or from Andrew H. Schapiro, the American ambassador to the Czech Republic.“President Zeman will lay wreaths, and he will use the time designated for the parade for a bilateral meeting with the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico,” Mr. Ovcacek said.Mr. Fico has not yet confirmed that he will go to Moscow.A version of this article appears in print on April 11, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Czech Republic: President to Skip Parade in Moscow.
