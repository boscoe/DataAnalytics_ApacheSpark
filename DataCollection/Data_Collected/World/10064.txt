BurnsLONDON — Nearly 530 years after King Richard III was slain on a battlefield near the city of Leicester, a coffin containing his remains was paraded through the crowded streets of that English Midlands city ahead of a formal reburial ceremony at Leicester’s Anglican cathedral scheduled for Thursday.The procession began early Sunday with the coffin traveling a dozen miles west of Leicester to the site of the Battle of Bosworth Field. It was there, on Aug. 22, 1485, that the 32-year-old Richard, popularly cast by many in England in the succeeding centuries as the most brutal and duplicitous of all English monarchs, was killed by the forces of Henry Tudor, founder of the Tudor dynasty.The day’s events provided a stunning contrast to the vilification that has been Richard’s legacy. Officials in Leicester, a city of 300,000 people, said 35,000 people viewed the procession. Spectators in the city stood five and in places 10 deep on the sidewalks as the horse-drawn coffin passed, behind two riders dressed in the helmeted, multiplated suits of armor of the kind worn by Richard and Henry’s soldiers in the Bosworth battle. Officials said that the crowds were heavier for Richard’s procession than they were in 2012 when Queen Elizabeth II visited the city on a tour that celebrated her 60th anniversary on the throne.Many in the crowds threw white roses onto Richard’s coffin, emblematic of the white rose that was the symbol of the Yorkist house whose principal champion Richard became in the last stages of the Wars of the Roses, which ended with Richard’s defeat at Bosworth. The last occasion when anything similar occurred in Britain was at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, in September 1997, when dense crowds in London threw white flowers on Diana’s passing hearse.The procession offered a momentary redemption for Richard in the city where he spent his last night, and returned as a naked corpse, strewn across the back of a horse, after the Bosworth battle. The corpse was exposed to several days of public abuse, and Richard’s remains were lost until an archaeological dig in September 2012.Led by the University of Leicester and the Richard the Third Society, a private group dedicated to the rehabilitation of Richard’s reputation, the dig discovered the skeletal remains subsequently identified as the dead king’s in the ruins of a Franciscan friary buried beneath a municipal parking lot in Leicester.Sunday’s procession kicked off a week of ceremonies dedicated to restoring Richard to what Cardinal Vincent Nichols, England’s foremost Roman Catholic prelate, described as the dignity befitting an English king.In his sermon at Leicester Cathedral, the cardinal carefully skirted the controversy over Richard’s seizing of the throne and the role many historians — and William Shakespeare, who described Richard in his play “Richard III” as an ugly, deformed hunchback with a “dissembling nature” — have assigned to him in the killing of two princes, sons of Richard’s brother King Edward IV, held captive in the Tower of London.Cardinal Nichols said that the re-examination of Richard’s reign since the discovery of his remains is in accordance with “the fashion for reconstructionist biographies in which saints can become villains and villains can become saints.”Advertisement
