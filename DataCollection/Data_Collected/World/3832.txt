In 2013, the French pushed Islamic militants out of Mali’s northern cities and towns, but jihadists continue to carry out attacks on United Nations peacekeepers.“I want to reiterate that these attacks will not impede the determination of the United Nations to support the Malian people and the peace process,” said Mongi Hamdi, who leads the mission and is the special representative for the United Nations secretary general in Mali. “I express my solidarity and salute the brave men and women serving throughout the country for their efforts to bringing lasting peace to Mali in these difficult conditions,” he said.Northern Mali has been unstable since it fell to Tuareg separatists and Islamic extremists after a military coup in 2012. Despite the presence of French troops and the United Nations force, the extremists have continued attacks in the north. They have also struck farther south, including an assault in March on a restaurant and nightclub popular in the capital, Bamako, and a Nov. 20 attack on a hotel there.Malian authorities said they had arrested two men in connection with the attack at the Radisson Blu hotel, which killed 20 people. There are competing claims of responsibility for that attack.Advertisement
