On Sunday, North Korea accused Washington of rejecting its invitation for Sung Kim, the top American nuclear envoy on the North, to visit North Korea. The United States and South Korea insisted that talks would be possible only when the North showed “sincerity” in ending its nuclear weapons program.Earlier this year, North Korea offered to suspend its nuclear tests if the United States and South Korea canceled their annual joint military exercises, scheduled to begin in March. Washington rejected the proposal.North Korea typically lashes out at both the United States and South Korea just before they begin the annual joint military drills. Its leader, Kim Jong-un, has recently carried out inspections of field exercises by the North Korean military, exhorting his troops to be ready for war.The North claims to have developed “miniaturized” nuclear weapons, though American and South Korean officials have expressed doubts that they are sophisticated enough to be mounted on a long-range missile. The United States also blamed the North for a recent hacking attack on Sony Pictures, though the North denied involvement.Advertisement
