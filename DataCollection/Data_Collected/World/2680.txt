LONDON — Laying the groundwork for a possible new order in central Europe, the Polish government and the provisional government of Czecho-Slovakia buried their past quarrels and jointly declared today [Nov. 11] their intention at the end of the war to enter into a closer economic and political association. The two governments-in-exile expressed the hope that they would be joined by other countries in the same part of Europe, and that free people throughout the world would help their cause by combating the German menace to the full extent of their power. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 12, 1940
