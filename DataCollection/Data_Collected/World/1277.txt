Almost a month after the deadliest pilgrim stampede in Saudi Arabia in 25 years, the authorities there have not given a detailed explanation or a final tally of victims, drawing increased ire from Iran, which lost the most people.Saudi newspapers reported Monday that the interior minister, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who is overseeing a committee investigating the stampede that reportedly killed more than 700 pilgrims, had met with its members Sunday and exhorted them to “continue their efforts to find the causes of the accident, praying to Allah Almighty to accept the martyrs and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.”The Saudi accounts gave no indication whether the committee was any closer to completing its inquest into the Sept. 24 stampede in a tent city erected in Mina, near an important stop on the annual pilgrimage known as the hajj.The official death toll remained at 769, despite reports in recent weeks from 30 countries suggesting that the total approached 1,800. The Associated Press, in an updated tally, reported on Monday that at least 2,110 pilgrims had been killed.AdvertisementIran, which lost at least 464 pilgrims in the crush, has become increasingly exasperated with the response of the Saudis, who view Iran as their chief rival in the Middle East.

In a series of Twitter messages posted Monday, the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said, “It appears that #HajjStampede tragedy has been due to negligence of hosting government.” Another Twitter post by Ayatollah Khamenei said the disaster was not a political issue, but was “about thousands of Muslims who died during Hajj rites and in ritual clothes; thus the issue must be followed up seriously.”AdvertisementAyatollah Khamenei also criticized what he viewed as a conspicuous lack of empathy for the hajj victims among Western nations allied with Saudi Arabia. Describing these nations on Twitter as “lying, hypocrite systems,” the ayatollah chided them for remaining “quiet for their friend.”Egypt, Bangladesh, Indonesia, India and Pakistan also lost citizens in the stampede. The government of Pakistan, which has been a major beneficiary of Saudi aid, warned private television networks a few weeks ago to avoid criticizing the Saudis in news programs and talk shows.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
