KEY WEST, Fla. — A 92-year-old fisherman who said he was Ernest Hemingway’s inspiration for the old fisherman in ‘‘The Old Man and the Sea’’ was one of some 130 refugees who landed in Florida from Cuba today [Oct. 21] after a two-day lull. The gnarled and thin fisherman, Anselmo Hernandez, said he knew Hemingway for 30 years. ‘‘Every time he was in Cuba he came to see me. He said he would write a novel about me and then he did,’’ said the gray-haired man. In New York, Hemingway’s widow, Mrs. Mary Hemingway, said she and her husband had known Mr. Hernandez for many years. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 21, 1965
