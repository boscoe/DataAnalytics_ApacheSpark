Close to three million children in Iraq and 3.6 million children in neighboring countries bearing the brunt of the influx are affected by the conflict, Unicef estimated.“As the crisis enters its fifth year, this generation of young people is still in danger of being lost to a cycle of violence — replicating in the next generation what they suffered in their own,” Mr. Lake said.Unicef’s report was one of a slew of statements by international relief agencies detailing the plight of civilians in Syria in a conflict that has killed more than 200,000 people.Describing 2014 as the worst year yet in the conflict, a report by 21 humanitarian agencies on Thursday said that parties to the conflict had ignored three United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding access for humanitarian assistance, that the number of children needing aid had increased by nearly one-third since the previous year, and that funding for aid agencies had fallen steeply in relation to needs.“This worst humanitarian crisis of our era should be galvanizing a global outcry of support, but instead, help is dwindling,” António Guterres, head of the United Nations refugee agency, said in a statement Thursday. He added: “With humanitarian appeals systematically underfunded, there just isn’t enough aid to meet the colossal needs — nor enough development support to the hosting countries creaking under the strain of so many refugees.”A look at the conflict that has dismembered Syria and inflamed the region with one of the world’s worst religious and sectarian wars.Across Syria, an estimated 2.8 million children were still struggling to pursue some form of learning amid the rubble and destruction resulting from the conflict. An assault on a school in eastern Damascus that killed at least 11 children in November was one of 68 school attacks recorded in 2014, Unicef said.In large sections of the country controlled by the Islamic State, young children are increasingly being pulled into active roles in the conflict and subjected to intense indoctrination and training in the use of weapons, said Hanaa Singer, Unicef’s representative in Syria.“Not only are they victims, they have become involved more and more as perpetrators,” Ms. Singer said in an interview.“There is concrete evidence that children are being recruited by all parties and used in all roles,” she said, including as combatants, as messengers and being stationed at checkpoints.Unicef’s report was published a week after the Islamic State released a video appearing to show the execution of a prisoner by a boy, in military fatigues, reported to have been identified later as a French citizen.In Raqqa, its headquarters, the Islamic State has reopened schools teaching extremist ideologies, Ms. Singer said, noting the propaganda videos distributed by the Islamic State showing children being taught to throw bombs and to place them under vehicles.“It is scary, this buildup of the killing machine,” Ms. Singer said. “Children are being indoctrinated in a very systematic way.”Despite the conflict, Unicef and local partners had been able to get polio vaccines to 2.9 million children and to contain a 2014 outbreak of the disease, Ms. Singer said. An estimated 840,000 doses of measles vaccine were also delivered, she said.With the help of local partners, vaccination had even continued in some Islamic State-controlled areas of Syria.With supplies of chlorine from international aid agencies, Syrian engineers had been able to keep up the supply of safe water to 16 million people in both government- and opposition-controlled areas.But the United Nations estimated that 4.8 million people, including two million children, were trapped in areas that could not be reached regularly by aid agencies, and delivering assistance across conflict lines remained hazardous, Ms. Singer said.Although some medicines were allowed through government checkpoints to areas controlled by the opposition, security forces routinely unloaded surgical supplies from aid convoys.In a move that promised easier access for humanitarian assistance to the devastated city of 300,000 people, the government announced the suspension of aerial bombing of the northern city of Aleppo last month. Since then, however, the government has expelled four crucial United Nations aid agency staff members, citing contacts with the opposition, setting back efforts to increase aid and adding to the difficulties of negotiating cross-line access for aid.At the same time, all aspects of humanitarian aid and protection faced critical shortfalls in funding, Ms. Singer said. “We are urging longer-term investment by donors so that children can survive and start to build the next phase of their lives.”Unicef had sought about $815 million for its operations in Syria and neighboring countries in 2015, but as of early March, it had received little more than one-tenth of that amount.“We can’t give up on the people of Syria,” Ms. Singer said.Advertisement
