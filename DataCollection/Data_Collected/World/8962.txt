Rescue ships saved more than 1,000 migrants and refugees north of Libya in the past two days, but 10 migrants died in the southern Mediterranean, Italian officials said Wednesday. Crews from coast guard and navy vessels and three cargo ships saved 941 people in seven operations that began Tuesday, Italy’s Coast Guard said. But one of the migrants’ boats capsized, and 10 bodies were spotted or plucked from the sea. On Wednesday, 94 more migrants were rescued, the coast guard said. For months now, migrants fleeing conflicts or poverty have been heading for Italy on smugglers’ boats that set sail from Libya. According to Interior Ministry figures, 7,882 migrants arrived on Italian coasts in the first two months of this year, compared with 5,506 during that period in 2014. The coast guard said the migrants saved in the latest rescues claimed to be Syrians, Palestinians, Libyans, Tunisians or residents of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.A version of this brief appears in print on March 5, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Italy: More Than 1,000 Migrants Saved.
