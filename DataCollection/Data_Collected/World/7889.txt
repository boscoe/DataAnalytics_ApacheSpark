Militia fighters have released a government minister seized more than two weeks ago in the Central African Republic, officials and relatives said Wednesday. The government official, Armel Mingatoloum Sayo, who serves as minister of sports and youth, was abducted Jan. 25 from his car in the capital, Bangui. The circumstances of Mr. Sayo’s release were not immediately clear on Wednesday. He was believed to have been taken by Christian militia fighters. The country exploded into sectarian violence in 2013 after Christian militia fighters tried to overthrow a government led by Muslim rebels. A transitional government put in place about a year ago is supposed to organize elections for later this year, but instability and violence threaten to derail that goal.A version of this brief appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Central African Republic: Kidnapped Official Is Freed.
