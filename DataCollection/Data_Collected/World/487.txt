DJAKARTA — Thousands of Moslem youths shouting ‘‘Long live America’’ stormed the headquarters of Indonesia’s powerful Communist party (PKI) today [Oct. 8] and burned it to the ground. The mob stormed the building shortly after 500,000 people held an anti-Communist rally in Djakarta’s main sports stadium. A Radio Djakarta broadcast said ‘‘the rally was held in a very tense atmosphere’’ and got out of hand when some of the crowd began to shout ‘‘Kill! Kill! Kill immediately!’’ Informed sources said the armed forces have begun a quiet but systematic purge of Communists in their own ranks with arrests and summary executions. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 9, 1965
