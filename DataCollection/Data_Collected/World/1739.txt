Voters on Sunday sent the presidential race in Argentina to a runoff. Here’s how the leading candidates reacted to the results.BUENOS AIRES —  With a largely noncombative campaign that stunned Argentina by pushing the presidential race into a tightly contested runoff, Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, also achieved another surprise, driving a wedge into the dominating political movement led by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.In the race to succeed Mrs. Kirchner, both Mr. Macri, who is proposing economic shifts to reduce protectionism, and Daniel Scioli, a former speedboat racer endorsed by the president, scrambled on Monday to reposition their campaigns. Both need voters who opted for other candidates, opening a frenetic new phase in Argentine politics before the runoff election on Nov. 22.Pollsters had cast Mr. Scioli as the front-runner, but momentum appeared to be shifting to Mr. Macri, especially after a rising star in his party, María Eugenia Vidal, the deputy mayor of Buenos Aires, defeated Aníbal Fernández, Mrs. Kirchner’s cabinet chief, in the governor’s race in Buenos Aires Province.In obtaining control of the province, a coveted stronghold, Mr. Macri’s party, called Let’s Change, not only defeated one of Mrs. Kirchner’s top supporters. The result was also seen as a referendum on Mr. Scioli, the governor of Buenos Aires Province since 2007.AdvertisementPolitical analysts paid particular attention because voting preferences in the province have historically foretold important shifts in Argentine politics.“The candidate who has best interpreted the moment is Macri,” said Carlos Germano, an independent analyst. “He needs to keep pointing toward dialogue and harmony,” he said, predicting that Mr. Macri would meet with leaders of the other opposition parties to solicit their support.AdvertisementMr. Scioli took 36.9 percent of the vote, compared with 34.3 percent for Mr. Macri in the first round — an unexpectedly slim margin that astounded many Argentines. Mr. Macri ran a largely nonconfrontational campaign in which he obtained high levels of support in Córdoba, Argentina’s second-largest city.“It utterly surprised me,” Jorge Vargas, 65, who polishes floors for a living in Buenos Aires, said of the results. “I voted for Scioli because I don’t like Macri’s background. He’s completely bourgeois.”Still, political analysts lauded Mr. Macri’s attempts to soften his patrician image by trying to appeal to some in Peronism, the ideologically flexible political movement that has held sway in Argentina for decades. Governing Argentina for the last eight years, Mrs. Kirchner repositioned her faction of Peronism to enhance the role of the state in the economy and increase antipoverty spending, while stepping up attacks on critics.But with his strong showing, attention shifted on Monday to Mr. Macri, 56, who was raised in one of Argentina’s wealthiest families and gained prominence as the president of Boca Juniors, one of Argentina’s most popular soccer clubs. He is running to the right of Mr. Scioli, but he has emphasized that he would seek to maintain some of Mrs. Kirchner’s policies on social spending.
                Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.            Reacting to the runoff outcome, Agustín Rossi, Mrs. Kirchner’s defense minister, told reporters that the president’s supporters needed to “be humble” in mobilizing a response to Mr. Macri’s rise. Mr. Rossi conceded that Mr. Macri had run a smooth campaign, highlighted by alluring “sound bites,” but he said Mr. Macri could end up eroding social welfare benefits.Mr. Macri entered politics after a harrowing episode in 1991 in which he was kidnapped by police officers and transported to a hiding place inside a coffin. Twelve days later, he was freed after his father, an Italian-born magnate, paid a multimillion-dollar ransom.AdvertisementHis father, Franco Macri, 85, assembled a business empire involved in construction and car manufacturing. Sometimes openly dismissive of his son’s political ambitions, Franco Macri said last year that his son had “the brain to be president, but not the heart,” explaining that he believed Argentina’s next president had to come from the radical wing of Mrs. Kirchner’s political movement.As mayor of Buenos Aires, Mr. Macri has remodeled public spaces, including plazas and the riverfront, and built bus lanes along major thoroughfares — achievements welcomed by voters. He has also sought to develop the poor south side of the city by encouraging technology businesses, as well as municipal government offices, to set up in the area.Both Mr. Macri and Mr. Scioli must attract more voters, especially those who opted for Sergio Massa, a former ally of Mrs. Kirchner who took 21.3 percent of the vote, and those who supported small leftist parties.After avoiding a debate before the first round of voting, Mr. Scioli said on Monday that he would accept a debate with Mr. Macri, reflecting how the candidate endorsed by Mrs. Kirchner now finds himself on the defensive. Both candidates have avoided the president’s belligerent tone in favor of a more mollifying approach.In reaction to a potential shift if Mr. Macri’s momentum builds, Argentine stocks surged on Monday. But analysts said such sentiment failed to reflect the possibility of a bruising runoff campaign. Moreover, Mr. Macri recognizes that he must attract supporters of Mr. Scioli, a challenging aim in what remains a highly polarized society.“For days, Macri has been working on this fissure, probing the Peronists from within,” Carlos Pagni, a political columnist, wrote in the newspaper La Nación.Some voters were perplexed by the runoff. “Scioli’s no good; he’s under Cristina’s thumb,” said Mary Dany Correa, 82, a retired civil servant who voted for Mr. Massa. “Macri’s done good things in the city, but I don’t see him as capable of running the whole country. There are a lot of things to fix.”But Mr. Macri’s showing uplifted many supporters who want a change after 12 years of Mrs. Kirchner and her predecessor, her late husband, Nestor Kirchner.Santiago Elizalde, 27, an information technology salesman who voted for Mr. Macri, said that while he was ecstatic that his candidate had upended the race, “it’s a match he still has to play.”A version of this article appears in print on October 27, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Argentine Vote Shakes Assumptions on Departing President’s Clout.
