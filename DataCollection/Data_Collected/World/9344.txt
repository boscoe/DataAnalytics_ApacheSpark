The group, Physicians for Human Rights, said it had documented 233 attacks on 183 medical facilities across Syria since the country’s conflict began in March 2011. In a report, it said that President Bashar al-Assad’s government was responsible for 88 percent of the recorded attacks on hospitals and 97 percent of the killings of medical workers. It documented 139 deaths directly attributable to torture and execution. Separately, Doctors Without Borders said Wednesday that desperately needed aid was failing to reach millions of people who were trapped by the conflict, and that a huge increase in medical assistance was required.
