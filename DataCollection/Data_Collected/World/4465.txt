Ms. Yunus, the director of the Institute for Peace and Democracy, had been detained since July 2014. She was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison in August this year. Her husband, Arif Yunus, was released on Nov. 12. They were convicted of treason, espionage and tax evasion in a case that human rights groups say was an effort to muzzle dissent. A court of appeals on Wednesday changed their sentences to suspended sentences. Advertisement
