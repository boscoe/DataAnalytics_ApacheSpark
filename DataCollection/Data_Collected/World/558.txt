Prime Minister Winston Churchill on a tour of London in 1940. British Pathé. LONDON — Prime Minister Winston Churchill was unanimously elected leader of the Conservative party today [Oct. 9], succeeding to the post held by Neville Chamberlain for the last three and a half years. In accepting the position, which he declined five months ago on the ground that he wished to represent a national government instead of a purely party one, Churchill said he felt that he could discharge his tasks with less difficulty if he was in formal relations with the majority of the members of the House of Commons and could speak with their authority.Before deciding to take on the responsibility, he said, he had asked himself whether he could, by temperament and conviction, identify himself with the historical concepts of Toryism. While not attempting to answer this fully, Churchill outlined certain basic convictions which he said lay deeper than party politics and belonged both to himself and to the party. Because of these, he said, he accepted ‘‘solemnly, but also buoyantly.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 10, 1940
