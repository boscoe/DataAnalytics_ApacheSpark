President Ernest Bai Koroma announced that he had removed Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana from office, citing a constitutional requirement that anyone running for vice president be a member of a political party. Mr. Sam-Sumana was expelled from the governing All People’s Congress political party on March 6. The party statement made several accusations against him, including that he was instigating unrest. He has rejected those accusations. Last week he asked the United States Embassy for asylum. The United States instead urged all sides to resolve the problem through the rule of law, and Mr. Sam-Sumana returned to his home. Advertisement
