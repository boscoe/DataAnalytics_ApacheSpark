ISTANBUL —  Turkey’s Parliament passed one of its most contested pieces of legislation on Friday, a bill that broadens police powers and increases penalties for people participating in unauthorized demonstrations.Approval came after a monthlong debate in which cups and glasses were flung across the assembly floor and lawmakers on opposing sides brawled with their fists over the bill. Supported by the ruling Justice and Development Party, which holds the majority of seats, the bill is expected to be signed into law by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Under the bill, the police will be permitted to use firearms against demonstrators who are armed with firebombs or other “injurious or similar weapons.” They will also be able to detain people for up to 48 hours to uphold public order. Protesters wearing masks or partly covering their faces will face up to five years in prison if they are deemed to be spreading “propaganda for a terrorist organization.”The bill will also allow the police to pursue some investigations without authorization from prosecutors and judges, raising fears of the arbitrary use of power without judicial oversight.AdvertisementOpponents say that the bill breaches the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches and that it could create the basis for turning Turkey into a police state. The government has described the bill as a reform that increases the security of its citizens while keeping within the European Union’s standards for freedoms and security regulations.
                Several features of the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was once seen as a role model for the Middle East, show him to have spent more than a decade silencing political dissent and amassing power.            The bill was proposed by the ruling party after thousands of Kurds took to the streets last October to protest Turkey’s lack of support for Kurdish fighters battling militants of the Islamic State, the extremist group, in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani. At least 40 people died in the demonstrations.AdvertisementInternational human rights organizations have criticized the bill for its vague terminology that could lead to preventive detentions to crack down on dissent.“The government’s legitimate concern about violent protest should not be a blank check for police powers,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, a Turkey researcher at Human Rights Watch.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

His signing of the bill would strengthen police powers ahead of June’s parliamentary elections.A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Turkey Expands Powers of Police During Protests.
