A supporter of Iran’s Islamic revolution, Najiyeh Allahdad, sees it as her duty to speak up when in her view the government doesn’t live up to the ideals for which her father fought and died.This is the second episode of “Our Man in Tehran,” a seven-part video series on nytimes.com, produced with VPRO in the Netherlands. It is the first of two videos about issues facing women in Iran. Najiyeh Allahdad, the subject of this episode, and Thomas Erdbrink, answered readers questions below.Q. I had a Persian roommate and friend in college. He loved Iran but criticized the revolution. So did many of his Iranian friends. I gained my view of the Islamic Republic partly from them. How do you feel that the views of westernized Iranian ex-patriots influence western attitudes towards Iran? — Roger Farwell; Baltimore, Md.A. Everywhere in the world, when a revolution is fomented, some extremist measures may take place. But not everyone agrees with such actions. Even in Iran there might be some revolutionaries who disagree with those measures. It seems that the people you have encountered belong to this group. It’s worth noting that the ideas of this group are similar to the position toward Iran favored by the U.S. government. As a result, their voice gains traction in that country and in the West in general.To me, it is important that we hear all of the voices of a nation, not just those we like. For example, I think that the voices of Iranians were not presented in the United States during former president Mohammad Khatami’s time in office as much as the voices of Iranians were during Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s tenure. It would be as if we in Iran just think about America as it was during Bush’s time in office and we deny the U.S. voice of Obama’s era. — Najiyeh AllahdadAdvertisementQ. Is religious autocracy compatible with a system based on respect for the rule of law and democratic rights? — Robert Bakewell; San FranciscoAdvertisementA. I believe in the Islamic Republic. Neither part, Islamic or Republic, is enough to run the country on its own. They are the two wings of this bird to keep it flying. I think that this system can be successful if there is someone who respects both sides. We have not been able to present a very successful example to the world, and we must try to improve everything. Nevertheless, I see no contradiction between the Islamic side and the democratic side of this system. — N.A.Q. Thanks for sharing your story! I’m curious: Are there ways in Iran for your objections about volleyball attendance to be heard? Can you organize with others who object, complain to higher-ups, petition, write to newspapers, publish pamphlets, march — without facing harsh consequences? — Jean Goodwin; Ames, IowaA. We have a small N.G.O. We managed to take some steps to protect the freedoms that our girls still enjoy. We want to protect these freedoms and then we will move forward to regain the lost freedoms that are in the framework of the law. For example, in the volleyball story, half of the girls who attended a gathering in front of the Azadi Stadium were from our N.G.O.We are different people with different ideas in this N.G.O. Some of us are journalists, some are members of political parties. But the point is that even we do not follow up things very seriously. I should confess that we are, to some extent, indifferent about what is happening around us.It is true that some of us are afraid of the consequences of any action. However, we should not forget that issues like attending stadiums for volleyball matches is not a highly sensitive case. Issues like espionage truly matter. But to object to banning girls from watching volleyball is not a big deal.The problem starts when some people with suspicious backgrounds join us in some gathering. I am talking about Ghoncheh Ghavami. I am not going to judge her here. We had a simple objection: Why had we been deprived of the right to go to the stadiums? Later, we stepped into a game in which we needed to prove we were not connected to this party or that foreign country. — N.A.Q. How do you separate your religious values from government policies that you disagree with? You voice disagreement with government officials, yet these men are part of a government that claims its policies are based on the principles of an Islamic revolution. — Chad Raymond; Pawtucket, R.I.AdvertisementA. I think that the law is what separates us from each other. Where I deviate from the law, or the officials deviate from the law, we would get different paths. We do not have biased laws. But we have biased interpretation of the laws. For example, there is nowhere in the law that prohibits women from attending stadiums. — N.A.Q. What does being a martyr mean for you? — Jen Gilleran; SeattleA. In my opinion, being a martyr is to die for what you truly believe in. This belief can be a great goal that one has defined for himself after thinking about it. A healthy and energetic person who has lots of plans in his life may decide to resist any difficulty and hardship to protect his goal. To me, being killed in such a way is martyrdom.Martyrdom has a holy value in my religion. We do not believe that we have lost our martyrs. We know that they are here, near us. I feel my father’s presence and his positive energy always surrounds my life in different happy and sad moments. — N.A.Q. Why do you wear the chador? Are you forced to wear it? — Poulami Bhattacharjee; Thousand Oaks, Calif.A. Choosing to wear a chador was in no way mandatory for me. I love my chador. I chose to do so when I turned 9 years old. I felt I was grown up enough to wear the dress that my God likes. I believe that God likes to see me in a chador. Therefore, I wear it. It is like when my husband likes to see me in red, then I wear red.It is explicitly mentioned in the Quran that women must cover their whole body except for their faces and hands and feet. Though it is not mentioned in the Quran what kind of clothes with which we should cover our body, I chose a chador to completely cover my body. However, I do not wear my chador when I am abroad. I may wear a blouse and jeans.The similarity between the dress codes in different religions is interesting to me. Even in Christianity it is better that women cover their hair with a head scarf. — N.A.Q. It is unclear to me where the real power is and who really makes policy in Iran. Is it the government or the religious hierarchy? And are the elections open and monitored? — Craig Lemle; New York.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

My best answer would be that most decisions are made by the Iranian system.AdvertisementThe political direction of the country is determined by its ideology. No parties are allowed and elections, including the presidential elections, offer choices, but always choices from a group of vetted candidates who have to prove that they support the idea of an Islamic republic.Since the laws and ideology of this system are based on Islam, religious authorities also play a role, often advisory. But the final word in matters of state is reserved for the supreme leader, who is an Ayatollah appointed for life by a council of 86 elected religious experts. That council, the Assembly of Experts, has the power to replace the supreme leader if they decide he is unfit to rule. Elections are not monitored by outside monitors. — Thomas Erdbrink Date of birth: July 26, 1976Hometown: TehranEducation: B.A. in graphics from Alzahra University, 1999Employment: Freelance designer, creating logos for companiesLife experience: I got married when I was 20. I have two sons. I have been fortunate in my life to have found a circle of friends and relatives who share my deep passion for helping others. We have formed a small charity group that finds people who need help, and we use our connections to gather help for them.How do you describe yourself? I’m an Iranian Muslim who uses any opportunity to improve her country and who protects her country's reputation in the world. I love life, and I love peace. I feel that what people have lost in this world is spirituality. I’ve devoted my life to trying to find this spirituality for myself first and then to help others enjoy it.Are you active on the Internet? I am on Instagram. I also have WhatsApp and Viber. I am in touch with my friends through these social networks and speak my mind. Also, I get information and news through these networks.What do you hope for the future? I am very hopeful and I believe that religion will play a more important role in people’s lives in the future, and the world will be saved by religion.What are your hobbies? I’m active in charity efforts. Like Superman, I jump to find people who need help.AdvertisementHave you traveled outside of Iran? Where? What did you think? I have traveled to India, China, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, the United States and Syria. I found some Eastern countries like India and China to be very civilized, but they have not used their civilization to improve their daily lives. On the other hand, I found the Western countries to be detached from their histories and stepping into a new world that has an unclear future. Some Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. seemed too dependent on Western countries and would be nothing without help from the U.S. And a country like Iraq has always been hampered by circumstances throughout its history.Date of birth: Sept. 25, 1991Hometown: Karaj, in north central IranEducation: Student of mechanical engineering, Karaj UniversityEmployment: Student, competitive taekwondo athleteLife experience: I got married to my brother’s friend at an early age, when I was 17. My brother-in-law used to practice taekwondo. I watched taekwondo films, and I liked it. He introduced me to my coach, and I started practicing. I liked it a lot and decided to follow my interest very seriously.How do you describe yourself? I am an adventurous person. I love excitement. I am full of energy and motivation to be successful in my studies and my sport.Are you active on the Internet? I have an Instagram page where I put my sport pictures.What do you hope for the future? I am sure that the future will be great. Not only for me, but also for all Iranian girls who play sports. With little equipment and facilities, we have won all of these achievements and honors. I am sure that if we keep on practicing, we can defeat many of our international rivals.
                As Iran and world powers including the United States try to reach a deal on nuclear controls in exchange for the lifting of sanctions, Iranians from all walks of life are watching and hoping for a new start.            Have you ever traveled outside of Iran? Where? What did you think? I have been to England, Spain, South Korea, Tunisia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Qatar. There are great facilities for young people in these countries, especially for women. I think that Iranian girls are so talented that they have reached the levels they are at now despite all of the shortages here. But I like the Iranian culture.How do you feel when you win and when you lose? Winning or losing, the first thing I say is, “Thank you, God.” I am serious. Then, later, I may start cheering or become grumpy when I lose.What matters most in life? Being a good person is the most important thing. Winning medals does not matter on its own. What matters is to become a good champion, someone that people do not forget.What is your favorite music? I like Morteza Pashaei’s songs. I enjoy listening to sad songs and lyrics. I would also like learn to play the piano. My husband has told me that he will buy me one if I win a gold medal.AdvertisementDoes wearing a hijab give you an advantage or disadvantage while practicing your sport? To wear a hijab during a match is difficult. I am not so committed to wearing a hijab, but I can see how women who wear one are pestered far less often by men in society. And I like to step on the winner’s podium wearing a hijab.Follow Thomas Erdbrink on Facebook and Twitter @ThomasErdbrink.To learn about new episodes, subscribe to the Times Video email newsletter, like The New York Times on Facebook or follow @nytimesworld on Twitter.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
