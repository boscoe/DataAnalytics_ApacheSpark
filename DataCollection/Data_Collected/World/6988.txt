More than 30 police commandos were killed in a clash with Muslim insurgents on Sunday in the southern Philippines in the biggest single-day combat loss for Filipino forces in many years, officials said. Dozens of commandos had entered the village of Tukanalipao at dawn looking for a top terrorism suspect, but encountered members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, said a local mayor, Tahirudin Benzar Ampatuan of Mamasapano. Other insurgents in the area later attacked the outnumbered police forces, the mayor said. The Moro group signed a peace deal with the government last year and forged a cease-fire, which has been safeguarded by foreign truce monitors. Mr. Ampatuan, the Moro group and military officials said the police commandos had not coordinated their plan to enter the village with the rebels, apparently resulting in the clash. The fighting subsided after several hours when members of a cease-fire committee and foreign truce monitors intervened, Mr. Ampatuan said.A version of this brief appears in print on January 26, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: The Philippines: Police and Rebels Clash.
