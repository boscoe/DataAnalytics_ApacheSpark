Putin of Russia called the Turkish downing of one of his nation’s warplanes on Tuesday a “stab in the back,” the phrase had been transformed into a hashtag on social networks by enraged Russian bloggers.#Студия13 #цитата #Путин #ТурцияЗаИГИЛ #Сирия #ИГИЛ #Су24 #Turkey #УдарВспину pic.twitter.com/vtHzNScNmTThe Russian tag #УдарВСпину was soon appended to a string of complaints and visual memes: comparing the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to a bloodsucking vampire and to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed caliph of the Islamic State; invoking Turkey’s wartime pact with Nazi Germany; calling for Russian tourists to boycott Turkish products and resorts; and demanding retribution as fierce as any in the long history of Russo-Turkish warfare.#УдарВСпину pic.twitter.com/ag23NDxenAWithin an hour, the hashtag was adopted and promoted by RIA Novosti, Russia’s official news agency. Before the day was out, it had been used in headlines of news broadcasts on leading state television channels.One common theme was the suggestion that Turkey, encouraged by the United States, had revealed itself as a supporter of the Islamic State militants by attacking Russia during its air campaign in Syria.Turkey, however, disputed Russia’s claim that the Russian airstrikes in the area where the jet was shot down were aimed against the Islamic State. The Russian ambassador in Ankara was summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry last week and was warned that the anti-Assad forces in northwestern Syria near the Turkish border were from the Turkmen ethnic minority, and not the Islamic State.When pro-Kremlin activists protested at the Turkish Embassy in Moscow, the online slogan appeared offline as well, showing up on placards at a rally that lasted into the evening.One well-known Russian nationalist activist at the protest outside the embassy, Maria Katasonova, later upped the ante by switching to another tag, #TurkeyISIS, inspired by Mr. Putin’s question about whether the Turkish military had acted in support of Islamic State militants.Advertisement
