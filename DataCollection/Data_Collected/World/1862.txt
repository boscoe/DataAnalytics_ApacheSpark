The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Wednesday that a refugee crisis was looming in Central and North America as people flee unchecked gang violence in parts of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. “The dramatic refugee crises we are witnessing in the world today are not confined to the Middle East or Africa,” the high commissioner for Refugees, António Guterres, said in Washington. “We are seeing another refugee situation unfolding in the Americas.” Mr. Guterres spoke as he issued a report describing the particular terror faced by women in those countries, which have some of the highest murder rates in the world. Applications for asylum in the United States have more than quadrupled since 2008, and they are also increasing in Central American countries like Costa Rica and Nicaragua.A version of this brief appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Violence Creating Refugee Crisis, a Senior U.N.
