An attack in the Central African Republic by Muslim fighters killed eight civilians in a camp for displaced people, the United Nations said Friday. The United Nations deputy spokesman, Farhan Haq, said United Nations peacekeepers intervened in Thursday night’s attack, which also left five of the attackers dead and wounded several displaced people, two of the attackers and a peacekeeper. The Central African Republic descended into conflict in 2013 when Muslim rebels overthrew the president, a Christian. When the rebel leader was pressed to step down the following year, a swift and violent backlash against Muslim civilians ensued, largely carried out by Christian militias, and the bloodshed has continued. The attack, which took place in Ngakobo, about 37 miles south of the central town of Bambari, occurred just days after Pope Francis wrapped up his three-nation African tour in the Central African Republic, where he called for peace and reconciliation between Muslims and Christians. The United Nations humanitarian coordinator in the Central African Republic, Aurélien A. Agbénonci, condemned the attack.A version of this brief appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Central African Republic: Attack Kills 8 Civilians at Camp for Displaced People.
