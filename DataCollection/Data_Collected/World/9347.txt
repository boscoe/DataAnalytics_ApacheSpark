The challenge to Ms. Soler’s leadership exposed divisions within the group as it grapples with the changing relationship between Cuba and the United States and the group’s shifting status among Cuba’s increasingly diverse opposition groups. Ms. Soler said by telephone that she had won 180 of a total of 201 votes cast. Sixteen members of the group voted against her, and the remaining ballots were blank or annulled, she said. More than 30 members did not vote. Several members called for Ms. Soler’s resignation after a video emerged in which some in the group surrounded a member, Alejandrina García de la Riva, in December, waving their fists and chanting, “Down traitor.” The Ladies in White was formed in 2003 to protest the imprisonment of 75 dissidents. Most of the dissidents have since been released, but the group continues to march weekly to demand democratic reform and freedom of speech. Advertisement
