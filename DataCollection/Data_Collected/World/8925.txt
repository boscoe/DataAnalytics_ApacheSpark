One of South America’s most active volcanoes erupted early Tuesday in southern Chile, spewing heavy smoke into the air as lava surged down its slopes and prompting the authorities to evacuate about 3,500 people. The Villarrica volcano erupted around 3 a.m., according to the National Emergency Office, which issued a red alert and ordered the evacuations. The 9,000-foot volcano sits above the small city of Pucon, whose population is about 22,000. Travis Armstrong, 29, an Australian tourist, called it “the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen,” saying: “It was spewing lava and ash hundreds of meters into the air. Lightning was striking down at the volcano from the ash cloud that formed from the eruption.”A version of this brief appears in print on March 4, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Chile: Eruption Sets Off Evacuations.
