An outbreak of avian flu that began in two states has spread to seven since last week and has infected more than 140,000 birds, Nigeria’s agriculture minister was quoted as saying by Nigerian news media on Thursday. The minister, Akwinumi Adesina, sought to assure the public that the outbreak had not reached a crisis. “There is no cause for alarm,” he said, though at least one strain of the virus that causes the disease, H5N1, can infect humans. He also exhorted Nigerian consumers not to fear poultry consumption because the virus is spread only through contact between live birds and people who directly handle them, and the virus dies when cooked. “So, let Nigerians feel free to eat chicken and eggs,” Mr. Adesina was quoted as saying. Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country and leading poultry producer.A version of this brief appears in print on January 23, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Nigeria: A Bird Flu Outbreak Spreads.
