Thailand’s king on Wednesday formally approved a request from the junta that martial law be lifted. In its place, though, the junta invoked a special security measure called Article 44 in the military-imposed interim Constitution that gives the government of Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former army chief, the power to override any branch of government in the name of national security and absolves him of any legal responsibility for his actions. Advertisement
