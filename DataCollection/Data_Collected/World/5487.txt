The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the first humanitarian transfer will airlift Cubans from Costa Rica to El Salvador in January. From there they will continue by bus toward Mexico. No more details were immediately released by Costa Rica or Guatemala, which hosted a diplomatic meeting Monday on the issue. The number of Cubans stranded in Costa Rica has reached at least 8,000 since neighboring Nicaragua closed its border to them weeks ago. Advertisement
