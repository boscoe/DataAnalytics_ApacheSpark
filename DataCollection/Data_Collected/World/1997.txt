A German man arrested in the killing of a 4-year-old migrant boy from Bosnia has confessed to killing another child, prosecutors said Friday. The suspect, identified only as Silvio S., 32, was apprehended Thursday in the Oct. 1 abduction of Mohamed Januzi, 4, and confessed to kidnapping Elias Sturm, 6, in July from a playground in Potsdam, a prosecutor, Michael von Hagen, told reporters. Silvio S. told the authorities that he had killed Mohamed a day after abducting him from the capital’s central registration center for migrants, Mr. von Hagen said. After sexually assaulting the boy, Silvio S. said he strangled Mohamed with a belt “to prevent the noise of his screams,” Mr. von Hagen said. In his confession, he also said he had killed Elias after abducting him and buried him in Brandenburg, said a Potsdam prosecutor, Heinrich Junker. The police have not yet found the body, Mr. Junker said.A version of this brief appears in print on October 31, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Germany: Murder Inquiry Widens.
