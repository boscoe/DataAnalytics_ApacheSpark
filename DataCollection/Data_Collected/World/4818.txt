The authorities have found what they believe are at least 19 bodies tossed into a deep, narrow canyon in the violence-plagued southern state of Guerrero, two Mexican officials said Tuesday. The federal officials said eight of the bodies had been partly burned, and two more were found in pieces. The officials said the authorities received an anonymous tip late last week that led to investigators’ discovery of the bodies last week near the town of Chichihualco. The location and time frame would suggest the bodies were not those of 43 radical students who disappeared in Guerrero State in September 2014. The bodies found in the canyon appeared to have been dumped — not buried — between a month and 18 months ago, officials said.A version of this brief appears in print on December 16, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Mexico: Bodies Discovered Dumped in Southern State.
