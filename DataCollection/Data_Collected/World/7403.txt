Among the casualties in China’s continuing crackdown on corruption have been the spirits makers who sell to the country’s monied elite. With ostentatious imbibing now highly frowned upon, the makers of liquor like baijiu have seen serious hits to sales growth over the past two years.Which would make it an odd time to consider how to give the fiery grain alcohol a little more bling. But China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission announced last month that it was soliciting professional opinion on whether to approve adding gold flakes to baijiu.Small amounts of gold have long been added to European liqueurs like Goldschläger and Goldwasser. And some Chinese distillers sell baijiu with gold flakes, though apparently without official sanction.
Gold was associated with immortality in ancient China, and the wealthy drank and ate from gold vessels. Alchemists even advocated consuming the metal itself. But ingesting gold also has negative connotations, as swallowing ingots is described as a means of suicide in classical Chinese literature.When ingested orally, gold dust is not toxic because it isn’t easily absorbed, although at least one case of a person having an allergic reaction to gold-laced liquor has been reported, according to PubChem, an online database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States.Amid the continuing efforts to rein in corruption and extravagant spending, China’s alcohol industry has been slow to embrace the further tying of its products to a gilded age.“I’m still not clear on the purpose of adding gold flake to baijiu,” Ma Yong, a member of the baijiu expert committee of the China National Food Industry Association, told The Beijing Times, which first reported on the proposal.The newspaper interviewed one baijiu drinker, whom it identified simply as Mr. Zhao, who once drank baijiu with gold flakes and clearly understood the point.“When the gold flashes, it gives you a lot of face,” he said. “But as far as the taste, it makes no difference.”
