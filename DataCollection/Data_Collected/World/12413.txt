In an interview on Fox News, the sister, Sarah, said that Mr. Hekmati had informed his family in the United States by telephone of his decision to stop eating. She said Mr. Hekmati had written to the officials of Evin Prison, where he has been held for more than three and a half years, declaring that “he’s going to start a hunger strike as of today, he’s already begun.” She also disclosed that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had visited with Mr. Hekmati’s Michigan family on Sunday. That is the highest-level meeting the Obama administration has given to the family since Mr. Hekmati was arrested. Mr. Hekmati, 31, an American of Iranian descent from Flint, Mich., first went on a hunger strike in December but suspended it after prison officials assured him that his case would be revisited, his family said at the time. He was seized in Iran in August 2011 while visiting relatives for the first time. Advertisement
