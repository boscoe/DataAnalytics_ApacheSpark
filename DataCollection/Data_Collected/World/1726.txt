Nigeria’s former national security adviser pleaded not guilty on Monday to money laundering in connection with $423,000 in Nigerian and United States currency seized at his homes. The former official, Sambo Dasuki, also denied charges of illegal possession of an arms cache, including assault rifles and a submachine gun, found when security agents raided two of his homes in July. The case at the Federal High Court was adjourned to Wednesday. Mr. Dasuki was an important adviser to Goodluck Jonathan when he was president. Mr. Dasuki was called before a Senate committee last year to explain an episode in which South Africa seized $9.3 million in cash flown on a private jet and a $5.7 million bank transfer that South Africa blocked, saying it was intended to illegally buy arms. Mr. Dasuki, who had taken over the role of the Defense Ministry in procuring weapons, said the deals were legitimate.A version of this brief appears in print on October 27, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Nigeria: Former Official Pleads Not Guilty in Corruption Case.
