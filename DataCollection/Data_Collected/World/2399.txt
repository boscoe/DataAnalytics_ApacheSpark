A special investigation of the ether drinking in the North of Ireland led to the conclusion that the ether drinking area may be roughly said to embrace the mountainous and barren districts of the counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Armagh and Antrim, the former two being the principal localities. Ether seems to be a great surprise to the temperance advocates of to-day, to those who wage war on alcoholic stimulants. Curiously enough, it originated with the great teetotal movement of fifty years ago. It has grown with that movement and it prevails now to an extent which nothing short of a stringent Act of Parliament energetically administered could effectually check. It flourishes among the peasantry of one of the finest districts of Ireland. They are not by any means an ignorant peasantry either — the men are intelligent, sturdy and healthy and the women are the flower of the Irish race. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 7, 1890
