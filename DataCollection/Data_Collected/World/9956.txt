NEW DELHI — Two heavily armed militants wearing Indian Army uniforms opened fire on a police station near the Pakistani border early Friday, killing three Indian security personnel and a civilian, officials said.The attack, for which Indian officials blamed Pakistan, was the first since a new coalition government took power in the disputed Kashmir region earlier this month. It could sway a debate over whether to overturn a contentious law that gives Indian security forces wide latitude to use force in the region without fear of prosecution.Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, which makes up part of Jammu and Kashmir State’s new governing coalition, have opposed lifting the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, and the attack Friday could provide them with further justification for their stance.“Our neighbor is not rectifying their ways,” Jitendra Singh, a junior minister in Mr. Modi’s office, said after the attack, referring to Pakistan.AdvertisementThe police station, which is about 10 miles from the heavily guarded Pakistani border, came under attack from two militants dressed in Indian battle fatigues who opened fire with Kalishnikov rifles, officials said. “They asked the guard to open the door and immediately shot him dead,” Danish Rana, a police inspector general, told reporters. After a three-hour exchange of gunfire, the militants were shot dead, he said.Ten people, one a civilian, were wounded by gunfire; all were in stable condition, said Dr. Raj Kumar Sangrama, a local medical officer.AdvertisementThe Indian-Pakistani border is dotted with small bodies of water, which Indian officials say are used by Pakistani militants to cross into India undetected.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Asia; India: 6 Killed at Kashmir Outpost.
