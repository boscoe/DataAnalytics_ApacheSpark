A Palestinian man stabbed a 70-year-old Israeli man, seriously wounding him, on a street on Monday in the northern city of Netanya, the police said. The assailant was shot and wounded by police officers. Hours earlier, a Palestinian man stabbed several people, including an 80-year-old woman, in Rishon Lezion, near Tel Aviv. Bystanders managed to apprehend the attacker, and the police then arrested him, the authorities said. The attacks, the latest in a month of violence, came after Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian who they said had tried to stab an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint in the West Bank.A version of this brief appears in print on November 3, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Israel: Stabbing Attacks Move Beyond Jerusalem and West Bank.
