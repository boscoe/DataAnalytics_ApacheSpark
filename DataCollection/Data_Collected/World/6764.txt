Looking haggard and with a long beard, the former hostage, Robert Nitsch Eberhard, arrived Wednesday in Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital, on a military flight. He had been kidnapped in neighboring Nigeria, where he was a teacher. “Until the last minute I did not know if I will survive or I will not survive,” he told reporters, describing total darkness and long periods “where nobody talks with you.” He said he had lost 110 pounds. The circumstances of his release were not clear, but the German ambassador to Cameroon, Klaus-Ludwig Keferstein, said officials were grateful to Cameroon’s government “that we could find a solution to the problem of this hostage taking.” Maps showing the violent rise of the Islamist militant group that is waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria.Advertisement
