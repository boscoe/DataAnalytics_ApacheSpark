Colombia has for the first time declined to extradite to the United States a leftist rebel accused of drug trafficking as it pushes to conclude peace negotiations with the rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The rebel fighter, Juan Vicente Carvajal, was wanted by American prosecutors. The Colombian government and the rebels have set a March 23 deadline for reaching a final accord that would end Latin America’s longest war, which has killed 220,000 people and displaced millions since 1964. Some FARC units have formed alliances with drug gangs. The government has said a final peace deal would probably protect former rebels from extradition to the United States.A version of this brief appears in print on December 2, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Colombia: Government Won’t Extradite Rebel to U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
