WASHINGTON — President Johnson launched today [Dec. 29] an all-out — and possibly final — drive to get the war in Vietnam to the negotiating table. Moving behind a curtain of secrecy, he dispatched two of his most trusted aides on sudden missions to Europe to see if they can get peace talks under way. Mr. Johnson’s roving ambassador, Averell Harriman, turned up unexpectedly in Warsaw to get across to the Communist world that North Vietnam must agree to talks. Almost simultaneously, Arthur Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, flew secretly into Rome to enlist the Pope in the effort to settle the war. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Dec. 30, 1965
