Ms. Suresh dismissed the effectiveness of a temporary ban, saying that it will continue to perpetuate the desire for ivory among wealthy Chinese while stimulating demand for illegal ivory laundering.International wildlife groups have long accused Beijing of deliberately ignoring China’s prime role in the illegal ivory trade, which has soared since officials with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, permitted China to buy 68 tons of African ivory in 2008.Chinese officials had lobbied hard to win permission for a legal domestic trade in ivory, claiming that it would save elephant herds by flooding the market with approved inventory, thus undercutting poachers. Instead, the slaughter has expanded as the price of ivory in China tripled in just four years from 2010, according to the organization Save the Elephants.“Every metric on the ivory trade has exploded upwards in recent years,” the organization said in a report last year that noted that the weight of seized ivory and the number of elephants killed for their tusks had also increased.In 1991, China adopted the terms of a 1989 international ban on the commercial ivory trade. Before Thursday’s moratorium announcement, Chinese were permitted to import ivory acquired through legal trophy hunting, and limited personal amounts of carved ivory obtained after 1975 from Zimbabwe and Namibia.The Chinese government has sponsored awareness campaigns highlighting the perils facing elephants, and officials destroyed six tons of illegal ivory last year. Still, many Chinese cling to a traditional fondness for ivory, which is believed to have medicinal properties and is given as gifts in the form of jewelry and carved sculptures.“People kill elephants so the ivory becomes more valuable, which will make people live better and happier,” said the owner of the Zhenguan Hall ivory shop in Shanghai, refusing to give his name. “Elephants die anyway. If they become extinct it really doesn’t matter.”Extinction is a growing possibility. At least 104 tons of ivory were seized globally between 2011 and 2013, equivalent to 15,522 dead elephants, said Ms. Suresh of the Environmental Investigation Agency.Despite China’s pledge that a temporary ban will help the government assess its benefits, Ms. Suresh and other wildlife advocates voiced concern. They fear that the Chinese government, which has openly called for relaxing international ivory trade limits, will use the yearlong moratorium as an excuse to say a ban failed to stop poaching and then call for the reopening of the international trade in ivory at the next major Cites conference, to be held in 2016.“China can emerge a leader in the fight against ivory trafficking by adopting a total ban on domestic trade in ivory,” she said. “This is the policy change that could actually make a difference for elephants in Africa.”Advertisement
