At least 15 government soldiers were killed in an ambush by fighters from the Shabab, a Somali rebel group, one day after the group killed a dozen people in an attack in the capital, a military official said late Monday. The ambush happened near Walaweyn, a town in the Lower Shabelle region, about 58 miles south of Mogadishu, the capital, said Col. Ahmed Muse of the Somali military. The Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the group’s online radio station, known as Andalus, saying that 30 soldiers had been killed. It was not possible to independently verify the group’s claims.A version of this brief appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Somalia: Soldiers Killed in Rebel Attack.
