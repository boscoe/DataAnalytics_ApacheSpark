Clashes between Myanmar troops and ethnic Kokang rebels near the Chinese border have left 47 government soldiers dead and 73 wounded, state news media said Friday. The newspaper The Global New Light of Myanmar said Friday there had been more than 13 clashes in the last several days between government troops and Kokang rebels near Laukkai close to the border, with the government carrying out five airstrikes. The number of rebel casualties was not immediately known. The newspaper said the fighting was serious enough for the government to inform China, which is concerned because clashes force civilians to flee across the border. The report said a Kokang renegade group led by the former Kokang leader Phone Kya Shin attacked military stations with the objective of capturing Laukkai, capital of the self-administered Kokang zone near the border more than 500 miles northeast of Yangon. The newspaper quoted local residents as saying that Kokang rebels had infiltrated the area by working in plantations and had attacked with rocket launchers and antiaircraft guns.A version of this brief appears in print on February 13, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Myanmar: 47 Government Troops Killed by Rebels.
