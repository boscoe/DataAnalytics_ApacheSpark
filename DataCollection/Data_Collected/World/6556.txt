Here are critical moments in the lives of Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, based on accounts from thousands of pages of legal documents obtained by The New York Times, including interrogation records, phone tap summaries and jailhouse letters.

Mr. Benyettou, then 22, was a janitor-turned-preacher who set up a pipeline for young French Muslims to join Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s Al Qaeda network in Iraq.Chérif and Saïd Kouachi, along with other young Muslim men, take Farid Benyettou’s classes and go on hourlong jogs at Buttes-Chaumont Park. The men later become known as the Buttes-Chaumont group. Chérif Kouachi decides to head to Iraq, leaving his brother behind. But hours before his flight on Jan. 25, 2005, he is arrested by the French police.While in prison, Chérif Kouachi is exposed to Djamel Beghal, one of France’s most radical jihadists. He meets Mr. Beghal, who was convicted in the 2001 plot to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Through him, he also befriends Amedy Coulibaly, who at the time was serving time for armed burglaries. Chérif Kouachi is released in 2006.Chérif Kouachi, Djamel Beghal and Amedy Coulibaly are detained for plotting a jailbreak to free Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem, a militant in prison for attacking a Paris rail station. Mr. Coulibaly and Mr. Beghal are sent back to jail. But Chérif Kouachi is released after a judge rules that there is not enough evidence to convict him.One or both of the Kouachi brothers travel to Yemen to train with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. American officials now say that Chérif Kouachi may have used his brother’s passport to go to Yemen to receive training and $20,000 from Al Qaeda’s affiliate there. Before his death, Chérif Kouachi tells a TV reporter that he had been trained and financed by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born preacher who was a top propagandist for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.Chérif and Saïd Kouachi attack the offices of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical newspaper, killing 12 people. Amedy Coulibaly later kills a police officer in southern Paris, then seizes a kosher supermarket the next day, killing four hostages before being killed by police.By Haeyoun Park, Sergio Peçanha and Tom GiratikanonAdvertisement
