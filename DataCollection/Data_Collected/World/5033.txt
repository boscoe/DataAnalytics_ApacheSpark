SANTO DOMINGO — Gunmen today [Dec . 20] machine-gunned the residence of civil war rebel leader Col. Francisco Caamano Deno as automatic arms fire continued to crackle throughout the city after weekend fighting that claimed at least nine lives. The new fighting raised fears that the shaky peace agreed to in September could blow apart, plunging this tense Caribbean island republic back into the chaos of this year’s four-month civil war. Col. Caamano Deno, involved yesterday with more than 100 of his men in a bloody battle with air force units in the streets of Santiago, this nation’s second largest city, came through this morning’s attack here unscathed. But the new fighting was seen as a severe blow to the rule of provisional President Hector Garcia Godoy, who only last week announced that rebel troops would be reintegrated into the Dominican armed forces. Shaking off today’s assassination attempt, Col. Caamano Deno went to the presidential palace and met with Mr. Garcia Godoy to discuss the violence of the past 24 hours. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 21, 1965
