The mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, was detained by federal officials on Thursday, opposition leaders said. Reports of the detention set off protests in some parts of Caracas, the capital; some people banged pots and others honked car horns. There was no confirmation from the government that Mr. Ledezma, a member of the opposition, had been detained. But Héctor Urgelles, a spokesman for Mr. Ledezma’s party, the Fearless People’s Alliance, said that dozens of masked men raided Mr. Ledezma’s office and carried him away without identifying themselves or showing a warrant for his arrest. Mr. Ledezma was elected in 2008, but the governing party subsequently transferred nearly all of his powers, including control of the police and schools, to a newly created government entity.A version of this brief appears in print on February 20, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Venezuela: Caracas Mayor Is Detained.
