India’s tiger population has rebounded, growing more than 30 percent over the last four years to 2,226, according to a new government census released on Tuesday.“It is incredible, wonderful,” said Yadvendradev Jhala, a tiger expert at the Wildlife Institute of India, and one of the supervisors of the report.India is home to 70 percent of the world’s tigers, and the latest increase comes after a decade-long effort to fight poaching and mitigate its effects, including a special tiger protection force and programs for orphaned cubs.In 2005, the government reported that poachers had killed the entire population of 22 tigers in a preserve in the state of Rajasthan.
