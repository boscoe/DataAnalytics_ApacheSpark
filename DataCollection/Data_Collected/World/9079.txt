The Russian opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny was released Friday after spending 15 days in custody and vowed that he and his supporters would not be intimidated by the killing of Boris Y. Nemtsov, a longtime Kremlin critic. Mr. Navalny, the driving force behind the 2011-12 mass protests in Moscow, said the killing in central Moscow would not lead him to scale down his campaign against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. “This act of terror hasn’t achieved its goal,” Mr. Navalny said after his release from a Moscow prison. “It will not frighten me or my comrades.” A Moscow court had found him guilty of violating the law when he distributed leaflets in the subway campaigning for an opposition rally.A version of this brief appears in print on March 7, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Russia: Navalny Is Released From Jail.
