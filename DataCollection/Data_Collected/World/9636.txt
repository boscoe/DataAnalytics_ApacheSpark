Still, the issue remains delicate for the United Nations system. It can hardly afford for its blue-helmeted troops to be seen as exploiting those they are sent to protect. At the same time, the United Nations must depend on contributing countries to pursue accusations of wrongdoing involving its military personnel.The report found that in 2014, 51 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse were reported in peacekeeping missions.The majority came from three large missions, in Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan. Among them were 13 allegations of sex with minors. There were paternity claims in 12 cases.Civilian agencies were not immune. The United Nations refugee agency reported six cases in which its staff exchanged money, employment or goods for sex.The report added that about 60 percent of complaints made since 2010 were found to be unsubstantiated.The advocacy group AIDS-Free World accused the United Nations of painting too rosy a picture of its efforts to curb sexual exploitation. It cited an unpublished 2013 report, which had been commissioned by the United Nations and which found that the problem was underreported and warned that “impunity is more norm than exception.”United Nations personnel can only be tried in the countries where they are posted if the organization specifically waives their legal immunity.Advertisement
