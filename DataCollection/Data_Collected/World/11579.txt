The mission said that two assailants stopped the convoy and shot the drivers before setting the vehicles on fire late Friday night about nine miles west of the northern city of Gao. Another member of the team was wounded but escaped with others in the convoy, officials said. On Wednesday, an attack on a United Nations peacekeeping base in the same region killed three people and wounded 16. A group formed by an Algerian extremist, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, claimed responsibility for that attack, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terrorist groups. Advertisement
