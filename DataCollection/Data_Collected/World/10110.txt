The survey by the polling firm MDA showed that 59.7 percent of respondents favor impeachment, and 68.9 percent believe Ms. Rousseff is responsible for the corruption involving a massive kickback scheme at the oil giant. Ms. Rousseffâ€™s popularity has fallen to a new low, with 64.8 percent of respondents rating her government negatively and only 10.8 percent seeing it positively, the poll said. Still, opposition leaders have resisted pushing for impeachment and say it is unlikely. The MDA poll, commissioned by the national transport lobby group CNT, surveyed 2,002 people from March 16 to 19. Advertisement
