HAVANA —  A delegation of members of Congress who have been some of the strongest advocates of lifting the American trade embargo with Cuba concluded a three-day visit here on Monday with optimism over trade deals but without an anticipated meeting with President Raúl Castro — apparently because of its decision to meet with several Cuban dissidents.The delegation, which included Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a longtime visitor who has long been involved in Cuban-American relations, emphasized the bright spots of the visit, particularly potential openings for American agricultural products in Cuba.With the Obama administration having lifted a battery of restrictions on trade and travel, and with plans by the United States and Cuba to reopen their embassies, Mr. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said he felt optimism among officials and citizens.“It’s a new day for Cuba and the United States,” Mr. Leahy told reporters.Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, took a ride in a 1950s taxi and laughingly wondered about being able to send a replacement from Detroit. Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, saw powdered milk from New Zealand on store shelves and asked why not get it “90 miles away in the U.S. That’s one thing that can change.”AdvertisementNo agreements were reached, but the politicians talked about taking the promise of a new relationship and transforming it into specific accords, though none suggested there were sufficient votes in Congress to lift the embargo outright.

That means many hurdles remain before an expansion of American exports to Cuba, not the least of which is how many American companies will venture into the country under threat of lawsuits from embargo supporters and in the face of Cuba’s daunting bureaucracy.AdvertisementThe Cuban government has offered few specifics about what it wants from the Americans in the new relationship, the State Department and congressional officials have said, aside from getting off the list of states that sponsor terrorism and doing away with remaining embargo-related restrictions.The delegation’s decision to meet with dissidents, who are still not allowed to openly criticize the government, appeared to have irked Cuban officials, who have urged American officials to skip such visits and have made clear that the improvement in relations would not end a political system that leaves little room for public opposition.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

An aide said the reason was not clear; such encounters are never certain. Yet he said the meeting with the dissidents could have been a factor.The delegation left two days before American and Cuban officials are to hold talks over migration accords and steps to reopen the embassies, the first encounter since President Obama and Mr. Castro announced the normalization of relations on Dec. 17 and swapped prisoners, including Alan Gross, an American foreign aid worker whose release Mr. Leahy had pursued directly with the Cubans. The talks will be led by Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson, the highest ranking American diplomat to visit Havana in 38 years.The Americans will push for the embassy in Havana to be like any other in the world, with Cubans allowed access. Officials said that Cuban guards often discourage people from approaching the building that now houses the United States Interests Section in Cuba. American officials will also ask that diplomats be allowed to travel around Cuba without getting permission and for their mail and goods to arrive without tampering.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Members of Congress, in Cuba, Discuss Trade but Don’t Meet With Castro.
