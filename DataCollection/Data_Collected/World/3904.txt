MEXICO CITY — Gen. Manuel Avila Camacho, soldier and rancher, became Mexico’s President today [Dec. 1], succeeding Lazaro Cardenas, and as he took office demonstrated that his government stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States and other sister American republics in the defense of democracy. The forty-three-year-old former Minister of War was inaugurated soon after 11 a.m. in the presence of special envoys from thirty-one foreign nations. Henry A. Wallace, Vice-President-elect of the United States, received a standing ovation when he entered the hall. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 2, 1940
