WASHINGTON — Secretary of State John Kerry plans to meet with his Iranian counterpart next week in Geneva to try to advance the negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, the State Department said on Friday.Mr. Kerry’s meeting with Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, will take place on Wednesday, a day before the American negotiating team is scheduled to resume formal talks in Geneva with Iranian officials.Mr. Kerry and Mr. Zarif will “provide guidance to their negotiating teams before their next round of discussions,” a senior State Department official said.Mr. Kerry is leaving Friday night for a long-planned trip to India but plans to stop in Munich on Saturday to meet with Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman, who has served as a conduit to Iranian officials.Talks on constraining Iran’s nuclear program have been extended twice, and a deadline for achieving a breakthrough is fast approaching.Iran and six world powers agreed in Vienna last year that March 1 would be the deadline for achieving a political accord that sets out the main provisions of an agreement. The deadline for completing a detailed agreement, including the technical details, is July 1.The talks have been frustrated by major differences, including over how many centrifuges Iran will be permitted to retain in order to enrich uranium.
                Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.            Mr. Kerry insisted at the end of a round of talks in Vienna in November that “new ideas surfaced” that might allow negotiators to bridge some of the gaps.A solution, if it is found, could involve an Iranian commitment to ship some of its nuclear stockpile to Russia. Iranian officials said on Friday that Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei A. Ryabkov, would travel to Tehran on Monday for talks with Mr. Zarif.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Iran: ‘Guidance’ Sought Before Nuclear Talks Resume.
