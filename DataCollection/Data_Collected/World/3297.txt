The three were flown out of Yemen’s capital, Sana, which is controlled by the Houthi rebels, on an Omani Air Force flight late on Wednesday, the news agency said. The brief statement gave no details about the identities of the Americans, but a Yemeni security official said the men had been detained by the rebels. “The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,” the official said. The rebels, who ousted Yemen’s internationally recognized government this year, have been pummeled by a military campaign led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the United States. Advertisement
