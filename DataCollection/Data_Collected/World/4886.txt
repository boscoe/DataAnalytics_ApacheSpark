The United Nations refugee agency urged the government not to go through with the deportations. Human Rights Watch said most of the 4,000 or so Sudanese asylum seekers in Jordan had traveled from the troubled Darfur region. The group said deporting them would violate customary international law, which forbids governments from returning people to areas where they risk being persecuted or tortured. Advertisement
