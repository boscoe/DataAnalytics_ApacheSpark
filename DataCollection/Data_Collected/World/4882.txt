The resignation of the speaker, Setya Novanto, from the opposition Golkar Party, came just minutes before Parliament’s Ethics Council was to rule that Mr. Novanto was guilty of a “moderate ethics violation,” which would result in his dismissal. A recording of a conversation in June made by the chief executive of the mining company, PT Freeport Indonesia, showed that Mr. Novanto and a businessman asked for a 20 percent stake for President Joko Widodo and Vice President Jusuf Kalla in return for an extension of the company’s operations. The two top officials denied any involvement. Mr. Novanto denied accusations of wrongdoing. Advertisement
