MOSCOW — One of Europe’s most senior human rights officials, the Council of Europe’s human rights commissioner, Nils Muiznieks, has criticized as “ridiculous” a new Russian law on road safety that prohibits transgender people from obtaining a driver’s license.The law took effect on Jan. 4 and bars people with “gender identity disorders” and “disorders of sexual preference” from driving. It also disqualifies people with any of a long list of physical and mental conditions.In a post on Facebook, Mr. Muiznieks called the rule a clear violation of European human rights law.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Russia: Ban Directed at Transgender Drivers Is Assailed.
