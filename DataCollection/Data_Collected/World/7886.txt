The police and security officers climbed Mount Gourougou, rounded up 1,200 migrants and bused them to remote towns in southern Morocco. For the past year, African migrants have made almost weekly attempts to reach Europe via the two Spanish enclaves on the Moroccan coast, Melilla and Ceuta. Spain said that 2,000 migrants crossed into the enclaves last year. Advertisement
