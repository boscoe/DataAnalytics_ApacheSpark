The police said the fire broke out Friday in a car repair shop at the base of a commercial building before spreading to a warehouse that had been illegally rented out to the workers. The police did not identify the victims but said they were migrant workers. Labor rights activists have long raised concerns about conditions for low-paid migrant laborers in the Emirates.
