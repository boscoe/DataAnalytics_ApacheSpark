Australian officials destroyed a boat carrying asylum seekers and then pushed them back to sea in another vessel, Indonesia said Friday. The chief of multilateral affairs in the Indonesian Foreign Office, Hasan Kleib, expressed concern that Australia had taken the unilateral action. Sixteen migrants from India, Nepal and Bangladesh and their Indonesian skipper were found stranded in Indonesia’s part of Timor Island on Thursday. The skipper, whom the police were questioning, said he was paid 22 million rupiah ($1,600) to transport the migrants from West Java. They left Nov. 18 and arrived at Christmas Island on Monday. The migrants were quoted as saying that Australian officials destroyed the boat, detained them for four days and sent them back out to sea in a new boat. Australia’s border protection minister, Peter Dutton, declined to comment, under a government policy of secrecy about people-smuggling operations.A version of this brief appears in print on November 28, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Indonesia: Australia Destroys Boat in Repelling Migrants, Official Says.
