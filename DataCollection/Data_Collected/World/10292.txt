An American aid worker being treated for Ebola at the National Institutes of Health clinical center in Maryland is doing better and has been upgraded from critical to serious condition, the N.I.H. announced Thursday. The patient, who worked with the American charity Partners in Health in Sierra Leone, was transferred to the United States on March 13. A Sierra Leonean colleague who also contracted Ebola in March has recovered and was discharged from a treatment unit, said Dr. Adikali Kamara, a district medical officer in Sierra Leone. People who came into contact with the two men, including more than a dozen Americans who were evacuated in several groups to the United States, are still being monitored for symptoms.A version of this brief appears in print on March 27, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Science and Health; An American With Ebola Is Improving.
