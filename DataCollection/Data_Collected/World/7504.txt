HONG KONG — Fiji will replace its national flag this year to remove symbols of British colonialism, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced Tuesday.Upon independence in 1970, the Pacific island nation adopted a flag closely modeled after its colonial-era banner, with a British Union Flag in the upper left corner and a shield with symbols including the British lion and the Cross of St. George in its right half.“They are the symbols of the colonizer — Britain — a country with whom we are friends and will continue to be so,” Mr. Bainimarama said. “But they are not symbols that are relevant to any Fijian in the 21st century. And they should go.”The Union Flag, also known as the Union Jack, appears on the flags of a variety of territories and provinces, as well as a handful of national flags of former British colonies. One of those countries, New Zealand, could drop the Union Jack from its flag pending the outcome of two referendums, to be held this year and next.Mr. Bainimarama said Fiji would begin soliciting citizens’ suggestions for a new design with “indigenous and truly Fijian symbols of identity.” He said he hoped the final result would retain the existing “Fiji blue” background but remove the Union Flag and colonial shield.A government-selected citizens’ panel will choose a final design, with plans to complete the process in time for Oct. 10, when Fiji marks 45 years of independence.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
