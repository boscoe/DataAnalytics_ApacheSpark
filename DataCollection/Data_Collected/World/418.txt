In a department store in the rue de Rivoli, the Paris police obtained information which has enabled them to ensnare a gang of master craftsmen and craftswomen. The police learned of two women, Clara Wintersten and Marie Grellet, who owed their success to always having a high-powered automobile waiting for them outside the door. On Wednesday, the automobile did not leave with the two women alone. As they climbed in by one door two policemen jumped in through the other, while the inspector for the department store seated himself by the chauffeur and ordered him to drive to police headquarters. â€” The New York Herald, European Edition, October 8, 1915
