The move clears the path for a referendum, which is not expected to face much opposition. The lower house of Parliament has already approved the changes. Mr. Kagame, in power since 2000, has won widespread praise for rebuilding Rwanda since a 1994 genocide killed about 800,000 people. But rights groups say the government severely restricts freedom of expression, charges the government has denied. The Senate leader, Bernard Makuza, said he expected the changes to be approved in a referendum, adding that Mr. Kagame, whose term ends in 2017, could run for another seven-year term and then two five-year terms, possibly keeping him in power until 2034. In Washington, the State Department expressed “great concern” over the Senate’s decision. Advertisement
