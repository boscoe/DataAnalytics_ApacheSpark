The fear is that if we don’t, we would reverse all the gains that have been made.”For several decades, artemisinin has been considered an anti-malaria wonder drug, rapidly ridding the body of the parasite that is introduced into the body by a mosquito and infects the blood.Early signs of trouble with the drug were cited a decade ago by scientists working in western Cambodia. Falciparum malaria, the deadliest form of the disease, was increasingly resistant to treatment with artemisinin, which is derived from a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine and is often used in conjunction with other drugs.The new study in The Lancet shows that resistance to the drug extends more than 1,500 miles away from Cambodia, along the border between Myanmar and India.It was not known whether resistance had spread overland or whether new diagnostic tools were revealing a situation that had previously gone undetected.The Lancet article concluded that resistance to artemisinin treatment “extends across much of Myanmar.”One of the sites where resistance was prevalent was 15 miles from the border with India.“The pace at which the geographical extent of artemisinin resistance is spreading is faster than the rate at which control and elimination measures are being developed and instituted, or new drugs being introduced,” the authors of The Lancet article wrote. “A vigorous international effort to contain this enormous threat is needed.”There is no immediate replacement for artemisinin, which has helped contribute to steep declines in mortality rates from the disease.Scientists say any possible substitute is years if not decades away.Scientists are particularly concerned about the declining efficacy of artemisinin because it appears to follow a pattern seen in previously used malaria drugs, like chloroquine. Such drugs were, in their time, mainstays of malaria treatment but are no longer considered useful because the parasite became resistant.The Lancet study found that nearly 40 percent of the samples it gathered from patients across Myanmar showed resistance to artemisinin.“It’s probably not a matter of if but a matter of when the rest of the world will be seeing this problem,” said Voravit Suwanvanichkij, a medical doctor who works with charities that offer health care to people along the Thai-Myanmar border.Dr. Voravit said Myanmar’s decrepit health care system and the lack of government control in many parts of the country had abetted the development of drug resistance.“In a place like Burma, where you have a health system that is so inadequate, you have the perfect setup for something like this,” Dr. Voravit said, referring to the country by its alternate name. “There are a lot of fake and adulterated drugs on the market.”Scientists say counterfeit drugs and patients who do not finish their course of medication encourage drug resistance by giving the parasite greater opportunity to mutate.Drug resistance appears to be most acute in western Cambodia, where a standard three-day course of drugs is no longer effective for many patients, scientists say. Additional doses are needed to mop up the malarial parasites.Researchers’ great fear is that resistance to artemisinin will spread to Africa. Ninety percent of the estimated 584,000 annual deaths from malaria occur in Africa, according to the World Health Organization.Advertisement
