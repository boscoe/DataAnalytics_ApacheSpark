Fighters from the Islamic State group ambushed an Iraqi Army convoy on Friday with a bulldozer packed with explosives, killing the commander of the First Division and three of his staff officers north of Falluja, said military officials. A suicide bomber in the bulldozer attacked the convoy of Humvees and then militants opened fire, killing Brig. Gen. Hassan Abbas Toufan, a colonel and two lieutenant colonels, said a member of the division and an intelligence officer. There was no initial count on the number of soldiers killed in the attack. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The attack is a setback for the Iraqi Army, which is embroiled in a fierce battle to reconquer western Anbar Province, which has been under the control of the Islamic State for the past year. Fighting has been focused on the provincial capital, Ramadi, where the government had been making slow progress.A version of this brief appears in print on April 25, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Iraq: ISIS Kills an Army Commander.
