To obtain money for the relief of the families of French artists now at the front in Europe and to arouse sympathy for the innocent sufferers from war a movement is under way to bring to the United States and exhibit in the leading cities Albert Besnard’s allegorical painting of a group symbolizing Peace, which the French Government was to contribute toward the decoration of Mr. Andrew Carnegie’s Peace Palace in The Hague. The exhibition will be under the auspices of the Museum of French Art in the United States, and it is hoped that part of the proceeds will be available before Christmas. It is proposed to show the painting in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco and in any other city where there seems to be sufficient interest in it. The painting represents peace by arbitrament. It shows a woman listening to the pleading of two litigants. Below are two warriors, whose differences have been settled, riding away in different directions. In the foreground the symbolic figure of Peace rises, carrying a child in her arms. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 24, 1915
