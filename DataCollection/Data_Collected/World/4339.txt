At least 33 people have died from a swine flu virus outbreak in two provinces of southwestern Iran in the past three weeks, the country’s deputy health minister, Ali-Akbar Sayyari, said Monday. Mr. Sayyari also said the virus, known as H1N1, was likely to spread to other areas, including Tehran, the capital and Iran’s largest city with about 8.3 million people. Mr. Sayyari’s remarks, reported by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, did not explain the precise origin of the outbreak or how the Iranian authorities intended to combat it. Swine flu is named for a virus that infects pigs, but the H1N1 strain, which first emerged in 2009, spreads via human-to-human contact and escalated into a global pandemic before it was contained after a year. The virus is now considered a human seasonal flu virus, according to the Department of Health and Human Services in the United States, and can be prevented with a vaccine.A version of this brief appears in print on December 8, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Deadly Swine Flu Outbreak Is Likely to Spread, Official Warns.
