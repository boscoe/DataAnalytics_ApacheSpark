Ms. Bhandari, 54, the deputy leader of the Communist Party of Nepal Unified Marxist-Leninist, had lobbied actively for a new Constitution, which requires that either the president or vice president be a woman. Lawmakers cheered when Ms. Bhandari’s name was announced as the new president, a largely ceremonial post.
