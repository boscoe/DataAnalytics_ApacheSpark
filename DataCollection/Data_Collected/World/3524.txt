The United States military said Monday that it had destroyed 283 tanker trucks used by Islamic State militants to transport oil out of eastern Syria. The operation on Saturday involved four A-10 attack planes and two AC-130 gunships near Deir el-Zour and Hasaka; it followed a similar attack on Nov. 15 that destroyed 116 tanker trucks.
