VICHY — The famous seventeenth century painting ‘‘The Immaculate Conception,’’ by Murillo, which used to attract the immediate attention of all who visited the Grand Gallery of the Louvre Museum at Paris by the angelic expression on the face of the central figure and the delicate blue tint of the draperies, has been handed over to Spain by the Pétain government. It will henceforth adorn the walls of the Prado Museum in Madrid. The loss of this celebrated masterpiece was first communicated to the French people today [Dec. 9] in the form of a Madrid dispatch of two paragraphs published at the bottom of a page in ‘‘Le Temps.’’ It stated merely that Francois Pietri, the French Ambassador at Madrid, had gone to the station there to meet the train bringing the picture to its new home. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 10, 1940
