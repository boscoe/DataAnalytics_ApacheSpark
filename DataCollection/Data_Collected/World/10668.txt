The man, Kim Ki-jong, 55, was also indicted on charges of assaulting a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty, according to the Seoul Central District Prosecutorsâ€™ Office. Prosecutors have also been investigating whether Mr. Kim violated a controversial law that bans praise or assistance for North Korea. The police say Mr. Kim attacked Ambassador Mark W. Lippert with a knife during a breakfast forum on March 5. Mr. Lippert suffered deep gashes on his face and arm. The police say that Mr. Kim opposed joint military exercises carried out by the United States and South Korea. Advertisement
