Ms. Okawa, born in Osaka on March 5, 1898, was recognized as the world’s oldest person by Guinness World Records in 2013. “It seemed rather short,” she said after an Osaka government official asked how she felt about living for 117 years. Asked for the secret of her longevity, she said, “I wonder about that too.” Ms. Okawa married her husband, Yukio, in 1919, and they had three children. He died in 1931. Japan has the most centenarians in the world, with more than 58,000, according to the government. Advertisement
