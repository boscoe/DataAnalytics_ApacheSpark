After initially approving the city’s plan, the former Conservative federal government banned the city from diverting the sewage in the midst of the recent election campaign. The Conservatives were routed by the Liberal Party last month.The new Liberal government said Monday that the diversion could go ahead provided that the city addressed concerns raised by a panel of scientists. That review found that while dumping the sewage was not ideal, it was preferable to the potential consequences of a sewer failure.Advertisement
