Most critics complain about the chamber’s increase in number in the past 15 years, now with close to 800 voting members.But on Thursday, recommendations were published that would reduce its powers rather than its size.The initiative follows a political tussle between ministers and the chamber: the House of Lords rejected government proposals on curbing social welfare payments in October.That left a hole of about 4.4 billion pounds, or $6.6 billion, in the government’s plans to balance the budget and prompted the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, to make a humiliating retreat over the issue.In flexing its muscles, the Lords revived a debate that has stirred, intermittently, for more than a century over the role of the upper chamber, which generally accepts its junior status in Parliament to elected lawmakers in the House of Commons.This past summer, the House of Lords also made embarrassing headlines when John Sewel, the chairman of its committee responsible for upholding standards among members, stepped down after the newspaper The Sun on Sunday accused him of snorting cocaine off the chest of a prostitute and released a video that showed him consuming a white powder.Tensions over the powers of the House of Lords are acute now because the Conservative government, in which Mr. Osborne serves, has an outright majority in the House of Commons.But it does not have the same numerical advantage as in the House of Lords, where it can sometimes be outvoted if the opposition Labour Party and the center-left Liberal Democrats join forces, leading to legislation being amended or delayed.After the welfare vote in October, the government asked a senior Conservative politician, Thomas Galbraith, known as Lord Strathclyde, to investigate some of the powers of the Lords (though not other issues, such as the size of the assembly).On Thursday, he outlined three possible ways to reduce the power of the Lords over statutory instruments, a form of secondary legislation. Under Lord Strathclyde’s preferred option, the House of Lords would be able to ask the House of Commons to reconsider secondary legislation when disputes exist, but the elected chamber would have the final say.In a statement, Prime Minister David Cameron thanked Lord Strathclyde and said he would “consider his recommendations carefully before responding in the new year.”Baroness Angela Smith, who leads the Labour members of the House of Lords, said that if the proposals were a reaction to the welfare vote in October, it “would be a massive overreaction” but that in fact it was “far more serious than that.”Meg Russell, director of the Constitution Unit at University College in London, said that the proposed changes were “potentially very significant” but that there was “some key detail missing,” which made it hard to assess the likely impact.But she added that there was an opportunity to negotiate a bigger package of changes and to agree to limits on the size of the chamber as a quid pro quo for the reduction of powers that the government wanted.“If you ask most people what is the problem with the House of Lords — if they have a view — they will point to the increase in its size in recent years,” Prof. Russell said. “I think the government ought to be prepared to do a deal on limiting numbers in exchange to changes to powers.”Many of the 790 voting members of the Lords are retired politicians or other party loyalists. A large number exists because the government can nominate supporters to the House of Lords, who are then appointed by the monarch.The Lords do not receive a salary, but members can claim up to £300 as a daily allowance for attending sessions, and do not have to give up any other job. A seat there also brings prestige, a public platform and an opportunity to shape laws, without having to fight any election.Despite its critics, the House of Lords has survived largely because of a lack of an agreement on a workable alternative and the fear that, were it converted into an elected chamber, it would produce the sort of deadlock seen in some bicameral legislatures, such as that of the United States.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
