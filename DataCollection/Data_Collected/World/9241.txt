He stepped down after Israel complained of a conflict of interest because he had given legal advice to the Palestine Liberation Organization.The panel needs to “weigh with the utmost objectivity” a large number of submissions and documents received from both sides in recent weeks, Ms. McGowan Davis said.Panel members conducted interviews in Jordan but were unable to visit Gaza after Israel refused to cooperate with the inquiry, which it accused of bias.Advertisement
