I guess they fly at very high altitudes. #Saudi #airstrikesExplosions/bombardment in multiple locations in capital Sana'a #Yemen now and antiaircraft rattling in frenzy.All my family woke up terrified cus of the bombings- what the hell? Would that be a one night thing? #YemenThere isn't a single direction I don't hear bombings from its side . #yemen #sanaaAfter dawn, as residents of Sana ventured out, some reported that they were surprised to find life going on, somewhat as normal, although schools were closed and there were long lines for fuel. Others shared political commentary and personal reflections, while anxiously watching the sky for signs of a renewed assault.Images of Yemen’s president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, appearing in Saudi Arabia and smiling broadly were bitterly dissected back home.As night fell and new bombing was reported in the capital and other parts of the country, Yemenis seemed to adjust to the new normal, comparing the second night’s strikes to what had come before. They joked about extending thanks to the nation of Oman for not joining in the attack and shared tips on how to deal with the pressure and stress.Advertisement
