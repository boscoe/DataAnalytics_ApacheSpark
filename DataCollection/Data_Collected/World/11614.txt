The body of a boy lies on a Gaza beach as a rescuer carries away another boy. Four boys died after two explosions, about 30 seconds apart. The first struck a small shack on a sea wall. The second, witnessed by the photographer, Tyler Hicks, from a nearby window, landed on the open beach near the boys as they were fleeing. Hicks rushed to the beach and photographed the scene.CreditTyler Hicks/The New York Times1 of 17
