The verdict follows an investigation and trial that were mired in controversy, including allegations of police incompetence, mishandling of evidence and torture of the suspects. The tourists, Hannah Witheridge and David Miller, were found dead on a beach on the island, Koh Tao, in September 2014. After weeks of pressure to solve the case, the migrants, U Zaw Lin and U Win Zaw Htun were arrested. Both later retracted their confessions. Advertisement
