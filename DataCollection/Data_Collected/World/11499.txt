Six militants were sentenced to death, and another was given life imprisonment by the military courts early this month.“The executions will remain stayed unless the court gives a decision,” said Justice Nasir ul-Mulk, while presiding over a full court of 17 judges in Islamabad.Nine military courts were set up in January after Parliament passed a constitutional amendment that empowered the military to try those suspected of being terrorists in a parallel system of courts, which operate swiftly compared with the slower-paced civilian judiciary.The move came after the brutal attack on a school in Peshawar last year by the Taliban in which at least 149 people were killed, most of them children. After the violence, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty and presented a plan to fight terrorism and militancy in the country.The establishment of the military courts and the lifting of the death penalty moratorium were criticized by rights groups and lawyers, who have raised concerns about the expansion of the military’s power.The petition to the court, filed on behalf of the Supreme Court Bar Association by Asma Jahangir, a rights activist and lawyer, challenged the trials by the military courts and questioned whether prisoners were provided with a fair hearing under them.“The recent trials of military courts are neither public nor transparent, and military courts do not ordinarily observe the principle of due process,” the petition said.The military courts operate under relative secrecy, and few details are available about the trials of the seven convicted of being terrorists. During the hearing on Thursday, the chief justice observed that only the sentences were made public, the local news media reported.“The Supreme Court suspending the execution orders issued by the military courts is indeed a welcome development,” said Saroop Ijaz, a columnist and lawyer in Lahore. “The proceedings are opaque, hasty and fall well short of all domestic and international standards of fair trial.”The hearing on the legality of the military courts was adjourned until Wednesday.There was no immediate comment from the military, but the move to suspend the executions might rankle the powerful generals who had pushed to set up the military courts. The military has ruled, directly or indirectly, for more than half of the country’s history, and it is not used to greater levels of scrutiny and public accountability under the civilian government.“I think the clash between the military and the judiciary cannot be ruled out,” said Asad Jamal, a lawyer based in Lahore. “However, the likelihood is moderate, not serious. I think the Pakistan Army understands, or most in the senior hierarchy do, that they cannot eradicate terrorism by simply operating military courts and executing a couple of hundred terrorists.”Advertisement
