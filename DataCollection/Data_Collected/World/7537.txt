Mr. Maazab added that his men had regained control of the field, which used to pump 40,000 barrels a day but is not operating now. The French energy company Total has a stake in the site, but it is contracted to a Libyan company. The Filipinos worked for an Italian company, Sogepi S.r.l., according to a statement earlier Wednesday by the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs. It reported three of its citizens as among seven foreigners who had been “abducted by unidentified armed men.”With Libya in turmoil, details of the attack, which occurred Tuesday night, were difficult to determine. Two rival governments control different parts of the country, each with their own armies. Rival armed factions have also been fighting for almost two months for control of Libya’s biggest oil ports, Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, on the Mediterranean coast.The Mabruk oil field closed after clashes that shut Es Sider in December. Total said it had had no personnel onshore since July.A French diplomatic source in Paris and Ali al-Hassi, a spokesman for an oil guard force, blamed Islamists for Tuesday’s attack, though it was not immediately possible to verify that assertion.Militants claiming links to the Islamic State, which controls parts of Syria and Iraq, took responsibility for an attack last week on a luxury hotel in Tripoli that killed nine people, including five foreigners. However, officials of the government in Tripoli blame factions loyal to the ousted dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Advertisement
