Four people were killed and 21 were wounded in the northeastern city of Potiskum on Sunday when explosives attached to two young women, one of them about 15 years old, were detonated in a crowded market, according to a security official and medical workers. The blasts at the market in Yobe State came just a day after a bomb strapped to a girl about 10 years old exploded in a market in Maiduguri in neighboring Borno State, killing as many as 20 people and wounding at least 18. A security official at the scene in Potiskum said one of the young women was about 15 and the other was in her early 20s. Both were killed. The older woman detonated her explosives first, the official said, and “the second bomber was terrified by the explosion and she tried to dash across the road, but she also exploded.”A version of this brief appears in print on January 12, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Nigeria: Market Hit by Bombs Strapped to 2 Women.
