With all the strangely picturesque ceremony customary to the occasion, the coronation of Emperor Yoshihito of Japan took place yesterday at Kyoto, the Holy City. Strictly speaking, by reason of the fact that in Japan the sovereign has no crown nor does he receive any anointment, the ceremony was not so much that of a coronation as of the consecration of the new Emperor by a solemn ritual homage paid by him to his ancestors. The festivities in connection with the celebration of the Emperor’s accession to the throne last a month and began on Saturday with the departure from Tokyo of the sovereign and his suite for Kyoto, where on Sunday he deposited in the sacred pavilion called the Shunko-Den the sword, mirror and jewels bequeathed by the first Emperor of the Meiji dynasty. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 11, 1915
