NEW DELHI — An express train hit a safety barrier at a railway station in northern India on Friday morning, killing at least 32 people and injuring dozens more after two coach cars and the engine derailed, the authorities said.The Dehradun-Varanasi Janta Express blew past the signal at the Bachhrawan station in Uttar Pradesh around 9 a.m. before hitting the barrier, said a railroad spokesman, Neeraj Sharma.Mr. Sharma said that the train’s speed had not yet been established but that the damage suggested it had been going about 20 to 25 miles per hour. It was unclear what caused the crash, he said.Ram Murat Yadav, a senior police official in Rae Bareli, the district in Uttar Pradesh in which the train crashed, said that nearby residents had rushed to the scene and were assisting the police and rescue teams in pulling bodies from heaps of twisted metal. He said that at least six of the bodies were disfigured beyond immediate recognition and that at least four children had died.AdvertisementAccidents are common on India’s railroads, which carry millions of passengers on an aging network of tracks, stations and trains.Though Mr. Sharma said that an inquiry had been ordered to determine whether the train’s brakes had failed, the minister of railways, Suresh Prabhu, took to Twitter to express his concern about safety in the “crumbling” infrastructure.AdvertisementIndia allocated more than $137 billion to upgrade railroads in its most recent budget, earmarking more than $20 billion for safety measures.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Asia; India: 32 Killed as Train Derails.
