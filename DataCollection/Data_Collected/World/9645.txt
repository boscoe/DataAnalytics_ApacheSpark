The Giza Criminal Court issued its decision on Monday, but set an April 11 date to issue the ruling formally. Egypt’s grand mufti will first review the matter, as in all death penalty cases, but his ruling is not binding. The case is rooted in violence that swept the country after the military-led ouster of President Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Advertisement
