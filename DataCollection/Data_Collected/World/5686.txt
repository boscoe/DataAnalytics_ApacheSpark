Figures compiled by the Health, Interior and Defense Ministries put the death toll at 15,538, compared with 17,956 killed in 2007 at the height of Sunni-Shiite sectarian violence. The 2014 toll was more than double the 6,522 people killed in 2013. The United Nations put the number of civilians killed in Iraq during 2014 at 12,282. But Iraq Body Count, a project based in Britain that tracks violence in Iraq, gave a higher toll, saying that 17,073 civilians were killed last year. Advertisement
