Mr. Santos praised the group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, for holding to a unilateral cease-fire it declared late last year. He said that the military would cease bombing for a month and then decide whether to continue, but said it would respond to any threats. He also said that military ground patrols would continue. Mr. Santos has long resisted calls from the FARC to agree to a full cease-fire while talks continue. Bombings have been one of the government’s most effective weapons against the FARC. Advertisement
