The Afghan authorities in Jalalabad said the Afghan soldier opened fire on a group of American soldiers. A Western official in Afghanistan, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that the service member who died in the attack was an American.At some point after the American diplomat, Donald Yamamoto, had left in a helicopter, an Afghan soldier at a nearby guard post began shooting at coalition troops who were still in the area, the Nangarhar police chief, Fazal Ahmad Sherzad, said. Coalition soldiers returned fire, killing the Afghan gunman and wounding at least one other Afghan, according to officials in the provincial governor’s office.The American-led military mission, known as Resolute Support, issued a statement saying only that “an incident in Jalalabad today resulted in the death of one Resolute Support service member.”Earlier this year, a coalition service member was killed in a suicide attack in Kabul. Three American contractors working for the military mission here were also killed at the Kabul International Airport in January when a man wearing an Afghan military uniform opened fire on them.So-called insider attacks, in which members of the Afghan security forces turn on Western allies, have declined since their peak in 2012.Khalid Alokozai contributed reporting from Jalalabad.Advertisement
