Prosecutors in the northern state of Sinaloa said Monday that a burned-out vehicle found with two charred bodies inside was registered in the name of one of two missing Australian tourists. Attorney General Marco Antonio Higuera of Sinaloa State said the vehicle’s serial number matched a vehicle registered in Alberta, Canada, to Adam Coleman, one of the missing men. He and Dean Lucas had been traveling from Edmonton to Guadalajara, Mexico, but they did not arrive as planned on Nov. 21. The bodies in the vehicle were so badly burned that officials will be able to identify them only through DNA tests or dental records, said Guadalupe Martinez, a spokesman for Mr. Higuera’s office. After taking a ferry from Baja California on Nov. 20, the men apparently began driving toward Guadalajara but did not get very far, Mr. Higuera said. The van and bodies were found the next day in a rural area of Novolato, about 100 miles south of Topolobampo, where they had exited the ferry. A tourist was killed last year along Mexico’s scenic Pacific coast in Sinaloa.A version of this brief appears in print on December 1, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexico: Charred Bodies in Van May Be Those of Missing Australian Tourists.
