BERLIN —  The Turkish border police detained eight Moroccans in Istanbul this week after becoming suspicious that they were Islamic radicals who planned to infiltrate Europe by joining the migrant stream.The hotel where the men said they had booked rooms for a vacation denied having a reservation, and the men were carrying charts and papers seeming to show that they did not plan to stay in Turkey, but would instead follow the now well-worn migrant path west and north.Turkey says it has detained about 1,000 suspected Islamic State extremists this year, but the eight men from Casablanca, reported Wednesday by the semiofficial news agency Anadolu, were the first known to be flagged for trying to embed as refugees. The Turkish authorities said some of the men were deported and some remained in custody.The episode highlights Turkey’s role as the gateway for refugees marching to Europe, and it added new urgency to a discussion that has been continuing for weeks, as European leaders seek Turkey’s cooperation in stemming the migrants’ flow. Those talks, though, have stalled amid mutual distrust, as well as Turkey’s insistence on using the crisis to obtain something it has long wanted: visa-free travel for its citizens to Europe.AdvertisementThroughout the four years of Syria’s civil war, Turkey, a member of NATO, has been accused by the West of not policing its southern border with Syria, allowing jihadists and weapons to easily enter Syria. It was only over the last year that Turkey awoke to the dangers of the Islamic State and became willing to crack down more forcefully at the Syrian border.AdvertisementNow, in the aftermath of the Paris attacks and the revelation that the French police had found a Syrian passport at one attack site that was used by a man who had passed from Turkey to Greece in October, Turkey’s other border — the maritime one that connects it to Greece — is of growing concern.Turkey’s position between the European and Arab worlds has long cast it as crucial to solutions in both regions.For the European Union, it is not only a fundamental element of any effort to slow the migrant flow and exert better control over who is entering its outer borders. It is also a key to gathering intelligence and tracking militants from Syria who are determined to bring jihad to European soil.
                The Islamic State emerged from a group of militants in Iraq to take over large portions of Iraq and Syria, and now threatens other countries in Europe and elsewhere.            “It became obvious after this summer that the E.U. needed Turkish collaboration in order to have a reasonable chance of maintaining its own cohesion,” said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and analyst at Carnegie Europe in Brussels.Such a deal is particularly important to Germany, which expects to receive some 800,000 asylum applications this year. Chancellor Angela Merkel has remained steadfast about welcoming refugees fleeing the Syria and Iraq wars, but she is under pressure to slow the flow and ensure more extensive background checks on those crossing its borders.For weeks, she and other European leaders have been courting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, but the talks have dragged on.In return for its cooperation, Turkey wants help — 3 billion euros over the next two years — to care for the 2.2 million refugees it now harbors, most of them Syrian. It seeks visa-free travel for Turks and a revitalization of talks that have stalled for a decade over Turkish membership in the European Union. And it would like a full summit meeting in Brussels to seal this deal with the European Union.AdvertisementEuropeans already suspicious of admitting Turkey, a large country with a mostly Muslim population, are wary. They point to Turkey’s failure to secure its porous border with Syria when the civil war erupted in 2011, increasing the area’s instability in an attempt to help unseat its enemy, President Bashar al-Assad.The border has remained porous, even after 2014, when Turkey reasserted more control. Europe said that has allowed thousands of young Europeans to freely cross its border to join and train with Islamic State militants in Syria — including some of the terrorists linked to the Paris attacks.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the subject, said Turkey frequently obfuscated and was generally uncooperative in sharing security data, and suggested that this may have played a role in suspects’ slipping through.The Turkish authorities made their own claim on noncooperation, saying they had warned their French counterparts twice in the past year about one of the attackers, Ismaël Omar Mostefaï, a 29-year-old French citizen who was known to the authorities as someone with radical Islamist beliefs, a senior Turkish official said Monday.The Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government protocol, said Ankara had never heard back from France and only received an “information request” about Mr. Mostefaï after the Paris attacks.The officials said that on Oct. 10, 2014, Turkey received an information request from France about four terrorism suspects. During its investigation, the Turkish authorities said they identified a fifth person, Mr. Mostefaï, and notified French counterparts twice, in December 2014 and June 2015.European intelligence officials believe that Mr. Mostefaï traveled to Turkey in 2012 and probably then slipped into Syria. The Turkish official disputed that account, saying that Mr. Mostefaï entered Turkey in 2013 and that there was no record of him leaving the country.The Turkish official said the case of Mr. Mostefaï reflected the importance of sharing intelligence in fighting terrorism.AdvertisementThe mutual suspicion has made it difficult for the European Union and Turkey to seal a deal on hardening Turkey’s borders.Turkey, sensing that it holds the upper hand with Europe, has dallied.But the Paris attacks may have shifted the dynamics. Now, Mr. Ulgen said, the Turks “should be in a hurry because, after Paris, the E.U.’s ability to deliver more is becoming severely constrained.”France and Europe are now preoccupied with fighting the Islamic State, a cause that will take President François Hollande to Washington and Moscow next week. The summit with the European Union sought by Mr. Erdogan to seal a new deal with Europe is likely to take second place.Since the Paris attacks, conservative governments in Poland and Hungary, citing security threats, have raised new objections to taking in Syrian refugees. Populist leaders like Marine Le Pen in France, who has risen steadily in polls, are poised to gain support and could delay or block an unpopular deal with Turkey.As that political and diplomatic struggle plays out, heightened anxiety over security at airports and borders continues to ripple far beyond Europe. In Honduras, five Syrian men carrying stolen Greek passports tried to enter Honduras but were arrested by immigration authorities at Toncontín airport in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran authorities said Wednesday.The authorities indicated that the passports had been altered to replace the original photos with those of the men.Reporting was contributed by Ceylan Yeginsu from Istanbul; Dan Bilefsky from Paris; James Kanter from Brussels; Tim Arango from Essex Junction, Vt.; and Elisabeth Malkin and Azam Ahmed from Mexico City.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
