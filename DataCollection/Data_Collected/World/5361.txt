More than 30 people were injured as houses or walls collapsed in the northwestern Pakistan city of Peshawar, said an emergency rescue service spokesman, Bilal Ahmed Faizi. Another Pakistani official, Ghulam Rasool, said it was a magnitude-6.9 quake centered in Tajikistan. But the United States Geological Survey reported that the quake had a magnitude of 6.2 and was centered in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan. Twitter users in the Afghan capital, Kabul, reported feeling the tremors. Hamid Nawaz, who runs Pakistan’s disaster management authority, said officials were still assessing damage. He confirmed that some old homes and walls collapsed in Peshawar, but he refused to share further details. The quake was also felt in the Kashmir region. In Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, some residents remained outside their homes despite the chilly winter weather, fearful of aftershocks. Advertisement
