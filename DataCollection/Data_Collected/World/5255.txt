Though the shadow of the great war lies athwart suffering Europe and though in France there be countless homes that are mourning lost ones, yet something of the spirit of Christmas has survived the tragedy of circumstances. In Paris particularly, where weather conditions on Christmas Eve were deplorable, the unbiased observer must have been impressed by the people’s fine courage and the optimism that seventeen months of warfare have not dimmed. All day yesterday the main boulevards of the city were very crowded, and, despite the occasional rain, the booths did good business, especially among the procrastinating majority who had forgotten to buy small presents for their own or other peoples’ children. There was also an eleventh-hour rush at the big stores, which, apart from the fact that the preponderance of women was even greater than usual, seemed to be as busy as in the piping times of peace. Many of the shoppers were buying gifts for the men in the trenches, and the military post yesterday and all through the past week must have dealt with a record number of parcels.  — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 25, 1915
