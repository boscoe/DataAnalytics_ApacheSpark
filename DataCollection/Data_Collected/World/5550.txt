Mohammed Rehman, 25, and his wife, Sana Ahmed Khan, 24, were found guilty at the Old Bailey court. Prosecutors said Mr. Rehman was only a few days away from finishing work on a bomb capable of causing mass casualties when the police moved in on May 28. They say he had been stockpiling chemicals and had detonated a small practice device in his backyard. The authorities said he had used the name Silent Bomber to ask Twitter followers to help him choose a target, writing: “Westfield shopping center or London underground? Any advice would be appreciated greatly.” Advertisement
