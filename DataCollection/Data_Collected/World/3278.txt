NEW YORK — The warlike attitude of the Indians in the North-West has undergone a marvelous change within twenty-four hours, owing to the Government’s prompt measures to prevent an outbreak. Several hundred braves have disappeared from the Standing Rock Agency, and though it is barely possible that they may have galloped across the country to incite the Northern Cheyennes against the whites, it is more likely that they are running away from what they regard as an impending calamity to the aged warriors and women. At the Pine Ridge Agency amicable Indians are apt to get into trouble. American Horse, a noted Sioux chief, and very friendly to the Government, was attacked a few nights ago by a crazy warrior. Referring to this incident General Miles said last night [Nov. 19] that the situation at the Pine Ridge Agency is critical, but he thinks the troops can prevent an outbreak in South Dakota. The Indians will hardly dare to rise, as on all sides the troops surround them. At the agencies along the Missouri River fanaticism has entirely metamorphosed the redskins, and if their religious craze is not checked a wholesale massacre may ensue. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 21, 1890
