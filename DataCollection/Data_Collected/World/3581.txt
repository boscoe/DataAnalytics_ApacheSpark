LEOPOLDVILLE — In a bloodless, almost troopless coup, Gen. Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo today [Nov. 25]. He dismissed President Joseph Kasavubu, named himself head of state for five years and asked Col. Leonard Mulamba to form a broadly based government. The coup was prompted by a political deadlock that had threatened to open a new chapter of violence in the Congo. It also was seen as an attempt to close an opening to the left within the Kasavubu government. The 35-year-old general said his move was not designed to impose a military dictatorship. He said he had acted ‘‘to save the nation, to put a definite end to chaos and anarchy.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 26, 1965
