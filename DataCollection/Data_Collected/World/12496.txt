According to the department, Mr. Qaduli is a senior Islamic State official who originally joined the Qaeda affiliate in Iraq, Mr. Adnani is an official Islamic State spokesman, Mr. Batirashvili is a battlefield commander in northern Syria, and Mr. Harzi is the group’s leader for the region along the Syria-Turkey border.
