A French court on Tuesday ordered a private clinic in Cannes to pay about $450,000 each to two 20-year-old women accidentally switched at birth, part of a $2.1 million settlement with both their families. The mistake occurred in 1994, when Sophie Serrano’s newborn daughter was put into an incubator at the Clinica Jourdan. A nurse’s assistant accidentally handed that baby to the wrong mother, and the baby girl in the adjacent incubator was given to Ms. Serrano. Three years later, Ms. Serrano’s companion left her after rumors spread that he might not have been the father of the unexpectedly olive-skinned girl. In 2004, DNA tests showed that the child, Manon, was the daughter of neither adult. An investigation ultimately found their biological child only 19 miles away. Ms. Serrano, who raised Manon, expressed relief Tuesday that the error had been acknowledged officially. The other family involved has chosen to remain anonymous.A version of this brief appears in print on February 11, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: France: Clinic to Pay in Baby Swap.
