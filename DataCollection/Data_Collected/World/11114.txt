GENEVA — The United Nations human rights chief on Thursday joined in criticism of the Malaysian government’s planned legislation on sedition and the prevention of terrorism, warning that both bills threatened to severely curtail freedom of opinion and expression and breach the country’s international obligations.The government’s move to restore powers of indefinite detention without trial and without safeguards against abuse was among “serious shortcomings” in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, said in a statement.The Malaysian authorities abolished indefinite detention powers in 2012 after years of criticism from human rights bodies, but the new measure allows the police to detain suspects for up to two years, renewable indefinitely, without trial or any form of judicial review.The act passed Malaysia’s lower house of Parliament on Tuesday, a day after the police arrested 17 people for what they said was a plot to carry out terrorist attacks on police stations and army camps.AdvertisementThe government also plans to broaden the scope of its Sedition Act and impose harsher penalties on offenders, moves that would “make a bad law worse,” Mr. al-Hussein said, noting that the move would reverse a commitment to repeal the act that the government made to the United Nations Human Rights Council two years ago during a review of its human rights record.AdvertisementThe new measures were “particularly worrying” because the existing sedition law had been used in many instances to curb freedom of expression in Malaysia, he added, including through “arrests of individuals for merely tweeting their criticism of government policies and judicial decisions.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The individuals investigated had not all faced prosecution, but “it’s a dagger hanging over them; it’s clearly an attempt to intimidate,” said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the United Nations human rights office.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
