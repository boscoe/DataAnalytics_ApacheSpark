The fight near a tent camp between migrants from Afghanistan and others from Eritrea left one with a broken leg. Others suffered superficial wounds, said a police union official, Gilles Debove. Calais is the destination of choice for migrants trying to sneak by truck or ferry across the English Channel. The clash grew out of a dispute that erupted when someone cut in front of other people waiting in a food line. Tensions are high because of tough winter living conditions and slow truck traffic that has diminished the opportunities for migrants to sneak into Britain, said Christian Salomé of the group L’Auberge des Migrants, which distributes meals. Mr. Salomé said that “the least thing can spark differences.” Fifty-one people were injured in similar fights last summer. Advertisement
