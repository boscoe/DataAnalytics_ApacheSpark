Portraying himself to be as tough as his domestic critics, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran criticized nuclear-armed powers on Wednesday, singling out the United States and Israel for what he described as false and hypocritical warnings about Iranian atomic ambitions.In a speech, Mr. Rouhani repeated his government’s claim that it neither covets nuclear weapons nor aspires to have them. That is a central issue in the prolonged international negotiations over Iranian nuclear activities, which Iran asserts are for purely peaceful purposes.“They tell us, ‘We don’t want Iran to make atomic bombs’ — you who have made atomic bombs,” Mr. Rouhani said sarcastically.He also asserted that the nuclear weapons amassed by the United States and, he said, possessed by Israel, have done little to ease their worries about vulnerability to attack.Advertisement“Have you managed to bring about security for yourselves with atomic bombs?,” Mr. Rouhani asked rhetorically in his speech, according to a translation by Agence France-Presse. “Have you managed to create security for the usurper Israel?”AdvertisementIsrael’s government, which considers Iran one of its most worrisome adversaries, has repeatedly accused the Iranians of seeking nuclear weapons. At the same time, Israel has never officially acknowledged that it possesses nuclear weapons, only that it will “not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons in the Middle East.”The Arms Control Association, a research group in Washington, says Israel is believed to have 100 to 200 warheads.
                Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.            Mr. Rouhani’s speech in the central city of Isfahan, widely reported by Iran state news media, was unusually abrasive for him, considering that he was elected in June 2013 partly on his pledge to ease the country’s deep economic isolation and resolve the nuclear dispute.The speech seemed tailored for a domestic audience to demonstrate a different message: that he has no fondness for the United States and that Iran can withstand the sanctions imposed by the West.Mr. Rouhani even took what appeared to be a gratuitous swipe at President Obama’s health care law and its troubled beginnings. Iran’s health insurance coverage, Mr. Rouhani said, covers everyone, while “you, in America, didn’t manage to resolve the health problem.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
