Salvation cannot be paid for, salvation cannot be bought. Jesus is the door and Jesus is free of charge.”Pope Francis called for the Jubilee, or Holy Year, to highlight the need for mercy, he said in an interview this month with the Italian magazine Credere. Typically, they are celebrated every 25 or 50 years and are focused in Rome, but this year bishops will open Holy Doors in local places of worship around the world.“To pass through the Holy Door means to rediscover the infinite mercy of the Father who welcomes everyone and goes out personally to encounter each of them,” the pope said before the opening ceremony last week. “This will be a year in which we grow ever more convinced of God’s mercy.”The pope’s warning against scammers came on the same week that police in Rome said they had seized 3,500 fake Vatican parchments being sold as keepsakes of the Holy Year pilgrimage, The Associated Press reported. The genuine parchments are personalized and sold by the Vatican for $8 to $40 to fund the pope’s charitable efforts, but $76,000 worth of knockoffs were found at a souvenir shop near St. Peter’s Basilica.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
