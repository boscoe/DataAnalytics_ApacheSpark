The special United Nations investigator of human rights abuses in North Korea suggested in an interview published Monday that the ruling Kim family must be replaced before the country’s extensive network of prison camps can be broken up. The investigator, Marzuki Darusman, emphasized in the interview with The Associated Press that he was not advocating force to oust North Korea’s government. But in discussing how to end abuses, most notably in the North’s penal system, he was quoted as saying: “That can only happen if this cult leadership system is completely dismantled. And the only way to do that is if the Kim family is effectively displaced, is effectively removed from the scene, and a new leadership comes into place.” North Korea’s rights abuses were documented in a United Nations report published last year, which the government of Kim Jong-un has denounced as propaganda orchestrated by the United States.  A version of this brief appears in print on February 3, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: North Korea: Investigator Rules Out Reforms by Kim.
