They were arrested in six groups, it said, adding that most of the suspects had ties to the Islamic State extremist group and nearly all were Saudi citizens. One of the 93 suspects is a woman.Saudi Arabia has joined an American-led coalition that is bombing the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, in Iraq and Syria, where the group has seized territory. The Saudis are also leading an Arab coalition carrying out airstrikes in Yemen.For their part, the Islamic State’s leaders have called on their supporters to mount attacks inside Saudi Arabia. There have been a series of mainly small-scale attacks in recent months.Saudi officials said last week that a pair of men accused of killing two policemen had received support from the Islamic State. Saudi Arabia announced on Tuesday that the second of those suspects had been detained.It was unclear why the Saudi authorities revealed the 93 arrests on Tuesday. They did not give the names of any suspects or provide any information about how or when the suspects would be tried.A spokesman for the United States Embassy in Riyadh declined to comment about the assertion that one group among those arrested was planning a car bombing at the embassy. The embassy suspended consular services in Riyadh and at consulates elsewhere in the country on March 15 because of security concerns; the services were resumed a week later, but Americans were urged to take precautions.Another group consisted of 65 people, including two Palestinians and a Yemeni, who had ties to the Islamic State and sought to spread its ideology and set up training sites for new recruits, the ministry statement said.Advertisement
