Col. Steven H. Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said, “We do not know their future intentions,” but added that “it’s fair to say that, yes, this appears to be a de-escalation of some of the tensions.”Earlier this week, the convoy had been on a course toward the Yemeni port of Aden, prompting Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter to call on Iran to avoid “fanning the flames” of the conflict by delivery weapons.The United States Navy diverted the aircraft carrier group led by the Theodore Roosevelt from its usual position in the Arabian Gulf, through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Arabian Sea to join other American forces conducting maritime security operations in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.Defense Department officials said point of the move was twofold: One objective was to reassure Saudi Arabia that the United States was serious in its intent to support gulf allies that have been waging war in Yemen — even though President Obama had no intention of actually using the carrier group to launch American strikes in Yemen. The second was to send a message to Iran that the United States would not allow weapons shipments to Houthi rebels in Yemen — even though that same message could have been delivered with a smaller vessel such as a Naval frigate.Defense Department officials privately made the case that, while deploying an aircraft carrier group may have been more than was required, the move got the point across to Iran.Yemen, the poorest country in the Middle East, is embroiled in a struggle for power that has serious implications for the region and the security of the United States.“There’s very few assets the U.S. military has at its disposal with more deterrent effect than a U.S. aircraft carrier,” one Defense Department official said, speaking on ground rules of anonymity to discuss internal planning.The official said that while the United States was not planning to launch airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen from the carrier, it was “important that the Saudis know that we have an arm around their shoulder.”For a month, Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. The Obama administration has sided with its Arab ally in the fight, but in recent days has sought to persuade Saudi Arabia to ease off its air campaign as civilian casualties mounted and seek political negotiations. The Saudi airstrikes, though, have continued.Defense Department officials said there were no communications between the American and Iranian ships, and they could not say what type of cargo was being transported, although an arms shipment was suspected.It was unclear whether the United States would have tried to board or stop the Iranian convoy if it had continued toward Yemen; such a move would have risked escalating the conflict in Yemen, and could have stymied fragile negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.Also Friday, Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen’s former president and the Houthis’ most important ally in the conflict, issued a statement calling on the Houthis to implement United Nations resolutions that require them to withdraw from territory they have occupied, in return for an end to the “aggression” by the Saudi-led coalition.Mr. Saleh has remained one of Yemen’s most stubbornly resilient and powerful political figures, despite stepping down in 2012 after a domestic uprising against his rule. It was not clear whether his comments on Friday, including a call for warring parties to “stop fighting” and engage in dialogue, amounted to another survival tactic or were a genuine attempt to end the conflict.There was no sign that Mr. Saleh’s own loyalists were standing down or withdrawing, including from the southern port city of Aden. Units close to Mr. Saleh have made up the bulk of the force fighting in Aden against local southern separatist militiamen, and are accused, along with the Houthis, of carrying out a brutal siege of the city.Kareem Fahim contributed reporting from Djibouti, and Mohammed Ali Kalfood from Sana, Yemen.Advertisement
