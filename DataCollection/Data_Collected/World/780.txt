VIENNA —  Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, propelled by the refugee crisis in Europe, came closer than ever to wresting control of Vienna from the Social Democrats who have led the city since 1945. But the Social Democrats held on to the mayor’s office in municipal elections on Sunday and proclaimed the result a triumph of “humanity and decency” over hostility to migrants.The Austrian capital has been such a center-left bastion that it is known as “Red Vienna,” and the balloting on Sunday was widely watched across Europe as a sort of referendum on acceptance of the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have poured into the Continent.The Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann, a Social Democrat, joined Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in early September in throwing open their countries’ borders to thousands who were then trapped in Hungary.“Vienna is the first real test” of that policy, Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof, a columnist for the center-left weekly Profil, said before the first voting projections in the local contests were known.You have 250 characters left.By submitting to us, you are promising that the content is original, doesn’t plagiarize from anyone or infringe a copyright or trademark, doesn’t violate anybody’s rights and isn’t libelous or otherwise unlawful or misleading.

With 97 percent of the ballots counted, the Social Democrats won the mayoralty and the most seats on the city council with 39.5 percent of the vote, compared with 31 percent for the Freedom Party.AdvertisementThe margin between the two parties was greater than most opinion polls had forecast. But the Freedom Party still made its best showing ever in the city, up five percentage points from the last city elections in 2010. Critics said the party campaigned largely on fear of the foreign influx and an uncertain future.AdvertisementHeinz-Christian Strache, a dental technician who has led the party nationally for almost a decade, conceded on national television that he had missed his goal of becoming Vienna’s mayor. But he insisted, “I am honestly happy with the result.”Michael Häupl, 66, who has been mayor 21 years, seemed relieved that his Social Democrats had limited their losses to just under five percentage points. The mood in the party’s tent was buoyant. “Humanity and a social policy of decency won,” Harry Kopietz, a party leader, told jubilant supporters.Populism and nationalism have been rising across Europe, with the notable exception so far of wealthy Germany. But the Freedom Party’s share of the vote was high even by more recent standards. “For a European state, 31 percent is sizable,” said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for the liberal Vienna newspaper Der Standard.
                In recent months European nations have worked to block the main route taken by migrants fleeing war and upheaval.            Mr. Rauscher noted that the mayor’s tactic of confronting Mr. Strache and not yielding to any of his complaints appeared to pay off. “The way you handle this kind of fight is total confrontation,” Mr. Rauscher said. “Appeasement is death.”According to surveys cited by ORF, 80 percent of voters identified refugee issues as their top concern in the election. Most of the hundreds of thousands who have entered Austria since early September have passed through on their way to Germany or other countries to the north and west. But some 80,000 asylum seekers are expected to be sheltered in Austria, a country of 8.7 million, by the end of the year.In Germany, Ms. Merkel has come under increasing pressure, particularly from her own conservative camp, for letting so many refugees in, straining Germany’s resources. Bavaria, the southern German state that most of the newcomers reach first, has threatened to take legal action against Ms. Merkel in the constitutional court, although it is not clear how that could happen.Ms. Merkel stuck on Sunday to her position that Germany could absorb the new arrivals, and she denied that any special tax would be levied to cope with the extra costs.AdvertisementThe mood among Vienna’s far rightists was subdued after the election results showed them making smaller gains than expected.
                German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.            The Freedom Party made strong inroads in Simmering, a working-class area of the city that was once a bastion of the left. A steady stream of voters outside a polling station there reflected the district’s deepening divisions.Eduard and Helene Feldmüller, 56 and 70, voiced outrage that the country was offering help to refugees when, as she said, “there are enough unemployed people in Austria.”“We have a good social network, but big debts,” Ms. Feldmüller said. “Who knows what will come next? More taxes?”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mrs. Salar, dressed all in blue, the Freedom Party’s color, said she voted “so that something gets changed.” Her husband said, “I would like the borders closed.”Both couples echoed themes the Freedom Party emphasized in the campaign, with slogans like “Security for our people, and not open borders for criminals,” and “Help for our poor, instead of help for economic migrants.”On the other side of the political divide, Aida Imara, 45, who was born in Egypt, led her two daughters and son, along with a neighbor’s child, into a polling place. “It’s especially important to vote this year because the Strache party is doubling its vote all the time,” said the oldest daughter, Amina Salem, 18.Kimberly Bradley contributed reporting.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
