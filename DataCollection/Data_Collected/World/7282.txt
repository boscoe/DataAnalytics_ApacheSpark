KARACHI, Pakistan —  An explosion ripped through a Shiite mosque in southern Pakistan during Friday Prayer, killing at least 55 people and wounding at least 59 in an apparent suicide bombing, the police said.The bombing in Shikarpur, about 300 miles north of Karachi, was the country’s worst sectarian attack in months.
