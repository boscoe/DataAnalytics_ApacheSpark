The protesters want the space to be a public park.The images show that protesters carrying a large banner across a road raised it as they passed an officer, glancing against his head and knocking off his cap. Seconds later, he calmly raised his rifle and fired a blast at one of the protesters only steps away.Video of the sudden outburst, which was filmed from at least two angles, generated outrage on Facebook, where it was viewed hundreds of thousands of times.The protest movement later shared an image of the wounded activist’s shoulder, saying that he had been shot at point-blank range with a rubber bullet from the officer’s shotgun.After the protesters regrouped, the crowd chanted for the military police forces charged with maintaining order across the country to be disbanded.“Não acabou! Tem que acabar! Eu quero o fim da polícia militar!” the protesters chanted, as the officer and his colleagues retreated. “It did not end! But it must end! I want the end of the military police!”Edilson Silva, a socialist deputy in the state legislature, hand-delivered a copy of the video to a senior police official on Friday, demanding that action be taken against the officer.Sergio Peçanha contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement
