AdvertisementSupported byBy Rick GladstoneThe United States Treasury said on Friday that it had imposed sanctions on four North Koreans, including the ambassador to Myanmar, over what American officials described as connections to North Korea’s illicit weapons proliferation activities.The action, announced by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, also includes sanctions on a North Korea-owned company based in Egypt that American officials said had helped North Korea market weapons abroad.Under the action, any assets owned by the affected individuals and company that fall within American jurisdiction are frozen. Additionally, all interactions between them and American citizens and entities are prohibited. There was no indication from the announcement that the North Koreans held any assets that could be impounded.The Treasury has taken similar action many times against North Korea, one of the most isolated and unpredictable nations, and a longtime adversary that has periodically threatened to attack the United States with nuclear weapons in the name of self-defense. But the imposition of sanctions on an ambassador is unusual and seemed to reflect higher scrutiny of the country’s diplomats.Western officials say North Korea uses many of its envoys as smugglers and abettors of arms sales prohibited by the United Nations Security Council. A North Korean envoy in Bangladesh was arrested this year and accused of smuggling gold bullion, but released because he had diplomatic immunity.The indirect connection to Myanmar in the sanctions announced on Friday appeared to reflect longstanding American concerns about defense-related links between North Korea and Myanmar’s military-dominated government, which just lost a parliamentary election to the long-repressed opposition. While the United States has eased some sanctions against Myanmar in the past few years as the military has loosened its grip on society, others remain in force.“North Korea’s continued violation of international law and its commitment to the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction pose a serious threat to the United States and to global peace and security,” Adam J. Szubin, the Treasury under secretary who oversees sanctions, said in the announcement on Friday.“Today’s designations underscore our ongoing efforts to obstruct the flow of funds used to augment North Korea’s nuclear capabilities,” Mr. Szubin said.The individuals and company named in the announcement all had ties to the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation, or Komid, a North Korean company already subject to sanctions for what the Treasury calls its leading role as a weapons proliferator.They were identified as Kim Sok Chol, North Korea’s ambassador to Myanmar, who0 the Treasury said had been paid by Komid; Kim Kwang Hyok, a Komid official in Myanmar; Ri Chong Chol, a Komid official in Pyongyang, North Korea; and Hwang Su Man, an official at the North Korea-owned EKO Development and Investment Company, based in Egypt. Mr. Hwang and EKO were accused of helping Komid.North Korea has been trying to improve its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons capabilities despite increasingly onerous sanctions imposed by the United Nations and United States.It has conducted three underground nuclear tests since 2006, the last in 2013. Last month, South Korea’s National Intelligence Service said North Korea appeared to be preparing for a fourth test.Advertisement
