Two former transportation ministers were convicted  Tuesday, found responsible for a 2012 train crash in Buenos Aires that killed 51 people. Juan Pablo Schiavi, who held the post at the time, was given an eight-year sentence, convicted of causing the deaths. Ricardo Jaime, his predecessor, was given a six-year sentence, merged with punishment for a previous charge of receiving bribes while in government. Both were found guilty of fraudulent practices that jeopardized the management of train lines and led to the tragedy, a four-judge panel said. Nineteen others were convicted, including the driver of the train and Sergio Claudio Cirigliano, whose company operated the commuter line. He was given a nine-year sentence for fraudulent practices that resulted in the crash. Victims’ families celebrated the ruling, for which the judges will provide a full explanation in March.A version of this brief appears in print on December 30, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Argentina: Ex-Transportation Ministers Get Prison.
