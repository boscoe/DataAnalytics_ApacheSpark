PARIS — A Paris court today [Oct. 22] fined best-selling novelist Jacques Laurent $1,200 for insulting President Charles de Gaulle. The court ruled that in his book ‘‘Mauriac Sous De Gaulle’’ (‘‘Mauriac Under De Gaulle’’) Mr. Laurent ‘‘attributed dishonourable and disgraceful feelings and motives’’ to the head of state. It ordered that 25 of the book’s 218 pages be deleted. Mr. Laurent, 46, is best known as Cecil Saint Laurent, the pseudonym under which he writes popular historical novels. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 23, 1965
