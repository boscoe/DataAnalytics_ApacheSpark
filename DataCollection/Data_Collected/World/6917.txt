CAIRO —  An Egyptian court ordered a retrial for 37 Muslim Brotherhood members sentenced to death and 115 others sentenced to life in a mass trial last year, judicial officials said on Saturday.The 152 people who will be retried were initially sentenced in March at a trial of more than 500 defendants, some tried in absentia. The proceedings lasted only a few days and were widely criticized by Western governments and human rights groups.They will face a retrial for carrying out attacks during clashes that erupted in the southern province of Minya after the forced dispersal of two Muslim Brotherhood protest camps in Cairo on Aug. 14, 2013, when hundreds were killed.The Brotherhood was protesting the removal of President Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted by the military in the wake of mass demonstrations against his rule.The original trial last year in Minya also ended with 377 people sentenced in absentia. Those sentenced in absentia automatically receive retrials when they turn themselves in, according to Egyptian law.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
