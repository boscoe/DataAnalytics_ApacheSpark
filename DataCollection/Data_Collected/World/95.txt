The blast happened about an hour after a bomb blew up on a passenger bus about 190 miles to the west, wounding at least 18 people in the town of Polomolok, officials said. No group claimed responsibility for either attack. Col. Rolando Joselito Bautista, the military commander in Basilan Province, where the second blast occurred, said Abu Sayyaf militants were suspected in that attack because of their history of bombings in the area. The roadside bomb struck the convoy of Vice Mayor Abdulbaki Ajibon of the city of Isabela, killing her driver, another passenger and two pedestrians, Colonel Bautista said. Ms. Ajibon was uninjured.
