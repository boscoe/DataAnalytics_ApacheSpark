The Airbus A320, operated by Asiana, approached the runway so low that it clipped a 20-foot-tall wireless communication tower that stood almost 1,000 feet before the runway.Two years ago, another Asiana plane, a Boeing 777, crashed at San Francisco International Airport after its tail touched a sea wall as the jet came in too low. The accident, said to have been caused by pilot error, left three people dead and more than 180 injured.Japanese news reports about Tuesday’s accident included photographs that showed damage to the communications tower, which was used to send signals to incoming planes. Part of the tower’s antenna was found stuck in the plane’s landing gear, the reports said.On Wednesday, the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport called in the top managers of all South Korean airline companies to instruct them to bolster airplane maintenance and pilot training. It also told reporters that it would conduct a review of all Airbus A320 pilots for job suitability, especially checking their ability to deal with emergencies.Yeo Hyung-ku, vice minister of transport, said that airline companies needed to consider the mental state of pilots as a potential cause of an accident, in an apparent allusion to the pilot at the controls of the Germanwings jetliner that crashed into the French Alps last month.All 11 Airbus A320 jets in South Korea are operated by Asiana and its affiliate, Air Busan.The Asiana plane involved in the Hiroshima accident was carrying 73 passengers and eight crew members from Incheon International Airport in South Korea.It careered off the tarmac and rotated almost 180 degrees before coming to a halt on the grass beside the runway. All the passengers were evacuated using escape chutes.Advertisement
