The levels of harmful fine particulate matter, called PM2.5, are significantly higher in Delhi during the winter months than they are in Beijing. Over the past two years, average concentrations in Delhi have been about 45 percent higher. 

Beijing has more than 30 government monitors tracking its air quality, although the historical data is not widely available. Delhi has just four, in addition to one at the U.S. embassy. “Delhi doesn’t have nearly enough, said Joshua Apte, an assistant professor at the University Texas at Austin, “and it’s still the best off in the country.”
