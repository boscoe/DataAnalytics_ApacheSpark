Despite cool weather and choppy seas, the influx underscored the burden on European policy makers and administrators caused by the unprecedented number of people fleeing countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. An estimated 210,265 people crossed the sea from Turkey to Greece last month, the United Nations agency reported, while an additional 8,129 people crossed from North Africa to Italy. The October figure was “beyond anything that could have been expected even a few months ago,” a spokesman for the agency, Adrian Edwards, said. More than 600,000 people have now crossed the Mediterranean this year, the refugee agency estimated, compared with about 216,000 people in 2014. Advertisement
