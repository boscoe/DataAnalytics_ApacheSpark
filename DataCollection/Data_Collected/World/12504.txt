If things go “perfectly well,” he said, the company could be offering service by September or October.The other company, Havana Ferry Partners, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said on its Facebook page that it, too, had received a license. The company did not answer calls, but its website says that it plans to offer ferry service using fast, “wave-piercing” vessels that can carry 300 passengers.Reinstating ferry service would take Cubans and Americans a step closer to the kind of back-and-forth travel that once linked Florida and Havana and long made Cuba a favored getaway.In practical terms, it could sharply reduce the cost of the trip and allow Cubans traveling to the island to carry even more goods at much less cost.Charter flights, which are currently the only option for those wishing to travel directly between Cuba and the United States, can run to at least $400 round-trip for the 25-minute flight each way over the Florida Straits.And Cubans traveling to Havana — who routinely carry flat-screen televisions, car tires and bundles of food, clothes and medicines — spend hundreds of dollars on overweight fees.Mr. Hinson said that Baja Ferries would charge about $250 to $300 round-trip, depending on Cuban taxes. The company, he said, hoped to operate three or four times a week, carrying some 2,000 to 3,000 passengers a week (a ferry can carry about 1,000 passengers). Were the ferries to go from Miami to Havana, which has yet to be settled, they would take about 10 hours to cover the 200-odd nautical miles, so as to arrive at sunrise, Mr. Hinson said.Robert L. Muse, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in embargo regulations and handled the license applications for Baja Ferries, said, “This is a more friendly mode of transportation for many Cubans visiting relatives.”OpinionAdvertisement
