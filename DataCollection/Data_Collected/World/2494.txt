LONDON — Delving 192 years back into musty English jurisprudence, an attorney quoted today [Nov. 8] a decision of the Kings Bench division in the reign of William III that a British subject is ‘‘entitled to what he can take from the King’s enemies.’’ The attorney obtained freedom for a member of the Home Guard, who had been charged with the theft of a German pistol, six rounds of ammunition and a flying helmet from a Nazi airman who had bailed out over Chatham, Kent. These articles were alleged to be ‘‘the property of his majesty,’’ but Gerald Thesiger, defending Harry Foulds, member of the Home Guard, cited the judgment of a prize court of 1748. That court had held that a subject was entitled to whatever he could take from the King’s enemies and that such property had never been vested in the crown. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 9, 1940
