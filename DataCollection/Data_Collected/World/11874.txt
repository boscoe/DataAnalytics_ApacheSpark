American Airlines and Delta Air Lines were among the carriers affected by the cloud, and they suspended their flights from the United States into the main airport in Buenos Aires. The Calbuco volcano in southern Chile, which borders Argentina, violently erupted this week for the first time in half a century, spewing ash miles up into the sky and setting off lightning bolts. After Chilean officials evacuated thousands of people from the surrounding area, the ash cloud wrought havoc as it drifted across the Andes, causing airport, road and school closings in Argentina’s provinces, and jeopardizing a gubernatorial election scheduled for Sunday. Calbuco is expected to continue erupting, the head of Chile’s state geology service said Friday.Advertisement
