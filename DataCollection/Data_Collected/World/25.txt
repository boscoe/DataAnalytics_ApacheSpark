The group was aiming to reach Germany and had come from the large, long-established Ain al Hilwe Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon’s south, it said. The boat’s owner was also detained. There was no immediate comment from the Lebanese justice authorities, but it is an offense to enter Tripoli’s port area without a security clearance or a ferry ticket. Advertisement
