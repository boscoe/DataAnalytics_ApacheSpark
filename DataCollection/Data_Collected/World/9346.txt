The body of the woman, Aide Nava, was found in the northern part of Guerrero State, where 43 trainee teachers were abducted last year. A spokesman for the prosecutors said Ms. Nava, a candidate from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, was kidnapped on Tuesday in the town Ahuacuotzingo, where she was running for mayor. The motive for the killing was not clear, although local news media said a message had been left with her body from the Los Rojos drug gang, one of the main criminal groups in Guerrero. Advertisement
