After the vote, Mr. Diallo and another opposition candidate said that their campaigns had been affected by electoral fraud and that they would not recognize the results. On Saturday, Mr. Diallo vowed to organize demonstrations against what he called an “electoral holdup.”Mr. Condé’s supporters credit him with improving the electricity supply in the capital, Conakry, and with keeping the country relatively stable despite an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,500 people in Guinea.The vote was only the second democratic presidential contest since Guinea gained independence from France in 1958.At least three people were killed in election-related violence in the weeks before the election, and many people worry that street protests in the coming days could lead to deadly confrontations with security forces.Mr. Condé defeated Mr. Diallo in a runoff in 2010. At least seven people were killed in election-related violence that year, and about 50 people died before Guinea’s 2013 legislative elections, according to Human Rights Watch.Advertisement
