Another large convoy of British cargo vessels carrying war supplies and food to England was attacked yesterday, presumably by German submarines, about 400 miles west of Ireland. At least eight ships were attacked, six of which were torpedoed. No ships are known to have been actually sunk. The only reports of the attack on the convoy were pieced together from distress signals. For a period of twenty hours, the U-boats apparently picked off merchantmen isolated from the convoy as they tried to make their way around the north of Ireland. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 3, 1940
