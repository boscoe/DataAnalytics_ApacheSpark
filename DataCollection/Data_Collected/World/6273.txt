CAIRO — A Cairo court on Monday acquitted 26 men accused of “debauchery” in a case that was seen as evidence of an intensifying crackdown on gay men by the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi.The men were charged in December after the police raided a Cairo bathhouse, apparently tipped off by an Egyptian television host who filmed the raid. The reasons for the acquittal were not immediately released.Lawyers for the defendants argued that the debauchery charge — used in prosecutions in Egypt, where gay sex is not explicitly illegal — was vague and unconstitutional, according to Islam Khalifa, one of the lawyers.The defendants had also been subjected to forensic anal exams, a practice condemned by human rights groups and ridiculed by medical experts but regularly used in such proceedings.A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Egypt: 26 Cleared in ‘Debauchery’ Case.
