Somali militants sprayed a Kenyan bus with bullets on Monday, killing two people, but a passenger said he and fellow Muslims had defied demands from the attackers to help identify Christian travelers. The attack took place in Mandera, in northeast Kenya. Abdi Mohamud Abdi, a Muslim who was among the passengers, said that more than 10 Shabab militants had boarded the bus and ordered the Muslim passengers to split away from the Christians, but that they had refused. “We even gave some non-Muslims our religious attire to wear in the bus so that they would not be identified easily,” he said. “We stuck together tightly. The militants threatened to shoot us, but we still refused and protected our brothers and sisters. Finally they gave up and left but warned that they would be back,” he said. Julius Otieno, the deputy county commissioner, confirmed the account, saying that the militants “were trying to identify who were Muslims and who were not” and that the Muslim passengers had refused to help.A version of this brief appears in print on December 22, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Kenya: Bus Passengers Defy Militants Seeking to Target Christians in Attack.
