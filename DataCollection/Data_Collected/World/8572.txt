The copyright held by the German state of Bavaria expires at the end of 2015.Simone Paulmichl, a spokeswoman for the institute, said Tuesday that the addition of the critical commentary was expected to more than double the length of the original, which was more than 700 pages, to about 2,000 pages to be published in two volumes. The institute plans to put out the annotated version itself, to prevent it from being published as a commercial endeavor.Last summer, the justice ministers of Germany’s 16 states agreed that the book should not be published in Germany without accompanying commentary.Although they made no specific comment regarding how an annotated version, with comments that are clearly distanced from the premises of the work, would be handled, the institute remains confident that its version will be able to proceed, Ms. Paulmichl said.Although “Mein Kampf” is available online, and printed copies can be purchased at bookstores and flea markets in the neighboring Czech Republic or Hungary, the state of Bavaria has refused to allow its republication in Germany. Critics charge that the prohibition has only increased interest in the book in some quarters.Advertisement
