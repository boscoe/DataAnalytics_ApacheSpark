WASHINGTON —  Ten Senate Democrats who have advocated putting more sanctions on Iran gave the White House a two-month reprieve on Tuesday, saying they would wait until after the late-March deadline for completing the outlines of a deal to restrain Tehran’s nuclear program before voting for a bill that President Obama has said would undermine any chance of reaching an agreement.The concession came in a letter to Mr. Obama from Senator Robert Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who has been increasingly at odds with the White House for his strong advocacy of a bill intended to squeeze Iran’s oil revenues even harder if the nuclear negotiations do not result in an agreement. But Mr. Menendez’s letter made clear that he and the other Democrats would join Senate Republicans if a meaningful accord was not reached by March 24.While Secretary of State John Kerry has expressed optimism that an extension agreed upon in November would lead to a speedy agreement, talks have been largely stalemated since then, and few of Mr. Kerry’s aides now believe that deadline can be met. The ultimate deadline for the talks is the end of June, by which time the two countries are supposed to develop a detailed accord.Mr. Menendez wrote in the letter that he and the other senators “remain deeply skeptical that Iran is committed to making the concessions required to demonstrate to the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful by March 24.” But he said that in deference to Mr. Obama’s fears that any new sanctions would undermine negotiations, “we will only vote for this legislation on the Senate floor if Iran fails to reach agreement on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.”Advertisement“This deadline is the critical test of Iranian intentions,” the senator said.Other senators signing the letter included Charles E. Schumer of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, usually close allies of the president.AdvertisementThe offer to Mr. Obama is double-edged, because it greatly reduces the chances that he can win another extension of the negotiations while keeping many of the current restrictions on Iran’s program in place. Until now, some of Mr. Obama’s current and former advisers on the Iran issue, perhaps the biggest single potential foreign policy breakthrough of his last two years in office, have argued privately that “managed irresolution” of the problem would be preferable to a breakdown in talks that could lead to a military standoff.At least some influential Republicans seemed willing to go along with the delay, sensing that an alliance with Senate Democrats could ultimately give them more leverage over the shape of a final agreement, if there is one. Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the new chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a proponent of new sanctions, said, “The last thing we need to do is pass a bill out of the U.S. Senate that is not veto-proof.”The letter came on the same day as congressional Republicans held two hearings about the usefulness of additional sanctions as they sought ways to hem in Mr. Obama’s team of negotiators. As part of that effort, they also found some unintended allies 6,000 miles away.
                Whether Iran is racing toward nuclear weapon capabilities is one of the most contentious foreign-policy issues challenging the West.            In recent days, conservatives in the Iranian Parliament have said they are working on a resolution of their own to counter American pressure by binding the hands of Iran’s negotiating team and stopping them from agreeing to production limits on nuclear fuel. Like many in Congress, they would be happy to see the current negotiations collapse. In fact, their proposals would require Tehran to deploy centrifuges that can enrich uranium far more efficiently than ever.The result of the competing resolutions in Washington and Tehran is what amounts to an international game of chicken. Each country is taunting the other to become the first to violate the terms of a 2013 pact that established the conditions under which the nuclear talks would take place. It prohibits the West from imposing new sanctions during the talks and bars Iran from improving its enrichment or bomb-making abilities.“Congress is trying to force the administration to adopt a harder line in the negotiations,” said Edward Levine, a former senior staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Iranian hard-liners suspect that Mr. Zarif — a former academic who was educated in the United States — wants a deal a bit too much. Influential Republicans, and a few Democrats, have said the same of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Obama.Some of the experts who testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Tuesday said they did not accept the claim that new sanctions would undercut any chance to strike a deal.Advertisement“These would only come into effect if Iran cheats, or doesn’t make a deal,” one of the witnesses, Eric S. Edelman, the under secretary of defense in the Bush administration, said in an interview. “I’m skeptical of the argument that unless we do something for Iran, it will walk away from the table. My view is that if the supreme leader wants a deal, there will be a deal.”The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has publicly expressed doubts of his own, even as he has given his negotiators room to explore the possibilities.He warned Iranians this month to prepare anew for a “resistance economy.” His comments suggested that he was bracing the public for more economic pain brought about both by sanctions and the rapid drop in oil prices, which has done more to break Iran’s budget than any penalty imposed by the West.The Iranian threat to resume high-level enrichment, which would shorten the time it would take to build a bomb, was clearly intended by military leaders and other hard-liners as a signal to Mr. Zarif. He must come back, they are saying, with a deal that ensures Iran’s ability to hold on to much of its nuclear infrastructure — and thus the capacity to assemble a weapon if its leadership decides it needs one.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: In Reprieve to Obama, Senate Democrats Agree to Wait on Iran Sanctions.
