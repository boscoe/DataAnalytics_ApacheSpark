China will begin tabulating deaths of officials after a spate of suicides last year raised questions about the effects of the country’s continuing anticorruption campaign.The Organization Department of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee, the body that oversees staffing of official positions, called for the new accounting earlier this month, according to Caixin, a Chinese financial news magazine.In recent weeks, several local governments have posted notices describing the order. The tabulation process calls for a listing of any civil servant who died an “unnatural death” from December 2012 to December 2014. The notices define “unnatural death” as suicide, homicide, industrial accident, natural disaster or execution. While the reasoning behind the study has not been publicly stated, the focus appears to be on suicides. Six of the order’s 12 points involve what details should be gathered for suicide cases, including time, place, method and possible reason.
A lack of reliable statistics makes it difficult to determine whether the number of suicides has increased because of the high-pressure corruption crackdown, which has seen tens of thousands of officials investigated over the past two years, or whether the scrutiny that has surrounded the campaign has given greater prominence to the deaths of civil servants.Last year, 68 provincial or ministerial-level officials and 71,000 lower-level officials were punished, Wang Qishan, the Politburo Standing Committee member who heads the Communist Party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said this month.Caixin reported that more than 50 officials had died unnatural deaths since late 2012, the latest being Shao Jianhua, a county party secretary in Anhui Province, whose drowning was announced on Sunday amid reports that he had been accused of corruption.Statistics from Hong Kong researchers indicate that the suicide rate among mid- and top-level officials is about 30 percent higher than the overall rate among urban residents in China.
