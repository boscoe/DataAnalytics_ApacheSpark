The number of refugee children there has doubled in the past year, the report said, and children account for about half of the 1.5 million people made homeless in the Islamist conflict. Some children have been made to fight with armed groups. The number not attending primary school in Nigeria has increased to 10.5 million from eight million in 2007, Unicef said.
