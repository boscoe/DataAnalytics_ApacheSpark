GENEVA — At least 9,115 people have been killed in the 21 months since the outbreak of hostilities in eastern Ukraine in April 2014, United Nations monitors in Ukraine reported on Wednesday, an increase of more than a thousand since the United Nations’ last estimate, in September. An estimated 20,797 have been injured.The casualty estimates are based on new information and do not represent an uptick in fighting, said the monitors, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.The pace of the killing has slowed since a cease-fire in August, the monitors said, with 47 civilians killed and 131 injured in the three months ended in mid-November. They warned, however, that extrajudicial killings and torture persist in regions controlled by separatists, and that the continuing movement of foreign fighters and arms from Russia were keeping the situation “highly flammable.”
                The latest updates to the current visual survey of the continuing dispute, with maps and satellite imagery showing rebel and military movement.            The figures are conservative, said Gianni Magazzeni, a senior United Nations human rights official, adding that the real toll is most likely significantly higher. “There remain a large number of unidentified bodies in morgues,” he said, especially in areas controlled by armed groups.AdvertisementMore than half the casualties in the latest reporting period were attributed to land mines and improvised explosive devices, “underscoring the urgent need for extensive mine clearance and mine awareness actions on both sides” of the contact line separating Ukraine government security forces from rebel groups controlling areas around the eastern towns of Donetsk and Luhansk, the monitors found.AdvertisementHowever, the lack of government control of Ukraine’s eastern border allowed the continuing movement of weapons, ammunition and fighters from Russia, which “carries latent risks of a resurgence of hostilities.,” they reported.
                How Russia aims to achieve its goal of keeping Ukraine isolated from the West.            Armed groups and government security services continued to commit serious abuses, the monitors said, and living conditions remained difficult for some 2.9 million people living in the areas of conflict with limited access to humanitarian aid and medical care.Extrajudicial killings, torture, illegal detention and forced labor continued in areas around Donetsk and Luhansk, the monitors said, reporting that they had no access to the places of detention run by the armed groups controlling them.“These are the places where human rights abuses are most frequently reported and where victims are most vulnerable,” Mr. Magazzeni told reporters here.The United Nations also drew attention to hardships for civilians created by the restrictions on movements imposed by the Ukrainian government, and to the “high degree of impunity” enjoyed by security services, which it accused of abuses including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture.A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Europe; Ukraine: More Than 9,100 People Killed Since Outbreak of Hostilities, U.N.
