The agreement will relax sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on the Iranian nuclear program to ensure it is peaceful.In a statement, the atomic agency, the nuclear-monitoring arm of the United Nations, said that as of Thursday, its requests for materials clarifying “past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program were completed.”Under the timeline for all preparatory steps required to put the nuclear agreement into effect, the atomic agency’s director general, Yukiya Amano, now has until Dec. 15 to provide “the final assessment on the resolution of all past and present outstanding issues,” the statement said.Iran always has asserted that its nuclear work is peaceful. But questions about past Iranian activities, and what atomic agency inspectors had described as Iran’s resistance in resolving them, became an acute obstacle in the negotiations.The main questions concerned suspected experiments at Parchin, a restricted military site outside Tehran, on trigger devices that could be used in nuclear explosions.Under a compromise, reached a day before Iran and the six world powers signed the agreement in July, the agency said that, instead of inspectors, the Iranians themselves could gather sample materials at the site and provide them to the atomic agency, which monitored the collection remotely with surveillance devices.While critics of the agreement in the United States said the compromise gave Iran latitude to cheat, Mr. Amano and his subordinates said it conformed to their standards. The compromise also enabled Iran to assert that no foreigners had been permitted to enter its military bases, mollifying domestic opponents of the deal who said Iranian sovereignty had been subverted.Iran’s Parliament formally endorsed the nuclear agreement this week, and it was then ratified by an oversight panel, the final approval required from the Iranian side.American officials have said it will take six to nine months for Iran to carry out all the steps required before sanctions are lifted. Iran has said it can complete the steps more quickly.Advertisement
