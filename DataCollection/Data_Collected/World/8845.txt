SYDNEY, Australia — Australia on Tuesday expanded its commitment to the international coalition fighting the Islamic State extremist group, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott announcing that an additional 300 troops would be sent to Iraq to train local forces.The Australian contingent will be based at Taji, northwest of Baghdad, and will include training forces and support and protection teams, Mr. Abbott said. In a statement, Mr. Abbott said the deployment had been requested by the Iraqi and American governments and marked the next phase of Australia’s contribution to the coalition to “disrupt, degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL,” using another name for the Islamic State.Australia has already sent special operations forces to Iraq for training purposes and has joined airstrikes against the Islamic State. Between 170 and 200 army personnel are in Iraq, and about 400 members of the air force are stationed in Dubai for the effort, according to the government.The troops whose deployment Mr. Abbott announced Tuesday will apparently work with soldiers from New Zealand, which last week said it would send 106 military personnel to Taji to work alongside Australian forces beginning in May, in addition to 37 support staff members to be deployed to the region.Mr. Abbott said most of the special operations troops who have been training counterterrorism forces would be withdrawn in September, a year after their deployment. “The challenge now is to ensure that the Iraqi regular forces are able to take and hold ground, and that’s what this mission is all about,” Mr. Abbott said.A version of this article appears in print on March 3, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Australia to Send More Troops to Iraq.
