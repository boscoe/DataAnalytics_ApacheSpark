Three United Nations agencies reported Thursday that 3.9 million people in South Sudan, roughly a third of the population, now face “severe food insecurity” because of the mayhem and disruptions caused by that country’s nearly two-year-old civil war. A statement issued jointly by the agencies, Unicef, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization, also said that at least 30,000 people in Unity State, in the north-central part of South Sudan, had fallen into the “catastrophe” phase of food insecurity — the most dire — and are “living in extreme conditions and are facing starvation and death.” Some families, the statement said, are subsisting on one meal a day of fish and water lilies. Despite a number of peace pledges made by the warring sides, fighting has persisted in South Sudan. Serge Tissot, the Food and Agriculture Organization’s representative in South Sudan, said in the statement that “livelihoods have been severely affected by high inflation rates, market disruption, conflict-related displacement and loss of livestock and agricultural production.”A version of this brief appears in print on October 23, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; South Sudan: Thousands Face Starvation, U.N.
