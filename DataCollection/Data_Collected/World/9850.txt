The former official, Habib el-Adly, was the interior minister and oversaw the police force, known for its human rights abuses. The case was linked to his years in power when he was accused of illegally amassing about $25 million. He was also acquitted last year of killing protesters during the 2011 uprising that ousted Mr. Mubarak. Advertisement
