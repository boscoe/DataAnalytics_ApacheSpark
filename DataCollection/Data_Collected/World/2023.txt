Bad weather was cited in the sinking on Wednesday of a large wooden smuggling boat off the Greek island of Lesbos. The death toll in that disaster rose to 16, The A.P. reported, with 274 reported rescued and one migrant missing.Greece, debt-ridden and resource-strained, has found itself an unwanted center of the migration crisis. More than half a million migrants, buffeted by civil war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere, have poured into the country, often via Turkey, in hopes of moving on to wealthier and more welcoming European nations.Although the European Union has promised to provide some financial help, Greece has argued that its creditors should weaken their demands for austerity to offset the country’s efforts to cope with the migration crisis.Nevertheless, some countries, including Hungary, which has also been coping with a migrant influx, have blamed Greece for fanning the crisis by not adequately policing and securing its borders.Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, said that the group was very concerned about the situation and that winter would make conditions for migrants even tougher. He said the Greek government had been helpful in dealing with the crisis given the economic strain.Although Greece has been the primary entry point for migrants, asylum seekers have been trying other routes. On Friday, rescuers in Spain said they had found the bodies of four migrants who had died as they tried to sail to Spain from Morocco, The A.P. reported, and 35 others were missing.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
