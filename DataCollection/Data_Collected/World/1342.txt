MOSCOW —  Russia and the United States signed an agreement on Tuesday that regulates all aircraft and drone flights over Syria, the defense departments of both countries announced.At a Pentagon briefing, Peter Cook, the department’s press secretary, said the agreement, called a memorandum of understanding, established safety protocols requiring the Russians and the United States-led international coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria to maintain professional airmanship at all times, use specific communication frequencies and establish a communication line on the ground.Anatoly I. Antonov, the Russian deputy defense minister, said in a Defense Ministry statement, “The memorandum contains a set of rules and restrictions aimed at preventing incidents between the Russian and U.S. aviation.” He did not go into details, but said it had “important practical significance.”The coalition has been bombing Islamic State positions in Syria since September 2014, so American officials were alarmed when Russia, with little warning, began launching its own airstrikes in Syria on behalf of its ally three weeks ago. Russia made no effort to coordinate the strikes with American air operations in the region, the United States has said.AdvertisementThere have been several close calls. On two occasions, Russian aircraft flew within 1,500 feet and 500 feet of American warplanes, although not in a threatening manner. Such incidents underscore the need for such an agreement, Mr. Cook said.
                A drastic escalation of fighting in Aleppo has shattered a partial truce.            “The Russians need to abide by these flight safety protocols that they’ve now agreed to, because we don’t want miscalculation and misunderstanding,” he said.AdvertisementThe protocols call for aircraft to maintain a “safe distance” from one another, Mr. Cook said, refusing to elaborate on what that distance is but saying coalition aircrews know how close is too close. “There’s no need for them to have an encounter if everyone’s abiding by these rules,” he said.The text of the memo was not released. Mr. Cook said the Russians had requested that it not be shared. He declined to elaborate on the ground communication line, including where exactly it would be located, but described it as a backup resource to “have real-time conversations” in case something went wrong with the air communications.Mr. Antonov suggested that more concrete steps needed to be worked out, including round-the-clock communications channels that would be established between the two relevant military commands and cooperation on issues like joint assistance in “critical situations.”Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, told reporters that an agreement was important because the number of aircraft aloft in recent days had increased noticeably, with as many as 30 combat aircraft sharing the sky over the same area simultaneously.
                What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.            “There are military transport planes, combat aircraft and drones of various size, including attack drones,” General Konashenkov was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency.At the Pentagon, Mr. Cook emphasized that the agreement did not establish the sharing of intelligence or target information and that it did not “constitute U.S. cooperation or support for Russia’s policy or actions in Syria.”Advertisement“We continue to believe that Russia’s strategy in Syria is counterproductive and their support for the Assad regime will only make Syria’s civil war worse,” said Mr. Cook, referring to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Moscow had proposed a number of specific measures to deepen Russian-American military cooperation to counter the threat from international terrorism, the statement said.Speaking to senior law enforcement commanders on Tuesday, President Vladimir V. Putin reiterated that Russia had deployed its military in Syria to prevent the threat from the Islamic State from spreading beyond the Middle East.“By creating a stronghold in Syria and a number of other Middle Eastern states, the terrorists have been making plans to expand their activities and destabilize entire regions,” Mr. Putin said.Karin Roberts contributed reporting from New York.A version of this article appears in print on October 21, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Agrees With Russia on Rules in Syrian Sky.
