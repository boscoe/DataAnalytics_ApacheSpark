PRAGUE — Some 3,000 young people, some of them using ‘‘explosives,’’ tried to break up the midnight mass in the Church of St. James here on Christmas Eve, the Czechoslovak news agency CTK disclosed today [Dec. 28]. It said the crowd ‘‘tried to incite disturbances, penetrate into the church and stop the service. They even used explosives’’ (apparently firecrackers). ‘‘Thanks to the intervention of police, two women were saved from being trampled underfoot,’’ the agency said. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 29, 1965
