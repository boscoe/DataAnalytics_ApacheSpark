The resolution builds on previous Council measures, also legally binding, that make it illegal to donate money to terrorist groups, trade in oil and antiquities or make ransom payments. Those prohibitions are sometimes ignored, and the new resolution, drafted by Russia and the United States, is intended to strengthen it. The resolution calls on countries to describe what steps they are taking to prevent terrorist organizations from making money, including interdicting oil sales. The effects may be limited: The Islamic State group draws a large share of its revenues from “taxes” imposed on the people who live in its territories. Perhaps the most incongruous element of the resolution is that one of its sponsors is the government of Syria.  Advertisement
