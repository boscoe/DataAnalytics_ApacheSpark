A widening gap between rich and poor in cities worldwide has contributed to deepening disparities in urban maternal health and child survival rates, the global charity Save the Children said Monday in an annual report.In two-thirds of the 36 developing countries among the 179 nations surveyed, the poorest urban children are at least twice as likely to die as their wealthier counterparts, according to the report, the charity’s 16th yearly assessment and rankings of the best and worst countries to raise a child.The report also found that the disparities were just as prevalent in big cities of some of the wealthiest nations as they were in poorer nations, and that the ranking of the United States had fallen compared with a year ago.The report “reveals a devastating child survival divide between the haves and have-nots, telling a tale of two cities among urban communities around the world, including the United States,” Carolyn Miles, president and chief executive of Save the Children, said in announcing the findings.AdvertisementWhile country-by-country statistics suggest that children raised in cities of developing nations were surviving at higher rates compared with children in rural areas of those nations, the Save the Children report said the statistics were misleading because they ”mask the fact that a child’s survival in the city too often is dependent on the family’s wealth.”AdvertisementThe greatest disparities are in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, India, Madagascar, Nigeria, Peru, Rwanda and Vietnam, the report said. Urban children from poor families in these countries are three to five times as likely to die as children in relatively affluent families.While the conclusions of the 70-page report were not surprising, they provided a statistical illustration of the basic survival struggles that are confronting impoverished families in urban areas, where more than half the global population now lives.In the United States, the report said, babies born in the lowest-income areas of Washington are more than 10 times as likely to die than babies in the wealthier parts of the city. Washington ranked last for child survival rates among the capital cities of the 25 wealthiest countries.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It is two-thirds of the 36 developing countries surveyed, not two-thirds of all 179 countries surveyed.A version of this article appears in print on May 5, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Grim Divide For Children Is Widening, Study Finds .
