PARIS —  The French authorities said on Friday that they had discovered a third body in the wreckage of an apartment after the police raid that killed Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Belgian militant suspected of planning the Paris terror attacks.Mr. Abaaoud’s cousin Hasna Aitboulahcen, 26, also died in the raid Wednesday on an apartment in the suburb of St.-Denis; her passport was found in a handbag inside. The third person who died in the raid has not yet been identified, said Agnès Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor.Officials on Friday backed away from their initial theory that Ms. Aitboulahcen had detonated a suicide vest during the raid, saying that it was the third person in the apartment who did.
                At least 130 people were killed Nov. 13. They included an architect, an American college student, an Algerian violinist and many, many music fans. Here are some of their stories.            The death toll from the Nov. 13 attacks rose to 130 on Friday. President François Hollande announced that he would preside over a tribute to the victims on Nov. 27 at the Invalides, the former military hospital that houses the tomb of Napoleon, an honor typically bestowed on French soldiers who die overseas.AdvertisementMr. Hollande also received King Mohammed VI of Morocco at the Élysée Palace to thank him for the “efficient assistance” Morocco provided after the attacks. Mr. Abaaoud was a leader of a cell of Belgian militants, mostly of Moroccan descent, who had sworn fidelity to the Islamic State.AdvertisementFrench news organizations have reported that Mr. Abaaoud was recorded on a surveillance video at 10:14 p.m. on Nov. 13 at the Croix de Chavaux station on the No. 9 line of the Métro — near the street where the attackers at four restaurants in the 10th and 11th Arrondissements left a black Seat Léon. If confirmed, the video suggests that Mr. Abaaoud had been not only an organizer of the attacks, but also a participant.
                As many as six of the assailants in the coordinated Islamic State terrorist assault in Paris were Europeans who had traveled to Syria.            On Friday, a lawyer for Mr. Abaaoud’s father, Omar, said he had expressed dismay that his son had not been captured alive, because the family wanted to learn what had happened to a younger son who had been lured to fight for the Islamic State.“He was expecting for the raid to end very badly,” the lawyer, Nathalie Gallant, told reporters in Brussels. Abdelhamid Abaaoud had persuaded his brother Younes, then 13, to join him in Syria.Omar Abaaoud’s “only regret is that they didn’t capture him alive so that they could interrogate him,” Ms. Gallant said. “The father hoped to understand how his son could have gone off the tracks, understand why he took Younes with him, where Younes is, and whether he’s still alive or whether he’s dead.”Moroccan news agencies reported on Friday that another brother, Yassine, who is in jail in Morocco, tipped off Moroccan security services that Abdelhamid was not in Syria — as French intelligence agencies initially believed — but rather in France, leading intelligence agencies to the apartment in St.-Denis.A senior Moroccan diplomat declined to comment on those reports, saying only that the cooperation between the French and Moroccan intelligence and security services was “very strong,” and that officials in both countries were working together on the investigation in “a very serious and efficient way.”One of the many unanswered questions in the investigation is the identity of a suicide bomber who entered Greece on Oct. 3 by presenting himself as a refugee with a Syrian passport — probably fake or stolen — and detonated his vest outside the French soccer stadium in St.-Denis. Compounding the mystery, the French authorities concluded on Friday, based on fingerprint analysis, that a second suicide bomber outside the stadium also entered Greece on Oct. 3. (It was not clear how.) The identities of the men are not known.As the forensic investigation into the St.-Denis raid — a military-style police assault that included drones, robots, assault rifles and grenades — continued, so did a nationwide sweep aimed at preventing another attack.AdvertisementInterior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Friday that the police had conducted 182 new raids overnight, detaining 17 people and seizing 76 weapons. In total, the police have conducted 793 raids over the past five nights, detaining 90 people.The French Parliament took the final steps to extend a state of emergency and expand its scope. The Senate unanimously passed the legislation on Friday evening, a day after the National Assembly, the lower house, overwhelmingly passed it as well.In addition to extending the state of emergency for three months, starting on Nov. 26, the bill will strengthen the powers of a 1955 emergency law to allow the dissolution of radical groups running mosques and other places of prayer; the blocking of websites and social media that glorify or incite terrorism; and the use, in certain cases, of electronic monitoring for those placed under house arrest.In Belgium, the authorities continued their hunt for Salah Abdeslam, 26, who is believed to have fled after the Paris attacks.Two Belgians — Hamza Attou, 21, a Brussels native, and Mohamed Amri, 27, who was born in Morocco — appeared in court in Brussels on Friday on charges of participating in a terrorist activity.Mr. Attou and Mr. Amri, who were detained on Tuesday, are accused of driving Mr. Abdeslam to Brussels after the attacks. Carine Couquelet, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Attou, has said the two men played no role in the assaults. “There are no indications pointing to his culpability,” she said of her client.The two men received a call at about 2 a.m. after the attacks, Ms. Couquelet said this week, then drove across the border and into Paris and “simply went to get Salah, without knowing” what they were getting into.When asked what the three had talked about during the ride home to Brussels, Mr. Amri’s lawyer, Xavier Carrette, said that Mr. Abdeslam “appeared stressed out” but did not mention the attacks.AdvertisementMr. Amri and Mr. Attou were aware that “something had happened in Paris when they went to get Salah Abdeslam but didn’t suspect anything,” Mr. Carrette said.Aurelien Breeden reported from Paris, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from Brussels.
