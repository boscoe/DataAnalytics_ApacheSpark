Gunmen presumed to be Palestinians fired more than 20 bullets at an Israeli car in a drive-by shooting in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, wounding an Israeli couple, according to the Israeli military and news media. The Israelis were identified as Shaul and Rachel Nir. Mr. Nir was a leader of the so-called Jewish Underground that carried out attacks against Palestinians in the 1980s. He was sentenced to life in prison for his role in a gun and grenade attack on the Islamic College in Hebron, in which three Palestinian students were killed, but his sentence was commuted and he was released after about seven years. Earlier on Wednesday, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded two Israelis in the West Bank city of Hebron, the Israeli authorities said. An Israeli security guard fatally shot the assailant at the scene.A version of this brief appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; West Bank: Attackers Wound 4 Israelis.
