During practice for the Chinese Grand Prix, it is downright lunacy.Somehow, a fan managed to climb a fence and sprint across the track at the Shanghai International Circuit in the middle of a practice session on Friday, jumping over the pit wall as a car approached. He reportedly wanted to “try a car” and was detained by members of the security staff when he reached the Ferrari garage, the Press Association reported.The incident has raised safety concerns before the race on Sunday.“That is just the most idiotic thing I have seen in a long, long while,” a Sky Sports television commentator said.
