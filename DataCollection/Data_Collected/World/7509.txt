Whenever movies about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan come up when I’m interviewing veterans, talk inevitably turns to “The Hurt Locker.” Almost everyone who has deployed tells me they found the portrayals of life on an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in Iraq laughably over the top: Since when do bomb techs ride out into the desert solo in full sniper gear? But then they bring up “the cereal scene” — where Staff Sgt. William James returns from war and finds himself shopping for groceries. In the cereal aisle, he stares silently at the hundreds of choices, seemingly disconnected and lost in thought, overwhelmed perhaps by the banality of the abundance surrounding him. Without looking, he throws a cereal box into the cart and walks off. A few scenes later, he is back in Iraq, seemingly more at ease.We published this article today about the push to portray veterans in a more thoughtful, realistic light onscreen. We focused on a retired Army captain, Chris Marvin, the founder of Got Your 6, who is leading the charge. He offered his hits (“American Sniper,” “Lone Survivor,” “The Mindy Project”) and duds (“Brothers,” “Forrest Gump,” “CSI: NY”).If you’re a veteran, tell us in the comments section what other onscreen portrayals of veterans do you think either captured what it is like to be a veteran after 9/11, or made you cringe?
