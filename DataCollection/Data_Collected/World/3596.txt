At a news conference on Tuesday, several cabinet ministers said that only 10,000 would arrive by the original deadline, with the balance coming by the end of February. “We want to bring them in fast, but we also want to do it right,” said John McCallum, the immigration minister. Mr. McCallum said the delay was not caused by security concerns after the recent attacks in Paris. Rather, he said, it related to preparing housing and services for the refugees, who will become permanent residents upon entry. Government officials said the selection process would favor families, women who are at risk and gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender people. Single men will be admitted only if they fall under the sexual orientation categories or if they travel with their parents. About 36 cities have agreed to accept Syrian refugees who are to be flown to Canada by the military, which will also provide temporary accommodations for about 6,000 people at some of its bases.  Advertisement
