The Metropolitan Police in London issued a statement two weeks ago, saying that one of its senior officers had been wrong to describe Nick’s account as “credible and true” before the investigation was concluded.Now the BBC, which has spent much of this year digging into the abuse claims and broadcast its findings on Tuesday night, has raised further questions about the case.The program concluded that at least one of the three murders Nick said he witnessed cannot have happened as described. Two other men identified as victims of the Westminster ring by an activist supporting Nick’s claims told the BBC program, “Panorama,” that they could not corroborate the claims.One of them said he had neither met the activist nor been abused by V.I.P.s, and the other suggested he had been pressured into incriminating particular politicians. A third man, described as a witness in the press, turns out to have a history of bomb hoaxes and falsely confessing to murder and rape.“It looks as though we’re now in a climate where the police are so concerned by their past failures to investigate these sorts of crimes adequately that they’re now overdoing it in the opposite direction,” Ken Macdonald, a former director of prosecutions, told the BBC. “There may be a danger that the police are now spending an undue amount of time investigating cases that have all the hallmarks of being fantasy.”There is of course no shortage of sordid tales that have proved true: Jimmy Savile, the veteran entertainer and BBC star who was friendly with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prince Charles, used his celebrity to gain access to young women and men and children in hospitals, schools, care homes and his television dressing room for as long as four decades. His crimes were covered up and his victims ignored. He died in 2011, one year before the police identified him as a prolific sexual predator.Another prominent case involved a Liberal member of Parliament, Cyril Smith, who reportedly abused boys in a care home in his constituency. He, too, died before an investigation could be concluded.Indeed, the revelation only last year that 1,400 girls, some as young as 11, were raped, mostly by Pakistani men, from 1997 to 2013 in the northern city of Rotherham while the authorities looked away showed that until recently the police here have sometimes done more to undermine victims than to go after their abusers.The BBC investigation suggests that the pendulum might now have swung too far the other way.Last November, one month after first hearing Nick’s account, the Metropolitan Police launched Operation Midland, a triple murder investigation with 35 officers dedicated to it.Nick gave the police a list with a dozen names of those allegedly involved in the pedophile ring. Among them were Edward Heath, a former prime minister; Leon Brittan, a former home secretary; Michael Hanley, a former head of MI5; Maurice Oldfield, a former head of the MI6 secret service, and an army general, Hugh Beach.Nick told the authorities he had been molested at London townhouses, on army bases and at sex parties on Dolphin Square, an apartment block close to Westminster and long favored by members of Parliament.One of the murders Nick said he witnessed supposedly took place in 1979. He said he had been walking down the street in Kingston, West London, with a friend from school when a car ran over his friend and killed him. Nick said he himself was dragged into the car, driven by a member of the V.I.P. gang, and warned not to make friends again.But the BBC investigation found no public record of a murder or accident in the described location at the time. It also tracked down all the boys at Nick’s school at the time with the first name he had provided for his friend. All of them are either alive or died in different circumstances than those described by Nick.The broadcaster also found that Nick had already spoken to the police in 2012, reporting sexual abuse by his stepfather. At the time, he apparently claimed no V.I.P. abuse — although after the Savile revelations he said he had been passed by his stepfather to a pedophile ring that included the entertainer.The police issued a statement on Tuesday night in response to the BBC investigation, expressing concern “that this program and other recent reporting will deter victims and witnesses from coming forward in future.“Seeing an individual make allegations and then be targeted by the media is not going to encourage others to speak out,” the statement continued. “There are still lines of inquiry to pursue which are not in the public domain and we will not reach a judgment until that work is completed.”A number of other recent abuse investigations have been successful: Household names including the singer Rolf Harris, the rock star Gary Glitter, the disc jockey Dave Lee Travis and the publicist Max Clifford have all been convicted.In July, a major independent public inquiry began investigating how all public entities handled claims of child sexual abuse.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
