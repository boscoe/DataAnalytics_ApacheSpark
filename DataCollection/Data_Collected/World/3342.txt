The Italian police arrested six members of Sicily’s Cosa Nostra mafia on Friday as part of an inquiry that uncovered a threat of violence against Interior Minister Angelino Alfano, an official involved with the investigation said. The military police said in a statement that they made the arrests in a dawn raid in Corleone, one of the criminal group’s strongholds, after an investigation that helped them prevent a murder. The statement did not mention Mr. Alfano, but the official said police wiretaps recorded mafia members talking on the telephone about an attack on the Sicily-born minister. “If it’s all agreed, we’ll hit him, right in the head,” one gang member is recorded as saying, the official told Reuters. The grudge against Mr. Alfano appears to stem from his readiness to toughen jail sentences for people convicted of mafia association, the official said. Asked by reporters in Brussels to comment on the matter, Mr. Alfano said, “We’ll talk about that later.” At its most powerful, Cosa Nostra killed several public figures, including a Sicilian politician, Piersanti Mattarella, the brother of Italy’s president.A version of this brief appears in print on November 21, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Italy: 6 Arrested in Plot Against Official.
