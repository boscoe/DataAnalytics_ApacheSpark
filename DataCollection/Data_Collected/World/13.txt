LONDON — Mr. McKenna gratified the House of Commons [Oct. 1] yesterday by withdrawing the proposed taxes on hats. It was shown in the debate that to tax imported hats would be detrimental to many business interests in this country. Mr. Cecil Harmsworth, M.P. for the Luton division, in an illuminating speech, showed how inequitable would be the incidence of the hat tax. Mr. McKenna admitted that there was great difficulty in the way of definition. For this reason, and also on the ground that the impost might harass our Allies, France and Italy, he had decided to abandon the hat tax. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 2, 1915
