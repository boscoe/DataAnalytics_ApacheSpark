TEHRAN — Iran started a 10-day registration period on Thursday for clerical candidates who hope to be elected to a council that can choose the country’s next supreme leader.The elections have taken on a greater sense of urgency because the current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 76, has recently made remarks regarding his health. Though he underwent prostate surgery in 2014, he has shown no signs of being in poor health.Ayatollah Khamenei is the most powerful man in Iran, and according to the Constitution is a representative of God on Earth.The council, known as the Assembly of Experts, consists of 86 Islamic theologians who have the authority to replace the supreme leader when he dies. Hard-liners and reformists are competing to gain a majority on the council. The elections, in which all Iranians 16 and older are allowed to vote, are scheduled for Feb. 26.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
