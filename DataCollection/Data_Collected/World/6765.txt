The authorities have unveiled what they said was a record haul of rare antiquities illegally looted from Italy and discovered during raids on Swiss warehouses belonging to a Sicilian art dealer. The police estimated the value of the 5,361 vases, bronze statues, frescoes and other items at about $58 million. Gen. Mariano Mossa of the Carabinieri, Italy’s paramilitary police force, called it “by a long shot the biggest recovery in history in terms of the quantity and quality of archaeological treasures.” The works, from the eighth century B.C. to the third century A.D., were found during an investigation into the art dealer Gianfranco Becchina, based in Basel. Prosecutors accuse him and his wife of being part of a huge trafficking network that involved tomb raiders in southern Italy, and dealers and buyers worldwide.A version of this brief appears in print on January 22, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Italy: Looted Antiquities Are Recovered.
