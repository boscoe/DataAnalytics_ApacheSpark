LONDON —  The British parliamentary elections are less than 100 days away, and they are a mess — at least five parties in a fragmented system designed for two, and absolute rule by the winner.In 1951, the two main parties, Conservative and Labour, won 97 percent of the vote; current opinion polls suggest that they will be lucky now to win 65 percent.No one expects any party to win an overall majority on May 7. The resulting hung Parliament will mean either a fragile minority government or another European-style coalition. It is not even clear whether David Cameron of the Conservatives, the incumbent, or Ed Miliband of Labour will be the prime minister.So the campaign thus far has been timid, with parties appealing to their core constituencies and trying to beat back their perceived threats in marginal election districts. For the Tories, that threat is the anti-Europe, anti-immigration United Kingdom Independence Party; for Labour, it is the Scottish National Party, which endangers about half of Labour’s 41 Scottish seats.AdvertisementThe campaign has focused mostly on personalities, who will cut the budget better, the dangers of Islamic radicalism, and which candidate loves the National Health Service the most. There has been little discussion of foreign policy, other than caricatures of the European Union; there has been almost no talk of Russia and Ukraine, or of Syria and Iraq.AdvertisementNor has there been much of a debate on the effect of current and future military spending cuts, on modernizing and retaining Britain’s submarine-based nuclear deterrent, and indeed on the country’s shrinking role in world affairs, where Paris — despite its own economic troubles — can seem a more useful and capable strategic partner to Washington than London.Still, underneath the political swordfights are some interesting trends in British attitudes toward defense and foreign policy, which have been laid out in a new study of popular and elite opinion released on Friday by Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs.Despite current trends, the study found that more than 60 percent of respondents from both the public and selected “opinion formers” — people considered influential in fields like politics, business, media, the arts, health education and the law — believe that Britain should remain a “great power,” the highest level since the survey was first conducted in 2010. Nearly 70 percent think Britain has a responsibility to maintain international security, the study found, while nearly 60 percent support providing troops for peacekeeping missions and a clear majority believe that Britain should help lead the global response to climate change.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Almost half support limits on the right of European Union citizens to live and work anywhere within the bloc.Among the opinion formers, however, more than 70 percent favor continued European Union membership. And they are more concerned about promoting British trade than the general public, which prioritizes border protection and counterterrorism.“The public appears to reject ideas of decline and supports an ambitious British foreign policy,” said Thomas Raines, who wrote the report.The Chatham House study was based on an August YouGov poll of a representative sample of 2,059 adults, using an online opt-in panel that does not meet The New York Times’ methodological standards. But the results are indicative, and the poll of 704 opinion formers was not designed, of course, to be random.A version of this article appears in print on February 1, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Public Survey Highlights Britons’ Global Ambitions.
