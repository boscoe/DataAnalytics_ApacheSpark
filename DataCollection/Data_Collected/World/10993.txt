The convoy was attacked as the police units were traveling through the remote western mountains of Jalisco toward Guadalajara. The gunmen are believed to belong to a powerful gang called the New Generation Jalisco Cartel, Jalisco’s security commissioner, Alejandro Solorio Aréchiga, said Tuesday in a radio interview. A man suspected of being one of the gang’s leaders, Heriberto Acevedo Cárdenas, was killed in a shootout with security forces on March 23. Four days earlier, 11 people were killed when a federal police convoy was attacked in Jalisco. Advertisement
