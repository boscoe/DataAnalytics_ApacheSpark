Four men and one woman have lain, nailed to crosses, during the day in Asunción, the capital, for several weeks, and will remain so despite the Work Ministry’s concession. The workers claim they are owed for work years ago on the Itaipu Dam. Carlos Gonzalez, an organizer, said 9,000 workers are owed back pay and benefits. Ignacio Martiez, a political analyst, said crucifixion protests that began a decade ago are successful because Paraguay’s government tends to address whoever “yells the loudest.” At night, they come off the crosses and sleep in tents.
