In the two months since the worldâ€™s attention was focused on the migrant crisis in Europe, by horrifying images of a small Syrian boy whose body washed up on a Turkish beach, many more children and adults have drowned trying to reach the relative safety of Greece.Others who risked everything have been plucked from the water before it was too late, by national coast guards, crowd-sourced volunteers and fishermen.
