Two Turkish police officers were sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison  for their role in the fatal beating of a university student during antigovernment protests in 2013, a case that has become a symbol of police violence. Four other people received lesser sentences in the death of the student, Ali Ismail Korkmaz, 19, who was hit in the head with clubs several times by men in civilian clothing in Eskisehir, a northwestern town. He died more than a month after falling into a coma. On Wednesday the police in Kayseri, a central Anatolian town where the hearing took place, used tear gas to disperse crowds that criticized the terms as too lenient, news reports said. The 2013 protests grew into nationwide riots against the authoritarian tendencies of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, now president, who called the protesters looters and terrorists seeking to overthrow his government.A version of this brief appears in print on January 22, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Turkey: 2 Officers Sentenced in Death.
