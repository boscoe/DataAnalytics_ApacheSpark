ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — At least seven people were killed and 18 were wounded Friday when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives outside a Shiite mosque in Rawalpindi, police officials said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion fell on Sunni extremists, who consider Shiites to be infidels and have repeatedly attacked them across the country.The bombing rattled a congested neighborhood of Rawalpindi, the garrison city adjacent to the capital, Islamabad.Some witnesses told local news media outlets that the bomber tried to force his way inside the mosque but was stopped by a security guard. The bomber then detonated his explosives, damaging the front of the mosque and an adjacent house. At the time of the attack, the neighborhood was nearly pitch black because of a power failure.An investigation was underway, a senior police official, Akhtar Umar Hayat Laleka, said.The wounded were ferried to nearby hospitals as rescue workers navigated through a narrow maze of streets to reach the blast site. Security forces were put on high alert across the city after the blast.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack and reiterated his government’s resolve to “eradicate the menace of extremism and terrorism,” according to a statement from Mr. Sharif’s office.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Pakistan: Blast Kills at Least 7 People Outside a Mosque.
