East Timor’s president has chosen an opposition party member, Rui Maria de Araújo, as the nation’s new prime minister, his office announced Wednesday. Mr. Araújo, a former health minister, replaces Xanana Gusmão, who resigned last week ahead of an expected restructuring of the government. Party officials signaled that the cabinet was expected to be reduced to 34 members from 55 and would become more inclusive, with opposition figures among those appointed. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was occupied by Indonesia in 1975. It voted in a referendum backed by the United Nations in 1999 to end the occupation, which left more than 170,000 dead, and it became a sovereign state in 2002. But the country has struggled to develop economically, and nearly half of its 1.2 million people live in poverty.A version of this brief appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: East Timor: Opposition Figure Is Named Prime Minister.
