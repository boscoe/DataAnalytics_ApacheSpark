BRUSSELS —  European leaders vowed on Thursday to “regain control” of the Continent’s external frontiers at their final summit meeting of 2015, a tumultuous year bracketed by lethal terrorist attacks in Paris and convulsed by destabilizing blows to Europe’s common currency and to its faith in a common destiny without borders.But the meeting, dominated like seven previous gatherings since May by Europe’s migration crisis, offered no new concrete measures to control and slow an often chaotic influx of asylum seekers that has seen more than a million people fleeing war and poverty pour into the Continent this year.Instead, leaders promised only to act on previous decisions, including measures to try to ensure the systematic registration and security checks of asylum seekers and a November promise to give Turkey more than $3.2 billion in return for help on stemming the flow.There was also no sign of a breakthrough to avert what, in coming months, could well be the biggest threat yet to the process of European integration: the prospect that Britain might pull out of the 28-nation European Union.AdvertisementSpeaking late Thursday in Brussels, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, who has pledged to hold a referendum on the country’s membership of the bloc by 2017, said “there is now a pathway to an agreement” that would keep Britain from bolting but added that “it will be very hard work.”AdvertisementDonald Tusk, the president of the European Council, the body that sets the agenda for such summit meetings and is expected to hammer out compromises, described it as a “make-or-break” moment in efforts to keep Britain in the bloc.He said he was “much more optimistic” after discussions over dinner between Mr. Cameron and other leaders, but he made clear that some of London’s demands, notably its desire to curb benefits for Europeans who move to Britain, were unacceptable.“The four horsemen of the apocalypse are circling,” said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London, referring to the security threat raised by a newly assertive Russia, the chaotic influx of asylum seekers, Greece’s calmed but far-from-solved financial crisis and Britain’s future direction.The European Union, Mr. Grant said, has faced periods of severe turbulence in the past without being derailed, notably in 1992, when Britain and Italy pulled out of an arrangement intended to limit currency fluctuations and Danish voters rejected a landmark European treaty in a referendum. “But this year’s is probably worse,” he added.Europe has maintained an unexpected degree of unity in response to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea last year and, after months of bruising negotiation over a bailout, managed in July to prevent Greece from crashing out of the eurozone. But its failure to stem the flow of migrants has not only threatened one of Europe’s proudest achievements, the 26-nation Schengen zone of visa-free travel, but also allowed so-called euroskeptics in Britain to rally public support for an exit from the union.Mr.  Cameron has said he wants Britain to stay in the union but only as long as it gets various concessions, including the right to exclude European migrants to the country from some benefits for up to four years.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said at a news conference that finding a solution for Britain’s demands “will maybe not be all that easy, but I think if each and everyone is of good will we can find a way.” She added that there would be “very important decisions” to make about Britain after a follow-up summit meeting of European Union leaders in February.AdvertisementPresident François Hollande of France told reporters that changes were possible in response to British demands, but only on condition that they “respect European principles, European rules.” He added: “Britain needs the United Kingdom, and the European Union needs the United Kingdom.”How difficult it will be to satisfy both British demands and those of other countries was made clear by a joint statement issued Thursday in Brussels, by the leaders of four Central and Eastern European nations: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. They rebuffed Britain’s principal request, the right to curb benefits, vowing to resist any move that “would be discriminatory or limit free movement” within the European Union.The departure of Britain from the bloc would throw into reverse for the first time the so-called European project, a program of integration that began with six countries with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 and that has since expanded to 28 nations, with several others eager to join.The issue of whether Britain stays or goes, Mr. Grant said, “is the most difficult of all the E.U.’s crises because it ultimately depends on British voters,” over whose decision other countries in the bloc have no control and little influence.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But a new border system is unlikely to take shape any time soon, as it touches on delicate issues like national sovereignty and could get bogged down in arduous procedures involving national governments and the European Parliament. That risks further highlighting the bloc’s seeming inability to respond rapidly to crises.Leaders did not give a green light on Thursday to the Commission’s proposals for a new border and coast guard service, but they did issue a joint final statement on migration saying that governments would “rapidly examine” them and aim to reach a deal by the middle of next year.The border proposals already face opposition in countries like Poland, where some suspect a power grab by Brussels intended to diminish national sovereignty, even as those countries push to save their own workers’ right to move freely in the bloc.Germany has taken the opposite position, arguing that protection of external borders, especially those in Greece, cannot be achieved without some form of control from Brussels.All agree, however, on the need to secure Europe’s often porous outer borders. “For the integrity of Schengen to be safeguarded it is indispensable to regain control over the external borders,” the leaders’ statement said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
