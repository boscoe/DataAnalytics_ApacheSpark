KramerMOSCOW — A Ukrainian court on Tuesday opened preliminary hearings in the trial of two Russian men captured in combat in eastern Ukraine and suspected of serving as active-duty members of the Russian military.For the Ukrainian authorities, the two are living evidence of Moscow’s direct role in the war.Both men, Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Aleksandr Aleksandrov, had confessed to being Russian soldiers while recovering from wounds in Ukrainian captivity. At the hearing, however, both told the court they were unemployed, not soldiers, the local news media reported.Their lawyers have argued, so far unsuccessfully, that they be treated not as criminals but as prisoners of war, eligible under the Geneva Conventions for release after hostilities end. If convicted, they could face life in prison in Ukraine.Russian defense officials have denied that either was a serving member of the military when captured in Ukraine’s Luhansk region. It was unclear whether their assertion that they were unemployed was merely a default stance assumed at the arraignment — akin to their pleas of innocence on weapons charges, though they were armed when captured — or reflected a change in their story.The trial is expected to begin this year.Advertisement
