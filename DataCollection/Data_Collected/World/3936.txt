The government says the group further provoked violence through incendiary festivals where leaders preached to huge crowds that the site — known to Palestinians as Al Aqsa and Jews as the Temple Mount — was in danger and had to be defended.But for many Palestinian citizens of Israel, who form a fifth of the nation’s population, the Northern Branch is also a lifeline and a pillar of their communities. For two decades, the group has provided food, paid power bills, run children’s activities and otherwise supported Arab communities, intertwining social services and its conservative interpretation of Islam with opposition to Israel.In providing social services to propel itself to power, the Islamic Movement in Israel mimics the path taken by the militant group Hamas, which controls Gaza, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Hezbollah, the Shiite militia and political group that offers extensive services throughout Lebanon while also carrying out armed struggle. Egypt has banned the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas and Hezbollah are deemed to be terrorist organizations by the United States and other Western powers.But Arab and Jewish analysts alike questioned the wisdom of outlawing the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement, particularly amid the current wave of violence. They say that the move will only increase the group’s popularity in Arab society, where it may be seen as a victim of an overly zealous Israel, and that forcing it underground will give its most extreme members more leeway for nefarious activity.The ban has given “a green light to young extreme Islamists that the moderate way isn’t working,” said Sami Abu Shhadeh, a longtime Palestinian community activist in Jaffa. Aeyal Gross, a Jewish Israeli lawyer and columnist, wrote in the left-leaning newspaper Haaretz: “Outlawing a political and religious organization is liable to miss the declared target of maintaining security and public order, and instead lead to radicalization and concealment.”Nohad Ali, a lecturer at Haifa University and expert on the Islamic Movement, said one in 10 Arabs in Israel either volunteered or were active with the group. The movement split in 1996 into a Northern and Southern Branch over differences involving whether to participate in Israeli elections. Over time, the Northern Branch became more radical compared with its more moderate southern cousin.Tawfik Mohammed said the shutdown of related organizations would affect 500,000 people.“The institutions were offering services that the Israelis had neglected to do,” Mr. Mohammad said. They include Al Aqsa for Holy Sites, which maintained graveyards and mosques; Naqab for People and the Land, which built homes, installed water pipes and arranged electricity for Bedouins in the southern desert; and Iqra, which provided academic help and scholarships to students.Tens of thousands of Palestinians marched in Israel on Saturday to protest the government’s decision to close charities allied with the outlawed movement. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that such protests would not sway him. “This will not change our decision one millimeter,” he said in a statement.One of the Northern Branch affiliates, the Jaffa Charitable Association, opened 15 years ago in this ancient port city abutting Tel Aviv, where gritty pockets of Palestinian poverty persist among gentrifying apartments overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. When it was closed, the association had three employees and 30 volunteers, supporting 500 local families with a budget of $40,000 a month, according to the association’s directors.Residents of Jaffa said the movement’s activists offered pride and a sense of belonging to troubled youths, even the fairly secular ones. Ahmad Najjar, 23, who drinks, smokes and was recently watching women in tight jeans walking up Jaffa’s main street, praised a local sheikh for visiting him during an eight-month hospital stay and helping him memorize verses from the Quran.“The Islamic Movement likes to help,” he said. “They have love, compassion and respect.”Another Palestinian man, whose liquor business betrays his lack of religiosity, said he gave the Northern Branch $50 a month and he praised its youth activities and volunteer days for tidying up the local graveyard.“They do these things for Jaffa,” he said, refusing to provide his name for fear the Israeli authorities might punish him for his involvement with the group. “Had the state cared or helped, the Islamic Movement would not exist.”But two senior Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the subject, said activities like these gave the Northern Branch opportunities to turn vulnerable young people into radicals. They argued that outlawing the group was similar to European crackdowns on incendiary preachers blamed for inspiring young, often dysfunctional Muslim men to join groups like the Islamic State.“It comes as no surprise that these extremist groups, they deal with the people who are on drugs and such, and the question is, ‘Where are they taking them after that?’” one of the Israeli officials said.Some Jaffa residents also said the group stirred trouble and drove wealthier Jewish customers away from local Arab businesses.For example, the Islamic Movement staged a protest march last month in Jaffa to support the Palestinian uprising, which has involved stabbings, shootings, vehicular attacks and violent demonstrations at Israeli military checkpoints. The Jaffa protest ended with young people hurling rocks and homemade bombs at the police.“People are now afraid to enter the street, because of that demonstration,” a falafel seller in Jaffa shouted angrily.Since the Islamic Movement’s split in 1996, the Northern Branch has been led by Sheikh Raed Salah, 57, who is expected to soon begin an 11-month term in an Israeli prison after being convicted of incitement. The case involves a fiery 2007 sermon in which he told hundreds of worshipers that Israel sought to build a new Jewish temple on the Jerusalem holy site.Immediately after the Islamic branches split, Sheikh Salah began an annual gathering called Al Aqsa Is in Danger, warning that Jews sought to take over the compound, a charge that Israel’s leaders deny.Mohammad Abu Noujeim, who, like Mr. Mohammad, identified himself as a former member of the Northern Branch for fear of arrest, said the organization had created shadow institutions so it could continue operating even if outlawed, something it had long expected.In Jaffa, a long-dormant group called the Islamic Association has no official relationship to the Northern Branch — but at least three identified as loyalists of the movement were elected this month to the association’s board.“I expect that Israel’s actions will create an even stronger association,” Mr. Abu Noujeim said. “The people will support it even more.”Advertisement
