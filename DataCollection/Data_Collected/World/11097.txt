After the hearing began, the officials said, the man, Claudio Giardiello, 57, shot two of his co-defendants, killing one of them, and also killed a lawyer. He then went to the office of a bankruptcy judge and killed him, they said. The officials said they believed that the judge, Fernando Ciampi, had been involved in the bankruptcy case. Another man was shot in the leg. In all, Mr. Giardiello fired 13 shots, they said. “He acted with cold premeditation,” said Tommaso Buonanno, a prosecutor. Mr. Giardiello fled on a scooter but was arrested later in Vimercate, about 19 miles from Milan, where, the police said, he had intended to kill at least one other person. It was unclear how Mr. Giardiello managed to carry a gun into the courthouse. He may have entered through a separate entrance for lawyers and court employees using a false ID, officials said.
