Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said Thursday that Russia and the coalition led by the United States saw “eye to eye” on the targets of their fight against terrorism in Syria.UNITED NATIONS — The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, told a packed room of reporters on Thursday that Russian warplanes had carried out airstrikes in Syria against rebel targets for the second straight day.Asked by reporters from at least three news organizations, including The New York Times, exactly whom the Russians airstrikes were aimed at, Mr. Lavrov was not specific.“If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it’s a terrorist, right?” he said.It was part of an animated exchange with reporters in which Mr. Lavrov defended Moscow’s strategy and reissued longstanding Russian criticism of American policies. Here is a recap of the issues he pressed during the 52-minute session.AdvertisementWhom Exactly Is Russia After?“I would recall, we always were saying we were going to fight ISIL and other terrorist groups,” Mr. Lavrov said, referring to the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.AdvertisementAsked about reports that Russian warplanes had hit United States-backed rebel groups fighting the Syrian government, Mr. Lavrov shot back: “You know something I don’t know?” He added, “We targeted ISIL-associated depots, armaments and sites.”He demurred when he was asked if those “other terrorist groups” in Russia’s sights included rebels supported by the United States and its allies.“I don’t know if the U.S.-led coalition targets only terrorist organizations,” Mr. Lavrov said. “Then, we do the same.”How Far Will Russia Go?Does Russia plan to expand its military operations to Iraq, where the Islamic State also operates?On this, Mr. Lavrov was unequivocal and tart.“No, we are not planning to expand our airstrikes to Iraq,” Mr. Lavrov said. “We were not invited. We were not asked. We are polite people.”His “not invited” comment was a reference to longstanding Russian criticism of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, as well as the Obama administration’s decision a year ago to carry out airstrikes against Islamic State targets inside Syria.
                A drastic escalation of fighting in Aleppo has shattered a partial truce.            Moscow’s position then — and now — is that any military action on a country’s territory should be done with the consent of that country’s legitimate government. In the case of Syria, the Russian government considers President Bashar al-Assad to be the sovereign authority.AdvertisementOn the Side of International LawOn Wednesday, Russia circulated a draft Security Council resolution that echoes that position, calling on countries to carry out military operations against terrorist organizations “and to coordinate their activities with the consent of the States, in the territories of which such activities are conducted,” according to a copy obtained by The Times.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Is Iraq a better place, a safer place?” Mr. Lavrov asked, rhetorically. “Qaddafi murdered — you know in front of viewers. Is Libya a better place? Now we are demonizing Assad. Can we try to draw lessons?”Mr. Lavrov said he was open to political talks, but made it clear that there should be no rush to usher Mr. Assad out. He offered no specifics.Advertisement“We cannot forget about the political process, but we cannot condition fighting ISIL by, you know, changing political systems,” he said. “We believe that, first of all, fighting terrorism must be a priority, but parallel with this — not after but parallel with this — many things could be done on the political front.”Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday suggested that there could be “concrete steps” toward a political solution, even without an agreement on Mr. Assad’s future.What About Ukraine?Asked whether Russia’s military expansion in Syria was designed to deflect international attention from its actions in Ukraine, Mr. Lavrov sounded indignant, calling it an “absurd interpretations of what is going on.”Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
