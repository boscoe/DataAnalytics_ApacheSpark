The list of potential explanations includes a number of possibilities, ranging from a sudden mechanical or structural failure to a more troubling scenario, like a terrorist attack.On Sunday, officials cited the exceptionally wide distribution of debris, over an area of approximately 20 square kilometers, or 7.7 square miles, as a strong indication that Metrojet Flight 9268 did not hit the ground intact.“Disintegration of the fuselage took place in the air, and the fragments are scattered around a large area,” Viktor Sorochenko, director of Russia’s Interstate Aviation Committee, told journalists in Cairo after visiting the crash site.According to people with knowledge of the investigation, the remains of the plane’s tail section, which had been damaged in a 2001 accident, were found several miles away from the front fuselage and cockpit. In addition, the bodies of several victims were discovered a significant distance from the main debris field, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the inquiry.Such a wide distribution of debris is a classic indicator of the plane coming apart while still in the air, according to Alain Bouillard, a former chief investigator for the French Bureau of Investigations and Analyses, or B.E.A. “Such a wide dispersal is very particular after an in-flight rupture.” But in-flight ruptures are also extremely rare for modern commercial jets, experts say.According to the Egyptian aviation authorities, air traffic controllers received no distress call.Mr. Bouillard said wide fluctuations in altitude were highly unusual but difficult to interpret in the absence of further details from the plane’s flight data and cockpit voice recorders. The recorders, often referred to as “black boxes,” were recovered from the crash scene on Saturday, and investigators in Cairo were to begin analyzing their contents on Monday.Other experts raised the possibility of pilot error. While Airbus aircraft are equipped with sophisticated software designed to help keep the plane flying within safe parameters, pilots must still maintain close attention to factors like speed, air temperature and altitude.A plane that was fully loaded with passengers and fuel, ascending too rapidly through the warm desert air, might have risked an aerodynamic stall, some analysts said. Depending on the speed of the descent, the aircraft might have been ripped apart as it tumbled toward the ground.Older aircraft in particular are vulnerable on very rare occasions to structural failure during ascent, as the passenger cabin is pressurized with more air inside than outside. Each time the cabin is pressurized, it is being slightly pushed outward like a balloon, and that puts stress on the fuselage.The most famous recent crash linked to this problem was a China Airlines Boeing 747-200 that broke into several pieces during the last stages of its ascent to 35,000 feet on a flight from Taipei to Hong Kong on May 25, 2002. The same aircraft had struck its tail when the pilot took off too steeply in 1980, causing a crack near the back of the fuselage that was later poorly repaired with a series of rivets. A Taiwan government analysis of aircraft parts retrieved from the seafloor showed that metal in the vicinity of the crack had suffered fatigue and then failed; the government then labeled failure of the rear fuselage as the probable cause of the crash, which killed all 225 people aboard.Analysts also left open the possibility of sabotage or some other deliberate act in Saturday’s crash — a scenario that gained currency just hours after the crash, when a Sinai militant group affiliated with the Islamic State claimed responsibility.While most analysts remain skeptical that Islamic State militants in the area possess missiles with sufficient range to strike aircraft flying at cruising altitudes, experts said they could not rule out the possibility of a more conventional form of terrorism.“Could it be that someone put a bomb in the hold?” said Mark Rosenker, a former chairman of the United States National Transportation Safety Board. “That is just one of the elements that needs to be looked at.” He and others said the Egyptian-led investigation team, which includes experts from France, Germany, Russia and Ireland, should be able to make that determination fairly quickly once the recorders were analyzed.The shock wave of an onboard explosion would normally be captured by the microphones of the cockpit voice recorders, they said, and any explosive residue could be easily recovered from the debris.Mr. Bouillard said the information on the recorders would probably be sufficient to allow investigators to “at least close some doors.”Jad Mouawad contributed reporting from New York, Andrew E.
