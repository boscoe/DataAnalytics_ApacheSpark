But the resolution skirted many of the most sensitive issues, including the future role of President Bashar al-Assad and exactly which elements of the opposition would be at the negotiating table.The council’s action culminated weeks of accelerating consultations among global and regional powers over how to end the conflict, which has raged for five years with an estimated 250,000 deaths and millions more driven from their homes.Secretary of State John Kerry said after the vote on Friday that decisions would have to follow within a month or two concerning the creation of a transitional government in Syria.Advertisement
