The military said Monday that at least 150 people had been killed in clashes with Islamists in the northeastern town of Baga, but the United Nations human rights office said there were “wildly differing” estimates. “While the exact details remain unclear, what appears fairly certain is that mass killings and mass forced displacement have occurred,” said Ravina Shamdasani of the human rights office. “We urge the government to act swiftly to restore law and order while ensuring that security operations are conducted in line with international law and full respect for human rights.” Also Tuesday, Cameroon’s government said that at least 143 Boko Haram fighters had been killed in Cameroon on Monday. It was not possible to immediately verify that report. Maps showing the violent rise of the Islamist militant group that is waging a campaign of terror in Nigeria.Advertisement
