CONAKRY, Guinea —  After a presidential vote that prompted a spate of violence and complaints of fraud, election results were validated in Guinea late Saturday, confirming the incumbent, Alpha Condé, as the winner.The results offer Mr. Condé, who first rose to power after a military junta, a second term of five years and another chance to revive the West African nation’s economy, which has been pummeled by a lingering Ebola outbreak and a drop in metals prices. Guinea is the world’s leading supplier of bauxite, a key ingredient in aluminum.The streets of Conakry, the capital, remained relatively calm after a judicial panel that had reviewed complaints of voting irregularities certified during a televised broadcast that Mr. Condé had won the Oct. 11 race with nearly 58 percent of the vote.Mr. Condé’s campaign dramatically outpaced those of his rivals, some of whom eventually dropped out in protest, with billboards across the countryside of his photo and the slogan “Progress in Motion.”A picture with an earlier version of this article was published in error. It showed Kelefa Sall, president of the Constitutional Court of Guinea, not President Alpha Condé.A version of this article appears in print on November 2, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Leader’s Win in Guinea Vote Is Confirmed.
