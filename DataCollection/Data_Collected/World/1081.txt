The general, Gilbert Diendéré, had already been charged with 10 other counts this month, including attacking national security and murder. The prosecutor, Col. Sita Sangaré, did not say when the new charge was added, but said General Diendéré would ultimately stand trial before a military tribunal. According to the prosecutor, the murder count can lead to a death sentence if the act has been done with “cruelty.” Colonel Sangaré said others charged included General Diendéré’s wife, Fatou Diendéré, a lawmaker from the former ruling party. During the coup, 14 people were killed and 250 injured, according to officials. The country’s transitional government was reinstalled on Sept. 23. Advertisement
