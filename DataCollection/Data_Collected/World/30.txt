Within hours of the first sorties, Russia’s Air Force released aerial views of some strikes, and footage recorded by militants and activists on the ground appeared to show the impact of the bombing.Perhaps the most contested footage was uploaded by the Russian Defense Ministry and showed what officials described as evidence of three strikes “against Islamic State terrorist organization positions in Syria.”However, an analysis of the topography shown in the video by a team of Russian bloggers who honed their craft parsing social media evidence of the war in Ukraine suggested that the strikes had taken place in a part of Syria controlled not by the Islamic State but by rival insurgent groups that oppose both Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, and the Islamic State.The bloggers, who post their findings on a LiveJournal page run by Ruslan Leviev, argued that the bombs had been dropped on the outskirts of Latamneh, a town in Hama Province, far west of Islamic State positions.In an analysis of the Russian footage, David Cenciotti, a former pilot in Italy’s Air Force who runs The Aviationist blog, observed that the footage also appeared to show bombs “missing their target by several meters.”Indeed, video uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday by the Izza Gathering, one of the remaining fragments of the loosely knit Free Syrian Army in Hama Province, appeared to show the Russian strikes had been aimed at its headquarters, located in a bunker built into a hillside outside town.Following reports of Russian strikes on the town of Talbiseh, in Homs Province — another part of Syria not controlled by the Islamic State — activists who have documented the uprising against President Assad for more than four years posted dozens of clips on YouTube showing the chaotic and bloody aftermath. Much of that footage included graphic images of victims of the attack, including badly wounded children, and prayers being said for the dead.Khaled Khoja, the president of the main Syrian exile opposition group, and volunteer rescue workers in Talbiseh known as the White Helmets, said that more than 30 civilians had been killed in the bombardment of areas of the province that the Islamic State had been expelled from last year.Advertisement
