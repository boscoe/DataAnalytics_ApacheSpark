A Norwegian court sentenced an Iraqi-born cleric on Friday to 18 months in jail for praising the killing of cartoonists at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which had lampooned Islam and other religions. The Oslo City Court also found the cleric, Najmaddin Faraj Ahmad, known as Mullah Krekar, guilty of urging others to kill a Kurdish immigrant in Norway in an interview with NRK, a Norwegian broadcaster. “Whoever offends our religion and our honor must understand that this is a conflict about life and death,” Mr. Ahmad told NRK. On Jan. 7, two Islamic extremists attacked the paper in Paris, leaving 12 people dead. Mr. Ahmad was also ordered to pay $8,750 in compensation to Halmat Goran, the Kurdish immigrant.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
