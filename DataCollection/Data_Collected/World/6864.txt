Prime Minister Habib Essid announced a new minority government on Friday that excludes most of the major figures on the political scene, including Islamist and leftist parties. The big winner in last year’s elections was the nationalist Nida Tunis party, but with only 86 of the 217 seats, it had promised to form a broad governing coalition to see the country out of its economic crisis. However, the 24 new ministers presented Friday appeared to come from only two parties that may not have enough seats to survive a no-confidence vote. The cabinet includes 10 ministers from Nida Tunis, including the foreign minister, and three from the Free Patriotic Union Party, which holds 16 seats. Together the two parties will have fewer than half of the seats in Parliament, which means they may have difficulty carrying out the necessary reforms to tackle Tunisia’s titanic economic problems like high inflation and unemployment. Nida Tunis’s main competitor, the moderate Islamist Ennahda Party, holds 69 seats and is not part of the government, nor is the leftist Popular Front, with 15 seats.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
