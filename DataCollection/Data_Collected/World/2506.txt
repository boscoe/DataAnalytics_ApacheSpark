WASHINGTON — It has become an axiom in the Johnson era that if a man wants a high government post, the last thing he does is say so. And a newspaper story saying that an official desires a cabinet job, or is under consideration, is regarded as the surest path to early retirement. Consequently, it raised eyebrows in official Washington today [Nov. 8] when Robert C. Weaver, the highest- ranking Negro in the government, answered ‘‘yes,’’ when asked whether he wanted the cabinet post of secretary of the new Department of Housing and Urban Development. The department, still headless, comes into being at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. President Johnson hasn’t indicated his choice for the new cabinet post, and won’t until early next year, according to a White House announcement over the weekend. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 9, 1965
