CARACAS, Venezuela — Amid a government campaign to blame Venezuela’s capitalist enemies for deep economic problems, the authorities have filed charges against two executives of the country’s largest pharmacy chain, accusing them of seeking to destabilize the economy by allowing a long line to form outside a store.The executives — the president and vice president of operations of the Farmatodo chain — are being held by the intelligence police, the national prosecutor’s office said in a statement released Wednesday.Venezuela is in the throes of an economic crisis, with high inflation and shortages of basic goods, that the leftist president, Nicolás Maduro, says is caused by capitalists conspiring to overthrow him.In recent days the authorities have also said they were seeking to arrest executives of a supermarket chain and announced the arrest of managers of a meat retailer, over accusations that they are hoarding goods.Long lines are common outside many stores in Venezuela, including those operated by the government. Inspectors visiting a Farmatodo store on Saturday in Caracas, the capital, found that not all cash registers were in operation even though there was a long line of people waiting, the prosecutor’s statement said.A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Venezuela: 2 Charged Over a Long Line.
