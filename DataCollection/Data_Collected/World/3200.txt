DUBLIN — Ireland’s first same-sex marriage ceremony was held Tuesday in County Tipperary after the new marriage legislation became official and after a historic referendum on the issue in May.In the ceremony on Tuesday, Cormac Gollogly, a lawyer, married his longtime partner, Richard Dowling, who is a financier. The couple, who are both 35 and live in Dublin, have been together for 12 years. They had a lavish civil partnership ceremony on Sept. 18, which included 128 guests, then a honeymoon in the Maldives.In contrast, Tuesday’s event in the midlands town of Clonmel was decidedly low-key: the early morning marriage was witnessed by two people, and a small family dinner was planned for later.In an interview after the wedding, Mr. Gallogly described the day as “a real whirlwind,” while Mr. Dowling said, “It was nice to be like everyone else.”“When you grow up you don’t want to be part of a civil partnership, you want to be married,” Mr. Dowling said. “Today was about recognizing what we would have wanted to have on Sept. 18.”The ceremony was conducted by a senior county registrar, Mary-Claire Heffernan, who also presided over the couple’s civil partnership. Normally, under Irish law, anyone registering to marry must give three months notice but couples with an existing civil partnership can be married the next day.A version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Europe; Ireland: First Gay Marriage Is Held.
