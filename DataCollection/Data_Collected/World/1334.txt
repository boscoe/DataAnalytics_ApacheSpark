BEIRUT, Lebanon —  Government forces across Syria — including army units, fighters with the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and other loyalist militias — were trying to advance Tuesday on more than half a dozen front lines, with close air support in places from Russian warplanes and helicopters.Syrian Army troops and allied militias inched their way closer to the contested city of Aleppo, as a slowly developing offensive stretched into its fifth day. To the east of the city, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad appeared to be pushing to retake a military airport surrounded by militants with the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.There are indications that the most prominent members of a new pro-government alliance — Russia and Iran — are involved on the ground in Syria. Already, several high-ranking Iranian officers have been killed in the fighting, and on Tuesday pro-government military sources told Reuters that three Russians had been killed by a shell fired from rebel lines.The progress of the offensive has been halting, however, slowed in part by American-made antitank weapons supplied to insurgents by Saudi Arabia.AdvertisementEven so, weeks of military activity by the government and the latest moves near Aleppo illustrated the “dramatic impact” of the Russian intervention so far, said Yezid Sayigh, an expert on Arab armies at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.AdvertisementWith relatively minimal effort, the Russians had managed to “boost regime and army morale,” and send a message to countries allied with the rebels, like the United States, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that they will not be able to intervene militarily in the conflict, as the Turks had hinted they might earlier this summer.“Putin doesn’t need to do more,” Mr. Sayigh said.The government forces have scored some minor victories, reportedly capturing a few villages in the south. But it was still too early to tell whether the advance toward Aleppo was part of a broader attempt to encircle the city and dislodge the rebels or a more limited offensive to ensure the safety of its supply lines.
                A drastic escalation of fighting in Aleppo has shattered a partial truce.            Faraj Shahid, a Turkey-based rebel activist who is from the countryside south of Aleppo, said the area was the site of frequent attacks by insurgents on the government’s critical supply line from Hama in central Syria. Over the last four days, he said, government forces had taken control of at least three villages in the vicinity.Zakaria Malahifji, a leader of a Western-backed rebel coalition, said that the government “chose this front because of its strategic location on the supply route, and its easy geography.” He added, “Airstrikes can be effective because of the flat battlefield, and attack helicopters are present all the time.”Over the last few days, he said, “losses are heavy on both sides and the regime’s advance is very slow,” while tens of thousands of people are reported to have fled the area.In response to the onslaught, rebel commanders have sent out panicked calls to fighters to end their divisions in the face of the latest threat. A rebel operations room in Aleppo issued a statement over the weekend calling on the rebels to put their “differences aside and turn the table on your enemy.”It was not clear whether the exhortations had any effect. Some analysts have suggested that the Russian intervention might have exactly this unifying effect in the divided rebel ranks, welding together groups with competing backers and ideological agendas under the banner of fighting Mr. Assad.AdvertisementThe battle in Aleppo may also help delineate the division of labor among members of the pro-government alliance, according to Mr. Sayigh, who said that the Russians, pursuing a limited role, were working principally with Syrian Army units at the level of battalion or brigade.There was a “high level of coordination” between the two, with the Russians providing close air support, attacking targets in front of army units with fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters.
                What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.            The fight in Aleppo, by contrast, appeared to be coordinated by Iranian officers, working with paramilitary groups like Hezbollah and members of Iraqi Shiite militias operating in Syria. Despite persistent rumors that a large contingent of Iranian troops was fighting in Aleppo, Mr. Sayigh said he had seen no sign of them, either there or anywhere else in Syria.Hashim al-Mousawi, a spokesman for the Harakat Hizbollah al-Nujaba, an Iraqi Shiite militia, said that roughly 1,500 men from the militia were fighting in Syria, including alongside the Syrian Army in Aleppo. He said control of the city was “very important for us,” and would allow the pro-government forces to cut off reinforcements to the Islamic State from Turkey.A radio station in Iraq affiliated with the militia broadcast a message on Tuesday evening encouraging more volunteers to join and fight in Syria.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Iran was supporting his group and other militias with weapons and other supplies, he said.The latest fighting near Aleppo highlighted the failures of various diplomatic efforts to end the war in Syria, which has killed more than 250,000 people.A proposal to freeze the fighting in Aleppo last year, led by the United Nations special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, also faltered: United Nations interlocutors went to the city and found that any initial support for the freeze among rebel groups there was vetoed by the rebels’ foreign donors, according to several diplomats in the region.As one Western diplomat put it, the rebels were “not calling the shots.”The Russian decision to help Mr. Assad consolidate his control in pro-government areas had become the “driving force” for any future political solution, said the Western diplomat, who requested anonymity in line with normal protocols.Before the Russian intervention, the government was increasingly confined to a shrinking, defensible portion of the country. “Now, it will not shrink anymore,” the diplomat added. “The game is over.”Kareem Fahim reported from Beirut, and Anne Barnard from Istanbul. Reporting was contributed by Hwaida Saad and Karam Shoumali from Istanbul; Maher Samaan from Beirut; and Omar Al-Jawoshy from Baghdad.A version of this article appears in print on October 21, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Russians Make an Impact in Syrian Battle for Control of Aleppo.
