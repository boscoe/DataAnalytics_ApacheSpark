The police identified the assailant as Mohammed Salaymeh, 22, from predominantly Arab East Jerusalem. The attack took place at the same intersection where a Palestinian man rammed his car into a crowded train platform in November and then attacked people with an iron bar, killing one person and injuring 13.
