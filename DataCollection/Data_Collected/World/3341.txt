It seemed like a good idea at the time: arm Lithuania’s police officers with AK-47’s routinely as extra security against any militant plots following the Paris attacks. But in just days, the decision had led to the accidental shooting of a homeless man, a hunt for a drug suspect who stole one of the weapons from a police car and went on the lam, and the resignation of the interior minister, who was accused of falling asleep during the search operation. “What happened in Vilnius yesterday was deplorable,” President Dalia Grybauskaite said on Friday. Ms. Grybauskaite’s statement came after a five-hour manhunt in Vilnius, the capital, on Thursday for a handcuffed man who made off with a loaded gun after being left unguarded in a police car. The man avoided hundreds of police officers who combed the city, backed by a helicopter and elite troops. He was arrested after five hours, in his own apartment, hiding in a shower; he had dumped the weapon in another derelict house. “The man escaped by walking,” said Linas Pernavas, the Lithuanian police chief, who made the decision last Saturday to issue the weapons to officers on routine patrol. “And then he boarded public transport — a bus.” In a separate episode on Saturday, a homeless man was accidentally shot in the leg by a Vilnius officer, according to the city police chief. The other main casualty was Interior Minister Saulius Skvernelis, who resigned on Friday after Loreta Grauziniene, the Parliament speaker, said at a news conference that she had called Mr. Skvernelis during the manhunt and he told her he had been sleeping.A version of this brief appears in print on November 21, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Lithuania: Misfires at AK-47’s Debut.
