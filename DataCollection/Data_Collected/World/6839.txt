A spokesman for the prison authority said Thursday that it had yet to receive a notification on the matter from the prosecutors.The two sons, along with a group of Mubarak cronies in business and in the ruling party, came to symbolize the self-dealing and corruption that were hallmarks of their father’s three decades in power.Some in that group were arrested after the January 2011 uprising that drove Hosni Mubarak from office. But most have since been released after prosecutors failed to make the charges against them stick, in what has been widely seen as a repudiation of the 2011 uprising by the country’s current leaders, who took power in a military takeover in July 2013.In November, a court dismissed murder charges against Hosni Mubarak related to the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising. Mr. Mubarak, his two sons and a business associate were also acquitted of corruption charges in that case.Egypt’s current military-led government has jailed thousands of people on charges that are widely seen as political, and the courts have sentenced protesters and others to lengthy prison terms after trials that human rights advocates have dismissed as farcical.On Thursday, the authorities announced that nearly 700 prisoners were being pardoned. It was unclear whether the decree would free any members of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that dominated the government before the 2013 military takeover but was later banned.
