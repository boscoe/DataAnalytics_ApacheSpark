The pro-government forces have surrounded Islamic State militants in the city center and have retaken villages around the city.United States officials have expressed concerns that the new offensive could worsen sectarian tensions, with primarily Shiite militias taking over a Sunni area where militants killed more than 1,000 Shiite soldiers last year.Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.Shiite militias have been accused of revenge killings in Diyala Province, and leading Shiite clerics and others have called on them to avoid abuses and attacks on villages where the Islamic State has taken control.During the current Tikrit offensive, video clips from the town of Albu Ajeel, where many militiamen believe villagers aided in the massacre, showed burning shops and buildings and a uniformed man declaring, “Burn them, burn them.” Few residents appear to have returned. By contrast, in the town of Alam, where the Sunni Jabouri tribe has backed the offensive by sending men to join the militias, there have been scenes of jubilation as residents and militiamen celebrated together.The report on the Amerli attacks did not accuse the militias of killing civilians, but it documented the abductions of 11 civilians and quoted residents as saying more were missing.Witnesses described militiamen removing televisions, clothing and refrigerators, and sometimes stripping houses of electrical wire, before burning the dwellings. Kurdish pesh merga leaders who had allied themselves with the mainly Shiite militias said they had seen 47 villages in which houses had been pillaged and public buildings and mosques destroyed.videoAdvertisement
