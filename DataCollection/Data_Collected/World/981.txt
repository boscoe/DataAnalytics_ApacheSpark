PARIS —  The aid group Doctors Without Borders said on Wednesday that an independent investigation into the American military airstrike that gutted the group’s trauma hospital in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Oct. 3 would begin pending the agreement of the United States and Afghan governments.The group called for the investigation, to be conducted by the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission, after criticizing the shifting accounts of the strike by American officials in the days after the attack. At least 22 people were killed, including 12 of the group’s staff members.“We have received apologies and condolences, but this is not enough. We are still in the dark about why a well-known hospital full of patients and medical staff was repeatedly bombarded for more than an hour,” said Dr. Joanne Liu, the president of Doctors Without Borders, a French-based group also known as Médecins Sans Frontières. “We need to understand what happened and why.”In Kunduz, as fighting ebbed after the withdrawal of Taliban fighters from the city center, images of the hospital showed extensive wreckage. Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that the hospital’s destruction had left tens of thousands of people without access to emergency care after weeks of intense fighting for the city.KunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceA hospitalrun by Doctors Without Borderswas hit inan airstrike.KunduzReportedTaliban presenceAmerican forces conducted airstrikes near Kunduz airport.Hospital hit in airstrike150 metersKunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceA hospital run by Doctors Without Borders was hit in an airstrike.KunduzReportedTaliban presenceAmerican forces also conducted airstrikes near Kunduz airport.Hospital hit in airstrike150 metersKunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceA hospitalrun by DoctorsWithout Borderswas hit inan airstrike.KunduzReportedTaliban presenceAmerican forces also conducted airstrikes near Kunduz airport.Hospital hit in airstrike150 metersKunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceKunduzHospital hit in airstrikeReportedTaliban presenceHospital hit in airstrike Kunduz airport
