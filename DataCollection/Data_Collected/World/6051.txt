Proceedings had been postponed since November. Khieu Samphan, 83, the Khmer Rouge’s head of state in the 1970s, and Nuon Chea, 88, an aide to the group’s leader, Pol Pot, were sentenced to life in prison in August after being found guilty of crimes against humanity. They are now on trial on separate atrocity charges, including genocide against minorities. Advertisement
