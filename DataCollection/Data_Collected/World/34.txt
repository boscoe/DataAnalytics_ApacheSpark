The seven nearly simultaneous blasts took place during the evening rush hours.The sentences were announced Wednesday after a trial that lasted more than seven years. Investigators alleged that most of the defendants were trained by the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba.“I am happy that ultimately the families of victims got justice,” said K.P. Raghuvanshi, former head of the anti-terrorist squad that pursued the case. Defense lawyers said they would appeal the verdict and sentences.Advertisement
