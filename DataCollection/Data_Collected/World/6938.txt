He did not elaborate.The newspaper El Mundo quoted Mr. Díaz as saying that the four detained brothers were of Moroccan origin but held Spanish citizenship. In searches carried out during the arrests, the police found combat gear and knives, he added.Earlier, the Interior Ministry released a short statement saying that the police were investigating whether the four men had been planning an attack in Spain. The authorities in Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish city bordering Morocco, declined to comment.People close to the investigation told the newspaper El País that the investigation started two weeks ago when one of the four posted a video on his Facebook page showing him providing military training and urging others to wage jihad.Advertisement
