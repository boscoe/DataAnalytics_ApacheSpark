MEXICO CITY —  After a flurry of arrests in recent weeks raised questions about its human rights record, Cuba on Thursday released more than two dozen dissidents, some of them believed to be among 53 it had agreed to free last month as the United States and Cuba decided to normalize diplomatic relations.Cuban human rights groups and independent journalists said 26 people had been released, but neither the State Department nor the Cuban government has publicly identified the 53 prisoners that the Cubans had agreed to release, so it was not clear how many of those just released were part of the agreement.A State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said it was “not the first release of individuals on the list,” but she has refused to name them.
                Some trade and travel restrictions will be eased. Others depend on congressional action.            “We made a judgment that the best way to secure the release of these individuals is to not name them publicly,” she said, asserting that doing so would “put a target on their backs” even though they had already been subject to arrest and imprisonment. “We know who’s on the list. The Cuban government has assured us that they’re going to release these individuals. We’re encouraging them to do that rapidly, and we’re confident they’ll do that.”AdvertisementThe new releases follow an episode last week in which Cuba detained a performance artist, Tania Bruguera, three times in connection with her plans to set up an open microphone in Havana’s Revolution Square on Dec. 30 and allow Cubans to speak their minds for a minute. The authorities warned her that she lacked a permit, suggested a different venue and then detained her and, according to dissident groups, more than 50 other people the day of the event.AdvertisementThe State Department condemned those arrests but officials, disinclined to provoke the Cubans with a reconciliation underway, have been more patient while awaiting the release of the 53 dissidents President Raúl Castro committed to on Dec. 17, when the countries announced a prisoner swap and said that they would reopen embassies and exchange ambassadors. President Obama also announced several measures to soften the five-decade economic embargo and encourage more travel and trade with Cuba.
            Highlights from The Times’s coverage of the historic developments in relations between the United States and Cuba.        On Jan. 21, the United States’ top diplomat for the hemisphere, Roberta Jacobson, plans to visit Cuba for regularly scheduled talks on migration accords that will also now include steps toward renewing diplomatic ties and concerns about human rights.Several of the dissidents released on Thursday are members of the Patriotic Union of Cuba. In a country where freedom of expression is limited, many had been detained for shouting antigovernment slogans at rallies or for writings denouncing the government.Figuerola Álvarez, 36, who had been detained since July 2012 for contempt of authority, among other charges, after filming the detention of people during a street festival in Santiago de Cuba, was among those released.“Before the end of the year the authorities had told me I was going to be released at the beginning of January 2015 and this afternoon they freed me without explanation,” he told the Spanish news agency Efe.A version of this article appears in print on January 9, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Cuba: More Than Two Dozen Dissidents Are Released.
