In the genocide, an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu forces in 100 days. The pastor, Jean Uwinkindi, who once led a church on the outskirts of the capital, Kigali, was convicted of crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity committed during the slaughter. Mr. Uwinkindi, 64, was arrested in Uganda in 2010. Advertisement
