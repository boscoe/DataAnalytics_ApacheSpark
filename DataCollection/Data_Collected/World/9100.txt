The 60-page draft also suggested that South Sudan, an oil-producing country, be placed under control of the African Union, Reuters reported.The inquiry, led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, blames Britain, Norway and the United States for creating “a politically unchallenged armed power” by backing a 2005 peace deal that “ushered in an unaccountable political class,” Reuters said.The findings were to be presented to the Peace and Security Council of the African Union on Jan. 29, but the body decided not to release the report because it feared that its publication would disrupt peace negotiations, Reuters quoted African Union diplomats as saying.A civil war has been raging in South Sudan since fighting erupted between forces loyal to Mr. Kiir and rebels allied with Mr. Machar, his former vice president, in December 2013. Tens of thousands are believed to have been killed in the fighting, and about two million have been displaced.Advertisement
