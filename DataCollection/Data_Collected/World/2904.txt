A Cambodian court on Friday ordered the arrest of an opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, in connection with a seven-year-old defamation case, and his party accused Prime Minister Hun Sen of being behind the move to gain the upper hand in their political fight. It is not clear if Mr. Rainsy, a lawmaker, will actually be arrested, since he has parliamentary immunity. He was ordered arrested in connection with a defamation and incitement case brought by Foreign Minister Hor Namhong in 2008. In a speech, Mr. Rainsy had accused Mr. Namhong of colluding with the Khmer Rouge while being held as a prisoner by the group. Mr. Rainsy was convicted and sentenced to two years in jail, but the verdict was never enforced. The timing of the arrest warrant raised questions about a possible political motivation given that Mr. Rainsy has been engaged in a war of words with Mr. Hun Sen.A version of this brief appears in print on November 14, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Cambodia: Court Orders the Arrest of an Opposition Leader in an Old Case.
