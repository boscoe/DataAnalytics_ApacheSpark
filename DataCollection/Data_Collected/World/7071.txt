Faced with a funding shortfall, the World Food Program, the lead United Nations relief agency for fighting hunger, halved rations on Tuesday to nearly 150,000 refugees in Uganda, a majority of them from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The cuts, announced by the agency’s Uganda director, Alice Martin-Daihirou, come as the program struggles to raise $30 million to fund the Uganda operation for the next six months. Ms. Martin-Daihirou called the step “a last resort to ensure we can continue providing lifesaving support” to the 150,000 refugees, nearly half of all refugees receiving the agency’s assistance in Uganda. Their arrival predated the December 2013 outbreak of fighting in South Sudan, which caused a flight of 138,000 South Sudanese to Uganda, who are not affected by the cuts. The agency’s recurrent funding problems have forced it to cut or halt food-aid distribution. Last month, it suspended a voucher program that had helped nearly 1.7 million Syrian refugees, but resumed it after an emergency fund-raising appeal.A report in the World Briefing column on Wednesday about the World Food Program’s cutback of refugee aid in Uganda misidentified the nationality of the refugees who are affected. A majority are from the Democratic Republic of Congo, not from South Sudan.A version of this brief appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Uganda: Agency Cuts Refugees’ Rations.
