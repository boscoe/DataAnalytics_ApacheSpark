BEIJING — Hundreds of Chinese civilians, including jade miners and merchants, are trapped in an area of northeastern Myanmar where that country’s army is fighting ethnic Kachin guerrillas, according to reports on Monday by Chinese state news organizations.The fighting is taking place around Hpakant, an area known for jade mines. The reports said that the area was controlled by the Kachin Independence Army until late 2013, when the land was seized by the Burmese Army, but that the rebels had retaken some of the territory.A report by Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, said about 2,000 civilians, both Chinese and ethnic Kachin, were trapped in the area. It cited an intelligence official with a Kachin rebel group, who also said the civilians had limited food and water. China Central Television posted a message on Twitter saying that “heavy clashes” between government troops and rebels had erupted on Thursday and were continuing.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the office was trying to ascertain the situation in northern Myanmar, also known as Burma.A large part of Kachin State is one of many places along Myanmar’s border held by rebel armies representing independence or pro-autonomy movements among ethnic groups. The Burmese Army has been engaged in long-running conflicts with the various forces. There have been periods of peace, but violence in the state has flared in recent years.Mia Li contributed research.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: China: Civilians Trapped in Myanmar.
