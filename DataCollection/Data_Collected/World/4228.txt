One of the dogs smelled the plants in the Floridsdorf district of Vienna, the capital, on Friday, the police said Saturday. Officers then saw a man taking a hose into the warehouse and searched the premises, finding 734 cannabis plants. In a statement on Saturday, the police said that they also found 32 sacks stuffed with frozen marijuana and a bag full of dried marijuana at the suspectâ€™s apartment. The police said the suspect denied any wrongdoing. A police spokesman, Roman Hahslinger, told the Austria Press Agency that the suspect was from outside Vienna and might not have known that the center for police dogs was nearby. Advertisement
