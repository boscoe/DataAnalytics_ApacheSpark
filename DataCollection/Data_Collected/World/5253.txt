WASHINGTON — The German Embassy confirmed tonight [Dec. 24] reports that word had been received from Berlin that all Nazi planes would be grounded and no bombing attacks would be made on British soil during the Christmas holiday period if the British in turn would suspend their attacks. There were indications that the truce, if agreed upon, would last at least during Christmas Day and the day after, and probably would extend through Jan. 1. The news was received coldly at the British Embassy. One British spokesman expressed surprise that the Germans recognized Christmas at all. ‘‘I thought the Germans had abolished Christmas altogether,’’ he said. No announcement was made at the German Embassy on the proposed truce. When asked on the telephone if it was true that the German high command had given orders not to attack during the Christmas period, the German spokesman at the Embassy replied, ‘‘Yes, that is true. We got confirmation on that from Berlin.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 25, 1940
