McNeil Jr.Scientists convened by the World Health Organization recommended Friday that an oral polio vaccine containing only two vaccine strains instead of the usual three be rolled out next April, as planned. Type 2 virus has not been detected in the wild since 1999, and the vaccine strain against it is responsible for 90 percent of the rare cases in which the live, weakened vaccine strain mutates into a stronger strain that can paralyze. The W.H.O.’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts also recommended that infants as young as 6 months get measles vaccine when the risk of catching it is high; the first shot is usually not given until 9 months.
