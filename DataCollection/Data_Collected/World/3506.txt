KUWAIT — Sheikh Abdullah al-Sabah, 73, ruler of this major oil-producing nation and one of the world’s richest men, died today [Nov. 24] of heart failure. The crown prince, Sheikh Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, was proclaimed the new ruler. Sheikh Abdullah had ruled Kuwait since its independence from Britain in 1961, and had been emir of the oil sheikhdom since 1950. Under his rule, the sandy little country on the east coast of Arabia acquired one of the most advanced social welfare systems in the world, and became a democracy with an elected parliament. He founded Kuwait’s first parliament and cabinet and enrolled the sheikhdom in the United Nations. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 25, 1965
