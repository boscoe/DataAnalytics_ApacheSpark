The popularity of music-halls in London was well illustrated to-day at the meeting of the committee of the County Council, when not less than three-hundred applications were made for licenses for gay establishments of that character. An interesting question was raised in the case of the Empire, not entirely unfamiliar to traveling Americans. This license was opposed by Mr. Charrington, a member of the committee on the triple grounds: 1. That it was the resort of low women and a source of temptation to young men of the better class, students at Oxford and Cambridge. 2. That the women in question were well dressed and sat in the better parts of the theatre. 3. That the dresses worn in the ballets were indecent. Mr. Charrington produced his grocer, who blushingly admitted that he ‘‘had been there.’’ Had he been shocked? Well, no, still he thought, it is a bad place and full of bad women. How did he know they were bad? By the way they used their eyes. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 3, 1890
