LONDON — Video footage showing white fans of the English soccer team Chelsea shoving a black subway rider in Paris has revived concerns about racism in what is often labeled “the beautiful game.”The incident occurred on Tuesday, a day after a former national soccer coach in Italy incited outrage after he complained in an interview at an awards ceremony about too many “colored players” in the youth ranks of Italian teams.Amateur video footage shown on British news websites depicted a group of Chelsea fans pushing a black man and preventing him from boarding a packed subway train at the Richelieu-Drouot station in central Paris on Tuesday. The fans could also be heard chanting, “We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it.”In the footage, another voice could be heard shouting, “Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea.” The episode was said to have occurred before Chelsea played a Champions League game against Paris St.-Germain at the Parc des Princes stadium that ended in a 1-1 draw.AdvertisementThe footage, initially obtained by The Guardian, showed an unidentified black man trying at least twice to board the stationary train but being pushed back by a group of white soccer fans whose faces are shown clearly in the video.A British expatriate who took the amateur footage, Paul Nolan, told the BBC on Wednesday that the episode was “threatening” and “ugly,” and that the people involved seemed “very aggressive.”Advertisement“I think there was a certain amount of pack mentality,” he said.Mr. Nolan told The Guardian that the man who was pushed off the train “was obviously completely shocked when they pushed him off.”“I don’t think he realized who they were,” he continued. “He then tried to get on again and got pushed off a second time.”Mr. Nolan added: “There definitely was a culture shock. I heard a couple of French guys saying: ‘I can’t believe this. It’s insane.’”Chelsea, currently leading the Premier League in England, has sought to shed accusations of racism among its fans dating to the 1970s. In 2012, the Football Association, soccer’s governing body in England, banned the Chelsea captain, John Terry, for four games and fined him the equivalent of $330,000 for racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, a player for an opposing team.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
