Guides to Chinese business etiquette often carry a reminder to never give a timepiece as a gift. The phrase “giving a clock,” or 送鐘, sounds in Mandarin too much like “paying one’s last respects” to the deceased, and the act of it is one of a few taboos based on Chinese pronunciation.That message didn’t reach Susan Kramer, the British minister of state for transport, until after she had given a large pocket watch to the mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je, on Monday during a visit to Taiwan.Dr. Ko said that as a physician — he was the chairman of the traumatology department at National Taiwan University Hospital before winning the mayoral race in November — he didn’t believe such superstitions. (Some argue that a watch isn’t the same as a clock and shouldn’t violate the taboo anyway.)
Still, the mayor, who is known for his blunt and at times impolitic speech, told a reporter after receiving the watch that he might sell it to a scrap metal dealer, a comment criticized by some local politicians as rude. He later apologized for his comment, Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency reported. An aide explained that the mayor had meant this as a joke, and that he had no intention of selling the watch.Baroness Kramer likewise apologized for her gift, which she said was a special timepiece available only to members of the House of Lords.“I’m sorry,” she said in a written statement. “We learn something new each day. I had no idea a gift like this could be seen as anything other than positive: In the U.K. a watch is precious — because nothing is more important than time.”
