A prosecutor, Hilario Ramos, said that the bus was traveling Saturday in the San Pablo District of the Cusco region when it veered off a rural road that was damaged by recent rains and fell more than 100 yards into a ravine. Edwin Licona, the Cusco regional president, said the bus was carrying 67 people, almost double the allowed capacity. Advertisement
