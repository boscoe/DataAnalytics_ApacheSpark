After months of talks, Turkey and the United States on Thursday signed an agreement to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to fight militants from the Islamic State, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said, according to the Anadolu News Agency. Mr. Cavusoglu also suggested that the fighters could join the rebellion against the Syrian government, although American officials have emphasized that the primary goal is to combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. Turkey, along with Jordan and Saudi Arabia, will provide training sites for the program, which is scheduled to begin in March and is expected to train about 15,000 fighters over three years, Turkish and American officials have said. The United States has said that it plans to send about 400 soldiers and other military personnel to train the fighters.A version of this brief appears in print on February 20, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Help in Fight Against ISIS.
