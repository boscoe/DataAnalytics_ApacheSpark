Views of the damage in Coventry, England, after a raid by Nazi planes in 1940. British Pathé.LONDON — Subjected last night to one of the most furious bombing attacks of the war, the industrial city of Coventry, in the heart of the Midlands, presented today [Nov. 15] scenes of ruin never before equaled in England in this ruthless and devastating conflict. From dusk on Thursday until dawn Coventry was battered and blasted by wave after wave of Nazi planes, which, according to German assertions, dropped 1,000,000 pounds of high explosives and 60,000 pounds of incendiary bombs.Homes, business premises, factories, hospitals, churches and streets alike were struck. Although most of the German planes were kept at a great height by an intensive barrage of fire from ground defenses, some of the attackers added to the terror of the night by diving low over the city to release their bombs, while others even machine-gunned buildings and streets. When dawn came and the raiders had left Coventry was unrecognizable. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Nov. 16, 1940
