His People’s Progressive Party, dominated by Indo-Guyanese, has held power for more than 20 years but fell short of a majority in the assembly in 2011 with the rise of a multiethnic third party as a political force. The two main parties have traditionally hewed to racial lines: one drawing support from the descendants of Africans, the other from the descendants of Indians. Advertisement
