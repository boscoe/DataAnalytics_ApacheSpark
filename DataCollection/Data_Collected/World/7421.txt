News of the resignation was welcomed in Israel, where top leaders had called his appointment a farce.They were particularly incensed over Professor Schabas’s declaration a few years ago that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel would be his “favorite” choice as a defendant at the International Criminal Court. Israel’s United Nations ambassador, Ron Prosor, equated the professor’s appointment with “choosing Count Dracula to run a blood bank.”The Israelis filed a formal complaint in January with the president of the Human Rights Council demanding the ouster of Professor Schabas, citing, among other things, consulting work he had done for the Palestine Liberation Organization in 2012. Professor Schabas said the consulting represented “a tiny part” of his body of academic work.The damage to Gaza’s infrastructure from the current conflict is already more severe than the destruction caused by either of the last two Gaza wars.But on Monday, Professor Schabas’s letter of resignation stated, Human Rights Council members decided to ask United Nations lawyers to weigh in. That appears to have spurred the decision to resign.“The Commission of Inquiry is at a decisive stage in its work,” Professor Schabas wrote. “It has largely completed the task of gathering material and listening to victims and other witnesses, including experts. The work on the drafting of the report is beginning. I believe that it is difficult for the work to continue while a procedure is underway to consider whether the chair of the commission should be removed.’Professor Schabas, a professor of international law at Middlesex University in London, added in his letter that while he was not asked to detail his consultancy work when he was appointed, his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had been well known. He said he had pledged to serve “with independence and impartiality.”“This work in defense of human rights appears to have made me a huge target for malicious attacks which, if Israel’s complaint is to be taken at face value, will only intensify in the weeks to come,” he wrote.His decision to resign came against a backdrop of resilient anger in the Israeli government over what it considers prejudicial attitudes at the United Nations over the Israeli military’s conduct during the Gaza conflict, in which Palestinian militants fired thousands of rockets into Israel and the Israelis attacked targets in Gaza with bombs and missiles.Nearly 2,200 Palestinians, including more than 500 children, were killed, according to the United Nations, with 100,000 buildings damaged or destroyed. On the Israeli side, six civilians and 67 soldiers were killed.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement
