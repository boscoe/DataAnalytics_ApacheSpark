Col. Paddy Ankunda, the Ugandan Army spokesman. Mr. Ongwen surrendered Tuesday in Central African Republic, officials in Washington said. Uganda’s foreign affairs permanent secretary, James Mugume, said a Ugandan legal team would consult with the International Criminal Court in The Hague on whether he should be moved there for trial or be tried at home. The court has accused Mr. Ongwen of crimes against humanity and murder, among other crimes. Originating in Uganda in the 1980s as a tribal uprising, the Lord’s Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, is accused of some of the worst postwar atrocities. Advertisement
