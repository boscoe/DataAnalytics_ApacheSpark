A senior army officer said that according to initial reports, about 30 adults and 50 children had been abducted from Mabass and other villages. Soldiers intervened and exchanged fire with the raiders for around two hours, he added. Cameroon’s communications minister, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, confirmed the attack and the kidnappings, but was not able to say how many people had been taken. About 80 homes were destroyed, he said. The attack occurred as Chad began deploying some of its troops to support Cameroon’s forces in the area, Cameroon’s Defense Ministry said Sunday. Advertisement
