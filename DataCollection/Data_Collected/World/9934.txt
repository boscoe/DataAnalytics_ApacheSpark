Ms. Pollán’s daughter, Laura Maria Labrada, announced on Thursday that she would leave the group because of differences with its leader, Berta Soler. She said the Ladies in White could no longer use Ms. Pollán’s name or her house, which had been the group’s headquarters. Ms. Pollán died in 2011. Tensions within the group have sharpened since the Dec. 17 thaw between Cuba and the United States, which Ms. Soler opposes and Ms. Labrada supports. Members this month accused Ms. Soler of being autocratic and called for her to resign, leading to a vote on her leadership, which she won. Advertisement
