In an interview in Naypyidaw, the capital, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, said her party, the National League for Democracy, was “ready to govern” but President Thein Sein was insincere about reform and might try to postpone the election, set for November. She also said American praise for Myanmar’s partly civilian government, which took power in 2011 after nearly 50 years of military rule, had made the government “complacent” about reform. While scathing about what she called Mr. Thein Sein’s “hard-line regime,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi emphasized the need to reconcile with the military, which detained her for 15 years until her release from house arrest in 2010. “We don’t think that boycotting the election is the best choice,” she said. “But we’re not ruling it out altogether.” Advertisement
