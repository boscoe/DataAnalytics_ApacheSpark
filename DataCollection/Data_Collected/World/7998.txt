Criticizing what it called a failure to prevent and punish “enforced disappearances,” which involve kidnappings carried out or permitted by officials, the United Nations Committee on Enforced Disappearances urged Mexico to pass a law specifically establishing that as a crime. There was no immediate response from the government, which presented its report to the committee last week and said passing laws on enforced disappearances was a priority. Mexico acknowledges that more than 23,000 people are considered either “disappeared” or of unknown whereabouts, although it has no specific numbers on forced disappearances. Advertisement
