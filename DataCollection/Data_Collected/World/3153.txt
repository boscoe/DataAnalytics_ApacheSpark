WASHINGTON — Anglo-American co-operation advanced another step tonight when the Navy Department announced that the British authorities had reached an agreement with Washington on the location of the sites to be leased to the United States government for naval and air bases in the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, British Guiana, Bermuda and Newfoundland. No agreement has yet been reached regarding Trinidad, the last of the bases involved in President Roosevelt’s trade of fifty American destroyers for the base sites on eight British possessions in the Western Hemisphere. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 19, 1940
