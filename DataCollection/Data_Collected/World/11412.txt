The Self Air-Defense Force scrambled its jets 943 times during the 12-month period through March 31, just one short of the record set in 1984, the Defense Ministry said. In the latest reporting period, the ministry reported 133 more instances when it sent its aircraft to investigate foreign aircraft compared with the previous year. Japanese forces scrambled 464 times against Chinese aircraft, which were mainly fighter jets approaching disputed East China Sea islands. The ministry said none of the Chinese planes violated Japan’s airspace. Advertisement
