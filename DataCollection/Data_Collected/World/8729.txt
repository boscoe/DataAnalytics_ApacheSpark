HONG KONG — Fifteen people were reported to be missing Friday after a small boat overturned in heavy winds off the Chinese territory of Macau.Macau’s Marine and Water Bureau said the boat was believed to have been transporting illegal migrants when it capsized shortly before 6 a.m. off Hac Sa Beach near the Grand Coloane Resort. Four people swam to shore after the accident, and rescuers continued to search for people still in the water, the authorities said Friday.China’s state-run Xinhua news service reported that 15 people were missing and that the four people who had swum to shore were all from mainland China.The boat was pulled out of the water and towed to shore by salvage vessels as strong wind and high waves hindered the rescue effort, the Macau authorities said.Macau’s economy is highly dependent on migrant workers, who make up 118,000 of the total work force of 405,500, according to statistics for the fourth quarter of 2014. Last year Macau repatriated more than 1,400 illegal immigrants, all of whom were from mainland China.A version of this article appears in print on February 28, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Macau: 15 Missing After Boat Overturns.
