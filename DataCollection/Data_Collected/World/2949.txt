WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court today [Nov. 15] unanimously ruled that Communist party members do not have to register with the government because they might incriminate themselves. The high tribunal declared a requirement that Communist party members register under the 1950 Subversive Activities Control Law, sometimes referred to as the McCarran Act, violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.Today’s decision is expected to have far-reaching effects. Communist leaders have indicated that the party, which has been driven underground by a series of anti-subversive statutes, may now surface. Sen. James O. Eastland, D., Miss., Judiciary Committee chairman, reported his group will seek “to plug the gaps in our security laws,” including perhaps a recommendation for an appropriate constitutional amendment. And the ruling could have an impact on the final determination of a trial here involving charges against the party itself for not registering with the attorney general. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Nov. 16, 1965
