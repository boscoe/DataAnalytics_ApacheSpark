The Cuban performance artist Tania Bruguera was released from custody on Friday after her third arrest this week related to her efforts to push for freedom of expression. Her #YoTambienExijo (I also demand) support group said she returned to her mother’s house after being released from a police station, though the authorities had not returned her passport. They told Ms. Bruguera, who divides her time between Cuba, New York and France, that she could not leave the country while “resistance and public disorder” charges were pending. Several activists among about 50 government opponents detained Tuesday were also released. The crackdown, condemned by the State Department and 1,000 artists who signed a letter on Friday to President Raúl Castro, was the largest since the diplomatic thaw between the United States and Cuba was announced Dec. 17.A version of this brief appears in print on January 3, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Cuba: Performance Artist Is Freed.
