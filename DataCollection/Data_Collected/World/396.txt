BEIRUT, Lebanon — Another landmark structure in Syria’s ancient city of Palmyra has been deliberately destroyed by Islamic State militants, according to local antigovernment activists and Syrian officials. The building involved this time was a set of arches, erected in the second century.Since seizing Palmyra from government forces in May, Islamic State fighters have destroyed some of the most beautiful and historically significant monuments in the sprawling oasis city in Syria’s central desert, one of the world’s most renowned archaeological sites.The latest to fall was the decorative triple arch built by the Romans, which bore ancient inscriptions and stood at the entrance to a grand colonnade.
                As it expanded across Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State destroyed many archaeological sites, looting them for profit and damaging some for propaganda.            Militants of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had already blown up the temples of Baalshamin and Baal, in keeping with their stated belief that such structures are idolatrous. But the arch was not a religious structure.AdvertisementIts destruction was first reported on Sunday by an antigovernment activist who uses the nom de guerre Khaled al-Homsi and who has long monitored the destruction of antiquities in Palmyra by all parties in the multisided war. Mr. Homsi fled Palmyra after the Islamic State takeover, in which his uncle Khalid al-Asaad, a former antiquities official, was killed by the group.AdvertisementResidents of Palmyra have also suffered under intensified bombardment by government warplanes over the past month, some of which did their own damage to the archaeological site, Mr. Homsi and others said.The Palmyra branch of the Local Coordination Committees — antigovernment activist cells set up early in the uprising that now primarily serve to document events around Syria — recently issued an infographic showing the toll from all sides for September alone.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect family members still in Syria.But flight is no guarantee of safety, the person from Palmyra added, corroborating accounts from other residents.Residents may be stopped on the road to government-held territory, they say, under suspicion of ties to the Islamic State or simply because government forces do not want more displaced people from restive Sunni areas moving west to areas like the provinces of Latakia and Tartus, which are already bursting with them.The ruins of the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra are shown in a video from March 2014, before the Islamic State took control.They can flee in the other direction, to Islamic State-held Raqqa, but there they still face the harsh rule of the militant group, as well as airstrikes by the United States-led coalition, the government and now also Russia.AdvertisementSome are going all the way to Turkey, potentially joining the flow of refugees from there to Europe, while others remain displaced in outlying areas around the city.On Monday, Palmyra residents and activists circulated images. One was a vintage photograph of the site with a man in traditional dress in the foreground; with a black stripe across the corner like a funeral ribbon.Another was from 2011, months into the Syrian uprising, when peaceful protests were still common. It shows protesters calling for the ouster of Mr. Assad, with a sign that seems to allude to the city’s role in history: “Here are the free men of Palmyra, renewing and rewriting history once again.”An article on March 29 about an assessment of the damage done by the Islamic State to the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra referred incorrectly to the second-century triple arch ISIS destroyed. The arches were decorative, not triumphal, and therefore were not built by the Romans to celebrate their victory over the Persians. The errors also appeared in another article on March 29, as well as in a picture caption, about efforts to create three-dimensional digital models of Palmyra’s threatened monuments in case the originals are damaged beyond repair, and the errors were repeated last Tuesday in a photo essay and in a caption by a Times photographer who visited Palmyra to document the destruction. The errors also appeared in an article and a picture caption on Oct. 6, 2015, about ISIS’ destruction of the arches.Hwaida Saad and Maher Samaan contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on October 6, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Islamic State Destroys Ancient Arches in Syria.
