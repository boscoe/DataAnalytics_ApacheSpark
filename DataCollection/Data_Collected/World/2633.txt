Its director, Frank Brandstaetter, told the dpa news agency on Monday that the sea lion, who had been a crowd favorite, was found Friday morning by workers. The other six sea lions in the cage were unharmed. The police say an autopsy found the animalâ€™s skull had been smashed and that she was missing three teeth. A hole was found in a fence near the sea lion enclosure, but the police said they did not yet have any suspects in the attack. Advertisement
