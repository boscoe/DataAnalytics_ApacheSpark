Mr. Santos has previously said that he would not order a halt to fighting until a final peace deal was clinched, and he reiterated that view last month when the FARC declared a unilateral cease-fire. On Thursday Óscar Naranjo, a government minister involved in the peace process, clarified Mr. Santos’s remarks, saying that hostilities continued and that no order had been given to halt bombing raids against FARC targets.
