After the Progress 59 freighter blasted off from Kazakhstan, ground teams lost contact with the ship, which NASA said was spinning. If efforts to regain control do not work, the ship will burn up in re-entering Earthâ€™s atmosphere. It would be the second station cargo ship lost in the past six months. The supplies are not critical for the station, which has enough food for more than four months and enough fuel to last more than a year, NASA said. Advertisement
