If you’re reading this on a smartphone or computer, chances are your device was assembled in China — part of the torrent of toys, machines, clothes, electronics and other goods made there for foreign consumers. For scientists trying to understand what is propelling greenhouse gas pollution, that torrent is a puzzle: What role has trade played in driving emissions, especially China’s?A paper published this week in the journal Nature Climate Change builds on research into how much of China’s carbon dioxide pollution is created by making goods for export. The answer is a lot: About a fifth to a third of such emissions from China came from making exports, according to earlier studies. The new paper adds detail to that research and concludes that while it might be cheaper to make things in China, the cost is more pollution than if the goods were made elsewhere.“Many people are inclined to say things like, ‘Well, stuff has to get made somewhere and China can do it cheaper,’” Steven J. Davis, an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, who is one of the paper’s authors, said in an email. “In reply to that logic, we’re showing that China’s role as the world’s manufacturer means much higher emissions than if the ‘stuff’ were made just about anywhere else.”China’s exports account for a large amount of greenhouse gases not just because the country happens to make so much for foreign markets, but also because so many of those exports have been made by using relatively dirty processes and by burning so much coal, the researchers say.“The CO2 emissions related to China’s exports are large not just because they export a lot of stuff or because they specialize in energy-demanding industries, but because their manufacturing technologies are less advanced and they rely primarily on coal for energy,” Klaus Hubacek, a professor at the University of Maryland, said in a summary accompanying the paper.The findings will feed into a debate among experts and policy makers about the link between trade and emissions – especially from China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gas, and also its biggest exporter.If making, say, a light bulb resulted in the same greenhouse gas emissions no matter where it was made, then what are called “trade-embodied emissions” would not matter so much. But if making that light bulb in China or any other economy results in relatively more or less pollution, then that has implications for trying to cut those emissions.The authors say China’s exports entail significantly more emissions than if the same goods were made in Europe. Making a range of products like steel, aluminum and propylene in China results in an average of 4.4 times more carbon dioxide emissions than if the same products were made in the European Union, they say.“Until the vast difference between the emissions intensity of Chinese exports and domestic production in developed countries is reduced, international trade with China will conflict with efforts to reduce global CO2 emissions,” the authors say.The role of trade in greenhouse gas pollution has prompted calls for tariffs or other border measures that would impose an extra cost on goods from places deemed to be not doing enough to cut pollution. But economists have argued that trying to redirect trade flows like this would have complicated knock-on effects across markets that in the end might not cut emissions.Instead, the authors of the latest paper say, they hope that identifying regions and industries in China that have the worst record in carbon dioxide pollution can help focus policies where they are most needed, including plans for a national market for companies to buy and sell emissions quotas.“Over all, the hope is that the policy will encourage less reliance on coal,” Professor Davis said, “but we’ve identified the ‘low hanging fruit’ where updating technologies could also make a large difference.”China’s broader economic transformation could also help reduce the proportion of emissions generated by exports. The researchers used data from 2007, because there were no later sources for the fine-grained, provincial-level statistical tables they needed for their analysis, Professor Davis said.“The sectoral mix and partners of global trade don’t seem to have changed much up to 2012, with the exception of a big dip in trade volumes due to the global recession,” he said. “Technologies and production structure within China have probably changed, and we are looking forward to the new tables to see how.”
