LONDON — The ‘‘bombores’’ — those persons who pour into one’s ears their real or imagined experience with a high-explosive that has obeyed the law of gravity — are to have sympathetic female audiences. The Marchioness of Reading, chairman of the Women’s Voluntary Service, which has 50,000 or more members, announced today [Dec. 11] at Preston, Lancashire, that W. V. S. would provide ‘‘listeners’’ for bombed-out persons who wanted to talk about it. And up at Birmingham those with hard-luck stories to retell are reported to have formed a ‘‘Birmingham District Bombees Association.’’ ‘‘We must realize,’’ said Lady Reading, ‘‘that people who have come from a bombed area are in a highly nervous state and that one of the things that helps them is to be allowed to talk about it.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 12, 1940
