Nazarbayev, 74, won his fifth successive term in a snap presidential election in which voters headed to the polls in droves on Sunday. In a televised news conference, election officials said on Monday that Mr. Nazarbayev had taken a whopping 97.7 percent of the vote.The Central Election Commission of Kazakhstan said that turnout was higher than 95 percent, meaning that nearly 93 of every 100 voting-age Kazakh citizens had headed to the polls and cast a ballot for Mr. Nazarbayev.Mr. Nazarbayev’s two opponents, who support the current government and were seen as playing a perfunctory role in the elections, won a combined 2.3 percent.Mr. Nazarbayev took a victory lap on Monday morning and dared the West to criticize his victory.“I apologize if these numbers are unacceptable for the superdemocratic countries, but there was nothing I could do,” Mr. Nazarbayev said at a televised news conference in Astana, the capital. “If I had interfered, it would have been undemocratic.”The chairman of the elections commission called the vote a landmark “expression of civil society, electoral activeness and political responsibility.”The election, which was called in February, was seen as a move by Mr. Nazarbayev to win a vote of confidence as Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s largest country, faces both a daunting economic slowdown driven by the collapse in oil prices and regional instability because of the crisis in Ukraine.Advertisement
