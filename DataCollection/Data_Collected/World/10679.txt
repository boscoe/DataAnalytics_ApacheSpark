Two police officers suffered minor injuries during the clash.The semiofficial Anadolu Agency, citing investigators, reported that the woman belonged to the same group behind the courthouse attack: the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front, a Marxist group with origins in Turkey’s political violence of the 1970s.Earlier in the day, a special police unit arrested a gunman who stormed into an Istanbul office of the governing Justice and Development Party and hung a Turkish flag with a sword added from the top floor.At the time of that episode, a large crowd had gathered for the funeral of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the prosecutor who was killed Tuesday. Mr. Kiraz had been in charge of investigating the death of Berkin Elvan, a teenage boy killed during antigovernment protests in 2013.A website affiliated with the Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front took responsibility for that attack and said it was motivated by the Berkin Elvan case. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Wednesday vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice and warned about provocations before June’s parliamentary elections.“We are aware that we face an axis of evil,” Mr. Davutoglu said. “We are aware that there is an attempt to pull Turkey into an atmosphere of chaos ahead of the election.”Advertisement
