Officials are investigating what might have caused an explosion that brought down the plane.“The backlog of passengers waiting to return to the U.K. is expected to have been cleared by the end of the weekend,” the government said in a statement.Russia has suspended all flights to Egypt, the most popular foreign tourist destination for Russians, until the cause of the crash is determined.Although Egypt has played down the likelihood that the crash was caused by terrorism, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said it was “more likely than not a terrorist bomb” brought down the plane, and President Obama said it was “a possibility.”The effects of the crash on demand for travel to Egypt could be a blow for the country, whose already struggling economy is heavily reliant on tourism.Advertisement
