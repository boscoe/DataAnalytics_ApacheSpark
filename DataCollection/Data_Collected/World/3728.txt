BERLIN —  On a stretch of sidewalk in Germany’s capital, migrant families huddle under blankets, their eyes locked on a tall metal gate. Helpers in bright yellow vests hand out steaming cups of tea to guard against the cold.Beyond that gate, in the courtyard of a complex of stately brick buildings in an up-and-coming Berlin neighborhood, is Germany’s version of Ellis Island — a clearing point for hundreds of new arrivals who gather long before dawn to submit their asylum applications.Many wait more than eight hours here each day, only to be told they will have to return the next day.“They always say ‘tomorrow,’ ” said Ezzat Aswam, 33, standing in the predawn chill with his 6-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son nestled next to him. He and his family arrived in Germany four months ago.AdvertisementThe courtyard has also become the face of the country’s struggle to impose order on the tumultuous wave of humanity arriving at its borders daily — about 758,000 in the first 10 months of the year, with 181,000 in October alone.In a country known for efficiency, the experience at the State Office for Health and Social Affairs, known by its German acronym, Lageso, can be startling. Many migrants risked their lives to get here, only to find themselves waiting behind metal barriers in a dirt courtyard just to pull a number for the next line.AdvertisementThe scene has ranged from chaotic to downright dangerous. On a recent morning, two hours before the center opened, an ambulance wound its way through dozens of migrants huddled under blankets. A man had collapsed — it was unclear whether it was from the cold or from exhaustion.Police officers have been brought in to back up private security guards after several migrants were injured trying to storm the gates. Rumors of guards accepting bribes are rampant.And it is from here that a 4-year-old boy from Bosnia disappeared last month — taken, the police said, by a man who confessed to kidnapping and killing him. The boy and his family were not among the tens of thousands of migrants who crossed Europe in recent months; they had been waiting for a decision on their asylum application for two years. They are now expected to be allowed to stay.“I mean, it’s Germany,” said Yazan Smair, a 31-year-old student who fled Syria three months ago and has been granted asylum in Germany; he now volunteers as an interpreter outside the registration center. “They have a system for everything,” he said. “There must be an easier way.”More specifically, though, it is Berlin, where budget cuts and population growth taxed resources long before the arrival of asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Syria and other places. Klaus Wowereit, a former mayor, sought to attract creative types to the city by describing it as “poor but sexy” — far from many migrants’ experiences so far.For two decades, Germany has sought to streamline its government, and nowhere has this been more visible than in Berlin. After the East and West sectors of the city were fused in 1990, its public work force was at 200,000. The city set out to halve that number, spinning off some services and downgrading others, so that by 2004, the number of employees had shrunk to 149,000.AdvertisementEven as the population grew, the number of city employees continued to drop. A decade later, there were just 117,000 of them, and those who remained complained that their ranks were too thin to provide needed social services to Berliners.At the same time, inexpensive rents, extensive public transportation and the image of Berlin as one of Europe’s hippest cities drew thousands of newcomers — 175,000 from 2011 to 2014. City planners had projected that Berlin would have another 175,000 arrivals over the next 15 years, but that estimate did not account for the thousands of migrants.Over that same period, affordable housing grew scarce. The glut of apartments after reunification led the city to reduce subsidies for low-income housing. Because of growing demand for housing, rents have shot up 7.7 percent in the past two years. And although city-owned housing companies plan 30,000 new apartments for 2016, that number was formulated before so many newcomers landed at Berlin’s doorstep, many sent there by the federal government from points south.Last month, Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, tried to reassure residents that the city was financially stable enough to meet everyone’s needs. “We have many social problems in our city — that I can’t deny,” Mr. Müller said on RBB state radio. “We have unemployed, we have the homeless.” However, he added: “We have many different social services to help people who need it. That is important to me.”But the scene at the state office reflects a city that is stretched, if not overwhelmed.Those who know the situation best — the volunteers who donate their time and energy to feed, clothe and counsel the new arrivals — worry that city administrators are failing to ensure the migrants’ welfare.“We need to work hard, otherwise we will see the first people dying of cold,” said Victoria Baxter of Moabit Hilft,  an organization formed over the summer to help asylum seekers left waiting for hours in the sun without sufficient water or food.Berlin’s role as a city of refuge has dominated much of its post-World War II history. West Berlin served as a haven in the heart of East Germany for people fleeing communism, predominantly in the 1960s; for Tamils escaping civil war in Sri Lanka in the 1980s; and for pacifists from West Germany seeking to avoid compulsory military service.But Europe has not seen migration of this scope since World War II. In Berlin alone, a city of 3.5 million, more than 62,000 people have arrived to seek asylum this year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That includes money for language classes, transportation and medical services, as well as for hiring and training more people to process applications.AdvertisementA former state bank building that was repurposed as a new, integrated registration center opened in October. Asylum seekers can submit their applications, undergo required medical examinations and, eventually, consult with officials from the labor office about possible jobs.City officials say the new system has allowed them to process as many as 700 applicants a day, compared with fewer than half that number this summer, when new arrivals first picked up.
                In recent months European nations have worked to block the main route taken by migrants fleeing war and upheaval.            “The processing of the applications for asylum is moving ahead with full power,” Mario Czaja, Berlin’s senator for health and social services, told the Berlin public radio station Radio Eins on Monday. “We have taken big steps to improve.”But those seeking to apply for asylum, or to secure social benefits, must still brave the courtyard to start the process. Only newcomers who have arrived since mid-October can qualify for the new system, leaving a backlog of several thousand people, like Mr. Aswam and his family, still waiting at the old center.Last week, Berlin’s department for health and social services instituted new rules aimed at easing the crush outside the registration center, including allowing one member of a household to apply for a whole family and prioritizing those who have been waiting the longest.Toryalay Jamshidi, an 18-year-old from Afghanistan, said he had waited five days and nights just to acquire the gray plastic bracelet needed to board the bus to the new processing center. During the wait, he said, he slept on the street some nights.Since the temperatures dropped below freezing, women and children have been allowed to wait in heated tents. Yet volunteers worry that too many people are still left at the end of the day with nowhere to sleep.Olivia Mandeau has been volunteering at night over the past two months, helping to distribute blankets and warm clothing as well as organizing emergency shelter for migrants on the street.“Nowhere else in Germany is this a problem — every other city manages to find everyone a roof over their heads,” Ms. Mandeau said.Advertisement“This is not a refugee crisis,” she said. “This is an administration crisis.”Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
