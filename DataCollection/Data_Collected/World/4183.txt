While the capital has been struck by several Islamist militant attacks this year, the police said they were treating the bombing at the El Sayad nightclub, in the Agouza district, as a crime rather than an act of terrorism.At least two men threw firebombs into the nightclub around 6:30 a.m., well after it had closed for the night, setting off an explosion and a fire that sent clouds of smoke billowing into the sky, witnesses said.The nightclub, in the basement of a building, offered few escape routes for those inside, and most of those who died appeared to have burned or suffered smoke inhalation.Mohammed Ali, who works at a nearby pharmacy, said he had seen two men fleeing the scene on motorbikes. The only people who would be normally inside the club at that time were members of the cleaning staff preparing to return home, he said.Nine of the dead, including three women, were taken to a hospital in Agouza. The director of that hospital, Ahmed Gamal, said that all had died from smoke inhalation. Outside the hospital morgue, wailing relatives dressed in black gathered to identify the bodies.Preliminary investigations indicated that the bombing had stemmed from a dispute at the nightclub, although exact details were unclear.State news media reported that there had been an argument hours earlier between members of the nightclub staff and a group of customers who had vowed to return later. A security official told Reuters that one of the attackers was an employee who had been fired from the club.Egyptian security forces have been on high alert after a number of violent attacks in Cairo this year as well as the crash of a Russian plane on the Sinai Peninsula on Oct. 31 that killed 224 people and that Russian officials blamed on a bomb.Advertisement
