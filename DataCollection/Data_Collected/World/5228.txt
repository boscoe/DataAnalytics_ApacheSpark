But safety fears put the televised event in question, as hard-liners and tribal leaders argued that it was un-Islamic and immoral.Death threats were posted on the pageant’s Facebook page, and at least some contestants were reported to have pulled out.In response, organizers delayed the event from its original start date in October and removed a swimsuit portion.“Iraq needed this,” Ahmed Leith, the pageant director, told CNN. “The situation is weak here, and we wanted to celebrate this the same way other countries like Lebanon and others do. To have a sense of normalcy.”Two of Ms. Abdelrahman’s cousins, both Iraqi police officers, were killed fighting Islamic State fighters, NBC reported. She said she would use her fame to work on educational initiatives, especially for those displaced by the conflict, reports said.Advertisement
