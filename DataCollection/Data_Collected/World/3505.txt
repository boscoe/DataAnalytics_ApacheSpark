Here is a clip from a Russian military briefing showing Russia’s version of events:The incident with Turkey is the kind of conflict analysts have been fearing might  happen amid escalating tensions  over a series of air encounters between Russia and the West. Russian military planes fly near, or into, the airspace of other nations, or behave in other ways that NATO countries consider aggressive.
