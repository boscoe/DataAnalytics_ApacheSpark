ROME — Capture by the Greeks of Koritza, Italian base eight miles inside the Albanian frontier, was announced today [Nov. 22] by the Italian high command. It said two Fascist divisions which since the opening of hostilities with Greece had held defensive positions on the Greco-Albanian frontier near Koritza had retired, after eleven days of fighting, to a line west of the city. Announcing that during the eleven-day period bitter combats had developed, a high command communiqué admitted that Italian losses were ‘‘considerable,’’ but said that Greek losses were ‘‘more and more graver.’’ It said the Italian air force, despite ‘‘prohibitive’’ weather conditions, had co-operated with ground troops by bombing enemy objectives. Koritza is a town of 26,000 inhabitants from which such highways as there are radiate outward to Yugoslavia and Greece. It commands the railroad through Florina to Salonica, on the Aegean Sea, toward which the Italian Army originally was headed. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 23, 1940
