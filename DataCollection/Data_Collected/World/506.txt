If the Nov. 8 vote is credible, most observers believe that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, will win the most seats in Parliament. By forming a coalition with smaller parties, it could control a majority. A clause in the 2008 Constitution, drafted when the country was under military rule, prevents Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi from taking the top job because her husband, who died in 1999, was a British citizen, and she has two children who are British citizens. “I’ve made it quite clear that if the N.L.D. wins the elections and we form a government, I’m going to be the leader of that government whether or not I’m the president,” she told the Indian television channel India Today TV.
