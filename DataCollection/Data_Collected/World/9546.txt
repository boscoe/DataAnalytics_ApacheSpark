WASHINGTON —  The United States and Iran are closing in on a historic agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear program, but are confronting serious last-minute obstacles, including when United Nations sanctions would be lifted and how inspections would be conducted, American and European officials said.Secretary of State John Kerry, who heads to Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday night for a critical round of talks, is still clashing with his Iranian counterpart over Tehran’s demand that all United Nations sanctions be suspended as soon as there is a deal, as well as Washington’s insistence that international inspectors be able to promptly visit any nuclear site, even those on Iranian military bases.There are also disagreements over Iran’s research and development of advanced centrifuges, which would allow Iran to produce nuclear fuel far more quickly, as well as over how many years an agreement would last.The White House hopes that an accord might eventually open a new chapter in a relationship that has been marked largely by decades of mutual suspicion, Iranian-sponsored terrorism, American cyberattacks and Iranian retaliation. But even the prospect of the deal has set off a furious political confrontation between the White House and Republicans who say an accord will fail to end Iran’s bomb program and even encourage Arab nations to mount their own nuclear efforts. Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Congress recently that the effect of the emerging deal with Iran would be “to move from preventing proliferation to managing it.”AdvertisementThe areas of convergence in the deal circulating in Washington and European capitals include a complex arrangement in which Iran would ship large portions of its stockpiles of uranium out of the country, almost certainly to Russia. In return, the United States and its negotiating partners could allow Iran to keep roughly 6,500 of its centrifuges spinning, rather than the few hundred that were under discussion a year ago.AdvertisementThe number of centrifuges, which may be altered in the final stages of talks, will take on outsize proportions in the public debate here. Opponents of the deal argue that it will leave the Iranians with a latent production capacity, even though the country would have limited amounts of uranium to work with. American officials insist that for at least the first 10 years of a final accord, the mix of fuel and enrichment capacity will leave the United States, Israel and others with at least a year’s worth of warning time if Iran raced to make a bomb’s worth of material — compared to just a few months of warning time today.But inside the negotiating rooms, there are still major debates about how to phase in the lifting of United Nations, American and European sanctions as Iran complies with the terms. The sanctions standoff underscores a little-discussed but politically volatile issue for the Obama administration: how quickly Iran would see economic and technological benefits from any accord.A suspension, and ultimate elimination, of the sanctions on oil exports and financial transactions is the key issue for President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and his lead negotiator, Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, if they hope to sell a 10-year or longer limitation on their nuclear activity to Iranian mullahs and military leaders who have opposed the negotiations. As details of the talks leak, they are being used by opponents in Tehran, especially the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which oversees the military side of the nuclear program. They argue that by limiting Iran’s capabilities for so many years, the United States would use an accord to thwart Iran’s emergence as the major power in the Middle East.But any rapid lifting of sanctions — by vote of the Security Council and by President Obama’s decisions to gradually waive imposition of American- imposed economic penalties — could intensify the already fierce congressional debate. Congress would ultimately need to vote to remove American sanctions, though it might not be asked to do so until Mr. Obama is out of office. And some Republicans may balk at doing that and instead try to toughen the terms, perhaps to the point that Iran might no longer accept them.An adviser to Mr. Kerry said the secretary recently expressed concern that even if he wins his last negotiating points with Iran, any accord “is going to be a heavy lift” in Congress.“He’s rightly worried,” said the adviser, who would not be named because he was discussing sensitive diplomatic talks. “The chances of reaching an agreement are now higher than ever, and the chances it will collapse politically here are higher, too.”Mr. Kerry is calling in reinforcements to bolster the argument that an accord would guarantee that, for a decade or more, that the United States and its allies have at least a year’s warning before Iran could manufacture a bomb’s worth of weapons-grade nuclear fuel. Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, a nuclear scientist who has negotiated with his Iranian counterpart during the last two rounds of talks, is part of the American team at the coming negotiations as well. Mr. Moniz is there to negotiate details that once seemed as if they were the eye-glazing stuff of diplomacy — how to modify arrays of centrifuges so they cannot easily make weapons fuel, for example — which is suddenly becoming crucial to the political debate.
                What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development.            Here are some of the critical remaining differences:HOW LONG A DEAL?One of the most contentious features of the accord is how long the provisions extending the breakout time to a year would last. American officials have said that such measures would be in effect for at least 10 years of an expected 15-year agreement. Mr. Kerry’s Iranian counterpart argued in an interview last summer that the entire deal should run no more than seven years.AdvertisementHowever long it lasts, a core objection Mr. Kerry must overcome is that after it expires, Iran would still have the infrastructure to produce as much nuclear material as it wants, as Japan or Brazil do. The Obama administration is betting that by then a different, or at least a more cooperative, Iranian regime will be in power.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Those measures would include visits to military sites where suspected nuclear work is going on. Iran’s generals have so far refused to do that.Getting a far-reaching inspection regime to guard against a covert nuclear program — one that goes beyond the toughest measures inspectors use in any other country — is critical for Mr. Kerry to meet his own goal, which he described earlier this month as “a deal that will prove over the long term that each pathway to a bomb is closed off.”Another way to hedge would be to keep some constraints, such as a ban on the construction of nuclear fuel reprocessing plants, in place after a formal agreement lapses.The United States has “great respect for the religious importance of a fatwa,” Mr. Kerry told reporters during a visit to Egypt on Saturday, alluding to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s much publicized edict against the development of nuclear weapons. But negotiators, Mr. Kerry said, needed an agreement that would “guarantee that Iran’s program will be peaceful now and peaceful forever.”A LEGALLY BINDING ACCORD?In congressional testimony last week, Mr. Kerry acknowledged what 47 Republicans wrote in a letter to the Iranian leadership last week — that any “executive agreement” like this one, made without a vote in Congress, would not be legally binding on future presidents. But neither are other “executive agreements,” including the diplomatic opening to China and the accord that rid Syria of many of its chemical weapons. The White House and Mr. Kerry argue that any future president is highly unlikely to rescind the accord, particularly if Iran is complying with its terms.Still, the nature of the agreement raises some questions about its durability.“I think Kerry is probably right that a future president is likely to honor the agreement as long as Iran does, but the fact that the agreement is not legally binding gives a future president or Congress more flexibility to seek to modify or abrogate the agreement,” said Gary Samore, once Mr. Obama’s chief adviser on weapons of mass destruction and now president of an advocacy group called United Against Nuclear Iran. “The same is true of Iran.”In fact, if a future president canceled the deal, there would be an immediate price to pay: Iran would be free to produce as much nuclear fuel as it wanted.AdvertisementRELAXED RESTRAINTS ON TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH?One reason the United States and its allies are so reluctant to lift the United Nations sanctions is that they include a ban on high-technology goods that could help Iran covertly build a weapon. So discussions are underway about setting up a highly monitored channel for Iran to receive its technology, with continuing bans on certain goods. But that requires extraordinarily good intelligence to avoid cheating.Similarly, the United States is insisting on long-lasting restrictions on Iranian research and development of advanced centrifuges. But Iran’s Atomic Energy Agency and its military are objecting, saying no other countries must live with such restrictions.The military and Iranian scientists are also resisting demands that they answer all of the questions the International Atomic Energy Agency has asked for many years about possible research and design work on nuclear weapons and how to shrink them into a warhead.“The issue is deeper than whether you make them admit what they did in the past,” said one American official, who asked for anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. “It’s getting to know their entire scientific infrastructure so you will detect any effort to start up weapons design years from now.”David D.
