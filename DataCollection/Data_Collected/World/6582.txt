The official, Atul Prasad, a Bihar State administrator, said the violence erupted Sunday after the body of a Hindu boy was found on a farm in the village of Sarayian more than a week after he disappeared. Mr. Prasad said Hindus blamed Muslims for killing the boy who was friendly with a Muslim girl from the village, nearly 65 miles north of Patna, the Bihar capital. The police have arrested eight Hindus on charges of burning nearly two dozen huts. Advertisement
