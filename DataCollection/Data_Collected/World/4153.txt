Georgia on Friday stripped former President Mikheil Saakashvili of his citizenship, in a move one of his supporters described as part of a settling of political scores. President Giorgi Margvelashvili signed a decree removing his predecessor’s citizenship on the grounds that Mr. Saakashvili, now governor of Ukraine’s Odessa region, became a Ukrainian citizen in May. Mr. Saakashvili came to power in the bloodless Rose Revolution in 2003 and steered Georgia on a pro-Western course that antagonized Moscow and culminated in a five-day war in 2008 in which Georgia was crushed by Russian forces. He is wanted in Georgia on charges including abuse of power and using excessive force against protesters in 2007, but Ukrainian prosecutors rejected a request to extradite him earlier this year. Friday’s decree is “yet another example of employing legal instruments for political persecution,” said Nugzar Tsiklauri, an opposition member of Parliament. Dozens of former state officials have been convicted in Georgia since a coalition led by a billionaire, Bidzina Ivanishvili, won a parliamentary election in 2012, ending nine years of Saakashvili dominance.A version of this brief appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Georgia: Ex-President Loses Citizenship.
