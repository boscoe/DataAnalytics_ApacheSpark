Stormy weather in the Adriatic Sea thwarted efforts on Wednesday to tow a damaged ferry to port in southern Italy so the authorities can investigate the blaze that killed at least 11 people and search the ship for more possible dead. Ninety-eight people were still unaccounted for, Giuseppe Volpe, the prosecutor in Bari, Italy, was quoted as saying by the ANSA news agency. It is not clear if those people ever boarded the ferry — which left Greece on Saturday bound for Italy — if they were rescued, or if they died in the fire or in the sea. The exact number of ferry survivors and how many were on board to begin with were still not known. Mr. Volpe said he hoped that the Greek authorities would be able to say many people had been rescued by various ships and taken to Greece.A version of this brief appears in print on January 1, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Italy: Storm Impedes Effort to Tow Ferry and See if There Are More Victims.
