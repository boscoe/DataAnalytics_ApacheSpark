The two were arrested and charged after raids on homes in Sydney’s southwestern suburbs early Thursday, the police said.Three other men, ages 21 and 22, who were being held after the previous raids, were charged later on Thursday.Catherine Burn, deputy commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force, said it was disturbing that a teenager had been arrested. The police said he was 14 when he first came to their notice. “To be putting a 15-year-old before the courts on very serious charges that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment demonstrates the difficulties law enforcement face,” Ms. Burn said.She said the two suspects charged on Thursday had links to another 15-year-old boy, Farhad Jabar, who shot and killed a police accountant, Curtis Cheng, in October in Parramatta, west of Sydney. The teenager was shot and killed by the police.Advertisement
