Rangers found the animals’ carcasses on Monday morning, the parks agency spokeswoman, Caroline Washaya-Moyo, said. She said poachers had gotten away with three ivory tusks, adding, “We are now trying to check how many elephants had fully developed tusks, because babies are among those killed.” She called the continuing losses to cyanide “alarming” and noted that many other species were also dying from the poison used against elephants. In 2013, more than 200 elephants died from cyanide poisoning in Hwange. Ms. Washaya-Moyo said the parks agency was hoping that trained dogs and drones would help tighten monitoring of the vast park. On Monday, national parks officials also announced that over the weekend the authorities at Harare International Airport seized 380 pounds of ivory, worth $43,250, that was about to be smuggled to Singapore. Three Zimbabweans and a Malian citizen were arrested, they said. Advertisement
