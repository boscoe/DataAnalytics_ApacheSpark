Later that month in Shanghai, a section of flooring in an escalator in a subway station partly collapsed, though no one was injured.In September in Chongqing, a 3-year-old girl was injured when her arm became stuck in a shopping mall escalator.At least 37 people died in escalator and elevator accidents last year, The Beijing Morning Post reported in July, quoting an official with the national safety regulator.In a nationwide inspection this year, the regulator found 111,000 faulty elevators and escalators, Xinhua, the state news agency, reported. Most have since been repaired, Xinhua said.Chinese news media commonly describe such escalators as “man-eating.” Some have noted that Lu Xun, one of China’s most venerated 20th-century writers, also used the phrase to describe the harsh living conditions of his time.“Lu Xun said that back then society was man-eating,” a Weibo user named Kun Cen commented. “Now we have man-eating escalators, swimming pools and statues that fall over, crushing people to death,” a reference to a monument that collapsed in Sichuan Province in August, killing a 10-year-old boy.Follow Patrick Boehler on Twitter @mrbaopanrui.
