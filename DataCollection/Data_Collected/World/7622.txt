Lawmakers in Warsaw on Friday approved a European convention against domestic violence following a stormy parliamentary debate, in which many said the convention threatened traditional family structures. The lawmakers voted 254-175 with eight abstentions to empower President Bronislaw Komorowski to sign into law the 2011 Council of Europe’s convention on combating violence against women and domestic violence. It obliges governments and organizations to penalize such violence, help victims and teach about tolerance. Many right-wing and Roman Catholic lawmakers said some of the regulations undermined Poland’s traditional roles for mothers and fathers. The convention says children should be taught about equal rights for men and women and about “nonstereotype” roles, which critics interpret as challenging the traditional roles of men and women in predominantly Catholic Poland. A spokesman for Poland’s bishops said in a statement that the vote meant that the lawmakers did not see the “good of the marriage, of the family, of Poland’s future demography as their priority.”A version of this brief appears in print on February 7, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Poland: Domestic Violence Law Debated.
