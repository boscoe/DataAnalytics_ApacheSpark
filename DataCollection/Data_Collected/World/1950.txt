BEIJING —  When the Chinese government loosened the one-child policy in 2013, Cai Wei and Ni Jun wanted to take advantage of it.The Beijing couple already had a son, Huhu, born in 2010, and like many families they wanted the child to have a sibling.But by the time the government announced Thursday that all Chinese couples could finally, legally, have a second child, the couple had changed their minds.“Our life would become harder,” Ms. Cai said. “It’s a money thing.”She ticked off a few expenses.Advertisement“We pay about 1,400 renminbi a month for Huhu’s kindergarten,” she said, about $220. “And that’s just the fees. Then there’s extra lessons. He loves art. Swimming is 100 renminbi an hour,” or $16. “Rollerblading. It’s all so expensive. I’d love to have a second child, but I’m afraid of the consequences.”
                A look at how China’s restrictions on the size of families changed over the years.            The couple’s story is a common one.For most ordinary families, the expense of raising a second child is overwhelming. Education is costly, child care generally dependent on willing relatives. And partly because people have so few children, prices for everything related to children are high.AdvertisementSo for many Chinese families the decision to have another child comes down to math.Two years ago, the government allowed couples in which one partner was an only child to have a second child. Ms. Cai, then 38, was an only child so she and her husband qualified. And they had long dreamed of giving Huhu a little sister.Ms. Cai is a private therapeutic masseuse. Mr. Ni, 41, is a guide for a travel agency who frequently travels overseas with groups.They live with his mother in a two-bedroom apartment that they own, in an ordinary tower block in Beijing. They have a car, and a combined salary of about $3,900 a month. While that puts them in the middle class, they find that the two salaries are essential to cover costs and they have little room to maneuver.Private kindergartens typically cost at least $630 a month. Cheaper, state-run kindergartens are highly sought after and cannot offer enough places. Huhu was lucky to get a place in one, Ms. Cai said. Still, education accounts for about 15 percent of their family budget.Mr. Ni’s job takes him out of the country for about two weeks a month, so Ms. Cai is often alone with Huhu.As China ends its one child policy, some parents ponder the pros and cons of having a second child.In China, a man’s parents traditionally help raise their grandchild, a system that many believe works best. But Mr. Ni’s father died last year and his mother’s health is not good.Advertisement“I am afraid that it would be too difficult for me to continue working after having a second child,” Ms. Cai said. Quitting would shrink the family finances.“I could be a full-time mom, or just work part-time, but that would be really hard,” she said. “Could we still afford our standard of living? What would life be like for us?”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The state has been investing in a nationwide health insurance system, but other services are lacking, she said.“Like for working mothers, there’s nothing,” she said. “Who looks after your baby? A nanny is a very, very big cost.”Typically, a nanny in a big city like Beijing may cost $235 to $475, or more, a month, depending on the nanny’s education.

After several food safety disasters such as melamine-tainted infant formula and recycled “gutter oil” sold as cheap cooking oil, many families buy safer foods.“We have to buy some imported foods, especially for our baby,” Ms. Cai said. “It’s expensive.”So though Ms. Cai wanted a second child, her initial enthusiasm has faded.“In reality, everyone has thought this through,” she said. “We’ve known for a while that they would do this.”The change in policy had been a government talking point for several years, and there were signs of increasing relaxation.AdvertisementAnd, she said, everyone knows why: a demographic crunch that policy makers fear has cut into the labor force, and will create a cohort of elderly Chinese whose care will be a challenge.“The family planning policies have gone on for so long and there are so few little children,” she said. “But it’s not that simple to have a child. And I don’t mean in physical terms, that I’m 40 now. I mean in economic terms.”“I do know people with more than one child,” she concluded. “Even three. But they are very rich.”A version of this article appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Rules Ease, but Wallets Often Limit Family Size.
