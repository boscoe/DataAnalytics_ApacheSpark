NAIROBI, Kenya —  Major election complications cropped up on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar on Wednesday, and the main opposition party on the mainland called for a recount as Tanzania’s election limbo stretched into its third day.Observers had predicted that Sunday’s elections would be the closest and possibly most troubled in Tanzania’s history. Tanzania is considered one of the most peaceful nations in Africa, led by essentially the same political party since independence more than 50 years ago.But many Tanzanians are growing tired of that party, and already there have been worrisome signs. Ballot papers were burned by a mob in western Tanzania on Sunday. On Monday, opposition officials said scores of their volunteers were  arrested.And on Wednesday, officials on Zanzibar, a semiautonomous island with miles of soft, white sand, suddenly declared election results from all local races void. The opposition had seemed poised to sweep those races, and though the decision to hold new local elections does not affect the nationwide presidential tally, observers said it was sure to raise already percolating tensions.AdvertisementZanzibar has always been the most volatile part of Tanzania, with an at times uneasy federation with the mainland, and past elections have turned violent.Advertisement“The next 48 hours will determine what direction we go, whether we go forward or backwards,” said Mazo Kundayo, an opposition supporter who runs a small hotel in the mainland city of Arusha. “I think they should cancel this election for the entire country. If it’s canceled then I don’t think there will be protests, but if it’s not, I don’t know what will happen.”
                Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.            The American Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, said it was “gravely alarmed” by the annulment of Zanzibar’s results. “This action halted an orderly and peaceful election,” the embassy said in a statement. “We call for this announcement to be recalled.”Officials on Zanzibar said they had to annul the elections, for the local president and House of Representatives, because of voter fraud, improper interference and fistfights between election commissioners. Another election will be held in 90 days, officials said.Nationwide, votes from the presidential election are being counted. So far the governing party’s candidate, John Magufuli, is comfortably ahead of his closest rival, Edward Lowassa, a former prime minister.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Business was down to a trickle with shops and schools closed as the country remained in election limbo. Mr. Magufuli, a chemist by training and the minister of public works, has 60 percent of the vote in early counting to Mr. Lowassa’s 40 percent.Many people fear that the opposition is gearing up for protests as soon as the final result is announced, expected on Thursday. Mr. Lowassa’s party has accused election officials of vote-rigging.On Wednesday, Mr. Lowassa demanded that the vote counting be stopped and started afresh “due to huge irregularities.”Though Tanzania’s governing party, the Party of the Revolution, was formed in 1977, it is widely considered an extension of the same political party that led Tanzania to independence in the 1960s. Many Tanzanians accuse it of being deeply corrupt. Still, it has an extensive network of party functionaries, especially in impoverished rural areas.Willy Lowry contributed reporting from Arusha, Tanzania, and Orton Kiishweko from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Election Unrest Feared on Tanzanian Island .
