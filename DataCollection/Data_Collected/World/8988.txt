MONTREUX, Switzlerland — Secretary of State John Kerry flew to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to take on the challenge of explaining a potential deal over Iran’s nuclear program to the American-allied conservative monarchies of the gulf.In the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Mr. Kerry plans to meet with King Salman and to consult with foreign ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, who are also flying there.Like Israel, which opposes the potential deal, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations in the region see Iran as an opponent. They are concerned about the terms of the deal, which would be limited in duration and would allow Iran to retain some of its nuclear infrastructure.Mr. Kerry met here in Switzerland for three days of talks that also included the United States energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, and Ali Akbar Salehi, the director of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization.AdvertisementFacing an end-of-March deadline for reaching a framework agreement that would define the outline of an eventual accord, Mr. Kerry plans to meet again with Mr. Zarif on March 15, probably in Geneva, a senior State Department official told reporters.AdvertisementIntensive consultations are planned before then, including a Saturday meeting Mr. Kerry is holding in Paris with foreign ministers from Britain, France and Germany.The harsh criticism of the emerging accord from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday in a speech before the United States Congress has focused attention on important elements of the agreement, including what might happen after it expires. But Mr. Kerry told reporters after the talks here that Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks would not influence the negotiators.“We are not going to be distracted by external factors,” said Mr. Kerry. “Simply demanding that Iran capitulate is not a plan.”
                What the United States and Iran want out of discussions over Iran’s nuclear development.            Mr. Kerry insisted that it was not yet clear whether an agreement would be reached with Iran. Even so, he continued to lay the foundation for selling an agreement should one be reached. Mr. Kerry argued that an intensification of economic sanctions would not compel Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, and he steered clear of the notion that the threat of military action might also be a form of leverage in the talks.Having rejected the idea that additional economic or military pressure might yield a better agreement, Mr. Kerry insisted that there was no viable alternative to the agreement that the United States and its partners were attempting to negotiate — an agreement that he said would lead to improved verification measures and would lengthen the time it would take Iran to “break out” and achieve a working nuclear weapon.Obama administration officials have said that a central goal of accord would be to preclude Iran from being able to develop enough nuclear material for a bomb within a year, should it decide to repudiate the agreement. American officials have said the breakout restrictions should last at least 10 years. Mr. Kerry, who took no questions from reporters in his appearance here, said the United States would be interested only in the “right deal.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One possibility that has been discussed is an accord that lasts 15 years, with restrictions on Iran’s ability to enrich uranium relaxed during the final years.Mr. Netanyahu warned in his speech that Iran would be able to build and operate a huge number of centrifuges for enriching uranium after the accord ends, greatly shortening its breakout time. Far from preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, Mr. Netanyahu asserted, an accord might be a path toward one.AdvertisementThe State Department official who spoke about Mr. Kerry’s plans to meet with Mr. Zarif declined to say how Iran’s ability to enrich uranium might be limited, if at all, after the accord expires.But the official insisted that enhanced monitoring measures would remain in place indefinitely after the accord lapsed, under the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This, the official asserted, would offer some protection against an Iranian decision to make a dash for a bomb.“All I am saying is that there will be a number of phases for Iran going into the future,” said the official, who was not identified under the agency’s protocol for briefing reporters, “and it will include measures of transparency.”“We have made some progress, but have a lot of challenges yet ahead,” the official said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
