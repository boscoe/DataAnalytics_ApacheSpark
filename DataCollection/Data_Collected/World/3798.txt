BERLIN — Herr Von Gossler, the Minister of Public Instruction replied to-day [Nov. 29] in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies to the interpellation of Herr Graf relative to the discovery of Professor Koch. The Minister replied that Professor Koch’s discovery was for the present only an infallible means of diagnoses for tuberculosis, but that as a means of cure it would require years of experience to test it. There was, however, great hope that the results would be good. In any case Professor Koch has rendered an immense service to science in connection with all kinds of infectious diseases. The minister added that it was he who prevented Professor Koch from publishing the method of preparation of his remedy, for fear that it might be badly prepared and do more harm than good. The Prussian Government, he said, intended to purchase the secret and manufacture the remedy with its own guarantee, and supply it free of cost to all the hospitals of Germany and other countries. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 30, 1890
