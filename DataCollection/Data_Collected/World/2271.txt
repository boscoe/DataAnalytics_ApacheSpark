WASHINGTON — The chances of early American intervention in Martinique were discounted today [Nov. 4] by Gaston Henry-Haye, French Ambassador, after he had delivered a note from the Vichy government to the State Department denying any intention of turning over French possessions and bases to the Germans. His personal message was to bridge a long gap before the official answering of a note by President Roosevelt to Marshal Henri Pétain, sharply informing the Vichy government that the United States could not tolerate a change in the sovereignty or control of the islands near the continental United States. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 5, 1940
