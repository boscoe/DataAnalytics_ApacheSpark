The police officers, who were investigating a land dispute in the Shopian district, died when militants shot at them with Kalashnikov rifles and then escaped into woods. In separate extremist attacks, a former militant who was suspected of being a police informer was seriously injured and a police officer in another district was shot in the neck from close range. “If you see all the three incidents, they have resorted to attack on soft targets where people were unarmed,” S. J. M. Gillani, inspector general of police in Kashmir, told the NDTV news channel. Among other recent violence in the area, a police officer and a soldier were killed Thursday by militants who escaped and last month an attack on a police station and army camp left three police officers, four militants and a civilian dead.
