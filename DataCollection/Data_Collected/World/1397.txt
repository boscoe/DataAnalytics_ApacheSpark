The summary, which follows an internal review over more than a year, was made available to the members of the Security Council following requests from several of them, United Nations diplomats said.The Palestinians hope that report could open the door for a discussion about international protection in the Palestinian territories, though the prospect of establishing any foreign presence is highly unlikely.Last week the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, categorically ruled out the need, while his Palestinian counterpart, Riyad Mansour, told reporters that he hoped the release of the report would persuade members of the Security Council to consider an international presence around the sites that Jews, Muslims and Christians consider holy in the Old City of Jerusalem.Secretary General Ban Ki-moon took pains to say in his cover letter to the Council that he did not “propose any particular system or systems of protection for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, nor is it in any sense an options paper.” Nor does he suggest that it should be taken up for discussion, saying that it was “compiled for the purpose of assisting and informing any future work that might take place within the Secretariat on this subject.”The summary includes the 1932 example of an international force mandated to maintain order at a Colombian river port called Leticia, located near the border with Peru and created by the League of Nations after clashes between both countries’ militaries. Some of the examples include armed peacekeepers. Others do not. Included are examples from Namibia, Kosovo and East Timor. Also referenced is the use of unarmed international observers in Hebron after a 1994 massacre of Palestinians at a mosque.Advertisement
