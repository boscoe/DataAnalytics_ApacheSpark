VICHY — Breaking after an interval of 150 years the fundamental principles of the French Revolution, the government of Premier Marshal Henri Petain relegated French Jews today to the status of citizens of an inferior class. Racial discrimination was placed on the statute books of this country for the first time when the ‘‘Journal Officiel’’ published this morning an anti-Semitic law designed to settle definitely the Jewish problem so far as France is concerned. The Vichy legislation excludes Jews from all the principal public offices of this country on the ground of race, unless the Jews served as combatants in the World War or won decorations for bravery in the present war. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 19, 1940
