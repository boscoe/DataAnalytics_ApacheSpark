Party leaders in the National Assembly decided on Wednesday that the agenda of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho’s center-right government would be debated on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10. Parliament is required to vote on the government’s policy agenda within three days of its presentation. The government would fall if the plan is rejected. Mr. Passos Coelho was named prime minister last week after his coalition won the most votes in an election on Oct. 4, but his coalition lost its majority in Parliament. The main opposition Socialists have vowed to vote out the new government. Advertisement
