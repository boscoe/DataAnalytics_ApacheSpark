Pope Francis made his first visit to the United States last month, traveling to Washington, New York and Philadelphia. Explore the full coverage from The Times.President Johnson and Pope Paul VI talked together for 46 minutes today [Oct. 4] about the problems of the world. The chief executive said afterwards that the pontiff’s visit to the United Nations ‘‘may be just what the world needs to get us thinking on how to achieve peace.’’ The dramatic meeting between the slight, retiring man who rules as spiritual leader of the world’s 550 million Roman Catholics and the towering Texan who leads the world’s most powerful and influential nation occurred in a plush sitting room in Suite 35 of the Waldorf Towers. The subject matter they covered, aided by two interpreters, ranged from the quest for peace to the problems of worldwide poverty, disease and illiteracy, from race relations to Vietnam. Gifts also were exchanged. Mr. Johnson gave the Pope a small gold globe and an autographed picture of himself in a silver frame. Pope Paul gave the president a large contemporary oil painting entitled ‘‘The Resurrection of Christ.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Oct. 5, 1965
