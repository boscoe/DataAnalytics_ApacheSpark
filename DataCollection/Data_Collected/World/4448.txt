Seven people were killed in Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, in violence associated with the continuing turmoil over President Pierre Nkurunziza and the extension of his presidency, witnesses said Wednesday. The United Nations says at least 240 people have been killed since April when Mr. Nkurunziza decided not to step down at the end of his second term. He was re-elected in July. Men in police uniforms pulled five people from their houses in the Cibitoke neighborhood and shot them dead on Wednesday, said a resident, Salima Bukuru. Their bodies were left on the roadside, she said. A human rights activist, Vital Nshimiyimana, said that some of those five victims had just been released from prison where they had been held for months after being arrested on charges of protesting against Mr. Nkurunziza. Another person was shot dead Wednesday afternoon in the Jabe neighborhood, while another was killed in Bwiza by people in police uniforms on Tuesday night, witnesses said. “I would not say that tomorrow there will be a genocide in Burundi,” Adama Dieng, the United Nations’ special adviser on the prevention of genocide, said Tuesday. “But there is a serious risk that if we do not stop the ongoing violence, this may end with a civil war, and following such civil war, everything is possible.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
