People in the area began looting shops and attacking foreign residents after a foreign shopkeeper was accused of shooting and killing a teenager on Monday, the South African Press Association said. The 14-year-old boy was reportedly in a group that tried to rob the shop. The targeted shops were owned by Ethiopians, Somalis and Pakistanis, witnesses said. Advertisement
