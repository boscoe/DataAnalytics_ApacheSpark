Snowden, the American former intelligence contractor, leaked details about the huge scale of information gathering by agencies in the United States and Britain.Like many Western countries, Britain is struggling to reconcile two imperatives: to preserve the privacy of individuals and to head off terrorist attacks. The parliamentary committee concluded in its report that the balance should be shifted somewhat in the direction of civil liberties, at a minimum by clarifying the ground rules for intelligence gathering.“We recognize that much of the detail regarding the agencies’ capabilities must be kept secret,” the panel said in the report. “There is, however, a great deal that can be discussed publicly, and we believe that the time has come for much greater openness and transparency regarding the agencies’ work.”In particular, the lawmakers called for a single new intelligence law to replace the patchwork of legislation now in place, which they said “could be misconstrued as providing the agencies with a ‘blank check’ to carry out whatever activities they deem necessary.” The powers of the intelligence agencies should be “set out clearly and unambiguously” in the law, the report said.The report cited flaws in the rules governing large databases of personal information, which the agencies use to identify individuals and establish links among them. Prime Minister David Cameron said on Thursday that he accepted the panel’s recommendation that formal oversight of such databases be written into law.The panel, the Intelligence and Security Committee, began its work in 2013 and heard testimony from a variety of senior figures, including the heads of Britain’s domestic and foreign security services, MI5 and MI6. Some of the testimony was heard in private.John Sawers, a former head of MI6, told the committee that Mr. Snowden’s leaks were “very damaging — they’ve put our operations at risk,” and that as a result, “our adversaries were rubbing their hands with glee.”On Thursday, one of the committee’s senior members, Hazel Blears of the opposition Labour Party, described the panel’s findings as generally “reassuring.”The report said that the agency mainly responsible for intercepting electronic communications in bulk, the Government Communications Headquarters or GCHQ, had “neither the legal authority, the technical capacity nor the resources” to monitor all Internet traffic. When GCHQ wants to monitor a particular person’s communications, Ms. Blears said, it is already required to get specific authorization from a senior minister.Even so, she said, the findings “do not obviate the need for a thorough overhaul of the current, overly complicated legislation.”Civil liberties advocates have long been concerned about the surveillance powers of government agencies, and some were dissatisfied with the oversight panel. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, an advocacy group, said that the committee “has repeatedly shown itself as a simple mouthpiece for the spooks — so clueless and ineffective that it’s only thanks to Edward Snowden that it had the slightest clue of the agencies’ antics.”The chairman of the committee, Malcolm Rifkind of the governing Conservative Party, stepped down from that post last month after he was secretly filmed by reporters appearing to offer consulting services to a private company for cash. Mr. Rifkind denied breaking parliamentary rules and retained his seat on the committee, but has said he will not seek another term in the general election scheduled for May 7.The committee’s report called for the misuse of GCHQ’s interception capabilities to be made a specific criminal offense. That recommendation became more relevant when another oversight official — the interception of communications commissioner, Anthony May — said in a separate report on Thursday that a GCHQ employee had performed unauthorized data searches last year that “amounted to gross misconduct,” and that the employee had been dismissed.Advertisement
