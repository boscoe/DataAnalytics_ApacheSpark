Buses full of Syrians, including rebel fighters, left the Waer neighborhood on the outskirts of Homs on Wednesday after rebels reached a cease-fire agreement with the Syrian government.BEIRUT, Lebanon —  Hundreds of people were evacuated on Wednesday from the last rebel-held pocket of Homs, the Syrian city devastated by years of bitter fighting and blockades.Under a local cease-fire agreement, food and supplies were allowed into the besieged Waer neighborhood on the outskirts of Homs, while insurgent fighters there who did not want to observe a truce were allowed safe passage out to rebel-held areas to the north, along with their families and their light weapons. Some civilians also were evacuated from Waer, accounting for about half the total, including about 20 wounded.The evacuation is the most significant concrete result from months of renewed efforts to strike local cease-fire deals. The Homs deal had extra symbolic value because the city was a major center of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.President Obama and other international officials want to see such deals replicated across Syria. Advocates say they could help end the civil war between the government and its Syrian opponents, and allow the two sides to unite against the foreign-led Islamic State militant group, which has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq.AdvertisementSkeptics, however, say that local cease-fire agreements merely reward the government’s harsh “starve or surrender” strategy for fighting the rebellion, which has taken a heavy toll on civilians, and that the idea of meaningful compromise between the rebels and the government remains far-fetched.AdvertisementRepresentatives of Syrian opposition factions were meeting on Wednesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to hash out a common platform for potential talks with the Syrian government. In a way, the Waer agreement rehearsed on a small level the larger task faced by the opposition and would-be peace brokers: sorting out which insurgents are willing to strike deals with the government and which are not.John Kerry, the American secretary of state, and Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general, announced that they planned to hold a meeting in New York on Dec. 18 to attempt to negotiate a ceasefire in Syria.The fighters who were evacuated on Wednesday were mainly from the Nusra Front, a Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda — a group that is excluded from the Riyadh talks. Those who stayed behind were mainly associated with less radical groups, loosely grouped as the Free Syrian Army. They said that despite their mistrust of the government, they were willing to try a cease-fire to end years of privation, destruction and isolation in the embattled neighborhood.“After almost three years of siege, finally I might see my family,” said an antigovernment activist who uses the nom de guerre Mohammad al-Homsi. “This is my only hope from this truce,” he added in an interview conducted over Skype, his voice betraying a mix of joy and trepidation.The activist comes from another Homs neighborhood, and survived two years of siege in the old city center; when that area was evacuated under an earlier cease-fire, he went to Waer, only to find himself besieged again.Scores of evacuees, including women and children, could be seen in television images on Wednesday boarding about a dozen green buses under United Nations and Red Crescent supervision.The government and its opponents disagreed over whether the deal amounted to a total surrender. Syrian government officials said the agreement would eventually restore complete state control over the last insurgent foothold in Homs, a major center of the rebellion that began in 2011.But opposition fighters and activists remaining in the neighborhood said the deal allowed the rebels to keep some of their weapons until the government fulfills other terms of the agreement, especially the release of 5,000 detainees and information about the whereabouts of hundreds more people who have disappeared. It is far from certain that will ever happen, given the large numbers involved and the rocky track record of previous attempted truces.01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000IndonesiaEstimated number of jihadist fighters from top-source countries.KyrgyzstanEgyptLibyaJune 2014December 2015BritainGermanyLebanonMoroccoFranceJordanTurkeyRussiaSaudi ArabiaTunisiaEstimated number of jihadist fightersfrom top-source countries.June 2014Dec. 201501,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000IndonesiaKyrgyzstanEgyptLibyaBritainGermanyLebanonMoroccoFranceJordanTurkeyRussiaSaudi ArabiaTunisia01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,000DEC. 9, 2015
“I don’t consider the agreement surrender,” Mr. Homsi said in the interview. “Waer will preserve its revolutionary character.”AdvertisementThat was because most original Waer residents and people from Homs city will remain, he said, while most of the evacuees will be fighters or trapped civilians who came from other parts of Syria. Checkpoints at the edges of the neighborhood will be overseen by both government and opposition forces, and both sides will have to approve anyone who wants to leave.The arrangement seemed intended to avoid some of the pitfalls of the Old City cease-fire in 2013. Under that deal, all the remaining insurgents in the neighborhood were evacuated to northern Syria with their weapons; 19 months later, the neighborhood remains largely depopulated.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Unlike the leaders of those jihadist groups, the evacuees from Waer were Syrians.Residents familiar with the cease-fire deal said the Islamic State supporters in the besieged neighborhood were working on their own and did not have operational contact with the group’s leadership.Still, Mr. Homsi said, “It is better to evacuate them, since those fighters might negatively affect or screw up the truce, and we don’t want that.”A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Cease-Fire in Syria City Allows Food and Evacuations .
