A Salvadoran judge on Thursday ordered former President Francisco Flores to stand trial over accusations that he diverted $15 million in donations for earthquake victims to his personal and political party accounts during his term from 1999 to 2004. Mr. Flores has been under house arrest since November 2014 on charges of embezzlement and illegal enrichment involving funds that Taiwan donated to support earthquake victims in 2001. The former president has said he gave the money to the proper recipients, but there was no record in the treasury because it was a personal donation. He has not said who received the money. Prosecutors charge that some went to El Salvador’s main conservative party, the Republican National Alliance.A version of this brief appears in print on December 4, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; El Salvador: Ex-President Faces Corruption Trial.
