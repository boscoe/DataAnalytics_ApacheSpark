The lower house earlier voted 515 to 4 in favor.French fighter jets joined the American-led coalition against extremists of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Iraq in 2014 and expanded their mission to Islamic State targets in Syria in September. President François Hollande cited specific threats against French interests stemming from the Islamic State in Syria.The vote came as Mr. Hollande and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany discussed how to combat the group, which has spread its violence to Europe and North Africa.Ms. Merkel indicated her country would do more in the international fight against the Islamic State.“We know that this attack wasn’t just intended for the people of Paris, but for our whole way of life,” she said. Mr. Hollande said it would “be a very good signal in the fight against terrorism” if Germany could do more against the Islamic State. Germany currently provides weapons and training for Kurds fighting the group in Iraq.“If the French president asks me to think about what more we can do, then it’s our task to think about that, and we will act quickly,” Ms. Merkel said, adding that the Islamic State “can’t be convinced with words; it must be fought with military means.”Advertisement
