The United Nations General Assembly’s human rights committee on Thursday adopted a resolution condemning North Korea’s bleak human rights situation and encouraging the Security Council to refer the North to the International Criminal Court. The European Union and Japan, which drafted the document, have been pursuing such resolutions every year. This year, 112 countries voted in support of the nonbinding resolution, while 19 countries voted against it and 50 countries abstained. In a statement, North Korea criticized the resolution and claimed that the United States “and other hostile forces” were behind it. The committee also approved similar resolutions expressing concerns about human rights violations in Iran, Syria and Myanmar. The resolutions now go to the full General Assembly.A version of this brief appears in print on November 20, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: United Nations; Human Rights Committee Condemns North Korea.
