Sotak The Iranian lawyer for Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post reporter incarcerated in Iran for nearly eight months, has requested a five-day release for him starting March 21, the beginning of Iran’s New Year, so he can be with his family, Mr. Rezaian’s brother, Ali, said Thursday at a news conference in Washington. Ali Rezaian also said the lawyer, Leila Ahsan, had not yet been allowed to meet with Mr. Rezaian, a native Californian of Iranian descent, but had been given access to the case files. Iranian officials have not disclosed the nature of the charges but have hinted that they are related to espionage. Advertisement
