ROME — Italian planes have bombed and machine-gunned troops landing on the island of Crete, the high command said today [Nov. 2], and Italian troops were reported proceeding along the Kalamas (Thymais) River valley toward Janina, twenty-five miles within Greek territory. The attack on Crete, the high command said, had visible results, and ‘‘some steamships were struck and docks and material were damaged.’’ Informed quarters believed the troops landing to have been British. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 3, 1940
