The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will extend its observer mission to Ukraine for one year, until March 2016, and may double its size to 1,000 observers, a spokeswoman said Thursday. The monitoring mission to Ukraine was first deployed a year ago after a request from Ukraine. It delivers public reports on fighting between pro-Russian groups and troops loyal to the Ukrainian government as well as on movements on border crossings between Russia and Ukraine. It currently has around 470 civilian monitors on the ground in Ukraine, the spokeswoman said.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
