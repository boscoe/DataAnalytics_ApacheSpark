A satellite image from Dec. 13 shows more than 1,450 tents at the biggest camp, Rukban.According to the United Nations, the number of people in these locations has risen from 4,000 to 12,000 since the beginning of November. Aid workers say the increasing numbers stuck in the area are making hygiene and sanitation worse, and winter temperatures are putting the refugees’ health and safety in jeopardy.500 ftKobaniSYRIATurkeySecure parking for refugees wasbriefly available here a few weeksprior to this image, in 2014.Tel Shair minefieldAbandoned cars1 mile to Kobani500 ftSecure parking for refugees wasbriefly available here a few weeksprior to this image, in 2014.KobaniSYRIATurkeyTel Shair minefield1 mile to KobaniAbandoned carsKobani500 ftTurkeySYRIASecure parking for refugees was briefly available here a few weeks prior to this image, in 2014.Abandoned cars1 mile to KobaniMinefield500 ftSecure parking for refugees was briefly available here a few weeks prior to this image, in 2014.KobaniSYRIATurkeyAbandoned carsMinefieldInternational border1 mile to KobaniSyriaLast year, during the struggle for control in Kobani on Syria’s northern border with Turkey, residents of the region sought alternate routes out of the country. For some, this meant driving through the Tel Shair corridor, an area that has been seeded with landmines for decades. The minefield runs nearly the entire length of the border with Turkey and sits on the Turkish side.2 MilesTurkeyTurkeyAreaof detailTel Shair minefieldAbandoned carsClusters ofstranded carsKobaniMinefieldKobaniInternational borderSYRIAImpact craterfrom unidentified munitionSyria2 MilesTurkeyAreaof detailTel Shair minefieldClusters ofstranded carsKobaniInternational borderSyriaAbandoned carsMinefieldImpact craterfrom unidentified munition2 MilesTurkeyTurkeyAreaof detailTel Shair minefieldAbandoned carsClusters ofstranded carsKobaniMinefieldKobaniInternational borderSYRIAImpact craterfrom unidentified munitionSyriaSatellite images from October and November 2014, just recently added to Google Maps, show several large clusters of cars along 15 miles of the Kobani border region, abandoned as refugees fled the country.
