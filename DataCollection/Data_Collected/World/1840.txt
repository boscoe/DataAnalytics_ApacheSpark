SOFIA, Bulgaria — The possibility that Fuehrer Adolf Hitler may try to extinguish the flames of war in Greece before they spread further into the Balkans was mentioned in diplomatic circles here today [Oct. 29]. The suggestion is based upon the presumption that Premier Benito Mussolini’s recent invasion was undertaken without the knowledge or against the wishes of his Axis partner. Some think Mussolini’s Greek adventure is a bid for the glory and the spoils of war and not entirely in harmony with Hitler’s desire for peace and quiet in the Balkans during his attack on England. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 30, 1940
