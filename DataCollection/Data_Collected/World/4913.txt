Officials in Pakistan said Wednesday that they had not been consulted by anyone in Saudi Arabia before their nation was described as a founding member of a new, 34-country “Islamic military alliance” to fight terrorism announced late Monday night by the Saudi defense minister.Pakistan’s foreign secretary, Aizaz Chaudhry, told reporters in Islamabad that he had asked his ambassador in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, to find out how the error was made. Dawn, the Pakistani daily, reported that another senior official confirmed to the newspaper that the announcement blindsided Pakistan’s government.

A Pakistani senator, Sehar Kamran, who serves on a defense committee and lived in Saudi Arabia for many years, also said she had heard nothing about the alliance until she was called by Reuters to comment on Pakistan’s membership.“This is not the first time that Saudi Arabia has named Pakistan as part of its military alliances without Islamabad’s knowledge and consent,” the Dawn correspondent Baqir Sajjad Syed reported. “The Saudis earlier named Pakistan as part of the coalition that carried out operations in Yemen and a Pakistani flag was displayed at the alliance’s media center. Pakistan later declined to join the Yemen war.”AdvertisementNine months of war between a Saudi-led military coalition and a Yemeni rebel group have left thousands of civilians dead, and appears to have given rise to a new branch of the Islamic State.AdvertisementThe formation of the new, Saudi-led alliance, announced by Mohammed bin Salman, the 30-year-old deputy crown prince who also serves as defense minister, appears to have caught more than one nation off guard.

Hezbollah, which is considered a terrorist group by Saudi Arabia, is part of Lebanon’s national unity government. According to Beirut’s Daily Star, Mr. Salam said that Saudi Arabia considered Islamic State militants the main enemies of the new alliance.Before doubts about the solidity of the new alliance appeared, and led to mockery on social networks, the Saudi initiative was warmly praised at the Republican presidential debate on Tuesday night.
