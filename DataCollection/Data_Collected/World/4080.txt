THE HAGUE — The Hague is teeming to-night [Dec. 4] with joyous crowds after the burial of the last of its Orange Kings, which was, in point of fact, a brilliant pageant. The population, amounting to 183,000, reached this morning to 400,000 by the influx of foreign Princes and their suites, crowds of Belgians, Germans, Luxemburgers and Dutch provincials; 25,000 visitors came from Amsterdam alone, and many spent the night in the streets, finding no lodgings. Many of the streets were decked with tricolor flags, and the balconies and windows were decorated with black hangings. Wooden stands for sightseers were erected in all the streets, in the shop fronts and even on the decks of the barges on the canals, and places were paid for at extraordinary prices. An Englishman gave 300 florins for a window. The procession formed, one mile long, and taking seventy-five minutes to pass a given point, the principal features were the muffled drums, the military bands playing Chopin’s and Handel’s funeral dirges. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 5, 1890
