PARIS — Charles de Gaulle, the most powerful French chief of state since Napoleon I, was reelected to a second term as president of the Fifth Republic yesterday [Dec. 18]. With more than 80 percent of the vote counted, the general led his leftist opponent, François Mitterrand, by a margin of 55 percent to 45. Gen. de Gaulle’s victory came in a runoff election, two weeks after he had failed to gain the absolute margin necessary for reelection against a field of five other candidates. In the Dec. 5 poll, he won 44 percent of the vote against 31 percent for his closest opponent, Mr. Mitterrand. Even before a third of the votes were counted tonight, a spokesman for Mr. Mitterrand, who had the support of the Communist, Socialist, Radical and other leftist parties, said there was no doubt that Gen. de Gaulle had won. What the 75-year-old general will do to enforce or mitigate the controversial policies of his first seven years as president was a matter of wide speculation here and in the international community. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 19, 1965
