Traveling by air is generally very safe, and airplane crashes have been becoming less and less frequent. As Matt Beardmore reported in The Times, there were fewer crashes around the world in 2014 than in any year since 1927, according to the Aircraft Crashes Record Office in Geneva.Even so, the idea of one’s own plane plunging to earth is many people’s worst nightmare, and high-profile accidents always attract significant global interest and prompt second thoughts for some travelers.The crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 in the French Alps this week is the latest aviation disaster to make world headlines, following the mysterious disappearance of one Malaysia Airlines flight, the apparent shooting down of another over eastern Ukraine, and the crash of an AirAsia flight into the Java Sea.How has the news of these events influenced you? Have you changed your travel plans or your attitude about flying?Please leave your thoughts in the comments.
