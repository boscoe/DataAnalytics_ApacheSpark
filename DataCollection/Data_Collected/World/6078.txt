Judge J. Paul Oetken dismissed a class-action lawsuit by Haitians against the United Nations, deeming the organization immune because of treaties. Lawyers for the plaintiffs vowed to appeal. “The court’s decision implies that the U.N. can operate with impunity,” said Beatrice Lindstrom, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, which helped file the lawsuit in October 2013. Two other lawsuits filed by Haitian cholera victims are still pending in American courts. The cholera epidemic, which has killed 8,700 people in Haiti since 2010, has been traced to infected United Nations peacekeepers who were then assigned to the country.Advertisement
