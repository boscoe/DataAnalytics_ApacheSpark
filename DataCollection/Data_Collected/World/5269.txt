The official, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale, said the Sri Lankan government had asked Saudi Arabia to reopen the case, and a Saudi court on Tuesday commuted the sentence to three years in prison. Ms. Atukorale said the woman was provided with a lawyer during the appeal hearing instead of only a translator as she had in her earlier court session. The 45-year-old married woman with two children, who was working as a maid in Saudi Arabia, was sentenced to death by stoning in August. An unmarried Sri Lankan man convicted with her was given a penalty of 100 lashes. Advertisement
