CAIRO — A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia said Friday that it would form a “fact-finding committee” to investigate allegations that coalition warplanes had bombed a clinic in Yemen operated by Doctors Without Borders earlier in the week, injuring nine people, according to a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.Doctors Without Borders said Thursday that it had repeatedly provided the coalition with the clinic’s coordinates before the airstrikes, which occurred on Wednesday morning.The coalition has been fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen since March and controls the airspace over the country. The strikes on Wednesday were the second coalition attack on a Doctors Without Borders medical site in Yemen in less than two months.In a separate statement, Saudi Arabia urged aid agencies to coordinate movements with the coalition and to “remain away from the places where the Houthi militias are present.”A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Yemen: Saudis to Investigate Clinic Raid.
