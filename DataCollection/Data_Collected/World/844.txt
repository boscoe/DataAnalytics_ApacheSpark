KATHMANDU, Nepal — The bodies of 21 people buried by a landslide almost six months ago along one of Nepal’s most popular trekking routes have been recovered, police officials said Monday.The recovery had been hampered by a wall of ice and rock that flattened the village of Langtang when a devastating earthquake struck in April. A team of Nepalese police and army officers retrieved the bodies last week, said Prabin Pokharel, a senior police official in Rasuwa district, which borders China and includes Langtang.The police discovered the remains in August when the snow around the region had melted, but could not retrieve them, partly because of the threat of further landslides during monsoon season, which lasts until September.More than 100 people in Rasuwa are still missing, and the catastrophe at Langtang, one of the worst affected villages in April’s earthquake, left families around the world desperately searching for word of the foreign tourists who had gone trekking there.At least 15 of the bodies were those of Nepalis, whose families identified them in part by their clothing. Officials said the remains of the others would be sent to a forensic lab for testing. More than 600 people were killed in Rasuwa district in the earthquake and its aftermath.A version of this article appears in print on October 13, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Nepal: Bodies Are Recovered From April Landslide.
