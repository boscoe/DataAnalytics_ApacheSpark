The plan called on the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, to prepare proposals for monitoring a cease-fire within a month.The resolution, however, skirted many of the most delicate issues, including the future of President Bashar al-Assad and which opposition members would be considered acceptable negotiating partners.Advertisement
