Abdel Rahman Sharah, a security official in Kafr el Sheikh.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing, which fit a pattern of attacks by militants who have killed hundreds of soldiers, police officers and members of the state security forces over the last 18 months.The attacks have increased in recent weeks, with most of them occurring in the northern Sinai Peninsula, a hotbed of insurgency against the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. At least 12 people were killed in attacks on Sunday that included the bombing of a police station.Advertisement
