The person had returned to Canada from China on Jan. 12 and is recovering from the illness in self-isolation, said the Public Health Agency of Canada. Gregory Taylor, Canada’s chief public health officer, said that the risk to Canadians was “very low because there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H7N9.” The H7N9 virus passes between birds, but experts say there is not enough evidence to prove that it passes between humans. Most cases report contact with poultry, usually in live poultry markets, the Canadian health agency said. The virus first infected three people in China in 2013. In 2014, it infected 453 people, killing 175 of them, said the World Health Organization. Advertisement
