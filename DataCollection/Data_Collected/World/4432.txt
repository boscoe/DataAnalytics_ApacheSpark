HOUSTON, Tex. — On Gemini-7, the medical doctors are figuratively sitting in the astronauts’ laps. Short of going along for the ride, they are attempting to monitor by radio the two men’s vital functions in great detail for 14 days. More than any other manned flight in the American program, Gemini-7 is focusing on the human reaction to prolonged exposure to weightlessness, confinement and the psychological pressure of flying in orbit. ‘‘We don’t think someone will come down with jellied bones,’’ Dr. Charles Berry, the chief flight surgeon, said before the flight. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 11, 1965
