CAIRO — An explosion outside a central courthouse killed two people and injured at least nine others on Monday, extending a series of small bombings around Cairo. Security officials said most of those injured were policemen.A little-known group calling itself Revolutionary Punishment claimed responsibility for the blast and warned of more attacks to come, but the Twitter messages it used to make the claim included old photos of damage from a different explosion, casting doubt on its credibility. The bomb on Monday, planted in a lamppost, broke windows but otherwise did only minimal damage to the courthouse.Since the military ousted President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, Islamist militants have killed hundreds of soldiers and police officers in a campaign of attacks on the security forces that took part in the takeover, with most of the violence concentrated in the North Sinai.In recent months however, Revolutionary Punishment and another new and allied group, the Popular Resistance Movement, have claimed responsibility for an escalating series of small bombing and arson attacks aimed at businesses as well as police stations around Cairo and elsewhere. Their specific ideology is unclear, although statements from the Popular Resistance Movement suggest Islamist leanings.The Popular Resistance Movement claimed responsibility for six bombings in two hours in the Giza district outside Cairo last Thursday; one person was killed and at least nine were injured. On Sunday, another bomb near a police station on the Nile in the tourist center of Aswan in southern Egypt killed two people. It was unclear if any group had claimed responsibility for that blast.The Egyptian government is seeking to project calm and confidence before a state-sponsored investment conference in Sharm el-Sheikh this month, and the official response to the latest bombings was muted.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
