He won that term in July in an election that nearly every opposition party boycotted.The dangers were starkly underlined last week when 87 people were reported killed in clashes in the capital, Bujumbura, after opposition attacks on military bases. Some were found shot with their hands tied behind their backs.That spike in violence prompted the United States government on Sunday to advise Americans to leave Burundi as soon as possible.Despite fears that the bloodshed could ignite wider ethnic conflagration in the region, only one African country, Ghana, supported the American request on Monday for a special session of the rights council, but Mr. Harper said he was confident that more would support the resolution.Among those expected to attend the session is the human rights advocate Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa, an outspoken opponent of Mr. Nkurunziza’s third term. Mr. Mbonimpa was shot in the head and neck in August, apparently in an assassination attempt, and moved to Belgium for treatment.His son-in-law, Pascal Nshirimana, was killed in Bujumbura in October, and his son, Welly Nzitonda, was found shot dead last month shortly after his reported arrest.Advertisement
