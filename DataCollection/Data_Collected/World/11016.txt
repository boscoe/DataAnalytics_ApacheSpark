Iran has said Sunni militants based in Pakistan have staged attacks in Iran. Pakistan has asked for more evidence and sought assurances of greater border cooperation.Pakistan has accused the Iranians of entering Pakistani territory at least twice last year, and it has protested mortar attacks by Iranian forces.The situation along the border has added to the security concerns of Pakistan, which also faces tensions with its northwestern neighbor, Afghanistan, and with India to the east.Advertisement
