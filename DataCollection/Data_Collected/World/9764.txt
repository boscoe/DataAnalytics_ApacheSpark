Ulla Brehm, a spokeswoman for the Gothenburg Police Department, said the shootings took place on the island community of Hesingen, an area with a history of “difficulties with youth gangs, drugs and violent criminals.” She said two people died in the shooting and several more were wounded and taken to hospitals. Ms. Brehm added that there was “nothing indicating that this was terrorism at all. Not at all.” The police said the shooting occurred around 10 p.m. in a popular local restaurant called Var Krog och Bar, which means “our tavern and bar” in Swedish, that is on a bustling square.
