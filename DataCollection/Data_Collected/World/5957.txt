SHANGHAI —  Nearly a week after a stampede killed at least 36 people and injured 49 others during an outdoor New Year’s Eve gathering in one of this city’s most popular tourist spots, a solemn memorial service was held here Tuesday morning.Friends and relatives of the victims were among those who came to bow, mourn and place flowers in Chen Yi Square, where people were crushed to death at about 11:35 p.m. after a huge crowd that had massed there panicked and pushed, creating a wave of pressure.The victims were mostly people in their 20s and 30s, a majority of them women who had come to Shanghai to work or study. The youngest victim was 12. China’s longstanding one-child policy means that many of the parents of the victims are now childless.The BundChen YiSquareChen Yi SquarePudongDISTRICTZhongshan RoadShanghaiShanghaiTowerHUANGPUDISTRICTHuangpuRiver BeijingchinaShanghai1/2 mileAlthough it is unclear what caused the panic and stampede, the city authorities have been accused of failing to manage or control the crowds at the riverfront Bund area. In the days after the accident, the police acknowledged that too few officers had been on patrol in the area, despite warnings in previous years about the size and unruliness of the crowds that showed up for New Year’s Eve countdowns and entertainment.AdvertisementThe authorities now say that most outdoor shows had been canceled in the days before New Year’s Eve but that tens of thousands of people still jammed the riverfront promenade, expecting to celebrate with light shows and a midnight countdown.AdvertisementIn the aftermath, the government has placed strict controls on news coverage of the stampede, censoring or limiting accounts, apparently in the belief that it is an embarrassment for Shanghai, China’s wealthiest and most advanced city. The authorities have also tried to prevent the families of victims from talking to journalists.The memorial service on Tuesday was heavily guarded by police officers, and the families of many victims were escorted into a mourning zone to pay their respects and place flowers. Medical personnel were on hand with wheelchairs and stretchers.Some relatives carried a large black-and-white photograph of one of the victims. Others burned paper money. One mourner was so overcome that she had to be carried away on a stretcher.Phoebe Peng contributed research.
