NEW YORK — A young student who once tried to become a Trappist monk set himself on fire in front of the United Nations here today [Nov. 9] screaming that he was against all wars. Police said Roger Laporte, 22, identified as a student and part-time volunteer for the Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist organization, was in critical condition in Bellevue Hospital with burns over his entire body. Last rites were administered after Mr. Laporte expressed repentance over his violation of the Roman Catholic Church’s strict religious credo against suicide. It was the second incident of its kind in a week. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 10, 1965
