A suicide bomber set off explosives in a Shiite mosque in southwest Pakistan on Thursday, killing at least 10 people and wounding several others, a government official said. The attack took place in the district of Sibi, about 120 miles southeast of Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan Province, said the official, Sarfraz Bugti, the provincial home minister. Six children were among those killed, Mr. Bugti said. The bomber, a man, was wearing a woman’s head-to-toe burqa to deceive guards, Mr. Bugti said. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but Sunni extremists have been blamed for similar attacks.A version of this brief appears in print on October 23, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Pakistan: Bombing at Mosque Kills at Least 10 People.
