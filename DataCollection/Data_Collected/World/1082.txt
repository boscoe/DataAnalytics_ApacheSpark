Maiduguri, a city that is the birthplace of the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram, has been hit by a series of bombings, exacting a terrible toll among civilians. The attack on Friday — described by civilian defense fighters, the National Emergency Management Agency and witnesses — came just hours after two bombs exploded near a mosque in Maiduguri, killing at least 30 people. Twenty people were wounded in that attack, some critically, said the emergency agency’s northeast Nigeria coordinator, Muhammed Kanar. The military and troops from neighboring countries have pushed the extremists from strongholds this year, but attacks by Boko Haram have continued. Advertisement
