The company, Oi, said it had cut the lines after the state government racked up $55.7 million in unpaid Internet and telephone bills due over three years ago. As Rio de Janeiro State pays for a number of large infrastructure projects in time for the Olympics, its tax revenue has fallen along with a drop in the price of oil. The cuts to the lines do not affect vital services like fire protection, schools or hospitals, Oi said. A spokesman for the state government contested the debt figure and said Oi also owed the state money. Advertisement
