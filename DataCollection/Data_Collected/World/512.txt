On Sept. 28, coalition warplanes bombed wedding tents on the Yemen’s Red Sea coast, killing at least 70 people.Saudi Arabia launched a military offensive in March against rebels known as the Houthis after they drove the Saudi-backed government from power. As war has spread throughout the country, more than 2,355 civilians have been killed — the majority of them in coalition airstrikes, human rights workers say.The airstrikes on Wednesday were in Dhamar Province, about 50 miles south of Sana, the capital, on the house of Muhammed al-Sanabani, said a cousin, Tawfiq al-Sanabani, who was nearby. Three of Muhammed al-Sanabani’s sons were to be married in a joint ceremony on Wednesday night, the cousin said. The airstrikes occurred just as the brides had arrived at the house. At least one of the sons was killed in the attack, Mr. Sanabani said.“I saw bodies lying in the yard, decapitated, charred,” he said. Safwan al-Ansi, the chief of the emergency department at the Dhamar health office, said that 23 people had been killed but that more bodies were still under the rubble of the house. Mr. Sanabani said he did not know why the house had been targeted.Shuaib Almosawa reported from Sana, and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.Advertisement
