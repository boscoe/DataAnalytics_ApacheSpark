SURABAYA, Indonesia — The search for remnants of the AirAsia jet that crashed in the Java Sea turned up little on Thursday, and an Indonesian official said finding the plane could take another week, but more bodies were reported to have been found on Friday.Recovery efforts were halted Thursday afternoon because of poor weather and rough seas, with no sign yet of the plane’s fuselage. But The Associated Press reported that more ships arrived on Friday with sensitive equipment.On Thursday, the head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, Bambang Soelistyo, said in Jakarta that the bodies of nine of the 162 people who had been aboard Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 had been recovered. Six had been sent to Jakarta; two were in Pangkalan Bun, close to the site of the crash; and one remained aboard a navy ship. One of the deceased was a flight attendant, Khairunnisa Haidar Fauzi, 22.The discovery of seven more bodies was announced Friday morning, six of them found by a United States Navy ship, said Suryadi B. Supriyadi, operation coordinator for the search and rescue agency, bringing the total to 16.

The jet crashed in stormy weather on Sunday morning on a flight from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore.Advertisement“I’m optimistic it can be found within a few days,” said Antonius Toos Sanitioso, an air safety investigator with Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, “but it could take at least a week.”AdvertisementSearch crews found what was thought to be the plane’s emergency slide on Thursday.Officials were taking DNA samples from passengers’ relatives to help identify the bodies.It remains unclear why the plane, an Airbus A320, crashed about 40 minutes after takeoff on Sunday. Shortly before contact was lost with the plane, the pilot asked permission to change course to avoid stormy weather.Mr. Sanitioso said the main priority for investigators was to find the plane’s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder. The recorders emit electronic pings, but no signals have been detected.A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Rough Seas Halt Search for Jet; Data Recorders Are Still Missing.
