Canada’s involvement in the operation, which began last October, was scheduled to last just six months and has consisted of airstrikes against the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Iraq and the use of troops for training and support in Iraq. Mr. Harper said that he wanted to extend the air force’s role to include strikes on targets in Syria. Opposition lawmakers say that Mr. Harper did not fully reveal the extent of the ground troops’ role last year. The criticism increased this month after Kurdish forces mistakenly killed a Canadian military adviser in Iraq. Opposition leaders said that they did not support the extension, but Mr. Harper’s Conservatives hold a majority in the House of Commons. Advertisement
