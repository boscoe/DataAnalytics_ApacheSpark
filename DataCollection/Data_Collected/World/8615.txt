The United States Embassy in Jordan on Wednesday warned American citizens to avoid high-end shopping malls in Amman, the capital, because of credible threats of terrorist attacks. The embassy’s statement contained no information about the type or timing of any possible attack, but it advised Americans in the country and embassy employees and their families to avoid the malls in the next few days. “Extremist groups have repeatedly expressed interest in attacking so-called soft targets, such as malls and restaurants in Jordan,” it said. The spokesman for Jordan’s government, Mohammad Momani, said security measures had already been stepped up because of “regional events.” Jordan is taking part in the campaign against the Islamic State group, which recently killed a captured Jordanian pilot and released a video showing his grisly death.A version of this brief appears in print on February 26, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Jordan: U.S. Warns of Threat to Malls.
