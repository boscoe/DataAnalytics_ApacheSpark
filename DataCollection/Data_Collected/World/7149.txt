The Ministry of Justice had accused Memorial of structuring its organization in violation of its own charter. The judge threw out the lawsuit on Thursday after the Justice Ministry said Memorial had rectified the charter violation. In a separate case, Memorial is challenging a decision by the ministry to register it as a foreign agent, a term defined under a 2012 law as a nongovernmental organization that receives foreign funds and engages in politics.
