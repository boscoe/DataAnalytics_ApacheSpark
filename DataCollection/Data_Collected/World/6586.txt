A leader of a Christian militia who has been implicated in attacks on civilians throughout the country has been arrested by United Nations peacekeepers, the country’s senior prosecutor said Sunday. The commander, Rodrigue Ngaibona, was arrested in Bouca, 195 miles north of the capital, Bangui, on Saturday, said the prosecutor, Maurice Dibert-Dollet. The Central African Republic was plunged into chaos when a mostly Muslim rebel alliance seized power in the majority Christian country in 2013. Abuses under the rebels’ brief rule spawned a backlash from a Christian militia. An arrest warrant was issued last May linking Mr. Ngaibona to murders, rapes and looting.A version of this brief appears in print on January 19, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Central African Republic: Peacekeepers Arrest a Christian Militia Commander.
