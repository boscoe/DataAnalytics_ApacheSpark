A British nurse who recovered from Ebola has been hospitalized again for treatment of what the Royal Free Hospital described as an unusual late complication. The nurse, Pauline Cafferkey, was in the hospital’s isolation unit, and her condition was described as serious. In December, tests showed that Ms. Cafferkey had Ebola after returning from Sierra Leone. She was treated at the Royal Free and discharged in January. Early Friday, she was flown to London from Scotland, where she lives. Medical authorities say the risk of her transmitting the virus is low, but public health officials in Scotland are monitoring people with whom she had close contact. Experts say there is mounting evidence that the mental and physical health problems in Ebola survivors can last for years after the virus is cleared from the bloodstream.A version of this brief appears in print on October 10, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Britain: After Recovering From Ebola, Nurse Is Hospitalized Again in London.
