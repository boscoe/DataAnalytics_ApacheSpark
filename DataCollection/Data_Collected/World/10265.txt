ISTANBUL — A website popular with jihadists that has been used to recruit Turks to the Islamic State was blocked by a court here on Wednesday, after years of publishing extreme Islamist content and evading Turkey’s strict Internet regulations.The court said that the website, Takva Haber, and its affiliate video website, Takva Tube, were spreading “terror propaganda” in violation of the country’s antiterrorism laws.The decision came amid criticism  of the government for blocking access to a number of websites, including those of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and of an atheist association, while permitting sites that promote Islamist extremism to operate freely.Before the court order went into effect on Wednesday, Takva Haber moved to redirect traffic to its site to a new address.A look at how governments around the world have been dealing with citizens turning jihadists.“The court of the infidel order has shut down our site that we have dedicated our days and nights to,” read a statement on the site. “Before the decision is enforced we have decided to move our website to enfalmedya.com.”AdvertisementIt was not immediately clear whether the new website would also be blocked.Tevhid Magazine, a site that promulgates the messages of Ebu Hanzala, a Turkish Salafist cleric who has been referred to as the “spiritual leader” of the Islamic State in Turkey, continues to operate.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The sentences were later changed to fines.AdvertisementAt least 105 people have been prosecuted for insulting the president in the past seven months.A version of this article appears in print on March 26, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Europe; Turkey: Court Blocks a Jihadist Website.
