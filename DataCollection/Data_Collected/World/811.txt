PARIS — The United States will soon hand back to France a small but significant number of installations, probably including several airfields which it has been utilizing since the early 1950s, it was learned today [Oct. 13]. At the same time, it is understood that the Department of Defense in Washington has now prepared detailed studies for a complete withdrawal of United States forces from France. The studies also foresee the relocation of various allied headquarters in other NATO nations, should this eventually become necessary as a result of President Charles de Gaulle’s policies. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 14, 1965
