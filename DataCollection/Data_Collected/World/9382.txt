SEOUL, South Korea — A Korean Air flight attendant who said she was abused by an airline vice president in what became internationally known as a case of  “nut rage” has filed suit in New York against the airline and the former executive, who is serving a prison sentence in South Korea.The flight attendant, Kim Do-hee, said she was verbally and physically assaulted by the executive, Cho Hyun-ah, after serving her a bag of macadamia nuts on a South Korea-bound flight that was taxiing at Kennedy International Airport on Dec. 5. Ms. Cho, who said the nuts should have been served on a plate, ordered the plane back to its gate so Ms. Kim’s supervisor could be removed.Ms. Cho, whose father is Korean Air’s chairman, lost her job and became an object of international scorn after the episode. Last month, a South Korean court convicted her of violating aviation safety law and sentenced her to a year in prison.Ms. Kim’s lawsuit, filed Monday in State Supreme Court in Queens, seeks to hold Ms. Cho “civilly responsible for the extensive damage that she has caused to Ms. Kim’s career, reputation and emotional well-being,” according to a statement released Tuesday by her lawyers. The suit also alleges that Ms. Kim was pressured to lie to South Korean regulators about the incident and to appear in public with Ms. Cho as part of an effort to rehabilitate her public image.The statement did not say how much Ms. Kim was seeking in damages.A Korean Air spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the suit. Ms. Kim still works for the airline, he added.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
