BO WATERSIDE, Liberia —  Fatu Momolu, a middle-age vendor of cold drinks, danced gleefully on Sunday back and forth across the border, an imaginary line that for the last seven months had turned all too real, severing Liberia from Sierra Leone and Ms. Momolu from much of her family.She threw her head and hands skyward as she raced from one end of the 100-yard bridge over the Mano River to the other and then back again, taking the president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, at her word that the country would lift its midnight curfew and reopen its borders.The gates were sealed in late July to try to limit the spread of the Ebola virus, which had broken out in several West African nations and was rapidly claiming lives. But the outbreak has waned now, with only a trickle of new cases reported in recent weeks.“Liberians are happy!” Ms. Momolu exclaimed at the border crossing. “We are free! Ebola is finished here!”
                The men and women of one Ebola clinic in rural Liberia reflect on life inside the gates.            But the running and dancing turned out to be premature. It takes two governments to reopen a sealed border, and the Sierra Leonean authorities on the far side of the river said grimly on Sunday that they had received no instructions to do so.AdvertisementA Sierra Leonean soldier whipped the air with a wooden stick to punctuate the point. Liberians like Ms. Momolu would have to go back across the river. Sierra Leoneans would have to stay put, herded behind nail-spiked wooden planks. Even though the rusty gates on the Liberian side were wide open, no one would be passing through today.AdvertisementA planned reopening ceremony at the Mano River bridge, the principal crossing between the two countries, turned into a meeting for local Liberian police, immigration and government officials to complain to one another about the resources they lacked: thermometers to screen travelers, facilities to isolate those who may be ill, hand washing stations to ward off infection, patrol vehicles to catch people trying to sneak across the border.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Paasewe, said he had come to the border to execute the president’s order, even as he hoped the Sierra Leoneans would not follow suit right away. He pressed immigration officials about whether they were prepared for the flow of travelers to resume on such short notice, and stressed that while his county had not seen a confirmed new case in nearly six weeks, “one case of Ebola is an epidemic.”“It takes one person that we do not check, it takes one person we let go without questioning, to reverse all of our gains,” he added. “We cannot afford to go back to where we are coming from.”Neither, for the moment, can people like Ms. Momolu go much of anywhere else.A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Liberia Lifts Its Curfew, but Border Stays Sealed.
