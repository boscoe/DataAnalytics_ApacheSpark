The former spy, a 32-year-old man identified only as Markus R. because of German privacy laws, made the confession at the opening of his trial in Munich’s state court. The defendant, who worked for Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, BND, is accused of passing material to the C.I.A. between 2008 and 2014. Prosecutors say he was paid $102,000 for the documents, which were reported to include lists of current and former German agents working internationally, along with their aliases. Advertisement
