The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid al-Hussein of Jordan, publicly appealed to Saudi Arabia on Thursday to halt the flogging of a blogger sentenced to 1,000 blows, 10 years’ imprisonment and a large fine for creating a website that contained criticism of the country’s religious establishment. The first 50 blows were given to the blogger, Raif Badawi, last Friday. Prince Zeid made the appeal on the eve of the second in a series of floggings, which are to be administered every Friday until all 1,000 blows with a cane have been completed. “Flogging is, in my view, at the very least, a form of cruel and inhuman punishment,” Prince Zeid said in a statement on his office’s website. He reminded the Saudis that the United Nations considers flogging a form of torture. As of Thursday evening, there was no indication that the authorities planned to halt the punishment, which has been widely condemned around the world.A version of this brief appears in print on January 16, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Saudi Arabia: U.N.
