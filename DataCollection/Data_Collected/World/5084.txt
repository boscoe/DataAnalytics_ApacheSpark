Sundayâ€™s landslide is not the first man-made disaster to affect China this year. In August, a large warehouse storing toxic chemicals exploded in the northern port city of Tianjin, killing more than 100 people and injuring hundreds more. A Times investigation later found a pattern of unsafe practices in storing such chemicals at other locations in China.
