Dorothee Ott, spokeswoman for the Bavarian Office for Historical Conservation, said the pretzel fragments went on display this week at the Regensburg Historical Museum. Ms. Ott said the pretzels and other baked goods found were badly burned, which is why they survived over the centuries. Archaeologists say they believe they were discarded from a bakery that was once on the site. Carbon dating places their creation between 1700 and 1800. Taking into account about 15 percent shrinkage, Ms. Ott said, “It’s a normal pretzel, maybe a little smaller than today.” Advertisement
