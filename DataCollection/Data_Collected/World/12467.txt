Gen. Mohammad Eid, who oversees arms supplies for the Syrian Army. Al Manar, the news channel of the Syrian government’s ally Hezbollah, said an attempt to assassinate him with a motorcycle bomb had failed.A look at the conflict that has dismembered Syria and inflamed the region with one of the world’s worst religious and sectarian wars.The conflict in Syria, which began with protests against President Bashar al-Assad and turned into war, has heated up in recent weeks. Insurgents are making new gains in the north and south, with the government accelerating bombing campaigns in insurgent-held districts in the northern cities of Aleppo and Idlib, and in the Damascus suburbs. On Sunday in Aleppo, for instance, videos posted by antigovernment activists showed distraught parents pulling the bodies of children from a school that residents said was hit by a bomb dropped from a government helicopter. On Monday, doctors in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, said one of its largest hospitals, Al Sakhour, had suspended operations after being hit repeatedly in government airstrikes. In Damascus, residents described a chaotic scene that erupted as people were heading to work. Abu Mohammad, 45, a government employee giving only a nickname for his safety, said he heard a blast, then gunfire, and saw black smoke.Peering out his building’s gate, he said, he saw uniformed soldiers and what appeared to be plainclothes security officers running with guns, calling on people to stay indoors, and closing roads as gunfire continued.Antigovernment sites said two bombs were planted, that the general was taken to a military hospital and that one of his bodyguards was killed. A pro-government radio station reported that insurgents had crossed an agricultural area from insurgent-held suburbs to the scene of the attack near Berniah Street, a major thoroughfare.The area is near the suburb of Barzeh, where insurgents and government forces have largely maintained a locally agreed upon cease-fire for more than a year.Hwaida Saad and Maher Samaan contributed reporting from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.Advertisement
