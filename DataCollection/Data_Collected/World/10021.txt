The United States, South Korea and Japan have been deeply skeptical about resuming negotiations with North Korea unless it shows a willingness to bargain away its nuclear weapons, while the North insists on talks without conditions.Analysts and officials in the region fear that while the six-nation talks are suspended, North Korea may be progressing toward building nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto its missiles. North Korea is also believed to be increasing its stockpile of nuclear fuel through a newly disclosed uranium enrichment program, as well as through its recently restarted reactor that produces plutonium.“We agreed to continue to exert our joint efforts to urgently stop the advancement of North Korea’s nuclear weapons capabilities and resume talks that can make concrete progress toward the denuclearization of North Korea,” Mr. Yun said during a joint news conference with his Chinese and Japanese counterparts.In their statement, the three foreign ministers said they hoped their meeting in Seoul, which was intended to try to improve ties that have been strained by territorial and historical disputes, would open “a path for restoring a cooperative system” among the three neighbors. To that end, they said they would try to resume a three-way meeting “at an early date.”The three countries’ foreign ministers began holding annual talks in 2007, which led to annual trilateral meetings beginning in 2008. But both forums were suspended after the 2012 meeting as persistent regional tensions worsened, notably over competing Chinese and Japanese claims to islands in the East China Sea.Highly emotional disputes rooted in the countries’ bitter 20th-century history — before its defeat in World War II, Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony and occupied parts of China — have created rifts that the three governments have tried to mend only in fits and starts over the years.In addition to the territorial disputes — South Korea and Japan have their own, over a different group of islets — both Beijing and Seoul say that Japan has not fully renounced its past militarism.In their joint statement, the three foreign ministers simply said they would continue to try to resolve their disputes “in a spirit of looking squarely at history.”Advertisement
