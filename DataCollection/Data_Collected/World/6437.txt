The former candidate, Biram Dah Abeid, was arrested in November. His lawyer said the convictions were for disturbing public order and belonging to an unrecognized organization. A researcher for Amnesty International in West Africa, Gaetan Mootoo, said: “The intensifying crackdown on antislavery activists in Mauritania has no legal justification and is symptomatic of the government’s lack of respect for human rights.” The police used tear gas to disperse hundreds of protesters who had gathered outside the courtroom, in the southern town of Rosso, local sources said. Mauritania was the last country to formally abolish slavery, in 1981. It still has the highest prevalence worldwide of slavery per capita, according to the Global Slavery Index. Advertisement
