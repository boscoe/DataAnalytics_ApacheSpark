President Juan Manuel Santos apologized Friday for Colombia’s actions during a 1985 army raid on the Supreme Court in which nearly 100 people were killed after the building was taken hostage by guerrillas of the M-19 rebel movement. Mr. Santos was acting in accordance with a ruling last year by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights condemning the state for the disappearance of 12 people, most of them cafeteria workers, who were taken alive from the building during the standoff. The apology comes after advances in the investigation of the siege.A version of this brief appears in print on November 7, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Colombia: Apology for Army Raid.
