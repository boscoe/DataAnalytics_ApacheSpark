With people rallying across Turkey over a brutal attack on a young student, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday denounced violence against women as the country’s “bleeding wound.” The police say the woman, Ozgecan Aslan, 20, was taking a minibus home in the southeastern province of Mersin last Wednesday when a man tried to rape her, according to Turkish news reports. When she retaliated with pepper spray, she was stabbed and beaten with an iron bar, her body then burned and dumped in a river. A 26-year-old man has been arrested with two accomplices, Hurriyet Daily News reported. Prosecutors were not available for comment, and the police gave no more details. Mr. Erdogan vowed in Ankara, “I will personally follow the case so that they will be given the heaviest penalty.” He added, “Violence against women is the bleeding wound of our country.” A human rights group, Bianet, says 281 women were murdered in Turkey in 2014, a 31 percent increase over 2013.A version of this brief appears in print on February 17, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Turkey: President Condemns Violence Against Women After Student’s Killing.
