KABUL, Afghanistan —  A crowded hospital in the embattled city of Kunduz that treats war wounded came under attack on Saturday and the American military acknowledged that it may have killed 19 patients, staff members and others at the facility while firing on insurgents nearby.The attack, which the military said in a statement might have been “collateral damage” that occurred while engaging militants, drew a fierce international outcry. The head of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, condemned it and called for a “thorough and impartial investigation.” It also renewed scrutiny of the United States military’s record of causing civilian casualties, which has alienated the Afghan public and often undermined relations with the government here.At least 12 staff members and seven patients — including three children — were killed when the hospital, run by Doctors Without Borders, was badly damaged in the airstrike early Saturday in Kunduz. At least 37 were wounded, and some were flown to Kabul for treatment.The United States military, in a statement, confirmed an airstrike at 2:15 a.m., saying that it had been targeting individuals “who were threatening the force” and that “there may have been collateral damage to a nearby medical facility.”AdvertisementOne American official, who requested anonymity to discuss early reports of an event now under official investigation, said the attack may have been carried out by an American AC-130 gunship that was supporting Special Operations forces on the ground in Kunduz. The top United States commander in Afghanistan, Gen. John F. Campbell, said that American troops had come under fire in the vicinity of the hospital and that an investigation into the airstrike had begun.AdvertisementPresident Obama issued a statement offering condolences to the victims in what he called “the tragic incident” in Kunduz. However, noting the Defense Department investigation, he said “we will await the results of that inquiry before making a definitive judgment as to the circumstances of this tragedy.”KunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceA hospitalrun by Doctors Without Borderswas hit inan airstrike.KunduzReportedTaliban presenceAmerican forces conducted airstrikes near Kunduz airport.Hospital hit in airstrike150 metersKunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceA hospital run by Doctors Without Borders was hit in an airstrike.KunduzReportedTaliban presenceAmerican forces also conducted airstrikes near Kunduz airport.Hospital hit in airstrike150 metersKunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceA hospitalrun by DoctorsWithout Borderswas hit inan airstrike.KunduzReportedTaliban presenceAmerican forces also conducted airstrikes near Kunduz airport.Hospital hit in airstrike150 metersKunduzAfghanistanReportedTaliban presenceKunduzHospital hit in airstrikeReportedTaliban presenceHospital hit in airstrike Kunduz airport
