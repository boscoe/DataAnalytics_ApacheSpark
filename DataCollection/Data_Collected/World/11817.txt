The state asked the ministry to investigate the trust for “disturbing the communal harmony here and carrying out antinational propaganda against India in foreign countries,” according to the Press Trust of India.The founder of the Sabrang Trust, Teesta Setalvad, and her husband have been accused of embezzling funds meant for a museum in Ahmedabad to honor victims of the sectarian riots in Gujarat in 2002. Those riots left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims.The Ford Foundation wrote in a statement on Thursday that it had had no communications from the Ministry of Home Affairs, but had been told by the Finance Ministry that the “Ministry of Home Affairs is reviewing information related to their ongoing investigation” of Sabrang. The foundation said last week that it was cooperating with the police investigation of the trust.“We are confident in our work and compliance with the law and look forward to the outcome of this inquiry,” the foundation said Thursday.Indian organizations that receive funds from abroad have been on alert over recent actions against Greenpeace India. The Indian government blocked the Greenpeace group on April 9 from receiving foreign funds, saying that it had violated the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. An activist working for Greenpeace India was prevented in January  from boarding a flight to Britain, where she was scheduled to brief a parliamentary committee on mining activities in central India.Advertisement
