Speaking to the General Assembly, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon noted that Liberia had progressed rapidly over the past month and was now reporting fewer than five new cases per week. But new cases have generally been increasing in Guinea and Sierra Leone in recent weeks, and Mr. Ban said that more than half of the newly infected people in those two countries had not been in contact with people known to have been infected. “This reminds us that setbacks can quickly follow apparent gains,” he said. Dr. David Nabarro, appointed by Mr. Ban to lead the United Nations anti-Ebola effort, also spoke to the General Assembly and expressed concern about unsafe burials of Ebola victims, considered a major source of new transmissions. He said an Ebola-infected corpse, not handled safely, could spread the virus to as many as 30 others.
