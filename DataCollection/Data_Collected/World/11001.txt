ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A Pakistani court on Tuesday ordered criminal charges to be filed against a former C.I.A. station chief and a former C.I.A. lawyer over a 2009 drone strike that killed two people.Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui of the Islamabad High Court issued his decision during a hearing for a contempt of court petition. The petition was about a 2014 case that sought to have criminal charges filed against the former C.I.A. station chief in Islamabad, Jonathan Bank, and a former C.I.A. lawyer, John A. Rizzo, for their roles in directing drone attacks in the country’s northwestern tribal regions.A resident of the North Waziristan tribal region, Kareem Khan, who claims that his brother and a son died in a drone strike in 2009 in North Waziristan, had threatened to sue the Central Intelligence Agency over the deaths.Mr. Bank left the country in 2010 after his cover was blown.Police officials in Islamabad have been reluctant to file criminal charges against the Americans, fearful that it would further harm the already troubled relationship with the United States. A civil judge in 2013 dismissed Mr. Khan’s application to charge C.I.A. officials, saying that the court lacked jurisdiction in the matter.Last year, Mr. Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Islamabad police for failing to press criminal charges against the American officials.American drone strikes are extremely unpopular in Pakistan, where they are viewed as a breach of the country’s sovereignty. Human rights activists have also criticized the strikes, claiming that they have resulted in a large number of civilian casualties.A version of this article appears in print on April 8, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Pakistan: Judge Wants Charges Filed Against 2 Former Officials of the C.I.A.
