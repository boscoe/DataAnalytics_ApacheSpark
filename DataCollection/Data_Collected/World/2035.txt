WASHINGTON — There’s no other way to phrase it: the Gemini-7 astronauts plan to spend ten days in orbit in GI underwear. If their funnel-shaped Gemini spacecraft doesn’t spring a leak, Air Force Maj. Frank Borman and his co-pilot, Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Lovell, intend to doff their silver spacesuits and continue the 14-day flight in regulation Air Force long johns. Long practiced by Russian cosmonauts, the so-called ‘‘shirt-sleeve’’ flight was not to become a part of the U.S. space program until the three-man Apollo spacecraft begin flying in 1967. Behind the change in plans is the absolute confidence that Gemini’s pressure hull will not expose the astronauts to the vacuum of space. If it did collide with a meteoroid or suffered explosive decompression for some other reason, the astronauts would pass out in less than a minute. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 2, 1965
