ST. PETERSBURG — The trial of Nihilists, which is at present proceeding before a special section of the Senate, sitting as a District Court of St. Petersburg, will probably last until the end of the year, for the prisoners are numerous, having been arrested on different grounds at different times since the early part of the current year. They are being tried in parties of five. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 10, 1890
