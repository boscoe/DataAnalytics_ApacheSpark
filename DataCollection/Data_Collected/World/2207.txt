Two prominent journalists were arrested Monday, as the head of the judiciary dismissed international condemnation of what appears to be a crackdown on writers and artists. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps arrested Isa Saharkhiz, an independent journalist, on charges of insulting the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and of “propaganda against the regime,” his son, Mehdi, said in a telephone interview. Also arrested was Ehsan Mazandarani, the managing director of the newspaper Farikhtegan, who faced security charges, according to the Tasnim news agency. Staff members at the newspaper confirmed the arrest. The arrests came after two Iranian poets and a filmmaker were sentenced to long prison terms and lashes last month on charges that included “insulting sanctities and propaganda against the state.” Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, the head of Iran’s judiciary, told the state news agency IRNA, “Tehran will never surrender to the human rights as interpreted by the West.”A version of this brief appears in print on November 3, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Two Journalists Are Arrested.
