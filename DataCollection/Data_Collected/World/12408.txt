Vanessa Bale, who works at the Gazelle International Hotel in Kokopo in New Britain, said that she felt the earthquake and that pots containing plants had broken, but that the three-story hotel had not sustained any structural damage. She added that no one had been injured. The United States Geological Survey, which originally said the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.4 but later updated the figure, said its center was about 81 miles south of Kokopo, in the Solomon Sea. Robin Brown, a district administrator in Namatanai, said he had heard reports food had fallen from shelves in some shops in Rabaul, a township in New Britain, but there were no reports of injuries. There have been four earthquakes off the coast of Papua New Guinea, with a magnitude of 6.1 to 7.5, over the last month.Advertisement
