DAKAR, Senegal —  Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana of Sierra Leone said Saturday that he had requested asylum at the United States Embassy in his country after soldiers surrounded his home in the wake of his expulsion from the governing party this month.Mr. Sam-Sumana was expelled from the All People’s Congress party, led by President Ernest Bai Koroma, after an investigation accused him of creating his own rival political movement in his home district, Kono, in the country’s Eastern Province. The accusation raised doubts about whether he could continue as vice president.“I have fled my house and am with my wife in a place I cannot disclose, waiting to hear from the U.S. ambassador, whom I have asked for asylum,” Mr. Sam-Sumana said.A government spokesman, Abdulai Bayraytay, who said he was traveling with Mr. Bai Koroma in northern Sierra Leone, declined to comment.In late February, Mr. Sam-Sumana said that he was placing himself in a 21-day quarantine after one of his bodyguards died of Ebola.The virus has killed more than 10,000 people in three West African nations, including Sierra Leone.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
