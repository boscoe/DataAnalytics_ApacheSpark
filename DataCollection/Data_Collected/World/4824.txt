BANGKOK —  A Thai military court on Tuesday sentenced a woman to seven years in jail for posting material on the Internet said to be insulting to the monarchy, just a day after another person was accused of disparaging the king’s dog.The military, which declared after seizing power last year that safeguarding the monarchy was one of its priorities, has stepped up the pace of prosecutions of people charged with lèse-majesté, or insulting the monarchy.The woman, identified by her lawyer as Chayapha C., was arrested in June for a Facebook post that prosecutors said included remarks opposed to the junta.Because the woman pleaded guilty to the charge, her original 14-year sentence was reduced, said Sasinan Thamnithinan of the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights.A version of this article appears in print on December 16, 2015, on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Post on Monarchy Brings a Jail Term .
