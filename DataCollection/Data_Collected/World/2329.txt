President Franklin D. Roosevelt won re-election yesterday to become the first President ever honored by a third term in the 151 years since the first inauguration of George Washington. The President and his running mate, Henry A. Wallace, rolled up an overwhelming margin in the electoral college over their Republican opponents, Wendell L. Willkie and Charles L. McNary. However, this plurality fell short of the one that President Roosevelt and John N. Garner attained in the 1936 landslide. â€” New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 6, 1940
