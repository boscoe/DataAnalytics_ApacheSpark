An international judge at a war crimes court in Cambodia charged another former Khmer Rouge member with crimes against humanity on Friday. The charges against the former member, Ao An, or Ta An, cover allegations of “extermination, persecution on political and religious grounds, and other inhumane acts” at detention centers under Pol Pot’s bloody rule in the 1970s.
