HYDE PARK, N.Y. — President Roosevelt, in a nationwide broadcast today [Oct.5], upheld free, liberal education as a bulwark of democracy and a barrier to dictatorship, and defended heavy spending during his administration as a governmental responsibility and duty. Dedicating three Dutchess County schools, built partially with federal funds, the President warned the nation that abolition of education and truth was the first step toward dictatorship, and characterized the three buildings as symbols of lasting democracy in this nation. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 6, 1940
