Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel has outlawed the northern faction of the Islamic Movement, blaming the group for contributing to a surge in violence in JerusalemJERUSALEM —  The Israeli security cabinet announced on Tuesday that it had outlawed the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel, accusing it of collaborating with Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza.The move, part of a government effort to quell a recent wave of violence, coincided with Israel’s attempt to claim common cause with its Western allies and seek more international sympathy for its response to the security threat from what it views as shared enemies.It also came at a delicate time of heightened friction between Israel’s Jewish majority and its Palestinian Arab minority, and between Israel and the Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. Weeks of deadly violence have involved Palestinian stabbing and shooting attacks against Israelis and clashes between Palestinians and the Israeli security forces.In statements distributed to the news media on Tuesday, the Israeli government said the northern branch had incited violence and had called for replacing the state of Israel with an Islamic caliphate. It said that “a significant body of evidence” linked the northern branch to Hamas, the heavily armed group defined as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and the European Union. Israel accused the northern branch and Hamas of engaging in “clandestine cooperation.”AdvertisementIt added that “with the collusion of Hamas,” the northern branch had set up two paid groups of male and female Muslim activists, the Mourabitoun and Mourabitat, to aggressively agitate against Jewish visitors to a contested Jerusalem holy site, a locus of the recent turbulence. Those groups were outlawed in September.AdvertisementWhen an organization is declared illegal, any entity or person belonging to it or acting on its behalf will be committing a criminal offense and subject to imprisonment, the authorities said.Lawyers for the Islamic Movement said the group had not been involved in any illegal activities. Omar Khamaisa, a lawyer for the northern branch, said the government’s decision was “political and is very far from having anything to do with the law.”He said the Islamic Movement had been created to support the Palestinian people, to encourage them to become better Muslims and to give financial support to their students in need. He added that the movement had also assisted in building infrastructure in Bedouin areas of the Negev desert neglected by the government.Arab members of the Israeli Parliament denounced the move as political and religious persecution, an assault on freedom of speech and a draconian step that they said was likely to exacerbate tensions.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the decision came after a series of discussions involving the legal and security issues at stake.The goal is “halting the dangerous incitement from within and preventing attacks on innocent civilians,” he said.Mr. Netanyahu emphasized that the measure was not directed against the great majority of the Arab and Muslim public in Israel, and he added that the government would, in parallel, “continue to invest resources for the benefit of Israel’s Arab and Jewish citizens.”AdvertisementAlthough the restrictions on the northern branch of the Islamic Movement were clearly preplanned, Israel appeared to be trying to capitalize on the timing in a bid for international support after the recent Paris attacks.“The state of Israel must serve as an example and a spearhead in the struggle against extremist Islam, whose emissaries we saw butcher innocent people in Paris, New York, Madrid and Israel,” said Gilad Erdan, Israel’s minister of public security.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It was kept under wraps, perhaps to allow the security services time to gather evidence and prepare surprise raids on related institutions and associations.Before the announcement early Tuesday, the Israeli defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, signed an order to seize the funds and property of 17 registered nonprofit organizations and institutions said to belong to the newly outlawed group.The directive applied to associations in Arab towns like Nazareth and Kafr Kanna in Galilee, the mixed Arab-Jewish ancient port city of Jaffa abutting Tel Aviv, the Bedouin town of Rahat in the Negev and the southern Israeli city of Beersheba.The police said that police officers and agents of the Shin Bet security agency had searched the premises of 13 such organizations overnight, and had seized computers, documents, funds and other materials. The police added that the bank accounts of the associations suspected of activity against state security had been frozen.Israel Radio said it had obtained documents indicating that organizations associated with the northern branch had received millions of shekels in donations from private sources in Turkey, Kuwait and other countries. (A shekel is worth about 25 cents.)The Islamic Movement’s northern branch is considered more radical than the so-called southern branch, which engages in Israeli national politics.Sheikh Raed Salah, the fiery leader of the northern branch, has been arrested, convicted in Israeli courts and sentenced to prison terms several times over the past 35 years for offenses including incitement to violence and racism. After losing an appeal last month, he is scheduled to soon begin an 11-month sentence.AdvertisementThe sheikh has led a decades-old campaign under the slogan “Al Aqsa Is in Danger,” accusing Israel of intending to change the balance of power and even to destroy the sacred compound housing Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. His annual rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people. A growing dispute over the compound, revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount, has fanned the recent violence.Israel has banned other organizations, including extremist groups of Jews like the Kach party and Kahane Chai in the 1990s. In 2013, it outlawed any organization engaged in so-called price-tag acts of vandalism and arson against churches, mosques and Palestinian property, mainly in retaliation for Israeli government and military moves against unauthorized settlement activity in the West Bank.After the overnight raids, Sheikh Raed, as the northern branch’s leader is known, said in a statement that the Israeli measures were “unjust and unacceptable.”The leaders of Israel’s Arab minority, which makes up more than 20 percent of the population, called for a general strike on Thursday in response to the Israeli decision.Arab citizens in Israel are supposed to be afforded equal rights, but they have long complained of discrimination. Mr. Netanyahu was forced to apologize after the March elections for divisive remarks he made before the polls closed, in which he encouraged his backers to vote by telling them that Arab voters were being bused to the polling booths “in droves.”Rami Nazzal contributed reporting from Ramallah, West Bank.A version of this article appears in print on November 18, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Israel Outlaws Branch of Islamic Group, Accusing It of Ties to Hamas .
