Voters expressed deep dissatisfaction over a failing economy and rising crime, and they put the opposition in control of the Assembly for the first time since a new Constitution was passed in 1999, shortly after the election of Mr. Maduro’s predecessor and mentor, the leftist Hugo Chávez.The new Assembly is to be sworn in on Jan. 5, which will set up a power struggle with Mr. Maduro, who has adopted a combative tone and has shown no intention of wanting to work with the new majority.Many analysts say the executive branch will rely on a loyal Supreme Court to block new laws. Human rights groups and other critics say the court lacks independence and reflexively rules for the government.The court has 32 justices who operate in several different branches relating to different types of legal issues, like constitutional questions, electoral disputes, and criminal and civil cases.Patricia Torres reported from Caracas, and William Neuman from Máncora, Peru.Advertisement
