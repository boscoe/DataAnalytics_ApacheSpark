It says the ship, found in the mud of a river in southern England near Southampton, is likely to be the Holigost, or “Holy Ghost,” which played a major role in two sea battles that enabled Henry to conquer territory in France in the early 15th century, during the Hundred Years’ War.The announcement came just days before the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt. In that battle, on Oct. 25, 1415, Henry led his troops to a famous victory in northern France, described by Shakespeare in “Henry V.” If recovered safely and verified, the ship will be preserved and go on display in Portsmouth.Advertisement
