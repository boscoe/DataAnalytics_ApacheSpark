The other two West African countries that have been ravaged by Ebola — Sierra Leone and Liberia — showed continued improvements for the week. Sierra Leone reported 55 confirmed new cases but that was the country’s lowest weekly total since last June. Liberia reported no new confirmed cases for the third consecutive week. Wednesday was the 12th day since the last known Ebola patient in Liberia had a negative test. Forty-two days must elapse after that test before transmission of the highly contagious Ebola virus is considered to have ended in Liberia. The weekly update by the W.H.O. also said a total of 10,154 people had died from the Ebola epidemic so far, almost all of them in the three worst-affected countries. Advertisement
