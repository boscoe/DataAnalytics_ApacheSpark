LONDON — To-day [Oct. 11] Londoners will find themselves faced  with the hardest of all tasks — the breaking of a habit. The “No Treating” order will come into force. Anyone who, in a fit of absentmindedness, asks his friend in a bar: “What will you have?” is liable to six months’ imprisonment, not to mention a fine of £100. The point for hotelkeepers and publicans to remember is that the official notice is the one that must be hung in every bar or  room where liquor is sold. Unofficial notices may be displayed at will, but the official bill must appear, in any case. Inquiries by letter and telephone have poured in on the secretary of the Protection Society as to the duty of the license-holder in a variety of circumstances. Most of the queries discuss the still undefined “meal,” the ordering of which carries exemption from the restriction on the hospitable instinct. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 12, 1915
