The move made Australia the latest of a list of major American allies to sign up.The office of Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement that Australia still had concerns about the management of the bank but recognized the pressing needs for infrastructure in Asia. The decision will allow Australia to “participate as a prospective founding member in negotiations to set up the bank,” the statement said.Australia said it wanted to ensure that the board of directors had authority over crucial investment decisions and that “no one country,” a reference to China, controls the bank.Among Washington’s main objections to the China-led bank have been concerns that it would seek to undermine the authority of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, established after World War II with the United States in the leadership role.The administration has also suggested that, given China’s record on the environment and lack of transparency, the new bank would not meet the standards of existing institutions. The Chinese have countered that bureaucracy at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which is based in Manila and led by Japan, has slowed their capacity to meet demand.The Obama administration publicly criticized Britain for joining this month, saying it was a sign of “accommodation” with China.But as allies including Britain and then France, Italy and Germany announced plans to join the bank this month, Australia — which counts China as its biggest trading partner — came under increased pressure to sign on. South Korea, another major trading partner with China, said last week that it would join the Beijing-based bank, reversing its decision last year to go along with the United States’ requests that major Asian allies stay aloof from the plan.Australia’s move leaves the major Asia Pacific allies, the United States and Japan, China’s biggest competitor in Asia, outside the bank. While some in Washington have said the United States should consider joining, that is an unlikely prospect.After expressing doubts, the Obama administration would be unlikely to reverse course, and Congress would almost certainly oppose the United States’ participating in an institution founded and primarily run by China.The turnaround by Australia showed that the United States’ “friends and allies are quite willing to accommodate China’s growing power despite America’s objections,” said Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the Australian National University.“Australia of course worries about China’s growing power, but it is also eager to be part of Asia’s economic and political future and simply cannot afford to become isolated from the new Asia China is building,” Mr. White said.Washington eased its opposition slightly as members of the G-20 group of advanced economies joined the bank, saying last week that it would encourage the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to cooperate with the new institution.A chief justification for the new bank is the failure of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to keep up with the huge needs for roads, railways and power in large areas of fast-developing Asia.In a speech at the annual Boao Forum for Asia in southern China on Saturday, President Xi Jinping of China said the new bank would supplement the work of the World Bank and other international financial institutions.“Being a big country means shouldering greater responsibilities for the region, as opposed to seeking greater monopoly over regional and world affairs,” Mr. Xi told the forum.Nearly 40 countries have said they would join the new bank. The Chinese set a deadline for the end of March for founding members to join. The bank will be led by a Chinese official in Beijing and have a starting capital of between $50 billion and $100 billion, Chinese officials say. It is expected to start operations at the end of the year.Advertisement
