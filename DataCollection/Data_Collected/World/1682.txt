BUENOS AIRES — Argentine voters sent the country’s presidential race into a runoff on Sunday, boosting hopes in the opposition after Mauricio Macri, the mayor of Buenos Aires, made a surprisingly strong showing against the candidate endorsed by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, according to partial results released by the electoral authorities.Pointing to a remarkably tight race, Daniel Scioli, a former vice president supported by Mrs. Kirchner, took 35.7 percent of the vote with 84 percent of balloting stations tallied, against 35.3 percent for Mr. Macri. The votes obtained by Mr. Macri, a former president of one of Argentina’s most popular soccer clubs who ran to the right of his rivals, upend a race in which Mr. Scioli was viewed as a strong front-runner.The candidates signaled an intense new phase of campaigning ahead of the runoff election on Nov. 22. Sergio Massa, a former ally of Mrs. Kirchner’s who moved into the opposition, could find himself in the role of kingmaker after securing 21 percent of the vote in the partial count, with analysts questioning whether he will forge an alliance with Mr. Macri.“I invite you to conquer our future,” Mr. Macri, 56, said Sunday night, in a conciliatory speech before the first official results were released after midnight, as he positioned his campaign to lure more voters.Voters on Sunday sent the presidential race in Argentina to a runoff. Here’s how the leading candidates reacted to the results.With Mrs. Kirchner, 62, constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term, the leading candidates ran carefully orchestrated campaigns that seemed to reflect a longing in the electorate for a break with her divisive governing style. Mrs. Kirchner intensified attacks on opponents in the news media and business establishment after succeeding her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, as president in 2007.Advertisement“More moderation is expected as the Kirchner era comes to a close,” said Mariel Fornoni, director of Management and Fit, a leading polling company. “There’s an enormous desire in society for less polarization.”AdvertisementMr. Scioli, 58, a former speedboat racer, sought to appeal to Mrs. Kirchner’s supporters by contending that he did not plan any abrupt policy shifts. Lacking her combative rhetorical spirit, he came across as a safe option for many voters who want continuity for programs that have increased social welfare spending over the past 12 years.“I never won a race smashing into a competitor’s boat,” Mr. Scioli told reporters during the campaign. “To the contrary, I always look to improve on what’s been achieved.”Even though Mr. Scioli seemed to fall short of obtaining the support on Sunday of some die-hard supporters of Mrs. Kirchner, the possibility of continuity under Mr. Scioli appealed to many voters.
                Argentina, Poland, Tanzania, Guatemala, Haiti and Ivory Coast held elections on Sunday. Here is a rundown of major issues and candidates in each country, with links to New York Times coverage.            “Scioli is with the poor people,” said María Rosa González, 66, a maid who voted for him on Sunday. She explained that her late father, a corn harvester, had been able to claim a state pension under a 2005 law supported by the Kirchners in which workers who had not paid contributions could collect retirement benefits. “This government helped the people. It’s on display.”Economists here argue over the costs of such policies, with some saying that Mrs. Kirchner’s successor will have to grapple with galloping inflation and a yawning budget deficit. But her supporters say that antipoverty spending was badly needed in the country after a chaotic economic collapse and political turmoil in 2001 and 2002.Mr. Macri, a civil engineer by training, said he would introduce market-oriented changes aiming to loosen currency controls and lure great investment into Argentina’s economy, standing in contrast to his rivals.Mrs. Kirchner still holds considerable sway, emerging as one of Argentina’s strongest leaders in recent decades. She has recently moved to enhance her power through a calculated series of moves, potentially casting her shadow over the management of the economy and foreign policy well after she is scheduled to leave office in December.AdvertisementWhile voting unfolded peacefully around the country, the leading candidate needed more than 45 percent of the vote, or 40 percent and a margin larger than 10 points over the nearest rival, to avoid the runoff. The delay by the authorities in releasing the results, which were made public about six hours after polls had closed, left much of the country on tenterhooks.Throughout the race, many voters and analysts here were struck as much by the similarities among the leading candidates as their differences, reflecting strategies of offering a nonthreatening alternative to Mrs. Kirchner’s commanding presence. Even Mr. Macri, who began campaigning from another part of the ideological spectrum, sought to appeal to supporters of Peronism, the ideologically diverse political grouping that dominates Argentine politics.Kirchnerismo, the leftist movement named for the Kirchners, came to overshadow other factions aligned with Peronism, which originated decades ago during the rule of Juan Domingo Perón. Mindful of the hazards of opposing Peronist power brokers, the three men adopted reserved campaign styles, leading some to suggest that a composite candidate could easily be made of Mr. Scioli, Mr. Macri and Mr. Massa.“He is an amiable, middle-of-the-road, middle-class, middle-aged and fairly athletic bloke of Italian extraction who, with a winning smile, tells us that the country can easily overcome all its many economic and social problems,” James Neilson wrote in a column in The Buenos Aires Herald.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Some estimate that about a third of Mr. Massa’s support came from dissident Peronists who could actually swing back to Mr. Scioli, potentially handing him a victory.“That greatly limits Massa’s margin for maneuver,” said Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst. Still, he said Mr. Macri would have already contemplated how to court this 30 percent, pointing to a statue of Juan Domingo Perón, the founder of Peronism, that Mr. Macri recently unveiled. “That’s why he inaugurated the statue,” Mr. Berensztein said.A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Tight Vote in Argentina Yields Presidential Runoff .
