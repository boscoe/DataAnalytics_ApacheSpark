Supporters say the move will improve stability, but opponents warn that it will entrench the governing party’s control over the former Soviet state.   Observers from the Council of Europe, a rights group, reported problems with voting lists and other irregularities, but the governing Republican Party said minor violations could not affect the result.   The changes, due to come into force after elections in May 2017, will broadly curb the role of the historically powerful president and give more authority to the prime minister and Parliament.   The opposition says the changes are a ruse to let President Serzh Sargsyan slip into an enhanced prime ministerial role after his term ends in 2018. He has regularly denied this.  About 63 percent of voters on Sunday supported the proposed changes to the Constitution, easily more than the simple majority needed. Advertisement
