Former President Alberto Fujimori on Thursday was convicted of using public money to influence newspaper coverage during his 2000 re-election campaign. Mr. Fujimori is already serving a 25-year sentence, handed down in 2009, for ordering the killings of 25 people during a war with leftist guerrillas. On Thursday, he was sentenced to eight years to be served concurrently with his earlier sentence so it will not add to his time in jail. Mr. Fujimori, who was president from 1990 to 2000, was also ordered to pay restitution of about $1 million. Local news media reported that evidence showed that a representative of Mr. Fujimori paid newspapers up to $3,000 for articles smearing his opponents. The verdict could affect the political prospects of his daughter, Keiko Fujimori, a probable candidate for president next year.A version of this brief appears in print on January 9, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Peru: Jailed Ex-President Is Convicted of Corruption.
