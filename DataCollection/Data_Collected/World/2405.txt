The departing United Nations envoy to Libya on Thursday urged the country’s rival factions to halt their attempts to obstruct a power-sharing plan intended to end a longstanding political crisis. The envoy, Bernardino León, who is expected to be replaced soon by a German diplomat, Martin Kobler, also defended himself against suggestions that it was a conflict of interest for him to accept a job training diplomats in the United Arab Emirates, one of the Arab countries most involved in the Libyan crisis. Libya has fallen into turmoil since the fall of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011, with an internationally recognized government and elected Parliament on one side and a self-styled administration holding Tripoli on the other, each backed by regional, tribal or Islamist armed factions. After months of deadlocked negotiations, Mr. León recently presented Libya’s rival factions with a proposed national unity government, but hard-liners on both sides have resisted sharing power. Along with Egypt, the U.A.E. backs Libya’s internationally recognized government operating in the east.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
