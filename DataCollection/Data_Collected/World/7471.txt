The TransAsia Airways twin turboprop crashed shortly after takeoff from Taipei Songshan Airport on a flight bound for the Kinmen islands, near the Chinese province of Fujian. About a dozen people were rescued from the plane, an ATR-72, while 10 were still trapped, the news agency reported, citing local television reports. Local television showed the plane’s fuselage resting in the Keelung River near the southeast side of Taipei, the Taiwanese capital. The crash is the second for the airline in just over six months, following an ATR-72 crash on July 23 that killed 48 people. The cause of that crash is still under investigation.Advertisement
