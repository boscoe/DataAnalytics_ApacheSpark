Mr. El-Baghdadi posted translated excerpts from the Islamic State leader’s audio message on Twitter, and encouraged his followers to respond by trolling the extremist group and its online supporters.For days, Twitter users around the world have been taking shots at the Islamic State, sharing all of the things they would rather be doing than fighting for the group.On Wednesday, Mr. El-Baghdadi — whom some news organizations mistakenly identified as the Islamic State leader because his surname is similar to the militant’s nom de guerre — made an effort to keep the digital resistance alive.This week’s campaign is the latest in a long-running fight by Internet vigilantes to disrupt the Islamic State’s online propaganda.“Basically, our work not only cripples their ability to spread propaganda, but also wastes their time,” a Twitter vigilante who goes by the screen name The Doctor told The New York Times in March.The Islamic State has regularly used social media to spread its message, recruit fighters, and threaten “infidels” and other enemies. The insidious threat it represents appears to motivate Muslims like Mr. El-Baghdadi to fight the extremists at every tweet.Advertisement
