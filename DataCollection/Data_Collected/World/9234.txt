Four people, including a police officer, have been taken into custody over suspected links to January’s terrorist attacks in Paris, officials said Monday. One man had ties to Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a police officer on Jan. 8 and then four people the next day at a kosher supermarket before being killed by security forces, the officials said. They said the detained man’s former girlfriend, a police officer who was suspended after looking at his criminal file, was also in custody. The officials had no details about the others. No one besides the dead gunmen has been linked directly to the attacks at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and the market. Mr. Coulibaly’s companion is believed to have left France before the attacks.A version of this brief appears in print on March 10, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: France: 4 Held on Suspicion Of Links to Paris Attackers.
