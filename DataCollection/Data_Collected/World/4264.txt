NEW YORK — The inauguration of the equestrial statue of Joan of Arc, erected in Riverside Drive, as a mark of sympathy with France, took place yesterday [Dec. 6], under the direction of an American committee. President Wilson sent a dispatch to the president of the committee, which was read during the ceremony, and of which the following is a passage: ‘‘Joan of Arc is one of those ideal figures of history toward which the patriotic thought of a people turns in order to find its inspiration. In her, pure enthusiasm, the source of all heroism and poetry, seems to be embodied.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 8, 1915
