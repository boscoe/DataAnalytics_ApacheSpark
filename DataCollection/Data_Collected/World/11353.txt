An operation to oust squatters from a Rio de Janeiro building once planned as a hotel for the 2016 Olympic Games erupted into chaos on Tuesday. Though the squatters had agreed to leave, when police officers in riot gear charged in, pandemonium erupted and squatters set two fires. An oil and mining magnate, Eike Batista, had intended to turn the apartment building into a luxury hotel before his businesses crumbled. An attorneys’ organization at one point counted more than 300 squatters in the building, including 70 to 80 children, though many left after a judge ordered it vacated. One squatter, Celia Regina Cesario, 58, blamed the Olympics for putting her back on the street. “The city has all this money for the Olympics,” she said, “but they don’t spend a cent on decent housing for people like us.”A version of this brief appears in print on April 15, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Brazil: Eviction of Squatters Turns Chaotic Amid Olympic Tensions.
