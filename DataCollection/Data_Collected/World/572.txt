Iran announced Thursday that it planned to boycott this year’s Frankfurt Book Fair in protest over a scheduled speech at the site by the novelist Salman Rushdie. Iranian state television reported that the Ministry of Culture called the decision by the fair organizers to invite Mr. Rushdie an “anti-cultural action.” It said Iran would not attend the fair in protest and urged other Islamic countries to do the same. Hundreds of Iranian publishers usually attend the annual event, which begins next week. Mr. Rushdie’s book “The Satanic Verses” has been banned in Iran since 1988, as many Muslims consider it to be blasphemous. A year later, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran’s supreme leader, issued an edict calling for Mr. Rushdie’s death.A version of this brief appears in print on October 9, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Shunning an Event With Rushdie.
