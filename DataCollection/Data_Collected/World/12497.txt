Iranian security forces arrested a prominent human rights activist, Narges Mohammadi, on Tuesday, the reformist Baharnews website reported. Ms. Mohammadi is one of the best-known activists remaining in Iran. For more than a decade, she has worked with the Defenders of Human Rights Center, founded by the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi. This week, Ms. Mohammadi, who has been sentenced to prison terms before for her work, was scheduled to appear in court in connection with a new case filed against her. A request for a delay in that case was denied, leaving her lawyer no time to study the charges against her, Baharnews reported.A version of this brief appears in print on May 6, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Rights Advocate Is Arrested.
