ROME —  A small group of Eritrean asylum seekers left Italy for Sweden on Friday, initiating a contentious European Union relocation program meant to help the union’s front-line countries deal with the largest movement of refugees on the Continent since World War II.The 19 young Eritreans dutifully smiled for official photographs with European and Italian officials on the tarmac at Ciampino Airport outside Rome, then boarded a government plane bound for Lulea, on the Gulf of Bothnia about 1,680 miles to the north, where the Swedish authorities awaited them.“That plane is a symbol of victory,” for a vision of Europe “able to be supportive and responsible, a Europe that can save human lives,” Angelino Alfano, the Italian interior minister, told reporters at a news conference shortly after the plane took off.The relocation program is meant to move 160,000 asylum seekers now sheltering in Greece and Italy to other European countries over the next two years. It was adopted last month after drawn-out and combative negotiations among the union’s 28 members, with some Eastern European countries resisting the most.AdvertisementMore than 580,000 migrants and refugees have reached the European Union by sea so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration. The influx of people fleeing poverty and strife has swamped the ability of the countries where they land to accommodate them, raised social tensions and widened political divisions within Europe over what to do.“Today is a defeat for those who are against Europe, and think it is better for the Mediterranean to become a lake of death,” Mr. Alfano said, a jab at politicians in Italy and elsewhere who play to anti-immigrant sentiment.AdvertisementJean Asselborn, the foreign minister of Luxembourg, said the start of the resettlement project showed that Europe “doesn’t mean only budgetary crises, financial problems, migration crisis.” Mr. Asselborn said it also showed that “we have the power, energy and will to solve these problems.” Luxembourg currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union.For humanitarian agencies that have been pushing for a safe and legal alternative to migrant smuggling, the flight on Friday was “an important step in the protection of asylum seekers,” said Federico Soda, an I.O.M. official based in Rome.Under the current rules, only Syrians, Eritreans and Iraqis qualify for resettlement under the program.Waiting to fly to Sweden on Friday morning, a 26-year-old Eritrean who gave his name as Michele said he was looking forward to going to a democratic country like Sweden. “I want to live serenely,” he said.To qualify, Michele had to request asylum and be fingerprinted in Italy. Many migrants are loath to do that because of European regulations that ordinarily restrict asylum seekers to the first member country where they register; most of them want to move north from Italy or Greece to countries with stronger economies.
                German and European Union leaders have called for European countries to share the burden of absorbing the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have poured into the continent this summer.            Like the other passengers, Michele was traveling light. Most had a small carry-on bag packed with donated clothes and a few personal belongings that survived the long trip across the Sahara and the Mediterranean. “They arrive with nothing,” said Nardos Neamin, a cultural mediator at an Italian Red Cross tent camp where six of the Eritreans on the plane had been living.AdvertisementDimitris Avramopoulos, the European Union’s commissioner for migration, told reporters in Rome on Friday that the flight to Sweden was “a journey of hope,” part of a program that also includes repatriating people who have no legal claim to asylum. “It is a tangible example of what we can do if we work together in the spirit of solidarity,” he said.Asylum seekers will be provided with “shelter, legal status and a welcoming atmosphere,” Mr. Avramopoulos said, but will not have a say in where they are sent. “I know that many want to go to specific countries,” he said, “but it can’t be done.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The challenge, he said, is to reach migrants “before they fall into the hands of human traffickers and risk their lives.”Ms. Neamin said many Eritreans at the Italian Red Cross camp had put off applying for asylum to see how the first group in the program fared. “I am certain, now, that they will register,” she said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
