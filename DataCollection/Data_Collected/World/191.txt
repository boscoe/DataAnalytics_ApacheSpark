TOKIO — If the United States refuses to understand Japan’s intentions in building a new world order in conjunction with Germany and Italy and ‘‘persists in challenging them, in the belief that the tripartite pact among them represents a hostile action, there will be no other course open to them than to go to war,’’ Premier Prince Fumimaro Konoye was quoted by Domei, the Japanese official news agency, as having stated yesterday evening in an interview at Kyoto. The new tripartite pact among Germany, Italy and Japan, the Premier said, aims at the bringing about of a new world order. Under the treaty Germany and Italy recognize Japan’s position ‘‘to lead others in the establishment of a new order in East Asia,’’ he stated, while Japan recognizes ‘‘the guiding positions of Germany and Italy in Europe.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, Oct. 5, 1940
