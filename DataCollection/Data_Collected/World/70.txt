The children who survived the German attack on the steamer City of Benares in 1940 (without sound). British Pathé.  LONDON — Unwilling to allow more children to face the dangers of the submarine-infected North Atlantic, the British government announced tonight the suspension for the time being of its scheme to send thousands of children to safety in the United States, Canada and the dominions. The government was influenced in its decision by the torpedoing on Sept. 17 of the steamer City of Benares. Sixty-nine children who were being taken to Canada to escape the bombing of Britain lost their lives when the vessel sank. About 50,000 children had been registered, and the board had stopped accepting new names. Despite the announcement of the scheme’s ‘‘postponement,’’ children continued to be sent overseas in gradually increasing numbers wherever shipping space permitted. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 2, 1940
