Prime Minister Evans Paul, a former Port-au-Prince mayor, was nominated by President Michel Martelly but has not been confirmed by the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. All lawmakersâ€™ terms expired as opponents of Mr. Martelly blocked legislation authorizing elections. The president can now rule by decree under the Constitution. Mr. Paul said Wednesday that he was organizing the government, with a new electoral council to be appointed within weeks and the legislative elections to be held this year. Advertisement
