The ambush, in Jalisco State on Thursday, left five other people dead, including two civilian bystanders and three of the presumed attackers, officials said. The officers belonged to the Gendarmerie, a 5,000-officer division of the federal police formed last year by President Enrique Peña Nieto to go after organized-crime groups hurting economic interests in various trouble spots in an effort to ease foreign investors’ concerns about safety. The officers were in a convoy patrolling an industrial corridor in Ocotlan when they came under gunfire from more than a dozen vehicles. It was unclear what prompted the attack. Advertisement
