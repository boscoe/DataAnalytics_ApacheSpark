Each side accused the other of breaking a cease-fire. A Pakistani military official said a 13-year-old girl had been killed by “unprovoked firing” from Indian border posts near the city of Sialkot. An 8-year-old was wounded in another district, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with protocol.Indian officials said Pakistani rangers “kept on firing the whole night,” using mortars and machine guns against 15 posts manned by India’s Border Security Force. One woman was killed in the Samba district, said Rakesh Sharma, chief of the Indian forces in the Jammu region.Mr. Sharma said that the exchange of fire had been lighter during the day on Saturday, “an odd shell left and right,” but that residents were beginning to leave their homes in anticipation of heavier nighttime firing. Both India and Pakistan claim Kashmir, and the neighbors have fought two wars over the region. For years, cross-border exchanges of fire have occasionally erupted, but in recent months, episodes of heavier shelling have prompted thousands of families in villages near the border to flee in search of safety.Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan.Advertisement
