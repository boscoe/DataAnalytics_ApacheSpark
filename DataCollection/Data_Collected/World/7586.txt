The protest came after a mysterious fire gutted a church in New Delhi, the capital, and several other churches were vandalized over the past two months. The protesters blame Hindu hard-liners for the attacks. The police said the protesters were detained because demonstrations are banned in the neighborhood where the minister, Rajnath Singh, lives. Church leaders have expressed disappointment that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not spoken out against the attacks. Advertisement
