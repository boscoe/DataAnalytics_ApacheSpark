TEHRAN — Signaling new efforts to halt what some officials have called out-of-control corruption, Iran’s judiciary announced this week that it had sentenced a former vice president to five years in jail and fined him the equivalent of $1 million after his recent conviction in a longstanding corruption case.Rumors of corruption have long surrounded Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, who was a first vice president under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. His conviction, which is believed to have taken place months ago but was announced only on Sunday, follows a recent order by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calling upon the government and the judiciary to deal firmly with corruption.The announcement by the judiciary did not specify the charge Mr. Rahimi was convicted of, but Iranian news media have reported that he quickly became enmeshed in insurance fraud after he was appointed by Mr. Ahmadinejad following the disputed 2009 presidential election.Mr. Rahimi is the most senior official in Iran to have been convicted of corruption since the Islamic revolution of 1979. His conviction follows several high-profile cases in which business tycoons, often connected to the previous government, were sentenced and in some cases executed.Mr. Rahimi, who like Mr. Ahmadinejad fell out of grace with ruling hard-liners following a dispute with Ayatollah Khamenei, has always insisted that the charges are politically motivated.The judiciary’s announcement was the first time that his name and sentence appeared in full in Iranian news reports.A version of this article appears in print on January 23, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Iran: Corruption Case Snares Ex-Official.
