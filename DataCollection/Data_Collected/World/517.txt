As expected, all 155 lawmakers in the governing coalition in the 300-member Parliament backed Mr. Tsipras. The vote followed three days of debate on the new government’s policy program, a standard procedure after general elections in Greece. In a speech in Parliament before the vote, Mr. Tsipras said his priorities were to recapitalize Greece’s banks by the end of the year and to win relief for the country’s huge debt burden. “Despite the difficulties ahead of us, we will exit the crisis in the next four years,” he promised.
