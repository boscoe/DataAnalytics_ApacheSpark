BERLIN —  The German government is considering restoring controls on Syrian refugees arriving here after fleeing war in their homeland, and will significantly tighten rules allowing refugees to bring their families here, the Interior Ministry said on Friday.The announcement followed weeks of mounting doubt about whether Germany has the capacity to handle almost 800,000 refugees who have arrived so far this year and who could total more than a million by year’s end.Chancellor Angela Merkel and her government have come under fire at home and abroad, accused of triggering the influx of refugees from Syria and elsewhere when the German office overseeing migration said in August that it would no longer check Syrian arrivals. Those pursuing asylum had already been arriving in Central Europe in ever-increasing numbers earlier in the summer, but the pace quickened after that statement.A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Johannes Dimroth, said by telephone on Friday that the proposal now was to “return to what was the case before” August for migrants arriving from Syria.AdvertisementThe change has not yet been carried out, another spokesman, Tobias Plate, said by email, and would first have to be discussed in the coalition government.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

While awaiting a decision, migrants in these centers will be restricted to that district and will lose all benefits if breaking these rules.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
