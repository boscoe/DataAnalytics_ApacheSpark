BELGRADE — As the procession of statesmen from central and southeastern Europe flies by in the direction of Adolf Hitler’s reception room, many Yugoslavs are watching nervously, and with a growing conviction that their country is being isolated. Every time one of these statesmen signs on the dotted line, the iron ring forged around the countries on the Yugoslav border is tightened. This fact is brought out by a glance at a map of Yugoslavia. Reading from left to right, this country’s neighbors are Benito Mussolini’s Italy, Hitler’s Germany, a Hungary which has just joined the totalitarian three-power pact, Iron Guard Rumania, where German soldiers stand ready, a Bulgaria which is making territorial demands on Yugoslavia, and finally Greece and Albania. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 24, 1940
