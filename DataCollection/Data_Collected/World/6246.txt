Mr. Obama, in a telephone call with Mr. Netanyahu, “reiterated the United States’ position that the Palestinian Authority does not yet constitute a state, and is therefore not eligible” to join the court, the administration said in a statement. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority moved to join the court last month as part of a strategic shift by the Palestinians to pursue statehood on their own after decades of failed negotiations with Israel brokered by the United States.  Mr. Obama also told Mr. Netanyahu that Washington wanted a comprehensive deal that would prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, the White House said.
