Ms. Kagezi was a chief prosecutor in the trial of about a dozen suspects in attacks in 2010 that killed at least 79 people in Kampala, the capital, as crowds watched the World Cup finals. Shabab militants claimed the bombings as retaliation for Ugandaâ€™s sending troops to bolster the Somali government. The police said Ms. Kagezi appeared to have been attacked by two men on a motorcycle as she drove home in a Kampala suburb. Advertisement
