JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesian investigators said Thursday that the co-pilot of AirAsia Flight 8501 was at the controls when the plane made its final radio transmission to ground control before plunging minutes later into the Java Sea, killing all 162 people aboard.The investigators, who have just completed a preliminary report on the crash based on the plane’s so-called black boxes, told journalists that the captain was “monitoring the flight” on Dec. 28 from his place in the cockpit’s left seat.The Airbus A320-200, flying at 32,000 feet, rapidly ascended an additional 5,000 feet in just 30 seconds — extremely unusual for a commercial aircraft — and then fell into the sea, said Ertata Lananggalih, senior air safety investigator for Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee.The plane, which had disappeared from radar at 24,000 feet, “fell slowly and hit the water in about three minutes,” Mr. Ertata said.AdvertisementHowever, he said, “there is no conclusion” that the accident was a result of the captain not being at the controls just before the plane ran into trouble.Tatang Kurniadi, chairman of the transportation safety committee, said “it was impossible” that the captain would not have immediately joined the co-pilot at the controls when the plane actually ran into trouble.Advertisement“Both were in control,” he said.First Officer Rémi Emmanuel Plesel, a French national who was born on the Caribbean island of Martinique, had significantly fewer flight hours than the aircraft’s Indonesian captain, Iriyanto, who had only one name.During a packed and at times testy news conference at the committee’s central Jakarta offices, reporters repeatedly questioned whether the French co-pilot was controlling the plane as it got into trouble.There has been speculation that the co-pilot’s inexperience relative to that of the captain had contributed to the crash.“We are never talking ‘wrong and right,’ ” Mr. Tatang said after the news conference. “We just want to find out, with the system, whether there’s one malfunction which we have to improve.”The transportation safety committee has sent its preliminary report, required within 30 days, to the International Civil Aviation Organization.

But Indonesian investigators said the preliminary report would not be released to the news media or the public, and they refused on Thursday to discuss specifics about the crash. Among the key questions still unanswered are whether the plane stalled before it fell — as has been widely speculated — and whether the final sounds heard in the cockpit were warning signals.AdvertisementShortly before air traffic controllers in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, lost contact with Flight 8501, the plane’s pilots advised that they were turning west and requested permission to increase their altitude to 38,000 feet from 32,000 feet, to avoid a storm cloud.The air traffic controllers cleared the plane to increase to an altitude of only 34,000 feet. The final time the pilots’ voices were heard on the cockpit voice recorder was four minutes later, the investigators said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But 92 people remain unaccounted for.On Tuesday, Indonesia’s armed forces halted search operations for victims and abandoned further attempts to raise the aircraft’s heavily damaged fuselage, which is lying off the southern coast of Borneo Island at a depth of around 100 feet.The country’s civilian National Search and Rescue Agency said on Tuesday that it would continue searching for victims until Feb. 6, but at a decreased tempo, given that the military, including navy divers, had conducted the bulk of the operations.A version of this article appears in print on January 30, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Indonesia: Report Says Co-Pilot Was Flying AirAsia Jet.
