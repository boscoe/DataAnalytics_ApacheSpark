BERLIN —  The German Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Friday to send reconnaissance planes, a frigate and midair fueling capacity to the Middle East to support the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, although German forces will not be involved in direct combat like airstrikes.The vote — with 445 in favor, 146 against, and seven abstentions — was expected, given the large parliamentary majority commanded by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s “grand coalition” government of center-right and center-left.Twenty-eight Social Democrats and just two Christian Democrats joined the opposition — the Greens and the Left party — in opposing the deployment. Three Greens voted for the military action.Even 70 years after World War II, Germany remains wary of using its military outside the NATO alliance, and such missions require parliamentary approval.AdvertisementThe government said action was essential because the turmoil in the Middle East was increasingly affecting events at home, from the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees to terrorist alerts and risky missions overseas for Germany’s all-volunteer armed forces.AdvertisementThe vote came only eight days after the government first pledged to meet requests from Germany’s closest European ally, France, for assistance in targeting the Islamic State in Syria after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that killed 130 people in and around Paris.After a parliamentary vote in favor of deployment, the foreign minister of Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said that his country had no desire for a long military intervention in Syria.“The Paris attacks have forced us in Europe to realize that the Middle East is not somewhere distant like South America,” said Norbert Röttgen, head of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee.“It is our neighbor,” he added, “and we Europeans must take responsibility for this region.”Thomas Oppermann, the Social Democrats’ leader in Parliament, noted that the government had been compelled to move swiftly because France had asked for help. “We can act quickly when that is needed,” yet with sufficient debate to enable a responsible decision, he said.The opposition attacked the government for its rapid response, however, and it charged that Berlin was relying solely on what it described as an ill-considered military action to combat the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.“War is terror that breeds more terror,” Sahra Wagenknecht, co-leader of the Left party, told Parliament.Part of the reason the government moved so quickly was that both major parties in the coalition will have annual congresses starting in a week, and that they apparently wanted the military deployment question settled beforehand.Lawmakers from both parties cited the deployment in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as a precedent; the opposition called that comparison unfortunate, noting the continuing turmoil and insecurity in Afghanistan 14 years later.AdvertisementThe government also moved quickly to capitalize on public outrage over the attacks in Paris, said Henning Riecke, trans-Atlantic director at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
                The Islamic State emerged from a group of militants in Iraq to take over large portions of Iraq and Syria, and now threatens other countries in Europe and elsewhere.            The parliamentary vote came as a new national opinion poll indicated solid support for military action.The poll showed that 59 percent of respondents supported the plan for limited deployment that the government had proposed and that 34 percent would back airstrikes in Syria; 22 percent would even be prepared to deploy ground troops.The poll for the public service broadcaster ARD and the daily Die Welt was conducted from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1, with 1,003 respondents and a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, according to the pollster Infratest Dimap.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

While Ms. Merkel has been a strong voice on the need to take in refugees, she has not been prominent in the debate on deployment. Instead, the foreign and defense ministers have been in the public eye.On Thursday, Ms. von der Leyen appeared to concede that critics had a legitimate argument when they questioned whether Germany’s military had the bandwidth for these deployments. In recent weeks, the Army has undertaken increased duties at home as the country accommodates the new refugees.Further questions about Germany’s military capacity arose this week when the Defense Ministry made clear that only 30 of about 60 aging Tornado planes were ready for deployment.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
