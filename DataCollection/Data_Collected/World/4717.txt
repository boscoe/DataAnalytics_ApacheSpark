MOSCOW —  Russia summoned a Turkish military attaché on Sunday to warn of what it called provocations by a Turkish fishing boat near a Russian warship in the Aegean Sea.The warship fired warning shots after the fishing boat did not heed calls to change course when it sailed within about 1,600 feet of the Smetlivy destroyer, one of the ships supporting Russia’s military intervention in Syria, the Russian Defense Ministry said.Russia told the Turkish military attaché of “potentially disastrous consequences from Ankara’s reckless actions toward Russia’s military contingent fighting against international terrorism in Syria,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement.It added that “only by luck was tragedy avoided.”The episode seemed likely to heighten tensions between Russia and Turkey over the Syrian crisis and Turkey’s shooting down of a Russian military jet last month. Turkey says Russia’s air force is targeting ethnic Turkish villages in northern Syria amid its effort to prop up President Bashar al-Assad.The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, in Rome for talks about Libya, told reporters he did not want relations with Russia to worsen over the episode and said that “we want to overcome tensions through dialogue.”A version of this article appears in print on December 14, 2015, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: Run-In With Turkish Fishing Boat Angers Russian Military .
