BUCHAREST — The lights went out in Bucharest at midnight last night and the city started living on a modified war-time basis. The blackout, for which no reason has been given, will be continued indefinitely, but at first it will not be put into effect until midnight every night. The blackout was announced to the population yesterday morning without previous warning. If the blackout is one of the prices Rumania pays for its friendship with Germany it will be rewarded for this friendship by a place in the sun if Germany wins the war. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 21, 1940
