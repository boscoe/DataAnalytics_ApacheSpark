The military says it has secured 80 percent of the district since the operation started in June, but the claim cannot be independently verified as reporters are prohibited from entering the area.The explosion just after noon on Tuesday reverberated across Lahore, where residents had been bracing for an attack since a Taliban attack at a school in Peshawar in December that killed about 150 people and appeared to signal a new escalation of the insurgent campaign.The home minister in Punjab Province, Shuja Khanzada, speaking at the scene, told reporters that the attack had occurred as the police were recruiting at their headquarters.The building was packed with people, but security measures prevented the bomber from reaching the entrance, and he detonated his explosives 150 feet away.“My car jumped into the air, and I lost my senses for a while,” said Farooq Tariq, a human rights activist who said he had just left a nearby building when the explosion occurred.“Smoke was everywhere,” he said. “Then I saw, about 150 feet away, people lying injured on the road.”It was the deadliest bombing for months in Lahore, a city that has suffered numerous attacks on police, intelligence and religious targets since the Taliban insurgency erupted in 2007.During a trial in Portland, Ore., last week, Reaz Qadir Khan, a naturalized American citizen, pleaded guilty to being an accessory to a suicide attack on the Lahore headquarters of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency in May 2009 that killed about 30 people and wounded more than 300.Mr. Khan, 51, a Portland city worker who was born in Pakistan and has lived in the United States since 1988, admitted to helping finance the attack and to providing assistance to the wife of one of the attackers afterward. He is due to be sentenced on June 8.Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan.Advertisement
