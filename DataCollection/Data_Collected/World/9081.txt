The resolution, drafted by the United States, was approved 14-0, with one abstention, from Venezuela. The resolution followed a report this year by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that chlorine bombs had been used in the conflict, even after the Syrian government had signed the global treaty banning such munitions and had agreed to the destruction of its arsenal, which was basically completed by June. Like that report, the Security Council resolution did not specify which side in the conflict had used the chlorine bombs. But critics of the Syrian government, including the United States, have pointed out that the bombs had been seen dropped from helicopters, which are only possessed by the Syrian military.
