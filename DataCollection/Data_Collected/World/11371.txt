Putin of Russia on Tuesday and expressed Israel’s “grave concerns” regarding Russia’s decision to deliver a sophisticated air-defense missile system to Iran, according to a statement from Mr. Netanyahu’s office.The call came as Israel pressed its case against the preliminary deal reached this month between Iran and the world powers, including the United States, to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Netanyahu said he had told Mr. Putin that the sale of the S-300 missile system to Iran “will only encourage Iranian aggression in the region and further undermine the stability of the Middle East.”Mr. Netanyahu said in a separate statement that the sale was “a direct result of the dangerous deal on the table” between Iran and the world powers, adding, “Can anyone still seriously claim that the deal with Iran will enhance security in the Middle East?”Advertisement
