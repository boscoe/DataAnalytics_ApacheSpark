Benetton’s decision to contribute to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund came after a petition organized by an international advocacy group garnered more than one million signatures. Benetton had said it did not want to take part in compensation funds financed by companies that sourced clothes from the factory because of a “lack of clarity” around objectives. It said it would announce the amount it would pay into the fund by April 24. Advertisement
