The government of Ecuador is not entitled to recover about $600 million from two former bankers now living in South Florida, a Florida judge ruled Thursday. The government of Ecuador sued Roberto and William Isaías, Ecuadorean brothers who fled to Florida after the bank they ran in Ecuador, Filanbanco, failed in 1998. Ecuador’s government convicted the men of embezzling bank deposits and sued in Florida to recover the funds. After a trial this summer in Miami, Judge John W. Thornton ruled Thursday that the statute of limitations had expired, and the government had no standing to sue. The Isaías family has contributed large amounts of money to Democratic campaigns, including that of President Obama. The Ecuadorean government has accused the Isaías family of buying political protection from Washington while living comfortably in Miami off the profits of a looted bank.A version of this brief appears in print on October 16, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Ecuador: Government Loses Bank Case.
