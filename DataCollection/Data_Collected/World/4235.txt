ISTANBUL —  Turkey has sent more troops, along with armored vehicles and tanks, to northern Iraq to support a longstanding mission to train Kurdish and Sunni Arab forces in the fight against the Islamic State, touching off an uproar in Baghdad, where officials called the move a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.The troop movements on the outskirts of Mosul apparently came in recent days and were done in coordination with the autonomous Kurdish government in northern Iraq, but not with the central government in Baghdad. They prompted the Iraqi foreign ministry to summon the Turkish ambassador in protest on Saturday and demand that the forces withdraw from Iraq.In a statement, the foreign ministry called the Turkish troop movements a hostile act and said they had been made “without the knowledge of the Iraqi central government,” adding, “This is considered a violation and a breach of the sovereignty of the country.” Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and President Fuad Masum also voiced objections.Days earlier, Mr. Abadi, who came to power last year with the strong support of the United States, made a similarly tough statement in reaction to the United States’ plans to deploy Special Operations forces to Iraq to conduct raids against Islamic State targets. He wrote on Facebook, “Iraq doesn’t need foreign ground troops,” and added, “This will be considered an act of aggression.”
            The United States, Iraq and their allies are engaging the Islamic State on multiple fronts in an attempt to weaken the militants' defenses.        50 MILESKobaniTURKEYHasakaMosulAleppoErbilThe U.S. is arming Syrian Arab fighters who will join Kurdish combatants to attack Raqqa. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias, aided by U.S. airstrikes, retook the Baiji oil refinery from ISIS on Friday after contesting it for more than a year. Deir al-ZourHawijaISIScontrolareasIRAQHomsIRANTikritPalmyraLEBANONSYRIAIraqi forces have encircled Ramadi, which is defended by 600 to 1,000 militants, with the support of U.S. airstrikes and the Iraqi air force. DamascusBaghdadFallujaJORDAN50 MILESKobaniTURKEYHasakaMosulAleppoErbilThe U.S. is arming Syrian Arab fighters who will join Kurdish combatants to attack Raqqa. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias, aided by U.S. airstrikes, retook the Baiji oil refinery from ISIS on Friday after contesting it for more than a year. Deir al-ZourHawijaISIScontrolareasIRAQHomsTikritPalmyraLEBANONSYRIAIraqi forces have encircled Ramadi, which is defended by 600 to 1,000 militants, with the support of U.S. airstrikes and the Iraqi air force. BaghdadFalluja50 MILESTURKEYKobaniIraqi forces andShiite militias, aidedby U.S. airstrikes,retook the Baiji oilrefinery on Friday.SYRIAISIScontrolThe U.S. is armingSyrian Arab fighterswho will join Kurdishcombatants toattack Raqqa.PalmyraTikritHawijaIRAQBaghdadIraqi forces have encircledRamadi, which is defendedby 600 to 1,000 militants.JORDAN50 MILESTURKEYIraqi forces andShiite militias, aidedby U.S. airstrikes,retook the Baiji oilrefinery on Friday.SYRIAISIScontrolThe U.S. is armingSyrian Arab fighterswho will join Kurdishcombatants toattack Raqqa.TikritHawijaIRAQIraqi forces have encircledRamadi, which is defendedby 600 to 1,000 militants.The reactions of the Iraqi authorities to the growing military role of the United States and Turkey inside Iraq highlighted Mr. Abadi’s weakness as he seeks to balance his relationships with the West and Iran, which backs powerful militias in Iraq. Some of the leaders of those militias are popular on the Iraqi street and have sought to undermine Mr. Abadi, saying they will fight any foreign troops on Iraqi soil.AdvertisementIn an interview on Saturday, Hakim al-Zamili, the head of Parliament’s security committee and a Shiite militia leader, said the Iraqi military, if necessary, should strike the Turkish positions in the north.Advertisement“I have sent a letter to Abadi and told him that Iraqi sovereignty must be respected, and we have weapons and F-16 planes and must use them to hit the Turkish military force in Mosul, so no one will dare violate the sovereignty of Iraq,” he said.While a military confrontation seems unlikely, the controversy highlights the extent to which Iraq is divided, essentially split between areas controlled by the Islamic State, the northern Kurdish region, and a Shiite-dominated zone that includes Baghdad and the south and that represents the extent of the central government’s control.
                The ease of creating roads through the desert could limit the effectiveness of the offensive to cut off a key ISIS supply route.            For instance, Turkey has established its small military presence in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq without the approval of Baghdad. For nearly a year, it has trained a small group of largely Sunni Arab fighters. They are mostly former policemen from Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, which fell to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, last year.Turkish officials played down the new troop deployment, saying it was a routine move to support a continuing training mission in the north.“No one should interpret our help in a wrong way,” Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey said Saturday, in remarks reported by the semiofficial Anadolu News Agency. “Turkey does not have an eye on another country’s soil, and she would never have. Turkey’s struggle is against terror and terror organizations.” The news agency said 150 new troops had been deployed.Baghdad has been aware of Turkey’s presence but chose to publicly challenge it only now — underscoring, analysts say, the increasing pressure Mr. Abadi is facing from Iran and its proxies, including Iraq’s former prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. In a report published last month, Ayham Kamel, the director for the Middle East and North Africa at the political risk firm Eurasia Group, predicted that Mr. Abadi would likely be ousted sometime next year.
                More than a dozen countries have had attacks since the Islamic State, or ISIS, began to pursue a global strategy in the summer of 2014.            In the case of the United States, American officials say they negotiated with Mr. Abadi about the new deployments of Special Forces and believe his recent comments in defense of Iraqi sovereignty were made for domestic political reasons.AdvertisementStill, Mr. Abadi’s increasingly weak position in the face of Iranian pressure complicates matters for the United States as it considers increasing its military presence in Iraq to fight the Islamic State.While the deal reached by the West and Iran to curb Iran’s nuclear program raised hopes that Washington and Tehran could more closely coordinate campaigns against the Islamic State in Iraq, that now appears unlikely. The heads of powerful Iranian-backed militias have said they are willing to fight any new American troops in Iraq, as they did during the long American occupation after 2003.Rather than the United States’ and Iran’s becoming partners in the fight against the Islamic State, Iran’s presence in Iraq is seen as a constraint on the American military’s role there.Kirk H. Sowell, an analyst based in Amman, Jordan, and editor of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, wrote in an email, “The sending of ground forces to Iraq in any appreciable numbers would almost certainly open a new front in the war, with U.S. troops fighting Shia militias instead of Islamic State.”Falih Hassan contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Safak Timur from Istanbul.A version of this article appears in print on December 6, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: Influx of Turkish Troops Angers Iraqi Officials.
