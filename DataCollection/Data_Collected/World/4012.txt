JAKARTA, Indonesia —  The crash of an AirAsia passenger jet off Indonesia last year was caused by a technical fault and a failed attempt by the crew to deal with it, not by bad weather, investigators said on Tuesday.The plane, an Airbus A320-200, plummeted into the Java Sea less than an hour after taking off from the Indonesian city of Surabaya on Dec. 28, 2014, bound for Singapore. All 162 people aboard were killed.According to crash investigators, Flight 8501’s problems began when an alarm sounded in the cockpit four separate times, warning that an important computer system that helps control the plane’s rudder had failed. Someone then apparently tried to reset the system by removing and replacing a circuit breaker.An AirAsia passenger jet plunged into the Java Sea in late 2014 because of a faulty component coupled with the crew's response, a crash investigator said on Tuesday.That procedure is sometimes used on the ground, just as an office worker might turn a computer off and on again to clear a software problem. But doing so in flight had fatal consequences: It disengaged the plane’s autopilot and autothrust systems, and the pilots were unable to keep the aircraft under control, Soerjanto Tjahjono, the head of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, said Tuesday at a news conference in Jakarta.Advertisement“The circuit breaker was pulled out and then pushed in again,” he said. “It caused some electrical distraction.”AdvertisementMr. Soerjanto and crash investigators said they did not have audio or video evidence to determine who might have reset the computer’s circuit breaker. Asked whether it was a member of the cockpit crew, Mr. Soerjanto replied only, “Someone.”

Investigators said that contrary to early speculation, the weather did not play a role in the crash, even though Flight 8501 was flying in heavy storm clouds when the pilots lost control of the plane.The final investigation report, released after the news conference, cited several contributing factors. One was the failure of the plane’s rudder travel limiter system, which restricts rudder movement to a safe range when the aircraft is flying at high speed and high altitude. The investigators traced the failure to a cracked solder joint on a circuit board, “which led to a loss of electrical continuity.”Investigators said the airline’s maintenance records showed that the rudder limiter system on the aircraft had problems on 23 occasions in 2014.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The aircraft, flying at an altitude of 32,000 feet, then climbed at a steep angle for an additional 5,000 feet and stalled. It then rolled hard to the left again and began falling out of control, nose first, toward the water at a speed of 20,000 feet per minute.“The manual handling” after the autopilot was off “resulted in the aircraft entering a prolonged stall and upset condition, which was beyond the capability of the crew to recover,” the report said.AdvertisementThe national safety committee has issued several recommendations to AirAsia, Airbus and the aviation authorities in Indonesia, the United States and Europe regarding the crash, including that commercial pilots undergo flight simulator training for the type of emergency situation that doomed Flight 8501.A version of this article appears in print on December 2, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Circuit Breaker Is Cited in 2014 AirAsia Crash.
