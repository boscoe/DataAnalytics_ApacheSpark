As a Saudi-led coalition continued to launch airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen, one day after the operation’s name was changed from Decisive Storm to Renewal of Hope, online dispatches from Yemeni bloggers and activists were filled with anguish over the growing toll of the conflict.While residents of the capital, Sana, reported fewer strikes than on previous days, in the southern cities of Taiz and Aden fighting continued between forces under the nominal control of the exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and a rebel alliance that included militiamen loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
            Spoke to family in Aden :( 
War rages on there, worse than ever! Navy ships shelling advancing Houthis. Airstrikes in Taiz too! 
#Yemen 
            More and more civilians are killed by indiscriminate shooting and street fighting in #Aden. #YemenCrisis 
            It's now needed more than ever to say #KefayaWar! Kefayawar on #Aden, Taiz, Lahj, Dhalea & Mareb. Kefayawar on innocent civilians. #Yemen 
            What we really know so far, that #ceasefire is not really a ceasefire, since airstrikes targeted #Taiz early today #Yemen 
#Aden , #Taiz , #Mareb & #Shabwah are still open #battlefield-s #Yemen In Aden, where supporters of a southern separatist movement have taken up arms against an advance by northern Houthi militiamen, there were widespread reports of civilian casualties. They included children, some of whom seemed to have become inured to the sound of shelling in residential neighborhoods.
#Aden_is_under_Attack my daughter seems resilient towards sound of shells which r in a rapid increase these days

            The second phase of the operation in Yemen is not a ceasefire, but a shift from a strategic bombing campaign to one that will support 1/2        
            monitor, and sustain the new political agreement that is currently being negotiated based on UNSC resolution 2216. 2/2
