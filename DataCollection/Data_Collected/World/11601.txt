The police said that standard procedures appeared to have been violated by the forces, though they said it was unclear whether police officers or members of the Central Reserve Police Force were at fault.“They fired, but they should have used other means,” said S. J. M. Gillani, the inspector general of police in Kashmir, adding that tear gas could have been used to dispel the protesters. “They should use minimum force.”Pockets of Indian-administered Kashmir have been tense since Monday, when two men, one a militant and the other the brother of a militant, were killed in the southern region of Tral, according to the Press Trust of India. On Wednesday, the separatist leaders Syed Ali Shah Geelani and Masarat Alam led a rally in Srinagar during which the Pakistani flag was flown, and each was put under house arrest on Thursday. On Friday, Mr. Alam was taken into custody for antinational activities, according to the police, and Mr. Geelani called for a general strike over Mr. Alam’s detention. Protests broke out in some areas of Kashmir on Friday, and 21 police officers and three civilians were injured.The police said that the protest on Saturday, which happened in an area called Magam, was over Mr. Alam’s arrest.Kashmir has endured protracted protests against India in recent years, often resulting in dozens of civilian deaths. India’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and the local People’s Democratic Party formed a coalition government this year, a move that provoked anger among Kashmir’s separatist leaders.Advertisement
