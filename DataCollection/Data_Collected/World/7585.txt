Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday that he had appointed Nickolay E. Mladenov, a former foreign minister of Bulgaria who has been his special representative in Iraq, as his new Middle East peace envoy. Mr. Mladenov succeeds Robert H. Serry, a Dutch diplomat who has been in that post for more than seven years. A statement on the appointment, posted on the United Nations website, said Mr. Ban thanked Mr. Serry for “his dedicated service and excellent leadership” but gave no indication about Mr. Serry’s future, precisely when the change would take effect or who would replace Mr. Mladenov in Iraq.As head of the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Mr. Mladenov will be Mr. Ban’s representative to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. He will also represent Mr. Ban in the so-called Quartet group — the United Nations, the United States, Russia and the European Union — that has sought unsuccessfully for years to mediate a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Mr. Mladenov’s appointment comes as the Syrian civil war is about to enter its fourth year, Islamist militants have seized parts of Syria and Iraq and Israeli-Palestinian tensions have escalated sharply, with no peace talks planned. The 50-day Gaza war last summer, the expansion of Israeli settlements, sectarian strife in East Jerusalem and Palestinian moves seeking the prosecution of Israelis at the International Criminal Court for war crimes have increased tensions on both sides. Mr. Serry, in his last report to the Security Council on Jan. 15, described the conflict as having entered “a precarious phase.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
