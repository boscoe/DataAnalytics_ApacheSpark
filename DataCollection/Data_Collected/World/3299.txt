Peter Robinson, the first minister of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing government, said in an interview published Thursday that he would retire from politics now that his coalition with Irish Catholic leaders had been restored to a firm foundation. Mr. Robinson, the 66-year-old leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, which represents the British Protestant majority, said in The Belfast Telegraph that he planned to step down early next year as first minister of the regional government and as the Democratic Unionist leader. He has held both positions since 2008. Finance Minister Arlene Foster, one of the few prominent women in Mr. Robinson’s party, is expected to succeed him as first minister, and the Democratic Unionist deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, is the front-runner to become the next party leader. On Tuesday, Mr. Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of the Irish republican party Sinn Fein announced an agreement to ease disputes that had threatened to collapse their coalition.A version of this brief appears in print on November 20, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Northern Ireland: Top Political Figure Will Retire.
