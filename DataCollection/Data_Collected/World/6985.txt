The seizure of the official, Armel Ningatoloum Sayo, followed the brief kidnapping last week of a United Nations staff member and a French aid worker, highlighting the insecurity in the country despite the presence of French and United Nations peacekeepers. Tatiana Yangeko, Mr. Sayoâ€™s spokeswoman, said the minister had been driving his wife and his brother back from church when four gunmen emerged from a taxi and forced him out of the car. Education Minister Eloi Anguimate was nearly kidnapped on Sunday in Kaga Bandoro, about 185 miles north of Bangui, a government official said. Mr. Anguimate escaped, but his driver, his assistant and the mayor of the town were seized, the official said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Advertisement
