A young migrant worker who spent days trapped under mud and debris from building collapses caused by a landslide remains the only survivor pulled from the wreckage of the latest man-made disaster in China, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday.The man, Tian Zeming, whose age has been reported as 19 and 21 by different news agencies, spent 67 hours trapped in a building in an industrial area of the city of Shenzhen before rescuers were able to locate him and pull him out. The door panel that crushed his foot and trapped him also gave him the space he would need to survive, The Associated Press reported.The rescue was documented in dramatic detail by Chinese news agencies, with photographers following Mr. Tian through the halls of a nearby hospital as he was wheeled away for surgery.Chinese state news media on Wednesday showed the rescue of a migrant worker who was buried under rubble in Shenzhen for more than 60 hours.But more than 5,000 workers scouring the scene have been able to retrieve just four bodies, and 76 people remain missing.
                A landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.            Like other large Chinese cities that saw disasters this year, Shenzhen has grown into a crowded city by sacrificing basic safety measures for rapid economic growth. The landslide that destroyed 33 buildings in an industrial area of the town was caused by a huge pile of waste that had been dumped into a nearby quarry. When heavy rains made the ground unstable, the waste destroyed the structures and trapped people, some of whom are migrant workers who lived in dormitories, inside.AdvertisementChinese officials are being asked to explain a disaster in which the warning signs seemed clear: According to The Associated Press, The Legal Evening News said a district government report had warned of a “catastrophe” as recently as January, when the agency measured one million cubic meters of waste had filled the quarry.Officials also appear to be seeking out those who may be accountable for the deadly spill. On Wednesday, The Global Times reported that a manager at the dumpsite had been taken away by the police for questioning.Advertisement“Human life is the most precious, and precaution is of paramount importance. Relevant departments should take a closer look at safety to prevent such kind of things from happening again,” Chen Lijin, a rescue worker, told Xinhua News Agency.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
