The students, who were from 20 to 23 years old, had been waiting for a bus to take them to their academy, which is in Cairo, said Gen. Abdel Rahman Sharah, a security official in Kafr el-Sheikh. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing, which fit a pattern of attacks by militants who have killed hundreds of soldiers, police officers and members of the state security forces over the past 18 months.
