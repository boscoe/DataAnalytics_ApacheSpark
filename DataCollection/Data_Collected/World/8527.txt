The government has officially licensed 10,000 cargo vessels and 700 passenger ferries, but many thousands operate without licenses, said Shafiqul Haq, director of marine safety and traffic management with Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority.The most common reasons for ferry accidents are overloading, human error, safety violations and unpredictable weather, Mr. Haq said. He said that what led to Sunday’s collision on the Padma River was under investigation.Among the dead were 25 women and 15 children, said Rashida Ferdouse, the top civil servant of the Manikganj district.“We have recovered the ferry and called off the search for more bodies,” Ms. Ferdouse said by telephone.Advertisement
