A group of Irish women who have traveled abroad to have abortions posted images of their faces online on Thursday as part of a new social media campaign to destigmatize the procedure and build support to change the law that makes it nearly impossible to legally terminate a pregnancy in Ireland.Images of 11 women appear on the home page of the new website, called the X-ile Project, along with a statement that encourages more women who felt cast out by their homeland at a time when they needed support to add their portraits to the gallery.“Our objective is to give a much-needed face to women who have effectively been exiled from Ireland and ignored due to unduly strict abortion laws,” the women write.

            Please support @thexileproject We shouldn't have to put names/faces to private abortion stories but is worth it if it helps #repealthe8th “It is estimated that 12 women a day on average travel outside of Ireland to access abortion services,” two of the activists behind the project, Laura Lovejoy and Julie Morrissy, explained in an email. “Almost everyone in Ireland knows someone who has been forced to travel for an abortion, although for many the stigma prevents them from talking about it.”Advertisement“In showing these images, we aim to demonstrate that those who choose to travel to have an abortion are responsible, ordinary women who can and should be able to make important decisions about their own lives,” they added.AdvertisementThe women also said that the project’s name was a reference to a 1992 case in which a suicidal 14-year-old rape victim (publicly identified only as “X”) was blocked from travelling to Britain for an abortion by the attorney general of Ireland. After the girl’s parents appealed the travel ban, Ireland’s Supreme Court overturned it, ruling that abortion was permitted in cases in which the pregnancy poses a threat to a woman’s life.After the site launched, one of the participants, Tara Flynn, an actress and comedian, encouraged other women to take part.

Senator Jim Walsh denounced what he called “the abortion holocaust” taking place outside Ireland in remarks on Thursday.
