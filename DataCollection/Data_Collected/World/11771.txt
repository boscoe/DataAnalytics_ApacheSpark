A steady stream of boats has been arriving daily to its shores, confronting the country and the European Union with a humanitarian crisis.“Either we have policies,” he told the lower house of Italy’s Parliament, “or we go nowhere.”He added, “We are asking Europe to be Europe, not just when it’s time to devise a budget.”Mr. Renzi called for the European Union to have a more coordinated strategy, including expanding search-and-rescue patrols and taking action against smugglers in Libya and elsewhere, whom he referred to as “21st-century slave drivers.”He also evoked an idea that has previously circulated in Brussels: the establishment of migration centers in African countries, in cooperation with the United Nations, so that would-be migrants could apply for asylum in the European Union from their home countries rather than set off on potentially deadly journeys in search of refuge in Europe.On Thursday, European leaders are expected to discuss proposals to double the size of search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean; increase the budget for Frontex, the European Union’s border agency; improve cooperation between the police across the bloc; and intensify the battle against smugglers and human traffickers.There were about 17 times as many refugee deaths from January to April this year as there were during the same period last year.European Union officials said on Wednesday that the current budget for the bloc’s border protection operation, known as Triton, was about 3 million euros, or $3.2 million, a month, and that the operation’s resources included two aircraft, two helicopters, six coastal patrol vessels and about 65 officers. Even doubling that would probably not be enough to deal with the scale of the migration crisis, analysts said.The number of people who have died in the Mediterranean Sea this year is thought to have already reached 1,727 migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration — more than 30 times last year’s death toll.However, efforts to forge a common and robust European approach to immigration have faced several challenges in recent years, including weak political will at a time when budgets are stretched and far-right parties that have gained in popularity across the Continent by tapping into resentment against immigrants.The efforts to forge a new European strategy on immigration have also been stymied by the fact that migration policy in the 28-member union is mostly the preserve of national governments rather than Brussels.Dan Bilefsky reported from London, and Jim Yardley from Catania, Sicily.
