The flight data recorder was found under part of the plane’s wing and brought to the surface early in the morning, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, head of the national search and rescue agency. Searchers will continue to try to locate the other black box, the cockpit voice recorder. They are vital to understanding what brought Flight 8501 down, killing all 162 people on board. The flight data recorder will be taken to Jakarta, the capital, for analysis. It could take up to two weeks to download its data, said Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at the National Committee for Safety Transportation. Search efforts have been consistently hampered by big waves and powerful currents created by the region’s rainy season. So far, 48 bodies have been recovered. videoAdvertisement
