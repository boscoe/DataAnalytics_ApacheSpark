BERLIN — It is announced that Prince Bismarck, together with a syndicate of Hamburg financiers, will establish a large brewery at Friedrichsruhe, with a capital of 600,000 marks. The brewery will, it is estimated, produce about 25,000 hectoliters of beer yearly. The Hamburg Association will own the brewery for fifty years, paying the ex-Chancellor and his heirs during that time the sum of 3,000 marks for the rent, Prince Bismarck reserving the right for his heirs to buy up the concern at the termination of the fifty years. The promoters are confident that the export trade will be large, owing in a great measure to the Prince’s popularity abroad. — The New York Herald, European Edition, November 3, 1890
