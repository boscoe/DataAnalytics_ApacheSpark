The mass killings of Shiite security forces from Camp Speicher, a former American base outside the predominantly Sunni city of Tikrit, have become a symbol of the brutality of Islamic State fighters. The burial sites, on the dictator Saddam Hussein’s presidential compound, were exhumed days after Islamic State militants were driven from the city. Khalid al-Atbi, an Iraqi health official working with the forensic team sent to Tikrit, called it “a heartbreaking scene,” adding, “We couldn’t prevent ourselves from breaking down in tears.” Advertisement
