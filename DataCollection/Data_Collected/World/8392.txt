An armed group in South Sudan has abducted at least 89 boys in a northern state, the United Nations children’s agency said Saturday. The boys, some as young as 13, were abducted from their homes near Malakal, the capital of Upper Nile State, according to a Unicef statement. Malakal, which is currently under government control, has recently been the scene of intense fighting between rebel forces and government troops. Watchdog groups have accused South Sudan’s warring factions of recruiting and using child soldiers. South Sudanese officials strongly denied the allegations. Rebels have not responded to the charges. Last year 12,000 children were used as soldiers by armed forces and groups across South Sudan, according Unicef.A version of this brief appears in print on February 22, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: South Sudan: Gunmen Kidnap 89 Boys, Unicef Says.
