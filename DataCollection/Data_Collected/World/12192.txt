A United Nations panel on North Korean human rights abuses, organized by the United States delegation at the organization’s New York headquarters, briefly degenerated into shouting and disorder Thursday when three North Korean diplomats disrupted the event to deliver a statement denying any wrongdoing in their country. The diplomats interrupted North Korean defectors who were testifying about the deprivations they said they had endured. The United States ambassador, Samantha Power, threatened to call in United Nations security guards to evict the North Korean diplomats, but they left after about six minutes. Ms. Power said  that the North Korean diplomats had been invited to speak but only after the defectors had spoken, “and unfortunately, as you heard, the delegation chose instead to try to drown out the testimony of these panelists.” She also told the defectors, “It must be chilling for those of you who have been subjected to the terror of the regime to be confronted with bullying and disruption and the kind of behavior that we saw today.” North Korea has become increasingly angry over actions by the United Nations during the past few years, most notably a human rights report that described much of the country as a large penal colony and called for possible prosecution of North Korean leaders at the International Criminal Court. The United Nations Security Council has tightened sanctions against North Korea because of its nuclear weapons and missile tests. The North Korean authorities have accused the United States of orchestrating such actions as part of what they call an American plot to destabilize their country.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
