Tajik authorities banned the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan this week, with a local court labeling it a terrorist organization. Thirteen leading party members were arrested, accused of having links to armed violence that rattled the country and left more than 40 people dead. The party has maintained that it is not connected with the violence. “We call upon the Tajik authorities to ensure that any measures taken in the fight against ‘terrorism’ or ‘extremism’ are fully in line with international human rights law,” the spokeswoman, Ravina Shamdasani, said in a statement that was published online. Tajikistan is a former member of the Soviet Union.Advertisement
