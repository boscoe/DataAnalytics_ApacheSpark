At about 11:20 a.m. Wednesday, at least two men armed with AK-47 assault rifles arrived looking for the Charlie Hebdo offices. They first went to the wrong address, but frightened witnesses waved them off. They then forced a woman entering the newspaper’s offices to let them in. The men killed a guard in the lobby and went to the second floor, where they fired at journalists in a news meeting, officials said.
