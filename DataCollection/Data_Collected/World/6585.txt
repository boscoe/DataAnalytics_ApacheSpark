Greek and Belgian officials had said earlier that there was no connection between the arrest of more than half a dozen people on Saturday in Athens and events last week in Belgium, where the police carried out deadly raids. But, the Belgian prosecutors said, “further analysis of the elements of our investigation gave us enough reasons to ask for the extradition of one of the persons that were arrested yesterday by the Greek authorities.” Advertisement
