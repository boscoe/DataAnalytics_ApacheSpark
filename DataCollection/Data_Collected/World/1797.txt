President Alassane Ouattara was set to claim a landslide victory Wednesday after results of weekend voting were released in 19 of 31 regions. Mr. Ouattara, 73, an economist educated in the United States and formerly an official at the International Monetary Fund, received 83.6 percent of the preliminary vote tally, the Independent Electoral Commission reported early Wednesday. Mr. Ouattara’s victory has been seen as all but assured. The nation’s growth rate, about 8 percent for each of the past three years, is twice that of the rest of the countries in the region.Sunday’s vote was the first peaceful presidential election in Ivory Coast for more than two decades. Five years ago, Mr. Ouattara narrowly won a runoff against the incumbent, Laurent Gbagbo, who refused to give up power for months. Ouattara supporters planned this week to celebrate his victory with a concert at the Golf Hôtel where he was blockaded during that standoff, which left about 3,000 people dead. Mr. Ouattara said at a news conference that the tally “definitely shows we have turned the page from the crisis our country went through.”A version of this brief appears in print on October 28, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Ivory Coast: Early Tally Shows President Poised for Win.
