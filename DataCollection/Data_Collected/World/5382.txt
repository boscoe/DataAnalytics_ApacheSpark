A Uighur muezzin called the evening prayer from a mosque rooftop in the old city of Kashgar, in Xinjiang Province. China’s government has taken measures aimed at shaping the behavior and beliefs of the country’s 10 million Uighurs, the Turkic-speaking Muslim minority that considers this region its homeland. Officials have banned mosques from broadcasting the call to prayer, forcing muezzins to shout out the invocation five times a day from rooftops across the city.    CreditAdam Dean for The New York Times1 of 8
