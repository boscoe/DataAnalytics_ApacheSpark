BUENOS AIRES —  The former wife of a federal prosecutor who died of a gunshot wound to the head after making explosive accusations against Argentina’s president charged Thursday that he had been murdered — reviving a bitter debate here over the mysterious circumstances shrouding his death.Citing a report by investigators she had hired, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, a judge and the former wife of Alberto Nisman, said at a news conference, “Suicide and an accident are totally ruled out, so we can only conclude that Nisman was without doubt the victim of a homicide.”The official investigation into Mr. Nisman’s death, which has shaken the country and turned Argentines into armchair detectives, has yet to establish whether he shot himself or was killed.“Nothing allows me to categorically assert today that it was suicide or homicide,” Viviana Fein, the prosecutor leading the investigation, said Thursday.AdvertisementMr. Nisman’s body was found in a bathroom of his apartment in Buenos Aires on Jan. 18, hours before he was to appear before a commission to elaborate on criminal accusations he had filed against President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.AdvertisementIn a 289-page complaint, Mr. Nisman accused Mrs. Kirchner of conspiring to shield Iranian officials from responsibility in the bombing of a Jewish community center here in 1994 that killed 85 people.
                A prosecutor in Argentina accuses the president of attempting to cover up a secret deal to shield terrorists. Days later, the prosecutor is found dead and the president alleges a conspiracy. An overview of key developments in the case.            He contended that the Argentine government had sought the arrangement as part of a trade pact with Iran. This week, the prosecutor who revived Mr. Nisman’s case appealed a judge’s decision to dismiss the complaint against Mrs. Kirchner.Ms. Arroyo Salgado said the investigation she commissioned had given “scientific rigor” to her belief that Mr. Nisman was killed. She said she hoped the report would help guide the official inquiry.The judge overseeing that investigation will consider Ms. Arroyo Salgado’s report when evaluating all the evidence, said Martin Böhmer, a law professor at the University of Buenos Aires.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

That, she said, contradicted autopsy findings suggesting suicide. Also, the pistol used was found on the bathroom floor.Ms. Arroyo Salgado’s comments come amid an onslaught of claims and counterclaims about the events surrounding Mr. Nisman’s death.A news agency under the authority of a government ministry, for instance, wrongly said this week that Mr. Nisman was drunk at the time of his death and reported that there had been an open bottle of vodka in his apartment. On Thursday, it backtracked on that account.Mrs. Kirchner has suggested that Mr. Nisman was killed after being manipulated by forces trying to destabilize her government, and she has cast suspicion on a former spymaster who worked with the prosecutor on the bombing investigation.A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Prosecutor in Argentina Was Killed, Ex-Wife Says.
