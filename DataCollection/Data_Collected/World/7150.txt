The agency’s report came two weeks after it announced that Mr. Rezaian, 38, had been formally charged and that his case would be heard by Iran’s Revolutionary Court. Mr. Rezaian’s family, American officials and The Post have all urged Iran to free him and have questioned why the charges have not been made public. Mr. Rezaian, a dual Iranian-American citizen, has been denied access to a lawyer. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said in a statement this month, “It is appalling and outrageous that Jason remains behind bars.” Advertisement
