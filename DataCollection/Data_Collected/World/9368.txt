Nearly all are now in Sierra Leone and Guinea; the health authorities have not reported any new cases in Liberia in the past two weeks.He said that health workers now had the facilities they need to curb the epidemic and that they had developed tactics that had proved to work. The remaining challenge is to build trust in the communities where health workers still encounter resistance, Dr. Aylward said; until that happens, predicting the end of the crisis is “a bit of a crapshoot.”To stay on track, the United Nations-led program fighting Ebola needs $400 million by the end of June, including $125 million for the World Health Organization, he said, adding that at the moment it has enough money in hand to continue only through the end of April.Advertisement
