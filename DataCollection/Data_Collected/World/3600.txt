They are scheduled to compete in a runoff on Dec. 27. Haiti’s Provisional Electoral Council said Mr. Moïse had received 33 percent of the vote to Mr. Célestin’s 25 percent. The announcement by the nine-member council set off a new wave of protests around Port-au-Prince, above, where supporters of Moise Jean Charles, one of the leading candidates from a field of 54, denounced the results.
