Comey, told the Polish ambassador to the United States that he regretted recent remarks that Polish officials had said amounted to an accusation of complicity in the Holocaust, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. Mr. Comey’s remarks, published in The Washington Post last week, prompted an outcry in Poland. “In their minds, the murderers and accomplices of Germany, and Poland and Hungary, and so many, many other places didn’t do something evil,” he said last week. “They convinced themselves it was the right thing to do, the thing they had to do.” Poland said the passage wrongly implied it was complicit in the Nazi genocide of European Jews. In a letter to the Polish ambassador released by the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Comey said: “I regret linking Germany and Poland because Poland was invaded and occupied by Germany. The Polish state bears no responsibility for the horrors imposed by the Nazis. I wish I had not used any other country names because my point was a universal one about human nature.” Poland now considers the matter settled, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Advertisement
