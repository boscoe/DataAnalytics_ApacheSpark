The disruption began during the morning rush hour with slow-moving convoys of taxis. Later, cabdrivers blocked a major downtown intersection. A police officer on a bicycle suffered minor injuries when he was clipped by a taxi. A television crew also recorded a taxi driver pounding on a small sedan carrying an Uber passenger. John Tory, the city’s mayor, said that the city was enforcing current laws against Uber while developing additional regulations. But Mr. Tory condemned the protest. “Dangerous and divisive tactics do nothing to address these issues,” he said. Advertisement
