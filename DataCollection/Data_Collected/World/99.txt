Saeed Abedini, the Iranian-American pastor serving an eight-year prison term in Iran on charges of undermining national security, could face additional charges, including links to antigovernment groups, his wife, Naghbeh Abedini, said Thursday. Mrs. Abedini, of Boise, Idaho, said she had learned that her husband could face a hearing on such charges through his parents in Iran. Mr. Abedini, 35, is one of three Americans of Iranian descent imprisoned in Iran. Mrs. Abedini expressed hope that all three could still be released in the aftermath of the Iran nuclear agreement. Iranian officials have recently hinted about the possibility of a prisoner exchange with the United States.A version of this brief appears in print on October 2, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Middle East; Iran: Detainee May Face More Charges.
