AL MUKALLA, Yemen —  Militants from Al Qaeda’s affiliate in Yemen tightened their grip on this coastal city in the country’s south on Friday, driving soldiers away with mortar fire so that the city was left undefended, witnesses said.The Qaeda fighters first entered Al Mukalla on Thursday and seized crucial government buildings, including a presidential palace. On Friday, residents fled to the outskirts of the city, as military commanders and their troops abandoned their bases, leaving behind American-made Humvee vehicles and other equipment to be seized by looters or the advancing fighters from the affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.The storming of Al Mukalla, Yemen’s fifth-largest city, was the group’s boldest attack since the start of a military offensive led by Saudi Arabia against the Houthis 10 days ago. The relative ease with which the militants captured large parts of the city raised fears of a broader expansion by the Sunni extremists, who have proved adept in the past at exploiting turmoil in Yemen to capture territory.Saudi officials have said their military action was aimed at driving the Houthis, a former rebel movement from northern Yemen, out of territory they had captured over the past eight months, and at restoring Yemen’s exiled president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to power. A Saudi military spokesman said on Friday that the effort was making progress, and that the Houthi units were increasingly isolated from their leadership and consumed with internal squabbles.AdvertisementBut the Houthis, who already control Sana, the capital, have proved stubborn foes, killing at least three Saudi soldiers during border skirmishes. They have been able to advance across Yemen and are now fighting for control of Aden, the second-largest city, which lies west of Al Mukalla along the southern coast. In an effort to prop up fighters who are resisting the Houthis, the Saudi military airdropped boxes of weapons and ammunition into the city on Friday, according to local news media reports.

Relief agencies have warned about the quickly escalating humanitarian cost of the war. The United Nations humanitarian relief coordinator, Valerie Amos, said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in fighting over the past two weeks, including more than 90 children. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, amid increasing shortages of food and medicine, she added.AdvertisementAden has been shaken by the worst of the fighting, which has killed dozens of civilians. Medical workers have also been caught up in the violence. The International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement that two brothers who had been working for the Yemen Red Crescent Society were shot dead Friday, as they shuttled wounded people to an ambulance.Residents of Aden have had difficulty fleeing the incessant clashes. The Chinese government was able to evacuate 225 foreigners from 10 countries on Thursday by sea aboard a Chinese Navy ship, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One Yemeni official, citing treasury officials, put the amount the militants retrieved at tens of millions of dollars. They also attacked Al Mukalla’s main prison, freeing hundreds of inmates including a senior leader of the Qaeda group.The city was left in a state of “panic and fear,” said a resident who gave only his first name, Muhammed. “It is hard to believe that Mukalla could be controlled this quickly by Al Qaeda, amidst the complete absence of the security forces,” he said.Saeed Al-Batati reported from Al Mukalla and Kareem Fahim from Cairo.A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page A3 of the New York edition with the headline: Qaeda Affiliate Pushes Military Out of Major Yemeni City.
