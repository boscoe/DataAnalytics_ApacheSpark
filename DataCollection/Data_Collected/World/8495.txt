They said that cases were surging again, but that Saudi health officials and scientists appeared unable to explain where the infections start and how they spread. Scientists and public health experts from the World Health Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health visited Saudi Arabia last week to investigate. MERS causes coughing, fever and breathing problems, and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Initial studies have linked the virus to camels, but disease experts note that many infected people report no contact with camels. The W.H.O. says 1,026 confirmed cases — including at least 376 deaths — have been reported since MERS emerged in 2012. About 85 percent have been in Saudi Arabia. Advertisement
