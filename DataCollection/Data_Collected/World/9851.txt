Nagorno-Karabakh is inside Azerbaijan but is controlled by its majority ethnic Armenian population. The two neighbors fought a war over it in the 1990s. Defense officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said three Armenian soldiers were killed in an attack by Azerbaijani commandos. Azerbaijan accused separatists of setting off the clash and said 20 Armenian soldiers were killed or wounded. Advertisement
