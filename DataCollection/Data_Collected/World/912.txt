Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, who has been found guilty of espionage in Iran after a secret trial, learned about his conviction by watching a state television broadcast in Evin Prison and is despondent about the case, his family reported Tuesday. Mr. Rezaian’s brother, Ali Rezaian, said their mother had been permitted to visit the prison on Tuesday and had described Mr. Rezaian as “terribly depressed.” The Iranian authorities, who have been holding him for nearly 15 months, have provided no clarity on the exact nature of the espionage conviction, which was first reported by the Iran state news media this week. The Washington Post, the United States government and Mr. Rezaian’s supporters have all denounced the outcome. Mr. Rezaian, 39, from Marin County, Calif., is one of three dual Iranian-American citizens imprisoned in Iran. Iranian officials have dropped hints that they would consider trading the three for Iranians held by the United States on sanctions violations. But there have been no other public indications that such an exchange may be envisioned.A version of this brief appears in print on October 14, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Post Reporter ‘Terribly Depressed’ by Conviction.
