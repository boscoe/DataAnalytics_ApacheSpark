The report said the conflict in the region, where the militant Islamist group Boko Haram has targeted educational institutions, has kept many children out of classes for more than a year, “putting them at risk of dropping out of school altogether.” The report said that more than 2,000 schools in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger remain closed because of the violence and that “hundreds have been attacked, looted or set on fire.” Advertisement
