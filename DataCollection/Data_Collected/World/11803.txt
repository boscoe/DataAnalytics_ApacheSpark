The Russian Interior Ministry, which runs the police, said Mr. Kadyrov’s order was “unacceptable.” Since 2004, Mr. Kadyrov has governed under the auspices of President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Kadyrov, above, was angered by the killing of a wanted man in Chechnya on Sunday in an operation carried out by federal forces stationed in Chechnya and officers from a nearby region. He said Wednesday: “Open fire if someone from Moscow or Stavropol, it doesn’t matter, appears on your turf without your knowledge.” But on Thursday he said he was Mr. Putin’s “foot soldier” and would never question his authority.
