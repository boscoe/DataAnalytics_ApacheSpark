WASHINGTON — As the first step in a shipping program designed to provide Great Britain with fast cargo carriers, the United States, it was learned in an authoritative quarter tonight [Dec. 18], is seeking a way to take over thirty or more Danish-flag vessels which have been tied up in American ports since the German occupation of that country. The question of legal authority to take over the ships and pay for them is still under discussion. One authority said it might be necessary to ask Congress for legislation covering such action. Danish ship owners, who refuse to recognize the German conquest of Denmark, are said to have recently been negotiating with American operators in New York for disposition of the vessels. It was said a sale would first have to be sanctioned by the Maritime Commission, and it was believed the commission in such event would give Britain first call on the tonnage. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 19, 1940
