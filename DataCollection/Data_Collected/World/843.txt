Mr. Mackin shot the officer and then shot and killed himself, the authorities said. The woman was shot as well, and was listed in critical condition at a hospital Monday night.The episode took place in the village of Omeath, near the border with Northern Ireland. There has been only one other fatal shooting of a police officer in the nation in the last 14 years, during a bank robbery in 2013 about 12 miles away from Omeath.Mr. Mackin was being prosecuted on charges of involvement in a dissident Irish Republican Army splinter group. The area around Omeath is represented in Parliament by Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political party formerly linked to the I.R.A., which has disbanded.Mr. Adams condemned the shooting on Monday and said there was no support for violent splinter groups. “All of that has now dwindled away into the type of criminality which has robbed this garda of his life,” he told R.T.E., the national broadcaster, using the Irish word for policeman.Ireland’s legal system has come under intense scrutiny recently, after it emerged that a man arrested in connection with a violent burglary had 120 previous convictions and was free on bail. About 1,500 people held a public meeting last week to discuss combating rural crime in the country.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
