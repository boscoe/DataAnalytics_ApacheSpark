Views of Georgetown, the capital of Guyana, in 1962, without sound. British Pathé.LONDON — The British government announced today [Nov. 19] that British Guiana will become independent on May 26 and will be known as Guyana. Colonial Secretary Anthony Greenwood said that Guyana will ask for Commonwealth membership. The new country, in South America, will remain a monarchy with a governor-general appointed by Queen Elizabeth. Mr. Greenwood said Britain would be very happy to consult other Commonwealth members on admitting Guyana to membership and would be willing to sponsor Guyana’s membership at the United Nations. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 20, 1965
