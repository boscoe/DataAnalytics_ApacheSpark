Ground forces were not involved.Turkey pledged to take a more active role in combating the Islamic State terrorist group in July, as part of a multipronged offensive in which the military increased attacks on Kurdish militants.Since then, the Turkish military has primarily concentrated on hitting its old rival, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, although Turkish air bases have also been used by jets from the United States-led coalition, which Turkey is part of, to hit Islamic State targets in northern Syria.The Islamic State’s fighters control large swaths of territory along the Turkish border, and the group is linked to a recent suicide bomb attack on a peace rally in Ankara that killed more than 100 people.The bombing raids come at a sensitive time for the Turkish government, as it attempts to act decisively after criticism for failing to prevent the Ankara attack, the deadliest in modern Turkey’s story.At the same time, most Turks hold deep misgivings about any deeper involvement in the Syria conflict, and the opposition has strongly criticized President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his foreign policy in the run-up to Sunday’s parliamentary vote.
