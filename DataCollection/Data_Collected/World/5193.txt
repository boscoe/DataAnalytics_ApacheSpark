SAN DIEGO — A Mission Bay, Calif., high school teacher disclosed today [Dec. 23] that the California Credentials Committee has challenged her qualifications because of a one-act play she wrote entitled ‘‘A Cat Called Jesus.’’ Mrs. Geri Turner Davis, 31, a drama instructor, said the committee had told her to consider resignation or a hearing. The play deals with the friendship between a Negro held in a Southern jail on a charge of murder and the white daughter of the sheriff. Critics charged that a situation in the play — in which the daughter helps plot the escape of the murder suspect — is immoral and sets a bad example for youth. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 24, 1965
