The exchange, while made public now, actually took place in mid-October, Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense said in a statement. China released two officers from Taiwan’s Bureau of Military Intelligence, and they were returned to Taiwan. The men, Chu Kung-hsun and Hsu Chang-kuo, had been arrested in Vietnam near the border with China in 2006 and given life sentences, which were later reduced to 20 years, according to the Taiwanese newspaper China Times, which first reported the exchange. A Chinese spy imprisoned in Taiwan, Li Zhihao, was given early parole as part of the exchange, Charles Chen, a spokesman for Taiwan’s presidential office, said in a statement. The exchange of spies, Mr. Chen said, was a sign of improved relations between China and Taiwan. Advertisement
