Burkina Faso’s transitional government is trying to negotiate the surrender of the leader of a failed coup attempt, officials announced Wednesday. The coup leader, Gen. Gilbert Diendéré, sought refuge Tuesday in the Vatican Embassy in Ouagadougou, the capital, after troops moved in to seize the barracks of the elite presidential guard unit that had staged the coup. The interim president, Michel Kafando, said there were no casualties from the assault on the barracks. Only 15 to 20 members of the guard unit, which once numbered 1,300, ultimately refused to surrender, said a military spokesman, Capt. Guy Hervé Ye, adding that they were detained without bloodshed.A version of this brief appears in print on October 1, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Burkina Faso: Coup Leader Finds Haven.
