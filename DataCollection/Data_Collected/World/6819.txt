The court dropped the charge of attempted suicide against the activist, Irom Sharmila, witnesses at the court said. Since beginning her protest against heavy-handed security tactics, Ms. Sharmila, 42, has been kept in custody in a hospital in Manipur State and fed forcibly by a tube since 2000 under the anti-suicide law. She said she would continue her fast until the government scrapped the security law, which is in effect in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir and in northeastern areas like Manipur where separatist insurgents are operating.Advertisement
