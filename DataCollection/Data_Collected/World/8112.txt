As China continues to debate the problem of ill-mannered travelers, the website of the Communist Party-run People’s Daily has issued a list of instances of foreign tourists behaving badly.“Spring Festival’s Golden Week has arrived, and lots of Chinese people are traveling,” People’s Daily Online said. “It’s always said that Chinese people can be uncivilized, but in fact it’s not uncommon for foreigners, either.”The short, photograph-heavy graphic lists a series of recent incidents, some scandalous, some picayune. First on its list is a pair of American sisters arrested for taking nude photographs at the Angkor temple complex in Cambodia in early February.Foreigners camping atop the Great Wall, urinating on a highway median in Shanghai and taking a dip in a scenic lake despite a sign banning swimming are also mentioned. Photographs of a boy who spilled popcorn, or two people taking up a park bench meant for four, capture less-famous offenses by foreign tourists.The bad behavior of Chinese tourists has received close attention at home, particularly after a group was caught on video berating staff members on a flight from Bangkok after being unable to sit together. One woman threw hot water and instant noodles at a flight attendant, and a man threatened to bomb the plane, which was forced to return to Bangkok. Chinese tourism authorities criticized the group for the outburst, and China has begun considering the creation of a blacklist for travelers who cause disruptions.People’s Daily Online ends its critique of universal bad behavior with guidelines for civilized travel. “Cutting in lines is weak,” it says in a list peppered with Internet-friendly neologisms. “Now it’s popular to stand in line!”
