Lawyers acting for WikiLeaks and its fugitive editor, Julian Assange, said Monday that they were exploring possible legal action against the American government and Google over the seizure of emails and other data belonging to three of the whistle-blowing organization’s journalists. A lawyer for WikiLeaks, Michael Ratner, told journalists in Geneva that the group had written on Monday to Google’s chairman, Eric Schmidt, and to American officials demanding details and explanations for “search and seizure” warrants issued to Google by the Department of Justice in March 2012. In response to the warrants, Google turned over to law enforcement authorities all data associated with the accounts of the journalists, Mr. Ratner said. WikiLeaks said it was “astonished and disturbed” that Google had waited more than two and a half years to notify the journalists that the authorities had issued the warrants, denying them the opportunity to oppose them in court. A Google spokesman said that its policy was to inform people about government requests for their data “except in limited cases, like when we are gagged by a court order, which sadly happens quite often.”A version of this brief appears in print on January 27, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: WikiLeaks Assails Google and the U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
