A bomb was set off outside a Hindu temple in northern Bangladesh early Saturday, wounding at least six people, the police said. The bomb exploded outside the Kantajew temple in the Dinajpur District, where about 1,500 people had gathered to watch an open-air folk performance as part of a fair in the area, said Iltutmish, a police official in the district. The motive for the attack and the identity of the attackers were not clear on Saturday. The fair, which has been held in the district for years, includes secular cultural events and often has many non-Hindu attendees, Mr. Iltutmish said. The Hindu population in Bangladesh has been dwindling for decades, down to about 8 percent of the total population of the largely Muslim country in 2011. The government has denied that the Islamic State is carrying out attacks in the country, instead identifying suspects associated with the Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party associated with the political opposition. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attack. Mohammad Ruhul Amin, the police superintendent in Dinajpur, said that at least four people had been detained for questioning in connection with the attack, but that no arrests had been made.A version of this brief appears in print on December 6, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Bangladesh: Bomb Explodes at Temple.
