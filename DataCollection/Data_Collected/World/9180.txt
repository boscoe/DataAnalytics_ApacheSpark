BEIRUT —  An American-led coalition airstrike in Syria hit an oil refinery run by Islamic State militants near the border with Turkey on Sunday, killing 30 people, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the observatory, a monitoring group based in Britain, said the dead were refinery workers and militants. The targeted refinery was just northeast of the town of Tel Abyad near the Turkish border, he said.A spokesman for the United States Combined Joint Task Force overseeing the fight against the Islamic State said that when accusations of civilian casualties caused by the coalition are deemed credible, a thorough investigation begin.The Islamic State has seized wide areas of Syria and Iraq, including oil-producing regions that have financed its activities.In November, the United Nations estimated the Islamic State’s revenue from oil at $846,000 to $1.6 million a day. However, the Pentagon says oil is no longer the group’s main source of revenue. Western diplomats have said this was because of airstrikes on oil installations and a plunge in global oil prices.A version of this article appears in print on March 9, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Refinery in Syria Is Target of Airstrike.
