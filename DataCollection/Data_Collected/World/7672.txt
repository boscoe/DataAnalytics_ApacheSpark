The attacks, on Friday night and early Saturday, were the latest spasm of violence in a nationwide transportation blockade called by the opposition to press Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and call new elections. The attacks raised the death toll to 63 since the blockade started Jan. 6. The opposition has called for a 72-hour nationwide general strike on Sunday. Advertisement
