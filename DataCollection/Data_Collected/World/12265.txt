About 500 students spent Thursday night outside the United States Embassy in Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, asking the United States for protection as street protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term went into their sixth day. In the Musaga neighborhood, protesters marched past smoldering barricades on Friday while brandishing sticks and metal bars. They tried to reach a major road but were stopped by a cordon of riot police officers. The demonstrators turned in their sticks, sang the national anthem and after a minute of silence marched back into the neighborhood. Many protesters say they will not leave the streets until Mr. Nkurunziza withdraws his candidacy.A version of this brief appears in print on May 2, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Burundi: U.S. Protection Sought.
