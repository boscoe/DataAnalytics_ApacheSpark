The electoral overhaul, which becomes law after more than a year of discussion in both chambers of Parliament, is a central part of Mr. Renzi’s political and economic agenda. The legislation, which takes effect in July 2016, is based on proportional representation but guarantees a big majority to the winning party and gives party bosses wide powers to handpick preferred candidates. Mr. Renzi says it will provide political stability to Italy, which has already seen four different governments since the start of the decade. Advertisement
