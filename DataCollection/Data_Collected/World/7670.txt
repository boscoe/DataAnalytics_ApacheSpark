The airline said it had canceled 90 flights over the next three days to accommodate the requirement by Taiwan’s Civil Aeronautics Administration that all 71 of its ATR pilots be retested. Preliminary investigations indicate that the pilots of the flight that crashed Wednesday shut off a running engine after the other engine went idle, a move that aviation experts said was an error.
