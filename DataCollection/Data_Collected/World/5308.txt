 The Allied troops celebrate Christmas in 1940. British Pathé.LONDON — There was ‘‘peace on earth’’ this Christmas Day in western Europe only because the aviators kept out of the skies. Throughout Christmas Eve and the dimly lit hours today [Dec. 25], both British and Germans refrained from bombing. Although for Great Britain the day was undisturbed from Land’s End in the southwest to John o’Groat’s House, northernmost point of the British mainland, some German planes breezed over the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland, and also buzzed off the Scottish coast. The fleet air arm, it was announced tonight, brought down one of these planes over the Orkneys and four of the Nazi crew were captured. Despite the seeming truce in aerial warfare, Londoners flocked to air-raid shelters Christmas night, and the capital’s streets were almost deserted, The United Press reported. During the day, it said, air-raid spotters continued to scan the sky, fire fighters remained at their posts and invasion precautions were observed with unusual vigilance. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 26, 1940
