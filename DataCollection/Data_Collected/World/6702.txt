A British man who joined a jihadist group to fight in Syria and then returned to Britain after faking his death has pleaded guilty to four terrorism offenses, the London police said Tuesday. The man, Imran Khawaja, 27, of Southall in West London, left last January, joined a group called Rayat al-Tawheed and, with his face concealed, was featured in a grisly video in Syria in which he was described as “British ISIS fighter Abu Daigham al-Britani with government soldier’s head Syria,” the police said. Mr. Khawaja, who is to be sentenced next month, was arrested entering Britain at the port of Dover last June. He pleaded guilty last month to charges including attending a terrorism training camp and preparing terrorist acts, but restrictions on reporting his plea were lifted just Tuesday.A version of this brief appears in print on January 21, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Britain: Man Pleads Guilty to Terrorism Charges.
