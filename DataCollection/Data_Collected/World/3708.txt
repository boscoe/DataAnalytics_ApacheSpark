The United States on Thursday condemned the killing of a local opposition leader in Venezuela days before a legislative election, and it called on the government to protect all political candidates. The local activist, Luis Díaz, a leader of the opposition Democratic Action party in Guárico State, was shot at a public meeting on Wednesday. “This was the deadliest of several recent attacks and acts of intimidation aimed at opposition candidates,” a State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said in a statement. “Campaigns of fear, violence and intimidation have no place in democracy.”A version of this brief appears in print on November 27, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Venezuela: U.S. Condemns a Killing.
