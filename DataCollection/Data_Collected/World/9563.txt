China has surpassed Germany to become the world’s third-largest arms exporter, but the United States and Russia remain the dominant sellers of weapons worldwide, according to statistics released on Monday by a research organization in Sweden.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said China surpassed Germany in 2010-14. With just 5 percent of total exports for that period, China’s share was far below that of the United States, at 31 percent, or Russia, at 27 percent.Although its share of overall sales remained small, China’s exports increased by 143 percent in 2010 to 2014, compared with the previous five-year period, Sipri said. (The organization looks at arms sales over five-year blocks to smooth out jumps from year to year.) Arms exports by the United States increased by 23 percent over the previous five years; Russia’s increased by 37 percent. After global arms sales fell over most of the 1980s and ’90s, they have increased in recent years, with the 2010-14 volume 16 percent higher than that of the previous five years, according to the report. China’s increase came as Germany and France saw declines in their shares of the arms market. Germany, which had the third-largest share in 2005-9, experienced a drop linked in part to government restrictions on arms exports announced in 2014, the report said. France would have had the third-largest share for 2009-14 had it not postponed plans to sell an amphibious assault ship to Russia last year over concerns about its involvement in the Ukraine conflict, the report added.China has not commanded such a significant share of the international arms trade since the mid-1980s, when it sold weapons to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war and ranked as high as fourth in annual arms exports, according to Sipri data. In recent years, China has attempted to move beyond the sale of low-margin small arms to more expensive military platforms, with limited success.“Most countries don’t prefer Chinese weapon systems, but China is basically a supplier of last resort,” said Richard Bitzinger, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “It sells reasonably good equipment to countries that don’t have a lot of money but want something.”

China also sold armored vehicles, and transport and trainer aircraft, to Venezuela; three frigates to Algeria; antiship missiles to Indonesia; and major arms to 18 African states, the report said.“For the most part, Chinese weapons don’t have a major impact on military capability,” Mr. Bitzinger said. “They can close some deals that are good for them, good for their industry, but it’s still hard to find Chinese weapon systems that you could argue are significant game changers when it comes to regional balances of power.”China’s efforts to sell complex military platforms have run into obstacles in recent years. Turkey’s plan to buy a $3 billion air-defense missile package from China has stalled over concerns from the United States and Europe. Likewise, analysts say the J-31, China’s stealth fighter jet, may not find widespread interest among foreign buyers because of concerns over its stealthiness, heavy maintenance demands and low-quality engines.China was also the third-largest arms importer during the past five years, behind India and Saudi Arabia. Russia, France and Ukraine were the largest suppliers to China, according to Sipri.The rankings were calculated based on the value of weapons actually delivered to customers using a common unit that eliminates ambiguity in sales definitions among governments.

Clarification: An earlier version of this article may have been unclear about when China’s arms exports increased by 143 percent. It was not in the period from 2005 to 2009, but in the years from 2010 to 2014 compared with the previous five-year period.
