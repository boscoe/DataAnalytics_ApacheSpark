China’s military planning and spending have increasingly focused on territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in waters near Japan.At a military parade in Beijing on Sep. 3, Mr. Xi announced that the People’s Liberation Army, which includes naval, air force and ballistic missile forces, would reduce its number of personnel by 300,000 in coming years, bringing the total to a little under two million. Currently, about 1.4 million members of the military are land forces.In November 2013, Communist Party leaders approved a program of changes that included restructuring the military.Adam Wu contributed research.videoAdvertisement
