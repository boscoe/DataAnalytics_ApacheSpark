Diplomats from around the world will try again in Vienna this weekend to find a way to end the four-year-old civil war in Syria. Judging by editorial opinion in the region, though, the region is sharply divided over whether the talks have any chance of success.With no immediate hope of a cease-fire and no presence at the talks for the warring factions themselves, many analysts have questioned whether the discussions might, by wasting time, do more harm than good.“While the main global powers discuss the future of Syria in endless meetings, without taking the Syrian people into account, innocent Syrians continue to die ahead of winter,” Cihangir Isbili wrote in Vahdet, a conservative Turkish newspaper. Noting that “no concrete result has emerged” from previous efforts, he wrote that the new round of talks was “likely to end in a similar manner.”The multisided conflict in Syria has become something of a proxy war, with Russia and Iran backing the government of President Bashar al-Assad, the United States and Saudi Arabia backing the rebel groups fighting to oust him, and the extremists of the Islamic State opposing them both.AdvertisementMany of the region’s newspapers are operated or tightly controlled by arms of their respective governments, and their editorial stances on the Vienna talks shed light on official narratives.AdvertisementIn Iran, the reformist daily Mardom Salari echoed official confidence that “the broad front and alliance between Iran, Russia, Iraq and the Islamic resistance will help the Syrian crisis reach an end.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And some editorial writers warned that the lack of an agreement among the participating countries about including any of the Syrian groups could bog the talks down.“Raising the issue of determining the Syrian opposition groups that will be invited to participate in the subsequent negotiations will only lead to drowning, once again,” wrote Monalisa Freiha in Lebanon’s An-Nahar daily. “This will lead to further stalling.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
