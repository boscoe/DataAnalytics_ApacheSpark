KUWAIT —  The new secretary of defense, Ashton B. Carter, will continue his crash course on American military operations in the greater Middle East with a closed-door conference on Monday in Kuwait, where he is scheduled to meet with three dozen senior American military and diplomatic officials who are leading the fight against the Islamic State.Mr. Carter plans to ask the officials about the impact that American-led military efforts have had on the extremist group’s advance, and about the terrorism threats the group poses to the United States and its allies.Mr. Carter spent the past two days in Afghanistan, meeting with senior Afghan and American officials to learn more about the security situation there, as he develops his own assessment of whether the United States should slow its withdrawal of 10,000 troops from the country.His aides said Mr. Carter wanted the conference on Monday to be a free-flowing discussion about American strategy. Attendees have been asked not to bring elaborate slide shows or thick binders full of briefing memos for Mr. Carter to read. Maps will be the only visual aids permitted, they said, and officials are expected to boil their comments for the secretary down to a two-minute elevator pitch.Advertisement“This kind of forum just fits his style better,” said one aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under Defense Department practice. “A number of us came in with him, frankly, last Saturday, and spent a day getting him smart on a bunch of these key first-order issues. And it was very similar to how we structured this event: firing questions at you, pushing on your logic, wanting to understand.
                Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.            “It worked so well that I think we all thought — and he certainly said — this is a great way for me to learn, I want to do this quickly on some key issues,” the aide said.AdvertisementMr. Carter’s aides arranged the conference hastily over the past week, and the roster of attendees was still not completely clear on Sunday. But those expected to be there include Lt. Gen. James L. Terry, the commander of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State; Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, head of Central Command, which is responsible for the region; John R. Allen, the retired general who now serves as the diplomatic envoy coordinating the coalition; and Brett H. McGurk, the State Department’s top Iraq expert.Mr. Carter’s aides said the meeting was not the beginning of a process to develop a new strategy to defeat the Islamic State. Rather, they said, Mr. Carter, a longtime Pentagon official who left the department in late 2013 after serving as deputy secretary of defense, is seeking to learn the intellectual underpinnings of the current strategy. Although the meeting will not be public, Mr. Carter is expected to speak to reporters afterward, something he appears to be more comfortable doing than his predecessor, Chuck Hagel, was.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He visited American troops who are training Afghan security forces in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In a question-and-answer session with the troops, he was asked about a wide range of issues, from transgender people’s place in the military to the pacifist Japanese Constitution.During Mr. Carter’s trip he discussed with the new Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, the question of whether American troops should remain in the country beyond the current timetable, which calls for them all to withdraw by the end of 2016. Afghan officials would like them to stay longer, providing more time for the Afghan military to build up its capabilities in the face of a continued threat from the Taliban.And on Sunday Mr. Carter spoke by telephone with his British counterpart, Michael Fallon, their first conversation since Mr. Carter was sworn in Tuesday. Not surprisingly, two subjects they discussed were Afghanistan and the Islamic State.A version of this article appears in print on February 23, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Mideast Crash Course for the New Defense Secretary.
