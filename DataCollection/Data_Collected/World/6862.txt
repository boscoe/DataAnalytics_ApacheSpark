The Senate of the Democratic Republic of Congo voted Friday to eliminate a measure in an electoral law that critics say would have prolonged the president’s time in power and drew large protests this week. The lower house voted last week to require a census before next year’s presidential election, prompting demonstrations over concerns that it was merely a ploy to delay that vote. More than 13 people have died and dozens have been injured in the unrest, according to Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations high commissioner for human rights. Human rights groups put that figure far higher. Even though the Senate’s vote removed the requirement for a new census before the election, uncertainty remains because a parliamentary committee must now reconcile the bills from the two houses of Parliament before a final version can be voted on. The proposed law has raised suspicions among the opposition that President Joseph Kabila, in office since 2001, is hoping to cling to power after his term ends. Term limits prevent Mr. Kabila from running again.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
