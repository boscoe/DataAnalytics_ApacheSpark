ISTANBUL — The Turkish government informed the United States that it had revoked the passport of an influential cleric based in Pennsylvania on Tuesday in a push for his deportation, Turkish media reported.The cleric, Fethullah Gulen, an ally-turned-foe of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been accused of forming a “parallel structure” to undermine and topple the government. Mr. Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania, has a broad following of millions worldwide and some of his supporters hold positions of power in the police and in the judiciary in Turkey.Pro-government media reported on Tuesday that Mr. Gulen’s passport had been canceled over irregularities in his original application. “It is now up to the U.S. to decide whether or not to allow Gulen’s extradition, which has long been sought by Turkish government officials,” the pro-government newspaper Daily Sabah reported.A Turkish court issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Gulen in late December, a move that experts said was very likely to lead to a formal extradition request and further strain relations between the United States and Turkey.Mr. Gulen’s lawyer, Nurullah Albayrak, has denied the reports, saying that his client’s passport was still valid. “If this news is true, Turkish authorities have lied to the U.S. authorities,” Mr. Albayrak said.A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Turkey: Cleric’s Passport Is Revoked.
