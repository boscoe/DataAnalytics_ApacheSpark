He got 24 votes.Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 75, underwent surgery on his prostate last year, raising issues about his health and longevity. The Assembly of Experts, in theory, can dismiss him. In case of the ayatollah’s death or incapacity, the assembly would be in charge of electing a new leader.Advertisement
