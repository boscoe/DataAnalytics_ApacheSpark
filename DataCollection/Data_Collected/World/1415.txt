TUNIS — The United Nations envoy to Libya said Wednesday that consultations would continue to seal an agreement for a unity government despite rejections announced by members of both warring factions.The envoy, Bernardino León, said that hard-liners had blocked a vote on the peace plan in the elected Parliament on Tuesday but that he was hopeful the vote would go forward soon. Mr. León said there was a wave of support in the country for a unity government and that hard-liners would not be allowed to hijack the process, raising the possibility of United Nations sanctions against some Libyans.“The political solution is the only real alternative,” Mr. León told reporters during a briefing in neighboring Tunisia. “A majority of Libyans want a political solution, they don’t want any more confrontations.”A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Middle East; Libya: U.N.
