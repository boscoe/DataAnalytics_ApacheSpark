HerszenhornMOSCOW — In an unusually pointed threat, the Russian ambassador in Copenhagen warned that Danish ships would become targets of Russia’s nuclear arsenal if the Scandinavian country joins NATO’s missile defense program.The comments by the Russian ambassador, Mikhail Vanin, drew an angry response from the Danish foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, who called them “unacceptable.”“I do not think that Danes are fully aware of the consequences if Denmark joins the U.S.-led missile defense shield,” Mr. Vanin was quoted in Jyllands-Posten, a Danish newspaper. “Denmark will be part of the threat to Russia.”He added, “if it happens, then Danish warships will be targets for Russia’s nuclear weapons.”Russia has long voiced strenuous objections to plans by the United States to build a Europe-based missile defense system. Russia has repeatedly said it views the antimissile program as a threat, despite reassurances from Washington.Advertisement
