The delay will enable Russian importers to identify alternative suppliers, he said. Officials are not considering a ban on industrial imports at this time, said Igor Shuvalov, another deputy prime minister. The list of banned items might be expanded in the future, officials said. Among the measures already announced are limits on travel and tourism between the two countries. Russia has spent almost $750 million on importing Turkish fruits and vegetables so far this year, according to government statistics, and Turkey accounted for about 4 percent of all foodstuffs purchased abroad in 2014. About 90 percent of all lemons sold in Russia come from Turkey, as well as significant amounts of tomatoes, grapes and apricots. About 1,250 Turkish trucks are now stacked up along Russiaâ€™s southern border, Interfax reported. Advertisement
