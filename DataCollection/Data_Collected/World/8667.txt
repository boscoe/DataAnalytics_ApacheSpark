Lyons The 101-year-old war veteran who was tied up and robbed in his Ottawa home in December, then left to suffocate with a plastic bag over his head, only to free himself and call the police, has died of natural causes, Canadian news outlets reported Thursday. The attack on the veteran, Ernest Côté, attracted national attention. An investigation led to the arrest of a suspect, Ian Bush, who was also charged last week with a 2007 triple murder involving a break-in and suffocation with plastic bags. Advertisement
