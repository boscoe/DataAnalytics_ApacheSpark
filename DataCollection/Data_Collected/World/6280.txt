LONDON — A British nurse who contracted an Ebola infection in Sierra Leone last month is no longer in critical condition, the hospital treating her in London said on Monday.The nurse, Pauline Cafferkey, who returned to Britain on Dec. 28 and received her diagnosis the same day “is showing signs of improvement and is no longer critically ill,” a statement issued by the Royal Free Hospital said.Concern about Ms. Cafferkey’s condition grew when it emerged that there was no stock left of the antiviral drug ZMapp, which had been successfully used on a previous Ebola patient in Britain, Will Pooley, also a nurse.Ms. Cafferkey, a 39-year-old Scottish volunteer for the charity Save the Children, has received experimental drugs and blood plasma from Mr. Pooley, who has recovered. She remains in an isolation unit.A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Britain: Ebola Patient Is Improving.
