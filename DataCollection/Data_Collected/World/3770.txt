A suicide bomber, suspected of being from Boko Haram, detonated himself in the midst of a procession of hundreds of Shiite Muslims on Friday, killing 21 people and wounding dozens, local religious leaders said. The attack occurred during an annual religious procession from Kano, Nigeria’s second-largest city, to Zaria, said Aliyu Yusuf Kakaki, a spokesman for the Shiite community in Kano.
