(That update was later removed from the prince’s Twitter account, but not before it had been shared more than 32,000 times.)The uncertainty in Yemen was not assuaged by a televised address from its Saudi-backed president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who spoke from Riaydh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. According to Yemeni viewers, Mr. Hadi offered little reassurance that their long national nightmare was at an end. Many seized on the fact that he read his rambling statement with crooked glasses, and the electricity went off again soon after he finished.Advertisement
