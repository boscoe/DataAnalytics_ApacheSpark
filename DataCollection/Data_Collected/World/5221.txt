The attacker was 17 when he and five other men brutally raped a 23-year-old woman on a bus in New Delhi, the Indian capital. She later died in a hospital. The young man served the maximum sentence of three years in a reform home and was released on Sunday. Four men convicted of rape and murder were sentenced to death and are appealing their sentences in India’s top court. A fifth man died in prison. The bill needs the president’s signature before it becomes a law. Advertisement
