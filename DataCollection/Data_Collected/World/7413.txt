The cabinet he proposed on Jan. 23 consisted of just two parties and did not survive a no-confidence vote. It has now been expanded to involve five parties, including one post — that of employment minister — for the powerful Islamist party, Ennahda. Mr. Essid’s Nida Tunis party won the most seats in October’s election but still needed to form a coalition. The government faces a confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday, which it is expected to pass.Advertisement
