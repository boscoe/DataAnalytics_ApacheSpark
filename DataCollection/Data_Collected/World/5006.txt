Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday ordered Waclaw Radziwinowicz, a correspondent for Gazeta Wyborcza, to leave Russia within 30 days. A ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said the Polish journalist was ordered out of Russia “on the principle of reciprocity.” Poland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the expulsion of Mr. Radziwinowicz as “unjustified” and “purely retaliatory” and said it would have “negative consequences” for relations between the two countries, which are already deeply strained over Russia’s actions in Ukraine and other matters. Roman Imielski, managing editor for Gazeta Wyborcza, and the Polish foreign ministry said the move was in response to the expulsion from Poland of Leonid Sviridov, a Russian reporter with the Kremlin-funded Rossiya Segodnya news service. He left Poland last Saturday. Poland’s Internal Security Agency said last year that Mr. Sviridov was a threat to Poland’s security, though it never revealed what evidence it had against him.
