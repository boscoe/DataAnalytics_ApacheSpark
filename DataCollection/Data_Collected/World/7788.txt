ROME —  Twenty-nine migrants who were rescued alive in rough seas off the Libyan coast died before the Italian Coast Guard could get them to shore, officials said on Monday.Two coast guard ships responded to a distress call from a boat battered by huge waves, some as high as 25 feet, and crews managed to evacuate more than 100 migrants from the boat. But the authorities said many of the migrants were so badly weakened by exhaustion and exposure that they did not survive much longer.“They perished during the trip, despite all the medical assistance and all the efforts we made,” said Cmdr. Filippo Marini, a spokesman for the coast guard. “They were devastated by the weather and sea conditions, and by the trip they had undertaken just to reach their boat.”Tens of thousands of people, many of them fleeing conflicts in Africa or the Middle East, pay smugglers to make a dangerous journey across the Mediterranean in the hope of reaching Western Europe, and the flow of migrants has reached crisis proportions. Last year, more than 170,000 people arrived in Italy alone, while more than 3,200 people are estimated to have died at sea making the attempt.AdvertisementUntil late last year, Italy had taken the lead in responding to the crisis, with a navy-run rescue program known as Mare Nostrum (Our Sea, the old Roman name for the Mediterranean) that was credited with saving tens of thousands of lives. More recently, the European Union’s immigration agency, Frontex, has taken over responsibility for coordinating a multinational maritime rescue effort, but it is limited to waters closer to Europe.AdvertisementThe Italian Coast Guard still responds on its own to more distant distress calls, like the one off Libya on Monday, but the navy does not.A boat packed with Syrian refugees fleeing the war bobbed in the sea about 50 miles off the southeastern coast of Sicily as the Italian Coast Guard approached.Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, suggested that the change might have played a tragic role in the events on Monday. If larger navy ships like those used in the Mare Nostrum program had been involved in the latest rescue, he said, they might have afforded more room and greater protection from the elements for the rescued migrants.“You could argue that this is the first consequence of the absence of Mare Nostrum,” he said. Noting that the flow of migrants is likely to increase in warmer weather, he added, “We shall see what happens this summer.”Commander Marini said the coast guard had received an initial distress call late on Sunday and sent two vessels from Lampedusa, an Italian island near the Tunisian coast that migrants often try to reach.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the rescue ships had very limited space below, and most of the migrants had to remain huddled on deck, wrapped in blankets, as the rescue vessels made their way back to Lampedusa. Commander Marini said each vessel had a doctor and a nurse on board who tried to treat the most weakened people, even as some began to succumb.Early reports said that seven of the 29 migrants who died did so before the coast guard reached the scene, but late on Monday a commander confirmed that all 29 were still alive when they were transferred to rescue vessels.“These people died because of the cold,” Giusi Nicolini, the mayor of Lampedusa, said in an interview on the Italian news channel Sky TG24. “Had they been transported on the large ships of Mare Nostrum, they would be alive.”A version of this article appears in print on February 10, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Migrants Are Plucked From Sea Off Libya, but 29 Die Aboard Italian Rescue Ships.
