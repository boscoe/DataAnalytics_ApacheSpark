Nelson Barbosa, the country’s planning minister, stepped into the position, Brazil’s presidential palace said on its website. Ms. Rousseff said Mr. Levy had a “fundamental role in the government’s handling of the economic crisis.” Since his first day on the job in January, Mr. Levy, a former bank executive and University of Chicago-trained economist, faced criticism from Ms. Rousseff’s largely leftist base and even her predecessor and mentor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who questioned the efficacy of fiscal austerity and sought to undermine him. Additionally, Congress gave him tepid support. Brazil’s economy contracted by 1.7 percent in the third quarter.Advertisement
