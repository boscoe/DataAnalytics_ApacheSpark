The accident happened while they repairing the light fixtures inside its display case.In a rush to fix the problem they just made it worse by using an insoluble epoxy resin that left a visible, crusty ring of glue around the base of the beard. The mask’s chin was also scratched.After the damage was discovered last January, one of the museum’s conservators described the epoxy to reporters as a “quick-drying, irreversible material.”The mask of Tutankhamen is one of the most famous artifacts in the Egyptian Museum, and Egyptologists reacted to the botched repair job with horror. The mask is over 3,300 years old and was discovered in 1922, setting off a worldwide craze over the history and art of ancient Egypt.Luckily, the damage appears to have been reversible after all.Egypt’s antiquities minister, Mamdouh el-Damaty, told reporters on Wednesday that the mask was repaired by a joint German-Egyptian team that studied the best ways to remove the epoxy and reattach the beard.“We indeed found them to be the natural materials which the ancient Egyptian used; they are still the best tools: beeswax,” Mr. el-Damaty said, according to The Associated Press. “It was prepared well and the beard was attached very successfully.”The tools used to complete the job were old-fashioned, too, said Christian Eckmann, the lead restoration specialist on the team. Speaking to The Associated Press, he said that the restoration workers removed the epoxy with “wooden tools, spatulas” and “other wooden instruments.”Advertisement
