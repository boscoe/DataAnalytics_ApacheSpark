He was 86.The cause was cancer, his family said.The British-born Mr. Avner was an adviser and speechwriter to the country’s leaders for some three decades, beginning with Levi Eshkol in the 1960s through Shimon Peres in the early 1990s. He also served as Israel’s ambassador to Britain and Australia.In his book, “The Prime Ministers: An Intimate Narrative of Israeli Leadership,” published in 2010, Mr. Avner recounted working alongside Israeli leaders, including Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin, as well as Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter; Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain; and the leader of the Chabad movement, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.The book became the basis for a 2013 documentary film, “The Prime Ministers: The Pioneers,” with actors like Sandra Bullock (Golda Meir) and Leonard Nimoy (Eshkol) giving voice to Israeli leaders.Mr. Avner was born on Dec. 30, 1928, in Manchester, England, and he immigrated to Israel as a teenager. Survivors include his wife, Mimi; a son; and three daughters.In a 2010 interview with the online Jewish magazine Tablet, Mr. Avner said he had put his book together based on handwritten notes from the many meetings he attended. Mr. Avner said the notes were meant to be used for the official records of these meetings.“However, I never threw away those scribbles,” he said. “I confess I was naughty.”Advertisement
