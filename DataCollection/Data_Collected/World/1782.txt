LONG BEACH, L.I. — Rear-Admiral Robert E. Peary’s first experience in aviation to-day [Oct. 13] was to find himself seated in a Curtiss flying-boat 1,200 feet above the marshy shore of Long Island near Long Beach, with the motor suddenly ‘‘gone dead’’ from a defective magneto. Fortunately the machine was under the control of Frank H. Burnside, an experienced pilot. So cleverly did he bring the disabled aircraft around in a graceful spiral, coming head-on into the wind to volplane safely into the mouth of a broad inlet, that the explorer knew nothing of the accident until he was told the flying-boat would have to be towed ashore. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 29, 1915
