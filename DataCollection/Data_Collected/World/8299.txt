Navalny, was sentenced on Thursday to 15 days in custody for handing out leaflets in the subway. A district court in Moscow ruled on Thursday that Mr. Navalny, an anticorruption crusader who led protests against President Vladimir V. Putin, violated the law when he campaigned recently on the subway for an unauthorized protest march on March 1. Mr. Navalny denied the accusations that he had broken the law and argued that the allegations were intended to prevent him from organizing the demonstration. “We need to put pressure on the government to prevent a political and economic crisis,” he said outside the court as police officers escorted him out of the building, below. Mr. Navalny, the driving force behind protests against Mr. Putin in Moscow in 2011 and 2012, has campaigned to organize antigovernment protests in several cities in March. In December, he was convicted of fraud and given a suspended sentence of three and a half years. Advertisement
