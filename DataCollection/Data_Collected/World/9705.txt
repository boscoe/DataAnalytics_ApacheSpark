The Syrian state news media reported Tuesday that the country’s air defense systems had shot down an American surveillance plane near the northwestern city of Latakia. American defense officials confirmed that United States military controllers had lost contact with an unarmed, remotely piloted craft — an MQ-1 Predator — over northwestern Syria but said they had no information to corroborate that it had been shot down. They said they were investigating. Syrian state television showed footage of what it said were the remnants of the plane being loaded into a truck by soldiers. If confirmed, the downing would be the first of an American aircraft in Syria since a United States-led coalition began bombing Islamic State extremists there last year.A version of this brief appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Syria: Reports Claim Downing of a U.S. Surveillance Drone.
