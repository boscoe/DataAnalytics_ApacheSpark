ATHENS — A woman and two young children drowned, and seven people were missing, after an inflatable dinghy carrying dozens of migrants from Turkey hit rocks near the Greek island of Lesbos, the Greek authorities said on Sunday as fears rose of more deaths amid worsening weather conditions.An additional 53 people made it ashore after the dinghy sank shortly before dawn on Sunday in choppy waters on a very windy day, according to an official at the Greek Shipping Ministry.The dead children were 2 and 7 years old, and their ethnicity was not known, the official said.A Greek military helicopter and Coast Guard vessels searched for another seven people believed to have boarded the dinghy on the neighboring Turkish coast but did not reach Lesbos. The European Union’s border-monitoring agency Frontex contributed to the search with a helicopter and patrol vessel, the ministry said.
                This summer, as the Majid family left Syria for Europe, The New York Times followed the group through weeks of defeat and triumph, disillusionment and determination.            Sunday’s episode added to the grim tally of deaths in the Aegean, which remains a popular crossing point for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war or other hardships.AdvertisementMore than half a million people have arrived in Greece this year, according to the United Nations refugee agency. There are no precise figures for drownings though the Greek Coast Guard issues almost daily reports of migrants who have been found dead or who are unaccounted for, often including very young children.AdvertisementOf the about 650,000 people that have crossed into Europe this year, via Greece or countries like Italy, more than 3,000 have died or are missing, according to figures from the International Organization for Migration.The Greek authorities have repeatedly appealed for help in handling the influx, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was expected to underscore the pressure Greece faces as the main gateway to Europe at a summit meeting in Brussels on Sunday of leaders of European countries and some Balkan states most affected by the crisis.
                The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.            On arriving at the summit meeting on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Tsipras emphasized the need for a “European solution” to a “huge humanitarian crisis.”“I believe we have a big responsibility when refugees every day lose their lives in the Aegean Sea,” he said. He criticized some countries for adopting an attitude of “not in my own back yard.” He also expressed displeasure at the absence of Turkey, a main transit point for migrants going to Europe, from the meeting.“Everyone knows that at the end of the corridor, there is an entrance,” he said. “If we will not be able to agree with the country at the entrance, I am afraid it will be very difficult to find a solution.”Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who traveled to Turkey last weekend for talks about the refugee crisis, indicated that Turkey’s role was critical. “We will not solve the refugee problem completely,” she said. “We need, among other things, further talks with Turkey for that.”Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
