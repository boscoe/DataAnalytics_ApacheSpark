The group of mostly elderly Yazidi hostages, many in poor health, were released on Saturday.Khaleel Mahmood Abdo, one of the freed captives, said that two days ago, after months of torment at the hands of the militants that included demands that the captives convert to Islam, the extremists announced an “amnesty and told us that we are burdening them.” The hostages, who were captured in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar, were held in prisons, confiscated houses or schools, and separated from younger captives, Mr. Abdo said.Thousands of Yazidis, who follow a religion that draws on several faiths, have been killed or captured by Islamic State militants who consider the Yazidis pagans. The militants have also enslaved Yazidi women and girls, and forced them to marry Islamic State fighters. Advertisement
