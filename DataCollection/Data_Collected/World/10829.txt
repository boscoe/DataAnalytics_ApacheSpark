The airstrike may have been intended for an air defense base about a mile and half away, a Yemen Interior Ministry official said.Annotated maps showing the Houthi rebels’ drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical divisions.Bombings attributed to the coalition have killed dozens of civilians since the start of the Saudi-led air offensive intended to cripple the Houthis, a Yemeni militia that has gained control of Sana and other parts of Yemen in the past eight months.The Saudi intervention, which began in late March, has exacerbated the fighting in Yemen’s civil conflict and effectively blockaded the country, starving cities and towns of essential supplies and making it increasingly difficult for civilians to flee. The latest deaths came as the United Nations Security Council was scheduled to meet in New York to discuss a Russian proposal for a 24-hour pause in the hostilities for humanitarian reasons. Echoing the Russian proposal, the International Committee of the Red Cross called on Saturday for an immediate suspension of the fighting, saying the humanitarian situation in Yemen was “dire.”“Our relief supplies and surgical personnel must be allowed to enter the country and safely reach the worst-affected places to provide help,” Robert Mardini, the head of the operations for the Red Cross in the Middle East, said in a statement. “Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die. For the wounded, their chances of survival depend on action within hours, not days.”A look at where Iran exerts influence across the region and at the emerging Saudi coalition.Red Cross workers have been trying to send in supplies for several days, but have yet to receive clearance from the warring parties, the group said.The southern city of Aden, which has been the site of street fighting for weeks, desperately needs assistance, humanitarian workers say. The Red Cross said it had been trying, in vain, to send in a surgical team by sea. Over the past week, three volunteers with the Yemeni Red Crescent have been killed trying to evacuate wounded people.Aid agencies are also trying to get supplies to Sana, which has been bombarded nightly by Saudi warplanes. Saudi officials have promised investigations into errant airstrikes, while blaming the Houthis for civilian deaths, accusing them of putting fighters in populated areas.A resident of the village hit on Friday, Dhiyazan Mohammed Khalil, said that if the attack was a mistake, it was an especially egregious one because the base sits on a mountain and the village is in the valley below.
