NEW DELHI —  A year after the arrest of an Indian diplomat accused of exploiting a domestic worker in New York ruptured relations, India and the United States have put the episode behind them, and President Obama arrived here Sunday to hail a new era of cooperation.During his visit, the president plans to seek common ground on climate change, civilian nuclear power, trade and security. But human rights groups worry that Mr. Obama, in his eagerness to make diplomatic breakthroughs, will brush aside serious issues that may stand in the way.Human rights advocates say they suspect that Indian diplomats are still circumventing American law to exploit domestic workers in the United States and have asked the State Department to investigate. They have voiced concern over forced labor and human trafficking inside India as well. And they say they hope Mr. Obama raises questions about free expression, gay rights and political intimidation.“There’s a lot of issues bubbling under the surface that they’re not talking about publicly,” said John Sifton, the Asia director for Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization based in New York.AdvertisementMr. Obama has raised none of those issues explicitly before the visit. Instead, he has emphasized the improvement in ties, citing rising trade, more joint military exercises and cooperation on counterterrorism and counterproliferation issues.Advertisement“While it’s true that progress has not always come as fast as we would have liked, we’ve succeeded in deepening the U.S.-India relationship across the board,” Mr. Obama said in written answers to questions submitted by India Today, the country’s leading weekly newsmagazine. To the extent that he touched on issues raised by human rights groups, it was only obliquely, as when he said each country was working at “creating more opportunities, including for girls and women.”The president’s priorities for the trip were exemplified by the officials he invited to join him, including Penny Pritzker, the commerce secretary; Michael B. Froman, the trade representative; and John D. Podesta, the presidential counselor who focuses on climate issues. Also joining the president will be several congressional Democrats: Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Ami Bera of California and Joseph Crowley of New York as well as Senator Mark Warner of Virginia.In addition to attending the Republic Day parade, Mr. Obama will meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attend a state dinner. He will also participate in a wreath-laying and tree-planting ceremony at the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, and he will host a meeting of American and Indian corporate executives.Mr. Obama, who visited in 2010, is the first sitting American president to travel to India twice.In effect, the visit is part of an effort to get the relationship back to where it was before the arrest of the Indian diplomat, Devyani Khobragade. American authorities arrested Ms. Khobragade, the deputy consul general in New York, in December 2013 after she was accused of submitting false documents to obtain a work visa for an Indian housekeeper, whom she paid less than $1.42 an hour and forced to work longer than what was allowed.India was outraged not at the treatment of the housekeeper but at the fact that Ms. Khobragade was strip-searched as part of the arrest, which is policy for processing suspects. India retaliated with investigations into several American institutions in New Delhi, and ultimately the American ambassador, Nancy Powell, resigned early. Ms. Khobragade was allowed to leave the United States on diplomatic immunity.As it happened, it took a man with a checkered human rights record of his own to revive relations between the countries. Prime Minister Modi had been denied a visa to the United States in 2005 on human rights grounds, stemming from his time as chief minister for Gujarat when more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots. Mr. Modi denied wrongdoing.After being elected last year, Mr. Modi proved to be far more pro-American than expected, and he and Mr. Obama forged a working relationship during a visit to Washington last fall. Mr. Obama sent a new ambassador, Richard R. Verma, and the two sides moved past the diplomatic dispute.AdvertisementBut a coalition of organizations like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking and the Human Trafficking Pro Bono Legal Center pressed the Obama administration not to forget about the issue of domestic workers. In a letter last month, they asked Secretary of State John Kerry to make sure that India was not breaking American law in its treatment of domestic workers.
                The New York Times would like to hear from readers in India about what President Obama’s visit means to you.            Citing Indian news reports, the groups said it appeared that India was sending domestic workers to the United States on A-2 visas meant for administrative workers, who are not protected from exploitation under American law, rather than the A-3 or G-5 visas that are required.Tiffany Williams of the National Domestic Workers Alliance said the administration did not seem eager to look into the matter. “I don’t think they’re looking the other way,” Ms. Williams said, “but I think they know they can’t prove it. So I don’t know if they want to open that can of worms to try to figure that out.”The Indian Embassy in Washington did not respond to messages seeking comment. The State Department said that to guard against fraud, it scrutinized any applications for A-2 visas from individuals formerly in A-3 status.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Amnesty International urged him to address efforts by Dow Chemical to avoid Indian court action to hold its subsidiary responsible for the chemical disaster in Bhopal that killed thousands more than 30 years ago. (Dow bought the subsidiary, Union Carbide, after the disaster and says a 1989 settlement with the government resolved liability.)Human Rights First said Mr. Obama should raise the issue of the reinstatement of a colonial-era law criminalizing sexual activity between men. In a letter to Mr. Obama, Elisa Massimino, the group’s president, also cited the forced labor of tens of millions of Indians. “More people are enslaved in India than in any other country in the world,” she wrote.Mr. Sifton said he hoped Mr. Obama would press Mr. Modi to rein in his own supporters, who Mr. Sifton said had been intimidating political rivals. “There’s a heckler’s veto where Modi’s supporters can shout down their opponents,” Mr. Sifton said. “The argument is that Modi isn’t doing enough to tamp down his own supporters.”A version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Human Rights Groups Press Obama on India.
