DAMASCUS, Syria —  Islamic State militants have blown up another major monument in the ancient city of Palmyra, Syria’s antiquities chief said Sunday. In recent months, the militants destroyed two ancient temples in the central Syrian city.The official, Maamoun Abdulkarim, said witnesses in Palmyra had confirmed that the monument, the Arch of Triumph, a jewel in the exquisite collection of ruins in the oasis city, had been blown up.

The group considers the buildings sacrilegious.“It’s as though there is a curse that has befallen this city, and I expect only news that will shock us,” Mr. Abdulkarim said. “If the city remains in their hands, the city is doomed.Advertisement“It is now wanton destruction,” he added. “Their acts of vengeance are no longer ideologically driven because they are now blowing up buildings with no religious meaning.”
                As it expanded across Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State destroyed many archaeological sites, looting them for profit and damaging some for propaganda.            In August, the Sunni Muslim militants blew up the temple of Baal Shamin and then the Temple of Bel, one of the best preserved Roman-era sites.AdvertisementThis month it was also confirmed that the militants had destroyed some of the best preserved of Palmyra’s funeral towers, sandstone constructions built to hold the remains of the ancient city’s richest families.Palmyra was one of the most important cultural centers of the ancient world, according to Unesco — the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization — which has described it as the crossroads of several civilizations.The ruins of the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra are shown in a video from March 2014, before the Islamic State took control.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has declared a caliphate in the territory it holds across Syria and Iraq and has destroyed other monuments it says are pagan and sacrilegious.Unesco has called such acts war crimes and says the Islamic State seeks to wipe out evidence of Syria’s diverse heritage.Before the capture of the city, Syrian officials said they had moved hundreds of ancient statues to safe locations.A version of this article appears in print on October 5, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: ISIS Destroys Another Monument at Palmyra Ruins in Syria.
