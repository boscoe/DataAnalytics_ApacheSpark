Gordon The United States announced Monday that it had increased to $5 million its reward for information that could lead to the safe return of Robert A. Levinson, a former F.B.I. agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007. The move comes as the Obama administration appears to be closing in on an agreement with Iran under which Tehran would accept limits on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. The fate of Americans who have been detained by Iran — or in Mr. Levinson’s case who have disappeared there — is not formally part of the talks. Monday was the eighth anniversary of Mr. Levinson’s disappearance, which occurred during a visit he made to Kish Island, Iran. His family received photographs and a video in late 2010 and early 2011. The F.B.I. offered a $1 million reward in 2012 for information about Mr. Levinson and increased it by $4 million on Monday. Iran has denied that it knows his whereabouts.  Advertisement
