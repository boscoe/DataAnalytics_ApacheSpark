DOHUK, Iraq — Kurdish officials are investigating reports that a mass grave has been found near the town of Sinjar that holds the remains of more than 70 Yazidis, including older women, a Kurdish security official said Saturday.Kurdish and Yazidi fighters retook the town of Sinjar on Friday from the Islamic State, which had controlled it since August 2014.On Saturday, local officials told news agencies that Islamic State members had executed older Yazidi women, ages 40 to about 80, in and around the town, whom they did not want to keep as sex slaves.The Kurdish security official said that the allegations appeared plausible and that mass graves had been found in other areas that had been captured from the Islamic State.A Kurdish government team plans to excavate the site to try to confirm the suspicions.“For now, it seems credible,” said a Kurdish official who asked not to be named to discuss internal reports. However, he said, further investigation must wait for excavation of the site.An earlier version of this article misstated the nationality of an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official is Kurdish, not American.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
