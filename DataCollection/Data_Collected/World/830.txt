A fire consumed a warehouse in the Chinese city of Tianjin late Monday, the state news media reported. While no casualties were reported, the episode took place two months after explosions at a chemical storage depot in another part of the city killed at least 165 people. In a scene reminiscent of that blast on Aug. 12, social media sites in China showed videos of a large fireball lighting up the sky in Tianjin. Firefighters received an alarm at 9:46 p.m. on Monday, responding to a fire in a warehouse storing ammonia and alcohol, the Beijing News reported. The fire was under control by midnight, the newspaper reported, citing a local government announcement. A witness told the newspaper that there had not been a blast, though several other accounts in the Chinese news media described the fire as an explosion. The August explosions at a warehouse that stored hazardous chemicals leveled part of Tianjin’s port district and exposed a system of lax enforcement of safety rules and political cronyism that has accompanied China’s rapid industrialization. Monday’s fire  occurred in the Beichen district, an area far closer to the urban core of Tianjin.A version of this brief appears in print on October 13, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; China: Fire Strikes Tianjin, 2 Months After Fatal Blast.
