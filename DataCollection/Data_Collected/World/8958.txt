BUENOS AIRES —  An Argentine prosecutor on Wednesday appealed a federal judge’s decision to dismiss a criminal complaint against President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that accused her of conspiring to hide Iranian officials’ involvement in the deadly bombing of a Jewish community center here in 1994.Gerardo Pollicita, the prosecutor, argued that Judge Daniel Rafecas threw out the case last week without taking enough time to review it.In a 35-page appeal request, Mr. Pollicita said the judge had acted “prematurely” and “hastily” in deciding that the criminal complaint did not merit an investigation into the president.Mr. Pollicita took on the case from Alberto Nisman, the longtime lead investigator into the attack who made the accusations against the president in January. Mr. Nisman was found dead in his apartment four days later with a gunshot wound to his head. He was scheduled to appear before Congress a day later to discuss his complaint.The “severity and institutional importance” of Mr. Nisman’s allegations “demands making every effort to try to reach the real truth,” Mr. Pollicita wrote.AdvertisementHe added that only with an investigation into the case can “a message be transmitted to society that the courts exhausted all the available resources and tools to make a decision with the most clarity and transparency.”AdvertisementAn appeals court must now decide whether Mr. Pollicita’s allegations merit investigation or if the case should be closed.Mr. Nisman’s original complaint said that Mrs. Kirchner and Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman had worked with her political supporters to try to hide the involvement of Iranian officials in the bombing, which left 85 people dead. Mr. Nisman said he had discovered the back-channel negotiations through wiretaps and other investigations and that the effort had been designed to gain trade benefits in return for reduced pressure on Iranians wanted in connection with the bombing.However, in throwing out the case, Judge Rafecas said the allegations did not hold up and lacked even circumstantial evidence.The case has caught public attention and raised speculation that it could hurt the governing party’s chances in the Oct. 25 presidential election.Mrs. Kirchner, who cannot run for a third consecutive term, has yet to endorse a candidate. The political tension has been aggravated by the cover-up allegations and Mr. Nisman’s death. Tens of thousands of people poured onto streets and plazas around the country on Feb. 18 for  a silent march to demand justice for Mr. Nisman.While corruption scandals often surface before elections, this one has caught the government off guard because of the public reaction to Mr. Nisman’s death, said Alejandro Catterberg, a political analyst at Poliarquía Consultores, a public opinion and political consulting firm in Buenos Aires.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

                A prosecutor in Argentina accuses the president of attempting to cover up a secret deal to shield terrorists. Days later, the prosecutor is found dead and the president alleges a conspiracy. An overview of key developments in the case.            The ad suggests that Mr. Nisman’s allegations sought to “destabilize” the government.Mrs. Kirchner and Mr. Timerman have rejected the assertions that they conspired with Iran, pointing to statements from Interpol’s former secretary general that they had never sought to lift arrest warrants for Iranian officials wanted in connection with the bombing.AdvertisementIn a nearly four-hour address to Congress on Sunday, Mrs. Kirchner suggested that Mr. Nisman had been manipulated by people trying to destabilize her government. She said that in the past Mr. Nisman had praised her speeches to the United Nations aimed at seeking justice for the 1994 bombing.“Which Nisman should we believe?” Mrs. Kirchner asked. “The one who accused us without evidence or the one who praised all my efforts at the United Nations?”Mr. Catterberg said the government’s attacks against Mr. Nisman and the cover-up allegations were designed to prevent Mrs. Kirchner from losing her core supporters, which he estimates at about 35 percent of the electorate. The strategy, he added, also aims to prevent lawmakers and leaders who support Peronism, a political movement that includes Mrs. Kirchner’s party, from fleeing to other factions and damaging her party in the election.“If the cover-up allegations lose legal support, there are far fewer reasons behind why the government could have been behind Mr. Nisman’s death,” Mr. Catterberg said.A version of this article appears in print on March 5, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Argentine President May Face More Scrutiny.
