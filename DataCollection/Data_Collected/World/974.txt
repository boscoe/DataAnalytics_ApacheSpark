President Jacob Zuma has suspended the national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, pending an inquiry into allegations of misconduct, his office said Wednesday. Mr. Zuma’s office opened an investigation in September into the commissioner’s role in the 2012 killing of 34 miners by officers during a wildcat strike over pay at the Marikana mine run by the platinum producer Lonmin. The investigation will look into whether Ms. Phiyega and other senior police officers concealed information on decisions they made while handling the labor unrest. Mr. Zuma’s office also said he had appointed Johannes Khomotso Phahlane as acting national police commissioner.A version of this brief appears in print on October 15, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; South Africa: Police Commissioner, Under Investigation, Is Suspended.
