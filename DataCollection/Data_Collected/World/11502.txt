Officials from Malaysia and Australia said they would double the search area for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 if its wreckage was not found in the current target area.KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Officials from Malaysia, Australia and China said Thursday that they would double the search area for the Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared more than a year ago if it is not found by the end of next month.Vessels that have scoured the southern Indian Ocean far off the coast of Australia for months have found no trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people aboard.“We are moving to widen out the search area and to extend it in every direction,” Warren Truss, Australia’s deputy prime minister, said after a meeting here with Liow Tiong Lai and Yang Chuantang, the Malaysian and Chinese transportation ministers.An area of about 23,100 square miles has been deemed the plane’s most likely resting place, based on technical data transmitted during the flight by an onboard aircraft maintenance system. About 60 percent of that area has been searched, according to the Australian agency coordinating the deep-sea search; the agency said it expected the search of the remaining 40 percent to be largely completed by next month.AdvertisementThe search will be expanded to about 46,000 square miles if Flight 370 is not found by the end of May, and the expanded search could last “at least the rest of this year,” Mr. Truss said.
                This animation shows where floating debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could have drifted if experts are correct about where the plane went down.            Officials said the cost of expanding the search would be around $35 million, which would be shared by Australia and Malaysia. The two governments together have already committed around $86 million for the search.AdvertisementThe Boeing 777 dropped off radar screens during a routine red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, to Beijing. Based on data from military radar and the plane’s electronic communications with a satellite, the authorities say it inexplicably changed course, flying west over the Malaysian Peninsula and eventually south to the Indian Ocean.All 239 of the passengers and crew members who were on the plane, most of them Chinese, are presumed dead.Four ships are under contract by the Australian and Malaysian governments to search for wreckage from the plane, but bad weather has at times bought the search to a standstill, with sea swells reaching up to 55 feet as cyclones churned through the ocean.Fugro Survey, a division of a Dutch company hired by the Australian government to look for the wreckage, has three vessels at sea, some of which tow side-scan sonar devices that glide above the ocean floor at the end of fiber-optic cables up to 10,000 yards long.The search area covers an area where the ocean floor has never been fully mapped. Mr. Truss said search crews were mapping extinct volcanoes and other previously unknown geological formations.Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in Australia’s Parliament last month, “I can’t promise that the search will go on at this intensity forever, but we will continue our very best efforts to resolve this mystery and find some answers.”Thomas Fuller reported from Kuala Lumpur and Michelle Innis from Sydney, Australia.A version of this article appears in print on April 17, 2015, on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Asia; Officials Prepared to Expand Search for Missing Jet.
