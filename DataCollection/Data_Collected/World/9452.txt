The government confirmed that the man, Rodolfo González, 64, died while being held at the headquarters of the intelligence police. He had been jailed since April and was awaiting trial on charges related to accusations that he promoted violence during the protests. Interior Minister Gustavo González rejected opposition claims that the prisoner had been driven to take his life by his deplorable conditions in jail. He said the evidence suggested that the inmate hanged himself. Advertisement
