Mr. Xiros, 56, was arrested in the suburb of Anavyssos, southeast of Athens, on Saturday afternoon. He had been serving six life terms for his role in the terrorist group November 17, which killed 23 people, including Greek politicians and businessmen and British, American and Turkish diplomats and military officials, from 1975 to 2000. He vanished while on furlough on Jan. 7, 2014. Weeks later, he released a video criticizing the handling of Greeceâ€™s financial crisis, threatening politicians and journalists and vowing more attacks. Advertisement
