The Italian Coast Guard rescued 970 migrants Wednesday after smugglers put their cargo ship on automatic pilot, heading straight for a crash into the Italian coast, and abandoned the command. The Coast Guard officials said the migrants, most of whom are Syrians and including many children and pregnant women, arrived safely in Gallipoli, in Italy’s southeastern Puglia region, before dawn Wednesday. More than 100 of them were treated for hypothermia. “There would have been death and destruction” if the vessel, the Moldovan-flagged Blue Sky M, had crashed into the coast, said Cmdr. Filippo Marini. The Coast Guard traced the ship’s location after a passenger made a satellite phone call seeking help.A version of this brief appears in print on January 1, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Italy: Hundreds of Migrants Rescued.
