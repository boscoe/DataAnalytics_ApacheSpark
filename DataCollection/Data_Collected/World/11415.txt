Most of the striking employees of the public broadcaster Radio France returned to work on Wednesday, four weeks after they walked off the job to protest a proposed reorganization that would have resulted in hundreds of layoffs and the closing of the country’s oldest orchestra. The broadcaster, which operates seven radio stations and two orchestras, is one of France’s most trusted voices in news and entertainment. The strike had left listeners with canned music playlists and abbreviated news broadcasts since March 19. The strike ended after the government appointed a labor mediator and the culture minister, Fleur Pellerin, promised on Monday to work for a satisfactory outcome. Four of the network’s five unions voted Tuesday to end the strike, and the last holdout, the CGT union, was expected to return to work this week.A version of this brief appears in print on April 16, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; France: Radio Strike Is Ending.
