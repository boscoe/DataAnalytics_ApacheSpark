While there, the court said, the men suffered “torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.”The two men — Abu Zubaydah, charged with running a Qaeda site in Pakistan; and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of planning the attack in 2000 on the American destroyer Cole — are being held in the American military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.Poland requested an appeal in October, but it was denied.The money will be paid within a month, Mr. Schetyna said on Wednesday, though he said some details still had to be resolved.“There is a question of how the money will be spent and if we will have to pay it directly to the people who sued us,” Mr. Schetyna said. “They will have a hard time using it, as they are still in jail.”Marcin Wojciechowski, chief spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said that Poland would try to avoid paying the money directly to the two men, preferring to put it into accounts the men could access only if they are released.Advertisement
