A man crashed into a barrier while trying to drive into the United States Consulate in Shanghai late Thursday, the police said. One Chinese guard was slightly injured, the police added. The man, who was taken into custody, had no apparent political motive, according to the authorities. His wife told them he had refused to leave their home for nearly a month out of fear that someone was trying to kill him, the state-run Xinhua news service reported. The suspect, Liu Daojie, 35, from Fujian Province in southeast China, told the police he had spotted armed police officers outside the consulate and decided to drive into the compound to draw attention to his concerns, Xinhua reported. A State Department spokesman said that all staff members were accounted for and that the consulate would operate normally Friday.A version of this brief appears in print on February 13, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: China: Motorist Tries to Drive Into American Consulate.
