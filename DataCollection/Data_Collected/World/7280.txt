JERUSALEM — Israel on Friday published bids for the building of 450 new housing units in West Bank settlements, deepening Palestinian anger and eliciting blunt criticism from the United States, which called the move illegitimate, counterproductive and likely to worsen Israel's isolation.Israeli critics of the government also assailed the move, describing it as a provocative political gesture meant to appease right-wing voters ahead of elections in March.The construction bids also came against a background of heightened tensions with the Obama administration over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s impending address to Congress, which was arranged without coordination with the White House.The United States, Israel's most important ally, has repeatedly condemned Israeli settlement plans. But the timing of the latest announcement appeared to especially irk White House officials.Advertisement“We have deep concerns about these highly contentious settlement construction announcements,” Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters in Washington. “They will have detrimental impacts on the ground, enflame already heightened tension with the Palestinians and further isolate the Israelis internationally.”AdvertisementThe European Union, in which legislative support for recognition of a Palestinian state has been growing — to Israel’s dismay — also criticized the construction bids. If carried out, the European Union’s foreign office said a statement, they would “further undermine the viability of the two-state solution; they are illegal in international law and constitute an obstacle to peace.”Ariel Rosenberg, a spokesman for the Israeli Housing Ministry, said the bids were not new but had been remarketed after they failed to attract contractors last year. “Failed tenders are automatically remarketed by professional staff in the Israel Land Authority,” he said, referring to the government agency responsible for land management.The current housing minister is Uri Ariel of the pro-settlement Jewish Home party.Most of the world considers the settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to be a violation of international law. The Palestinians intend to establish a state on the lands that Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 war. The Obama administration has described the settlements as “illegitimate.”American officials have said Israel's repeated announcements of construction bids played a destructive role in the breakdown of American-brokered peace negotiations with the Palestinians last year.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Others are planned for settlements closer to Jerusalem and the 1967 lines such as Adam, Elkana and Alfei Menashe.Saeb Erekat, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee and the chief Palestinian negotiator, said in a statement that “the announcement for 450 additional criminal settlement units” was “unsurprising when viewed in the context of the culture of impunity granted to Israel by the international community.”The Palestinians moved a month ago to join the International Criminal Court in The Hague with the intention of using the court to pursue cases against Israel’s settlement policy and its military operations. In mid-January, the court’s prosecutors opened a preliminary examination of possible war crimes committed in the Palestinian territories.Advertisement“Israel is intent on providing the I.C.C. with further evidence of its lawlessness,” Hanan Ashrawi, another P.L.O. executive committee member, said in a statement.“There is a sense that they are holding a liquidation sale before the elections,” Yariv Oppenheimer, director of Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy group that opposes all settlement activity, told Israel Radio, referring to the government. “The housing minister and the prime minister are trying to do all they can to create facts on the ground before the government is replaced.”In addition, Israeli anti-settlement groups said Friday that a local Jerusalem planning committee had advanced plans for 93 new housing units in Gilo, which lies over the 1967 line on the southern edge of Jerusalem.Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.A version of this article appears in print on January 31, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Israel Takes New Step to Expand West Bank Housing.
