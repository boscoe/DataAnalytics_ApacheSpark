The first military conscription in the peace-time history of the United States started yesterday when the prime cut of the nation’s man power — virtually all men between twenty-one and thirty-five, inclusive, estimated at 16,500,000 strong — placed themselves at the call of the War Department by registering for possible military service. Here and there a man grumbled, or even refused to register, but for each one who did there were tens of thousands who expressed pride and willingness to play their parts in America’s defense plan to train about 900,000 soldiers each year for the next five years. Under this program approximately every fifth man who registered will be sent to training camp. In practice, the men who will be assigned to training will be single men, with no dependents, in good physical condition and not engaged in an occupation essential to national welfare or industrial defense. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 17, 1940
