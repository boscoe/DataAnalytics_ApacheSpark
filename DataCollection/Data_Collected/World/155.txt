In addition, 44 people were arrested in Istanbul on suspicion of links with the Kurdish rebels. The fighting took place in the town of Silvan, in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir, where all of those killed were members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, according to a security official. A cease-fire that lasted for two and a half years was broken in July, when the Turkish government began a crackdown on the party, known as the P.K.K. Since then, more than 120 security personnel and hundreds of militants have been killed. Advertisement
