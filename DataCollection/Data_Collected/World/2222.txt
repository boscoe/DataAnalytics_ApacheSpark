Two Syrian activists who used video and social media to expose human rights abuses committed by the Islamic State were tracked down by jihadists and killed in their home in a southern Turkish city, according to their colleagues.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, released a graphic video claiming responsibility for their deaths on Sunday. The clip showed the body of one of the activists, his throat slit, along with a warning to the group’s opponents.“You will never be safe from the blade of the Islamic State, and our hand will reach you wherever you are to slit your throat,” it said.One of the men, Ibrahim Abdel Qader, was a co-founder of Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, a group of citizen journalists and human rights activists that uses social media to document abuses committed by the jihadist group in Raqqa, the Syrian city it uses as its headquarters. The citizen-journalists are a primary source about life inside the ISIS capital.AdvertisementThe second man, Fares Hammadi, was a former member of the group who had left to work on human rights abuses across Syria as a whole, not just Raqqa, a spokesman for the group said.AdvertisementThe video posted by ISIS on Sunday included a mocking reference to the group’s name, saying that the killing of the two men was meant “to teach every apostate that he will slaughtered silently.” And it raised troubling questions about the group’s potential reach into nearby countries.Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, a spokesman for the activist group, said that Mr. Abdel Qader had been stabbed more than 50 times and then beheaded in his apartment in Sanliurfa, Turkey, while Mr. Hammadi’s throat was slit.He said the Turkish police were investigating the killings. Members of the activist group said the police had told them they believed the killings occurred between 2 and 5 a.m. on Friday.Reached for comment, the provincial governor’s office in Sanliurfa said that the case was under investigation and would not give further details.Mr. Raqqawi said that both men left Raqqa last year and fled to Sanliurfa, a city of roughly 500,000 about 30 miles inside Turkey, after receiving threats from the Islamic State. He said Mr. Hammadi had been arrested and tortured by members of ISIS, who left long scars across his upper back.The activist group accused an acquaintance of the men in Sanliurfa, Tlas Surour, of killing the two. The group said Mr. Surour had recently come to Sanliurfa from Raqqa and presented himself as a defector from ISIS. He reportedly became friends with the men, renting an apartment next door and going out to eat with them. The group released a photo of him with one of the victims.

The group was aware that the Islamic State was looking for its offices in southern Turkey, but was nevertheless stunned by the killing of its members there.“We try to be very careful because it is getting more dangerous every day,” Mr. Raqqawi said. “We get death threats every day – ‘We will kill you all, we will cut off your heads’ — but we never imagined they would do this on Turkish soil.”Turkey has invested heavily in efforts to combat and contain the Islamic State. but it has suffered spillover violence in the past. Turkish officials blame the Islamic State for a bombing at a peace rally in Ankara, the capital, last month that killed at least 95 peopleCeylan Yeginsu contributed reporting from Istanbul.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
