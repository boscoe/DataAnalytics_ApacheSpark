BERLIN — The police in Dresden are investigating the murder of a 20-year-old Eritrean refugee who was found dead Tuesday with stab wounds to his chest and neck, officials said Wednesday.The state prosecutor, Lorenz Haase, identified the refugee only as Khalid I., saying his body was discovered by other residents of his apartment block.The case comes as Dresden has been the focal point of marches by up to 25,000 people backing a group that calls itself Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West, or Pegida for short.The victim had been in Dresden since September and had sought asylum, Mr. Haase said. Figures released Wednesday by the federal Interior Ministry showed that 202,834 people sought asylum in Germany last year, a 60 percent increase over 2013.A version of this article appears in print on January 15, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Germany: Murder Inquiry Focuses on Migrant’s Death.
