Khodorkovsky’s foundation, chemical weapons attacks by government forces on rebels in Jobar were reported by French journalists and local opposition activists.In his analysis of the viral video, Roland Oliphant, a Moscow correspondent for the London newspaper The Telegraph, observed that intensive Russian state television coverage of the war in Syria might have helped sway the public behind the military intervention.“Before the intervention just 14 percent of Russians said they backed direct military support for Bashar al-Assad’s government, according to a mid-September poll by the independent Levada Center,” Mr. Oliphant reported. “But a later survey by the same pollster released on Oct. 8, one week into the air campaign, showed 72 percent of Russians backing airstrikes.”Advertisement
