Journals, a fixture of the international section, allow correspondents to step back from the news and write about places that intrigue them. This year, we learned about a surfing club in Sierra Leone that helped people cope with Ebola; a trash pile in Beirut that united residents in disgust; an Italian town that unearthed centuries of history in a quest to fix a toilet; ostentatious “love motels” in Brazil; a storied bookstore in Islamabad; and a 14th-century castle in New Delhi where supernatural beings are thought to grant wishes.We hope you enjoy our choices.As Ebola gnaws through Sierra Leone, those at Bureh Beach Surf Club teach and feed tourists, eking out a living seemingly determined to pursue their passion as a way to cope. Warming relations have brought a burst of popularity for Old Glory, which Cubans are displaying on apartments, cars and especially their clothing.As he tried to find a sewage pipe, Luciano Faggiano dug his way past a Messapian tomb, a Roman granary, a Franciscan chapel and even etchings from the Knights Templar.Ignazio Marino is seen as a leader of unblemished integrity. But many question whether that is enough in the face of crumbling services, a declining standard of living and government scandal.The Russian capital is looking ever more like an elegant European capital, but its political life is marching steadily in the opposite direction.To protesters, the garbage piles are one indignity too far, the ultimate manifestation of a failed system that has left the state unable to perform basic functions.Motels that rent by the hour have moved beyond ostentatious decorations to embrace services, like helicopter rides and high-end dining, for clients seeking trysts or to spice up their relationships.The female attendants who historically cleaned the city’s free toilets may be relegated to the past by a company promising an elegant bathroom experience, at a price.Curry is so important to the British palate that it has its own committee in Parliament, but curry advocates say immigration restrictions are causing staff shortages.Those wishing to know what they are can find them in petitions addressed to supernatural beings and pinned to the wall of a 14th-century castle.Most of Hong Kong is not an urban jungle, but rather a real one, bristling with monkeys, pythons and boars — and a lot of feral cattle.Saeed Jan Qureshi built one of the biggest bookstores in the world and earned a reputation as a source of literary advice. Now, the future of Saeed Book Bank is in his son’s hands.The demand for crisp, clean Guinean francs for gift giving has provided jobs for young people in Conakry, who try to reel in customers wanting to trade in old bills.On the outskirts of Beijing, more than 1,000 families have settled into a community modeled after an American frontier town, on streets with names like Aspen, Moose and Route 66.Thirty young men spent months burning the bodies of the infected. A year later, many relatives and fellow countrymen still can’t forgive them.Advertisement
