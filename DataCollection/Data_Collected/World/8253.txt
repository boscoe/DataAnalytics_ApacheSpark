The divers handed over all the coins.Mr. Sharvit said they probably came from a boat that sank on its way to deliver tax money to Egypt or from a merchant ship trading among Mediterranean coastal cities.He said archaeologists hoped that further excavations at the site of the discovery would make it possible “to supplement our understanding of the entire archaeological context, and thus answer the many questions that still remain unanswered about the treasure.”Robert Cole, the Israel Antiquities Authority’s curator of coins, said the coins were in excellent condition. They did not require any cleaning or conservation, despite having been at the bottom of the sea for about a millennium.“Gold is a noble metal and is not affected by air or water,” he said. “Several of the coins that were found in the assemblage were bent and exhibit teeth and bite marks, evidence they were ‘physically’ inspected by their owners or the merchants.”The earliest coin exposed in the treasure was a quarter dinar minted in Palermo, Sicily, in the second half of the ninth century.Most of the coins, though, appear to have belonged to the Fatimid caliphs Al-Hakim and his son Al-Zahir and been minted later. The Fatimid kingdom ruled Northern Africa beginning in the 10th century.Advertisement
