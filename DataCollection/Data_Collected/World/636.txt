The Associated Press count is 701 higher than Saudi Arabia’s official tally of 769 killed and 934 injured in the Sept. 24 disaster in Mina, a few miles from the holy city of Mecca. Saudi officials, who could not be reached for comment Friday, have said their tally remains accurate and have not updated their casualty toll since Sept. 26. The previous deadliest episode took place in 1990, when a stampede killed 1,426 people. The A.P. figure comes from statements and officials’ comments from 19 of the over 180 countries that sent citizens to the five-day annual pilgrimage. The authorities have said the Sept. 24 crush and stampede occurred when two waves of pilgrims converged on a narrow road, causing hundreds of people to suffocate or be trampled to death. Advertisement
