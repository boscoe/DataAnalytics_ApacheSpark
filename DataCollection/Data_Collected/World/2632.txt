Mr. Lamorde is the latest in a string of senior officials to be removed by Mr. Buhari, who took office in May promising to halt the graft dragging down Nigeria, the continent’s top oil producer. Mr. Lamorde was a police commissioner when he became chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission four years ago. The commission itself has been accused of corruption.
