The Chinese artist Ai Weiwei this week visited the Greek island of Lesbos, where thousands of migrants continue to arrive daily, hoping to find refuge in Europe from war and poverty in the Middle East, West Asia and North Africa.During his visit, Mr. Ai turned his Instagram account into a news feed, sharing photographs of himself with new arrivals and the volunteers who have come from around the world to help them.The artist, who marched through London in September with the sculptor Anish Kapoor in solidarity with refugees, also shared images of children being helped from arriving boats, and of the growing mountain of discarded life jackets left behind by the more than 400,000 migrants who survived the often perilous boat journey from Turkey this year.
