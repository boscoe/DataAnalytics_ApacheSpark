TIKRIT, Iraq —  Iraqi officials insisted for weeks that Islamic State fighters had been all but exterminated in Tikrit, confined to a few pockets in the city center. Yet on Sunday, military officials in the city were reluctant to allow journalists to head back to Baghdad by road — even though the highway skirts Tikrit well to the west.The supposed safer alternative was a general’s Iraqi Air Force Cessna waiting at the Tikrit Air Base nine miles northwest of downtown. But before takeoff, two mortar shells slammed into a grassy patch between the airfield’s two runways, within 100 yards of the small plane. Iraqi military escorts surmised that the person shooting had to have been within visual range — and probably to the west, although downtown was southeast.“Daesh are everywhere,” one senior officer said, using the Arab nickname for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.During a two-day visit to Tikrit, a strategic city in Iraq’s central Sunni heartland, it was clear that after four weeks of the government offensive the Islamic State’s fighters are more numerous and still hold much more territory here than officials had previously allowed, even with heavy American airstrikes added in.AdvertisementAccording to Iraqi military officials and fighters on the ground in Tikrit, ISIS still dominates or controls about 20 square miles of the city, everything from the edge of Tikrit University in the north, to the far end of the New Ouja neighborhood in the south, a distance as much as eight miles north to south. That encompasses most of the populous parts of the city, which generally lie west of the Tigris River; all of its main downtown and business districts; the government quarter and the former palace of Saddam Hussein.AdvertisementGovernment forces remain mostly east of the Tigris, an area that is predominantly rural and agricultural, or on the suburban or rural outskirts of the city on the western and southern sides. The city’s population used to be more than a quarter million, but most residents have fled.The army headquarters for the operation are situated at a campus building not far from the front line with ISIS — though here, front line is a relative term. Eight mortar tubes were set up around the headquarters to provide defense, and they were pointing not just south toward the center of Tikrit, but also to the north and northeast.Those mortars were all fired relatively frequently Saturday and Sunday, their shots alternating with the ground-shaking blasts of bombs being dropped from time to time by coalition aircraft.
            Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.        Iraqi Army Retakes Government Complex in Central Ramadi
Iraqi forces continued their weeklong assault on Monday and seized a government complex in central Ramadi. The last remaining ISIS militants left the government buildings on Monday afternoon as the Iraqi Army continued to disrupt the seven-month occupation.

Iraqi security forces have made gains in western Ramadi this week, after spending months trying to cordon off and surround the city. But they have yet to cross the rivers around the city's center, where intense urban combat is expected. Ramadi fell to the Islamic State in May after Iraqi forces withdrew en masse. The government has been trying to recapture it since July.

Jordan is blocking up to 12,000 Syrians in two points in its northeastern border region. A satellite image from Dec. 5 shows more than 1,000 tents at the biggest camp, Rukban, in a demilitarized zone between Syria and Jordan. According to the United Nations, the number of people in these locations has risen from 4,000 to 12,000 since the beginning of November.

The estimated number of foreign fighters who traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State and other extremist groups has increased to at least 27,000 from 12,000 in the past 18 months, according to a report by The Soufan Group, a private geopolitical risk assessment company. The most foreign fighters come from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Russia, according to the analysis.

Syrian activists have documented more than 70 airstrikes on Raqqa in the five days after the Paris attacks, compared with about 50 during the first two weeks of November. French warplanes have pounded the city, the Islamic State’s stronghold, and Russia has targeted it in retaliation for the downing of a Russian passenger plane over Egypt. It is unclear how much ISIS was affected by the recent strikes, however.

The airstrikes, which aim to choke the Islamic State's financial lifeline, target eight large fields that generate several million dollars per month for the group.

Kurdish and Yazidi fighters, backed by American air power, began a major offensive to retake Sinjar, Iraq, and cut a crucial Islamic State supply route between Raqqa, Syria, the group’s capital, and Mosul, the largest Islamic State-controlled city in Iraq. Before the operation, thousands of Kurdish fighters prepared to sweep down from Mount Sinjar and attack the Islamic State on multiple fronts.

In November 2014, the Islamic State established a base in Libya after accepting pledges of allegiance from militants in Darnah, Libya. Forces loyal to the Misurata-Tripoli faction retreated from areas east and west of Surt, where the Islamic State was gaining territory, at the end of May. On June 14, the Islamic State lost control of Darnah to local militias.
