Mr. Strelet, a Liberal Democrat, had taken the post only in the end of July.Thousands of Moldovans have been demonstrating outside the Parliament building in Chisinau, the capital, for more than a month in protests against official corruption, news agencies reported.The country was rocked this year by the discovery that $1 billion had been fraudulently siphoned from Moldova’s banking system over a period of years, a huge amount for an impoverished country whose entire economic output is only about $8 billion a year.A former prime minister — Vlad Filat, who held office from 2009-13 — was arrested in the case in October, on charges of accepting $260 million in bribes.Whether Moldova, a former Soviet republic, would orient itself toward the West (it borders Romania, a European Union member) or toward Moscow has been a bone of contention since the country gained independence in 1991. Like neighboring Ukraine, Moldova has seen a pro-Russian eastern province, Transnistria, break away from the central government’s control; Russian troops are stationed there.Despite objections from the Kremlin, Moldova signed an association agreement with the European Union in 2014, but its economic and political troubles have complicated the path to any further integration. Five rival parties are represented in the country’s fractious Parliament, necessitating coalition governments; Mr. Strelet’s predecessor, Chiril Gaburici, lasted only four months in office.Advertisement
