RIO DE JANEIRO — Leftist youths spat at both Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy yesterday [Nov. 16] in two separate incidents. Mr. Rusk, on his way to an inter-American conference here, had stopped in Montevideo, when he was attacked by an 18-year-old youth who shouted: ‘‘This is in the name of my people.’’ The youth, who spat toward Mr. Rusk, was quickly subdued by police. Sen. Kennedy was spat upon by University of Chile students, who also threw eggs and stones at him in Conception. Sen. Kennedy controlled his anger. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 18, 1965
