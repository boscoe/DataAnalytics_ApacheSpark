Deaths from a swine flu outbreak in Iran have more than tripled in the past three weeks to at least 112, Agence France-Presse said Monday, quoting the Iranian news media. Mohammad Mehdi Gouya, head of the Health Ministry’s communicable diseases department, was quoted as saying the outbreak, which began in November, was under control and likely to diminish in coming days. He was also quoted as saying that nearly 1,200 people had been hospitalized with the sickness caused by the virus, known as H1N1. Iranian health officials said in early December that the virus had mostly affected people in the southern areas of Iran and that they feared it could spread to Tehran and provinces in the north and east. Swine flu is named for a virus that infects pigs, but the H1N1 strain spreads via human-to-human contact and escalated into a global pandemic in 2009 before it was controlled in 2010.A version of this brief appears in print on December 29, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Deaths From Swine Flu Rise.
