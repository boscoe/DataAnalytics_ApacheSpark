CAIRO —  Former President Hosni Mubarak embezzled $17.5 million for personal expenses during his last eight years in power, according to billing statements cited as evidence in his only criminal conviction still standing: $5,455 for four La-Z-Boy recliners, $6,336 on a marble mosaic for a son’s bathroom, $2,018 for a chess set, and hundreds of other items.Now, however, a Cairo appeals court has reversed the last guilty verdict. Citing procedural problems, Judge Salama Abdel Meguid ordered a retrial for the last of several convictions handed down in the aftermath of the 2011 uprising that ended Mr. Mubarak’s rule.All of the previous convictions, including a guilty verdict for directing the killing of demonstrators, have now been dismissed or upended after a 2013 military takeover, granting Mr. Mubarak, 86, at least a partial rehabilitation.When a court ruling in November overturned his murder conviction and life sentence, the decision was widely seen as a sweeping repudiation of the 2011 uprising that forced him from power. Thousands braved draconian new penalties for public demonstrations and protested near Tahrir Square the night the verdict was announced. Security forces had already sealed off the square in anticipation, and they used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. At least two protesters were killed, and at least nine others were injured.

During a brief, televised court session, Judge Meguid had scarcely announced the decision to send the case back for retrial before women in the courtroom erupted in celebration and drowned out his voice.AdvertisementThe Egyptian state and private news media, almost all of it pro-government, covered the ruling only lightly. The Egyptian affiliate of the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera network had devoted extensive coverage to outrage at the previous successful Mubarak appeal in November, but Qatar has since agreed to shut down the station in an attempt to repair diplomatic relations with the military-backed government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.AdvertisementMada Masr, an English-language online magazine, published the billing records showing details of the Mubaraks’ extravagant lifestyle, which might have enraged many Egyptians. The average household income here is about $4,090 a year, according to the most recent government figures. But few, if any, Arabic-language news outlets reported on the Mubarak expenses.There is no longer any legal reason for Mr. Mubarak to be detained. He remains inside a military hospital overlooking the Nile, where he was moved from prison for health reasons during his trials. But even before the reversal on Tuesday, he had already been detained for longer than his three-year corruption sentence, ostensibly entitling him to release.There may, however, be political reasons for Mr. Mubarak to stay out of sight, or for the authorities to keep him from public view. If released, he would become the first former president allowed to live freely and speak openly; all others left the post in military custody or died in office. Mr. Mubarak could publicly defend his tenure, criticize Mr. Sisi’s policies, rally his former loyalists in business, politics and government, or potentially even seek to influence a planned parliamentary vote — any of which could prove awkward for Mr. Sisi.Not all residents agree with the Egyptian court ruling that sentenced former President Hosni Mubarak to three years on charges of stealing public funds.Overturning the conviction, though, may remove some embarrassment for Mr. Sisi’s prime minister, Ibrahim Mehlib. Mr. Mehlib was the chief executive of the state-run construction company under Mr. Mubarak, and the prosecution’s court filings in the case charged that Mr. Mehlib had played a central role in helping the family embezzle money by falsifying expense reports.Prosecutors accused the Mubaraks of illegally charging the government for personal expenses — including utility bills, landscaping, home furnishings, refrigerators, other electrical appliances and kitchen supplies — and for a variety of private homes, as well as a public palace that was fraudulently transferred to their ownership.Many expenses related to five vacation homes that the family owned near the seaside resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, as well as a farm east of Cairo. The family billed the government for the design and furnishing of a private office in a luxury hotel complex for Mr. Mubarak’s wife, Suzanne, and another office where their sons ran an investment business.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Military leaders remember Mr. Mubarak as one of their own, and the political will to bring charges against him has dissipated.Striking down Mr. Mubarak’s murder conviction in November, Judge Mahmoud Kamel al-Rashidi struck a philosophical tone. “To rule for or against him after he has become old,” he said, “will be left to history and the judge of judges.”A version of this article appears in print on January 14, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Egyptian Judge Voids Mubarak’s Last Standing Conviction and Orders Retrial.
