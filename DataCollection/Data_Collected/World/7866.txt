This small town on the border with Turkey was under siege for months as Islamic State fighters and Kurdish forces battled for control. Most of the residents fled to refugee camps in Turkey. The militants were finally pushed out in late January by Kurdish fighters with the help of American-led airstrikes.

Syria’s largest city was home to more than two million people before the war. Now most of its residents have left, and the city is divided between pro-government forces and rebels. The city center is one of the main fronts. An analysis of 210 sites in the city’s old quarters concluded that about half were damaged and one-fifth were destroyed.

After months under siege by government forces and facing starvation, most of the rebels agreed last May to a negotiated withdrawal from the city. Some are still fighting in the more heavily populated Waer neighborhood. The city’s old quarters were severely damaged.

The Islamic State now holds most of the city. In December, the Islamists began an offensive to take the airport, which had been used by pro-government forces to launch airstrikes in the region. Airstrikes by the American-led coalition against the Islamic State also hit targets near the city.

The Syrian government demolished thousands of residential buildings in the suburbs of Hama and Damascus between 2012 and 2013, according to a study by Human Rights Watch. In Hama, the Mashaa al-Arbaeen neighborhood was razed in the fall of 2012. Residents there were perceived by the government as sympathizing with the opposition.
