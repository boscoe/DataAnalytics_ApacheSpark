All the people first reported symptoms in December; three have died, the rest are in critical condition. Their ages range from 20 to 78, with most over 50. All but one had a known history of exposure to live poultry. Human infections with this bird flu strain were first noticed in March 2013. Since then, there have been more than 450 cases, with the numbers spiking in winter and vanishing in summer. Thus far, the H7N9 strain has not been known to move easily between humans, although there have been some family clusters. There has been no known spread to health care workers. China has tried to fight outbreaks by shutting live poultry markets for cleaning, but legal and illegal markets continue to operate, the W.H.O. has said. Advertisement
