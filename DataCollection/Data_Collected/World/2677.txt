In 1965, Prime Minister Ian Smith of Rhodesia arrived in England for talks, before the country’s independence was declared. British Pathé.SALISBURY — Rhodesia today [Nov. 11] declared its independence in the most momentous defiance of Britain since America threw off colonial rule nearly 200 years ago. The white-ruled colony in the heart of Africa immediately found itself outlawed in a largely hostile world. Britain imposed economic sanctions and called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to recruit world-wide support. In Pretoria, South African Premier Dr. Hendrik Verwoerd declared that his country would continue normal relations with Rhodesia, thus becoming the first government to recognize the ‘‘rebel’’ nation. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 12, 1965
