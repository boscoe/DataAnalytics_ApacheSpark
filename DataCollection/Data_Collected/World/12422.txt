He also said the United States had allocated $5 million for the creation of a special court or other independent judicial mechanism that would hold perpetrators of atrocities and other crimes in South Sudan to account. Speaking at a news conference while visiting Nairobi, Kenya, Mr. Kerry said South Sudan’s promising potential after achieving independence from Sudan in 2011 “is now at grave risk of being squandered because of civil violence, because of more than two million people who have been displaced from their homes.” He sharply criticized President Salva Kiir of South Sudan and his political rival, the former vice president, Riek Machar, “who have not yet chosen to make the compromises needed for peace.” In an interview with South Sudan’s Eye Radio, Mr. Kerry was even more blunt, saying South Sudan’s leaders “need to come to their senses” and make peace. Loyalists of Mr. Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, and Mr. Machar, of the Nuer ethnic group, have been fighting since December 2013.  Advertisement
