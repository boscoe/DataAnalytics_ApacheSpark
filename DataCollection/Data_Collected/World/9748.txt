Who could possibly bemoan rising prosperity, greater economic freedom, a declining birthrate and increasing university enrollment?Perhaps a Chinese military recruiter. Anecdotal evidence suggests that a career in the People’s Liberation Army is becoming less attractive for talented young people, even as the country’s armed forces are increasingly in need of educated soldiers, sailors and airmen to operate its rapidly growing arsenal of advanced weapons.Working against the military is the country’s one-child policy, now well into its third decade, which has led to a generation of only children in China’s cities who have a variety of career choices other than a rigorous soldier’s life, Xie Xiaobo, the chief of staff at the Guizhou Xingyi military command in southern China, was quoted as saying in PLA Daily, the military’s flagship newspaper. Mr. Xie added that after decades of peace, young people’s awareness of national defense issues had also weakened and that veterans were not receiving the benefits they once were entitled to, such as job placement at a state-owned company, reducing the attraction of a military career.Li Guangju, a political commissar in the northern province of Hebei, told PLA Daily that many of the young people attracted to a career in the armed forces did not have the skills needed for an advanced army.The recruitment crunch comes as the People’s Liberation Army deploys an increasingly sophisticated array of weaponry, including missiles capable of sinking aircraft carriers, fighter jets with stealth technology, modern destroyers and submarines, and an information-warfare corps trained in cyberwarfare. This year, the country plans to increase military spending by 10 percent to about $145 billion, the government announced this month.In the eastern province of Shandong — a heavily populated region that has traditionally supplied a disproportionate share of the military’s forces — the number of new recruits started to fall off four or five years ago, Li Daguang, a professor at the National Defense University in Beijing, told Global Times, an offshoot of the Communist Party’s main newspaper, People’s Daily.“Parents used to vie to get their children enlisted, and some even tried to bribe the recruitment officials, but now the opposite is true,” Professor Li said.For the rent-seeking set, a career in the military may not be as attractive as it was a few years ago. The governing Communist Party is in the middle of a wide-ranging crackdown on corruption, with much of the effort focused on the military. This month, the military announced that 14 generals, including the son of one of the two generals who served on the party’s elite Politburo from 2007 to 2012, were under investigation over corruption. The other general on the Politburo at that time, Xu Caihou, was stripped of his party membership last year for taking bribes. He died on March 15 of bladder cancer.
