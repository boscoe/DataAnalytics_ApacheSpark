Two large bombings in Shiite-majority neighborhoods in Baghdad killed at least 18 people on Saturday. The larger attack took place in the Kadhimiya neighborhood, where the police said a suicide bomber set off his explosives at a checkpoint. At least 11 people were killed, including at least four civilians, and more than 36 people were wounded. In the second attack, a suicide bomber set off explosives on a busy street in the Huriya district, killing seven people and wounding 25, the police said. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but the Islamic State group, which controls about a third of Iraq and Syria, has carried out several similar attacks.A version of this brief appears in print on October 4, 2015, on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iraq: Explosions in Baghdad Kill at Least 18 People.
