The guards were on patrol near the town of Qasr-e Shirin, about 340 miles west of the capital, Tehran, when one of the mines went off. The second, which killed the shepherd, was in the same area. Iran says it has defused millions of land mines that Iraqi forces planted during the 1980-88 conflict. Advertisement
