Belgian authorities have detained four suspects during an antiterrorism sweep linked to the recruitment of potential jihadis to go fight in Syria, officials said Friday. The police searched 22 homes, mostly in northeastern Belgium early Friday but found no weapons, explosives or ammunition. The federal prosecutor’s office said in a statement the sweep was aimed at “uncovering the organization behind the recruitment and sending” of people to Syria. Officials fear that fighters trained and radicalized in Syria could carry out attacks at home after returning from the war zone. The prosecutor’s office said the operation was not linked to the attacks this month in Paris nor to the Jan. 15 operation in Belgium, when the authorities claimed that they prevented an imminent and major terrorist attack on the police.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
