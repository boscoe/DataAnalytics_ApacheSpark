MEXICO CITY —  A Mexican military helicopter was shot down Friday in southwestern Mexico, killing three soldiers and wounding several others during an outbreak of violence in the region that left banks and gas stations ablaze and residents hunkering indoors, military and regional officials said.An armed group in a rural area of Jalisco State fired on the helicopter, forcing it to make an emergency landing. The army said in a statement that three soldiers died, three were missing and 12 others aboard were wounded, but it was not clear if their injuries were from gunfire, which damaged the tail rotor, or the landing.It was a rare fatal attack on a military aircraft, though several have been strafed or forced to land because of mechanical mishaps as Mexico has stepped up their use in recent years to battle organized crime groups.Violence erupted in four southwestern states early Friday as federal forces cracked down on a major drug gang. In Jalisco, 11 banks and 16 gasoline stations were set on fire and nearly 30 roadblock were formed by flaming vehicles, many of them in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, the country’s second-largest. A total of seven people, including the soldiers, were reported killed, and 15 people were arrested, while the governor of the state, Aristóteles Sandoval, declared a “red alert” and appealed for calm.Advertisement“The whole government is active,” he said in a post on Twitter. “Security in the state is being redoubled.”AdvertisementThe American Consulate in Guadalajara issued a warning to its employees to stay in their homes; Friday was a holiday in Mexico, Labor Day, when many people normally flock to vacation spots. One of them, Puerto Vallarta, on the Pacific Coast in Jalisco, reported fires as well, though they did not appear to be near resorts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
