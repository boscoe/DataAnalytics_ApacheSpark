After meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican on Tuesday, the president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, told his two million Twitter followers that the pontiff had spoken enthusiastically about his coming visit to the country and had even told him a self-deprecating joke.Mr. Correa said that the pope, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, was looking forward to returning to Latin America in July, beginning with a stop in Ecuador.
            Tuvimos audiencia con el Papa. Fraterno como siempre y queriendo mucho al Ecuador.
¡No puedo creer las oportunidades que me ha dado la vida!        He then revealed that Pope Francis had poked fun at the stereotypical self-love of Argentines.
            Me contó un chiste. A todos sorprendió que escogiera llamarse “Francisco”, porque siendo argentino, esperaban que se llame “Jesús II”...        According to a translation from the Argentine journalist Uki Goñi, the pope joked that his compatriots were surprised that he had chosen to call himself Francis I, since, “being Argentine, they thought I would call myself Jesus II.”

            ...Un abrazo a nuestra querida Argentina, y perdón por el chiste, pero fue... ¡del propio Papa!        Ecuador’s president also attended a summit meeting at the Vatican on Tuesday on the environment, along with Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations. The meeting was part of a campaign by the pope to press world leaders to take action to combat climate change.La Nación, an Argentine daily, noted that the pope had also joked about the supposed vanity of his people in an interview last month with a Mexican television journalist.On that occasion, after observing that Argentines are “not humble,” he asked the reporter, “Do you know how an Argentine kills himself?” When she said no, the pope replied, “He climbs up on his ego, and then throws himself down!”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
