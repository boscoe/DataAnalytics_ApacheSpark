The Honduran police said Wednesday that 15 people had been killed in two attacks within a span of 12 hours. Seven people were shot in the capital, Tegucigalpa, early Wednesday, and eight bus drivers were killed in the northern city of San Pedro Sula late Tuesday. A senior police official, Leonel Sauceda, said that in Wednesday’s attack, six of the victims were pulled from their homes by armed men and shot. He said that the manner of the crime suggested an attack by gangs. In the Tuesday attacks, six men in flak jackets and ski masks shot eight drivers one by one at a bus terminal. Murders of bus drivers and taxi drivers are common in Honduras and are almost always linked to the collection of extortion by any of the half-dozen gangs that operate nationwide. Nearly all drivers must pay a weekly amount to the gangs.A version of this brief appears in print on November 26, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Honduras: Gunmen Kill 15 People in 2 Days.
