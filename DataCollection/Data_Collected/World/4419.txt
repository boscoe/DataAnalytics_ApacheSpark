As Beijing enacted emergency measures on Tuesday to cope with the city’s first “red alert” over air pollution, images and stories of woe on social media documented the smog that is keeping schoolchildren and factory workers at home and some vehicles off the roads.China’s state news agency, offering a stark contrast to current conditions, published images of pollution-free days. It did not say when the photographs of clear blue skies were taken: days of heavy smog that were off the charts started in late November, producing levels beyond the measure of the air-quality index.

            Beijing’s first 2015 red alert for heavy air pollution announced Tuesday. Take a look at today's #smog : pic.twitter.com/rN2W9xXqV3 Edward Wong, The New York Times’s bureau chief in China, published images and reaction on Twitter, including an item that circulated the trending nickname #airpocalypse that some have given to the crisis:
            Beijing issues Red Alert on pollution for the first time. 20 million face airpocalypse. https://t.co/ClXWxQEuSM pic.twitter.com/AWu3DiF5y3 Even far from street-level, the situation looked grim. A satellite image showed an opaque patch smothering the regionaround Beijing. The image was captured on Dec. 7, the day Chinese officials declared there would be a red alert.

            "Life in a Toxic Country." I wrote this earlier on China. Still valid now; smog Red Alert. https://t.co/ZcpyLYgakE pic.twitter.com/UcOaB1dI5O Among the commonplace precautions are the use of air filters in homes and surgical masks for those venturing outside. Still, from smoking to exercising in public, many stubbornly stuck to their daily activities, even if they did need to adapt a bit. Others, it appeared, had no choice but to go to work.
