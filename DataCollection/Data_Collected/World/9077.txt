A rescue team has found two bodies in a glacier on Mexico’s tallest peak, a dormant volcano, officials said Friday, adding that the bodies may be the remains of climbers missing since a 1959 avalanche. Juan Navarro, the mayor of Chalchicomula de Sesma, the town nearest the Pico de Orizaba volcano, the third highest in North America, said a rescue team went up Thursday to start digging out the first body, sighted this week. Initially, only a head and a hand could be seen sticking out of the snow and ice. But on Thursday, they excavated further and discovered that the hand actually belonged to another body that appeared to be embracing the first corpse. The bodies were found at an altitude of about 17,290 feet, just below the peak of the 18,406-foot volcano.A version of this brief appears in print on March 7, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Mexico: Bodies Found Atop Volcano.
