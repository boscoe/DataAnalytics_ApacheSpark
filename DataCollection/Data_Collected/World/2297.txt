LONDON —  After the revelations by Edward J. Snowden of wholesale surveillance and the rapid development of communications technology, the British government is about to present a draft bill intended to clarify the state’s powers and increase transparency and oversight for intelligence agencies and the police.The aim is to modernize and streamline the government’s surveillance powers, while trying to retain public confidence that the government will also protect the privacy of law-abiding citizens.The draft legislation, known as the Investigatory Powers Bill and to be presented to Parliament on Wednesday, will inevitably be controversial, with critics already calling it the “snoopers’ charter.” It replaces a tougher draft that was killed in 2013 by the Liberal Democrats, then the coalition partner of the Conservatives.This time, the majority Conservative government is stepping more cautiously, seeking parliamentary and public debate and consultation before coming up with a final bill expected in the spring. And the government is already suggesting that it has heard critics and will include judicial oversight for surveillance warrants.AdvertisementGovernment officials and briefers are emphasizing the removal of fiercely contentious or unworkable elements, including a demand by the police to have routine access to citizens’ Internet browsing history, a ban on encryption and an effort to force foreign companies to provide data to the British authorities.AdvertisementThe bill is also expected to propose a two-tier oversight system for surveillance warrants — approval by the home or foreign secretary, as required now, plus agreement by a new oversight committee of judges with top-secret clearances.The legislation is meant to pull together some six other acts of law, some passed in the 1990s, that cover surveillance powers, and to unify at least three separate oversight commissioners into one board. It will also replace temporary emergency legislation governing data collection, retention and investigation, part of which was judged illegal.The bill is expected to require communications companies to keep customer data for at least 12 months and to allow the government, with a warrant, to look at which Internet domains people visit and when. To view the content of searches and emails, a further warrant would be required.The sharpest criticism of existing legislation came from David Anderson, a senior lawyer who is Britain’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. In a report commissioned by Parliament and released in June, he described current laws as “incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates.”“A multitude of alternative powers, some of them without statutory safeguards, confuse the picture further,” he added, concluding that “this state of affairs is undemocratic, unnecessary and — in the long run — intolerable.”One of Mr. Anderson’s central proposals, likely to be accepted, is to create an Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission to oversee the intelligence agencies, which would include serving or retired judges who would provide authorization for most surveillance warrants. At present, nearly all such warrants are authorized by a senior cabinet minister.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

A report by a panel of lawmakers responsible for oversight of intelligence issues, released in March and seen as supportive of the current system, nonetheless criticized British legislation as developing “piecemeal” and being “unnecessarily complicated.” The committee said it had “serious concerns about the resulting lack of transparency.”A third report, released in July, was commissioned in March 2014 by Nick Clegg, a Liberal Democrat who was then deputy prime minister, from a research group, the Royal United Services Institute, which specializes in defense and security issues.The report also criticized the system as lacking transparency and argued that public consent could not be taken for granted, while calling for a “radical overhaul” of the warrant process.The presentation of the draft on Wednesday is likely to be followed by criticism and debate, both from nongovernmental organizations concerned with civil liberties and from opposition parties in Parliament, which are already suggesting that they could not support a bill without judicial oversight of the warrant process.But opinion surveys have found that the British public retains a high level of confidence in the probity of the security services and in the permanent Civil Service — higher than is generally true in the United States or continental Europe.Cian Murphy, a legal expert at King’s College, London, said that while he did not expect that the draft bill would seek to expand powers, it might still prove controversial by giving explicit legal authorization for some activities seen by some as in a gray area, like the tapping of communications between Britons.On Monday, Joanna Cavan, head of the Interception of Communications Commissioner’s Office — one of the existing oversight bodies — said she supported a single, unified body with responsibilities for surveillance oversight, but she appealed for sufficient powers and resources.“This will present an opportunity to streamline the oversight landscape, to put all of the oversight responsibilities on a statutory footing, to bridge some of the identified gaps and overlaps,” she said.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
