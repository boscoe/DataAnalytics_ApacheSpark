And Muslim leaders in France have said that the police tactics are excessive and unfairly target Muslims.Some people have shared video and photographs on social media to document raids on their homes and in their neighborhoods.French officials have defended the state of emergency, saying it has been a necessary step to provide security and more resolutely protect citizens in France in the wake of the Paris attacks that killed 130 people last month.“The state of emergency, it’s true, justifies certain temporary restrictions on liberties,” Prime Minister Manuel Valls said last month. “But resorting to this, it’s to give us every chance to fully restore these liberties.”The state of emergency is scheduled to expire Feb. 26, though it may be extended.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
