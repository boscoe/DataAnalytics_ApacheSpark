LONDON —  Britain’s newly designed passport was meant to celebrate the country’s creativity and innovation over the last five centuries, and officials have called it the “latest step in an evolutionary process” for passport security.Activists and female politicians, however, say that the new travel document is a step backward because it features seven men but only two women.The current passport, which is decorated with drawings of many birds but no humans, will be replaced next month by the new document, which the Home Office unveiled on Tuesday.Called the “Creative United Kingdom” passport, it has been described as the most secure one that Britain has ever issued, with advanced technology using watermarks and ink that become visible only under infrared or ultraviolet light.AdvertisementStella Creasy, a Labour Party lawmaker whose successful campaign in 2013 to put Jane Austen on the 10 pound note was widely viewed as a victory for gender equality and female representation, could barely contain her disbelief.Advertisement“So tired of this shizzle — home office could only find 2 UK women 2 celebrate in 500 years of history #tellHERstory,” she wrote on Twitter.Emily Thornberry, another lawmaker and a former attorney general in the shadow cabinet of Ed Miliband, told the BBC that the new passport was “quite exasperating.”It is an “opportunity to celebrate the achievements of women,” she said. “We have had this fight about bank notes, and now it’s about passports. I just feel as though we are here all over again.”Elisabeth Scott, the architect of the Royal Shakespeare Theater in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, Shakespeare’s birthplace, is on one of the passport’s 34 pages. The other woman featured is Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician considered to be one of the first computer programmers. She is known for her work with Charles Babbage, a pioneer of computer science who is also honored in the new passport.The six others on the passport are Shakespeare; the painter John Constable; John Harrison, who invented the marine chronometer; the architect Giles Gilbert Scott; and the sculptors Antony Gormley and Anish Kapoor.James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, defended the new document, saying that images had been chosen “in homage to the successes in innovation, architecture, arts and performance.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
