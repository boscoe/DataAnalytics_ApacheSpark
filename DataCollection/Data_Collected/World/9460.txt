The spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic, said the bloc would “fully respect such a decision,” and underlined that Iceland remained an important partner. Iceland started its membership negotiations in 2010 looking to better anchor itself to Europe two years after its economy declined sharply amid a banking collapse. The biggest challenges to those talks were fishing rights and agriculture. The new government froze the E.U. accession application in 2013. Advertisement
