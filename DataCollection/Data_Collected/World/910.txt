An Argentine former transportation minister was convicted Tuesday on corruption charges after he acknowledged having accepted vacations and free rent from businessmen whose companies had government contracts. In a plea bargain Ricardo Jaime, transportation minister from 2003 to 2009, got a suspended sentence of one and a half years — merged with punishment for a separate crime — and was ordered to pay more than $200,000. Judge Julián Ercolini wrote in his sentencing that Mr. Jaime, 60, took vacations to Brazil in private jets provided by Claudio Cirigliano, whose rail company operated a major commuter line. The judge added that Mr. Jaime also lived in apartments whose rent was covered for years by a company that operated a major bus terminal. Mr. Jaime renewed the company’s contract while it was paying his rent, the local news media reported.A version of this brief appears in print on October 14, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Argentina: Former Official Found Guilty in Graft Case.
