CARACAS, Venezuela —  Venezuela’s departing Congress has promoted a judge who drew international criticism by giving a long prison term to the opposition leader Leopoldo López.Lawmakers from the governing United Socialist Party named Judge Susana Barreiros as head public defender days after the opposition won a congressional victory that represented the first major change to the balance of power in more than a decade.Opposition leaders took the Thursday appointment as an affront and said the appointment showed how little respect the governing party had for human rights and international opinion.The departing National Assembly president, Diosdado Cabello, responded gleefully, saying the more the “bourgeois” opposition attacked the judge, the more it solidified her revolutionary credentials.In September, Judge Barreiros gave Mr. López the maximum possible sentence of 14 years in prison for his role in leading antigovernment street protests that turned violent in 2014.The move was part of what promises to be a string of actions aimed at consolidating power before the socialists hand over the legislature to the opposition.A version of this article appears in print on December 12, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Venezuela Readies an Uneasy Transfer .
