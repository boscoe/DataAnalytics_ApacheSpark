Doctors in Belgium have rejected a request by an imprisoned murderer and rapist for medically assisted suicide, officials said Tuesday. The prisoner, Frank Van Den Bleeken, 51, who has served nearly 30 years of a life sentence, was to get a lethal injection on Sunday, after the ministry consented to his request in September, Justice Minister Koen Geens said last week. The doctors stopped the process, though a Justice Ministry statement said medical confidentiality prevented the doctors from disclosing why. The assisted death would have been the first involving a prisoner since Belgium legalized euthanasia 12 years ago.Weâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
