MEXICO CITY —  The death toll in the crash of a Mexican military helicopter shot down Friday by members of a drug gang climbed to six Monday after tests of remains at the scene determined that they were of three soldiers initially reported as missing.The helicopter, a Eurocopter EC725 Cougar, was participating in a sweep to weaken the gang, the Jalisco New Generation, which has emerged as a serious threat in southwestern Mexico.Members of the gang fired a rocket-propelled grenade, a testament to the firepower the group has attained, bringing down the helicopter in a rural area of Jalisco State, according to Monte Alejandro Rubido, the federal security commissioner.Mr. Rubido said Monday that the shooting down of a helicopter of that size by a drug gang was unprecedented in the country and that such a fatal attack on military aircraft was rare. It will lead the authorities to redouble their efforts to cripple the gang, he said.In total, the authorities said, 15 people died on Friday, including the soldiers, in a series of attacks by the gang and confrontations with the police that left dozens of buildings ablaze and roads blocked by flaming vehicles.A version of this article appears in print on May 5, 2015, on Page A7 of the New York edition with the headline: Toll Climbs to 6 in Copter Downing.
