MEXICO CITY —  A performance artist who was arrested Tuesday, along with several dissidents and journalists, after she sought to test change in Cuba and promote free speech by setting up an open mike in Havana’s Revolution Square was briefly detained again on Wednesday and told she could not leave the country for several weeks.The arrests, which disrupted the event, were the most sweeping roundup of dissidents in the two weeks since the United States and Cuba said they would normalize diplomatic relations and President Obama moved to loosen several trade and travel restrictions associated with the five-decade economic embargo.President Raúl Castro has said that Cuba’s political system, which limits freedom of expression, will not change, and the Cuban authorities made it clear that they would not tolerate what they called a “political provocation” by the artist, Tania Bruguera, and her supporters.
            Highlights from The Times’s coverage of the historic developments in relations between the United States and Cuba.        Ms. Bruguera, who splits her time between Cuba and New York, had planned to set up the microphone on Tuesday afternoon and allow Cubans to speak for a minute at a time, articulating their visions for the country’s future. Instead, she was detained at her mother’s home hours before the event and released Wednesday afternoon, along with several others.AdvertisementIn a statement on her sister’s Facebook page, Ms. Bruguera said she had been held on public disorder charges. She then announced a news conference and public gathering on the Malecón, Havana’s coastal highway, at the memorial to the Maine, the American battleship that sank in Havana Harbor in 1898.AdvertisementAgents stopped her en route to the gathering and took her away, her sister said. In a Facebook post on Wednesday evening, her sister, Deborah Bruguera, who lives in Italy, said Ms. Bruguera had been interrogated about her motives and her supporters and was told she could not leave Cuba “for two or three months” while the case was being processed.Cuba made no official statement on the detentions, but the authorities had declined to issue Ms. Bruguera a permit for the event.Dissidents said several dozen people had been arrested, with most let go Tuesday or Wednesday. Those detained included Reinaldo Escobar, editor of the independent news site 14ymedio.com and the husband of the opposition blogger Yoani Sánchez, who said she had been briefly put under house arrest.The State Department condemned the arrests several hours after they unfolded on Tuesday.“As part of the process of normalization of diplomatic relations, the United States will continue to press the Cuban government to uphold its international obligations and to respect the rights of Cubans to peacefully assemble and express their ideas and opinions,” its statement said.People opposed to the resumption of relations with Cuba were quick to hold up the arrests as a sign that the Castro government had no intention of pursuing political change and would reap only economic benefits from Mr. Obama’s moves.“Castro govt. arrests of activists in #Havana exposes the folly of new Obama #CubaPolicy,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a Cuban-American, wrote on Twitter.A version of this article appears in print on January 1, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Cuba Arrests Dissidents 2 Weeks After U.S. Accord.
