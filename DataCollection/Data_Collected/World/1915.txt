LONDON — Since their disastrous attack on the island of Dalen, in the Dvina, the Germans have continued their desperate attacks against Dvinsk, and, as officially reported, have been repulsed in this district with ‘‘cruel losses.’’ Eye-witnesses describe the fierce fighting which recently occurred on the island of Dalen. The Russians lured the enemy to the island and then promptly opened fire from the two opposite sides, inflicting terrible losses on the foe. At Riga, the public assembled on the bridge over the Dvina and watched thousands of German corpses floating down the stream. Other Riga resident followed the progress of the artillery battle from the high railway bridge near the station. One of the arms of the Dvina, called the Little Dvina, was clogged with German corpses. In the battle in this region, the enemy lost 7,000 prisoners. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 31, 1915
