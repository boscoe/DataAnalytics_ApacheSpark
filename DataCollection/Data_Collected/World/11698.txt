Gunmen killed a regional lawmaker there on Saturday, and an attack outside the Ministry of Higher Education building on Tuesday left at least 19 people dead. The group also staged an assault on a university in eastern Kenya this month, killing nearly 150 people.Nicholas Kay, the United Nations special representative to Somalia, condemned the attack via Twitter, saying that he was “shocked and appalled by loss of life.”Garowe is the capital of Puntland, a semiautonomous region in northeastern Somalia where attacks by the Shabab are not common.Advertisement
