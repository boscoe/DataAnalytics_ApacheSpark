René Bonvallet was quietly sipping his absinthe on the terrace of a café on the boulevard Bonne Nouvelle yesterday evening when his enjoyment of his apéritif was suddenly interrupted. There was a crash of breaking glass and the next instant a human being fell right upon M. Bonvallet. It appears that a young seamstress, Mlle. Marie Mesnin, who worked for a dressmaker on the first floor, had dropped a needle on to the glass marquise over the terrace of the café. Whilst attempting to pick up the fallen implement of her trade she had stepped upon a pane of glass, which gave way beneath her avoir-dupois. Happily for her, but not for him, M. Bonvallet was seated just beneath. Mlle. Mesnin was more frightened than hurt by her fall, while M. Bonvallet received some severe injuries about the head. — The New York Herald, European Edition, October 10, 1890
