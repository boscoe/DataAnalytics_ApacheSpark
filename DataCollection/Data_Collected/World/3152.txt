NEW ORLEANS — A frail teen-ager pulled out two pistols aboard a jetliner last night [Nov. 17] and nearly shot Christopher Kraft, Gemini space mission flight director, in the face. The youth was Thomas Robinson, 16, of Brownsville, Texas. He fired six shots aboard a National Airlines DC-8 jetliner before a passenger subdued him. No one was injured. Mr. Kraft, with a score of other top U.S. space officials traveling to Cape Kennedy for a flight readiness review for the next Gemini mission, was threatened by the frail-looking pistol-waving youth who said he was trying to hijack the plane and take it to Cuba. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 19, 1965
