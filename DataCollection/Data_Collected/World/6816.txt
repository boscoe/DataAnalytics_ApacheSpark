Antigovernment protests in the Democratic Republic of Congo have left at least a dozen people dead, officials said Thursday, as the Senate postponed a vote on a proposed law that the opposition fears will prolong the president’s time in power. The proposed law would require a census before the presidential election next year, but the vote was postponed until Friday. Critics say the logistical challenges of conducting a national census would delay the election. Parliament’s lower house passed the measure on Saturday, setting off protests in Kinshasa, the capital, and other cities. Since Monday, 12 people have died, a government spokesman, Lambert Mende, said Thursday, and more than 400 people have been arrested. But a coalition of human rights groups said the death toll was much higher.A version of this brief appears in print on January 23, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Congo: A Proposed Law Stirs Protests.
