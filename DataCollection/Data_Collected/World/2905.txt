Mr. Katanga, known as Simba during his time as a feared militia leader, was sentenced to 12 years in jail in 2014, but the time he spent in custody after being handed to the court in 2007 counted toward his sentence. Judges, who automatically review sentences once prisoners have served two-thirds of their time, said Mr. Katanga had demonstrated good behavior and regretted his crimes. Advertisement
