The operator of the ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant said Tuesday that it had neglected to stop a leak of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean since last May. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., said it had first detected the flow of contaminated rainwater nine months ago, but did not explain why it had been so slow in responding. The company, known as Tepco, said it would place sandbags to block the leak of water, which it said was too small to change radiation levels in the plant’s man-made harbor. A triple meltdown occurred at the plant after a huge earthquake and tsunami four years ago.A version of this brief appears in print on February 25, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Japan: Leak Is Disclosed at Nuclear Plant.
