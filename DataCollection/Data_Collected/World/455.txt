Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post’s imprisoned Iran correspondent, will have spent his 444th day in captivity as of Friday, the same length of time as the Americans held during the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis. The newspaper pointed out the comparison in a statement on Tuesday, calling Mr. Rezaian’s incarceration “a milestone significant in its injustice” and once again calling for his immediate release. Mr. Rezaian, an American of Iranian descent from Marin County, Calif., has been prosecuted on charges of espionage and other crimes in a closed trial, which ended nearly two months ago with no verdict yet announced. He has denied any wrongdoing. Mr. Rezaian is one of three Americans of Iranian descent imprisoned in Iran.  A version of this brief appears in print on October 7, 2015, on Page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Jailed Post Reporter Nears a Grim Milestone.
