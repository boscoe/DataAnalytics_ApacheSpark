Some news reports put the death toll as high as 30, implying that many of those listed as missing had died. That number could not immediately be confirmed.The separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk are rich in coal and are dotted with slag heaps and active mines, both legal and illegal.The Zasyadko mine has had deadly accidents before. A methane explosion in 2007 killed more than 100.Advertisement
