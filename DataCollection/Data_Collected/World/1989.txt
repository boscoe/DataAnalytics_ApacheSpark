It predicted the storm would make landfall in the early hours of Monday morning.Officials in Oman watched the approaching storm closely. In 2007, a similar storm, Cyclone Gonu, killed at least 50 people and caused as much as $5 billion in damage when it struck the country, knocking out power to the capital, Muscat, and briefly halting oil exports. This time it is another of Oman’s largest cities, Salalah, that lies in the path of the storm.In messages posted online in multiple languages on Friday, Oman’s state meteorological agency warned residents of its southern and central provinces of torrential rains, thunderstorms and flash floods that it predicted would begin on Saturday, as well as rough seas and waves over 20 feet high. It urged residents to avoid low-lying areas and to avoid crossing rivers during the storm. It also advised fishermen to avoid venturing into the sea.Yemen’s largest cities and most of its infrastructure are in the west of the country, which faces less danger from the storm than its largely isolated east.Advertisement
