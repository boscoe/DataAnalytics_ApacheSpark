A police spokesman said that at least 45 people were wounded when the rocket struck a house in the southern province during a firefight between government forces and Taliban insurgents nearby. Bashir Ahmad Shakir, a provincial council member, said the death toll could be up to 30 with as many as 60 wounded. Abdul Haleem, a cousin of the bride, said the rocket struck his house as guests waited outside for the bride to arrive. “Nine children of mine are missing; I just collected body parts,” he said. “I don’t know whether it’s my children or someone else.” This past year was the deadliest of the war for government forces and civilians, with around 5,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers killed, officials have said.
