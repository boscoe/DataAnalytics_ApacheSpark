ROME — Italian military activity in Greece, aimed at ousting British influence and making the nation a satellite of the Axis powers, is being supplemented both by German diplomatic pressure and by ‘‘fifth-column’’ work. If these combined forces succeed to the limit of the Axis hopes, King George II will soon lose this throne and the government of Premier Gen. John Metaxas will be replaced by one under Constantine Cotzias, now Governor of Athens. Well-informed Germans in Rome said tonight [Oct. 30] they expected the collapse of Greece within a few days. They are counting, in part, on the strength of Premier Benito Mussolini’s army, which will be shown when it comes to grip with the eight divisions of Greek troops reported to be concentrating in the north, and partly on the prospect of a Greek uprising against the Metaxas government. When the collapse comes, it is predicted, the King’s younger brother, Crown Prince Paul, the thirty-eight-year old heir, will be named sovereign. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 31, 1940
