Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post correspondent who has been incarcerated in Iran since July 2014, was permitted an extended visit with his wife and mother on Friday in what appeared to be a Christmas gesture by the Iranian authorities. Mr. Rezaian, 39, a California native, has been accused of espionage and other hostile acts, charges that he and his supporters say are unfounded. His mother, Mary Rezaian, and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, shared a home-cooked meal with him at Evin Prison in Tehran, according to an account Mrs. Rezaian relayed to her other son, Ali Rezaian, in the United States. “It was the longest meeting with him since she arrived last December,” Ali Rezaian said in an email. Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, said in a statement that he welcomed the gesture but said Iran should release Mr. Rezaian “and allow him a return to life as a free man who can spend time with his family where and whenever he pleases.”A version of this brief appears in print on December 26, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Iran: Relatives Visit a Jailed Reporter.
