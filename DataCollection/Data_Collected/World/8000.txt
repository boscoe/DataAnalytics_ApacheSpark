The mother of Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post’s Tehran correspondent, who has been incarcerated without publicly explained charges since July 22, said Friday that she feared new delays in his trial, and that the Iranian authorities had sharply curtailed prison visits from Mr. Rezaian’s Iranian wife. Mr. Rezaian was formally charged in January, even though the judiciary has not disclosed any details. His mother, Mary Rezaian, said that under Iranian law, Mr. Rezaian should be put on trial by early March, within 60 days after formal charges are set. But now, she said, “there are rumblings” that her son’s case will not be heard until after the Persian New Year holiday, which falls on March 21 and lasts for about two weeks, “so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6.” Mrs. Rezaian, an American who lives in Turkey, made the assertions in a written commentary posted on CNN’s website. American officials and The Post have repeatedly called on Iran to release Mr. Rezaian, 38, a dual Iranian-American citizen. A version of this brief appears in print on February 14, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Iran: Delays Feared in Reporter’s Trial.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
