LONDON — Faced with war on two fronts, the Italians continued today [Dec. 13] to get the worst of it on both, according to all the reports received at London from Egypt and Greece. In Egypt, the mechanical power of sea, land and air forces was combined against the foe. It was the British who made the combination. The Italian fleet, so far as London knows, remained in hiding somewhere else while the Royal Navy aided the army of the Nile and the Royal Air Force in shoving Marshal Rodolfo Graziani’s troops along the road of their retreat from the land of Egypt to the barren sands of Italian Libya.Though the first days of the North African desert offensive have given the impression that the Italians have been routed, neither military observers nor well informed civilians in London are yet throwing their hats very far into the air. It is understood here that Graziani blundered in garrisoning his front lines and outposts with his worst troops. His main army, it is believed, still remains somewhere in Libya, untouched save by bombing the R.A.F. has inflicted. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 14, 1940
