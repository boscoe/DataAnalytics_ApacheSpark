HAVANA —  Seeking to restore relations ruptured more than five decades ago, the United States and Cuba began talks here on Wednesday by agreeing to disagree on a central issue dividing them — the privilege of Cubans who arrive in the United States to automatically qualify for residency.As the State Department’s top diplomat for the Western Hemisphere, Roberta S. Jacobson, arrived on Wednesday, American and Cuban officials held another in a series of meetings on migration. On Thursday, a meeting will be held to begin addressing the reopening of embassies and the establishment of closer diplomatic ties.The migration meeting, normally held twice a year but imbued with heightened interest because of the thaw between the countries, was supposed to take place sometime in January, but recently was scheduled to coincide with the American delegation’s arrival.The American and Cuban diplomats commended one another for collaboration and communication among their law enforcement agencies involved in immigration, with the Cubans saying further talks would be held to stem immigration document fraud.
            Highlights from The Times’s coverage of the historic developments in relations between the United States and Cuba.        Both sides, however, held fast to their positions on aspects of American immigration policy that Cuba has long blamed for luring people into dangerous journeys by sea to reach Florida, 90 miles away. Under the “wet foot, dry foot” policy, Cubans who reach American soil can stay and qualify for residency after one year, while those caught at sea are returned to Cuba.AdvertisementThere has been a large increase in the number of Cubans trying to reach the United States by sea — the Coast Guard has reported intercepting some 3,722 in the past year, double the number of 2012 — and there have been concerns expressed here that the normalization of relations could bring an end to the policy.AdvertisementBut Alex Lee, the senior American diplomat at the migration talks, said the policy would continue. “The policy locally known as wet foot, dry foot very much remains in effect,” he told reporters after the meeting. He added that the migration increase had slowed in January.Josefina Vidal, the Cuban foreign ministry representative for American affairs, reiterated her government’s view that the policy was “the main incentive” for people to embark on the perilous journeys, and she said that some migrants intercepted at sea were allowed to enter the United States after all.The president discussed the move to normalize relations with Cuba during his State of the Union address.She also complained of an American program in place since 2006 that has granted thousands of Cuban medical professionals serving countries around the world the right to enter the United States immediately. “This is reprehensible," she said, calling it “a brain-drain practice that deprives many countries of a vital resource.”On Thursday, Cuban and American officials will discuss how to proceed on re-establishing diplomatic ties, after President Obama and President Raul Castro agreed to do so Dec. 17.In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Obama hailed the move toward diplomatic relations and called on Congress to end the trade embargo.Cuban officials agreed, but they have been more circumspect about their expectations for the talks and focused on more practical matters, like the desire to resume banking ties that would make it easier for Americans to use credit cards here and getting off the State Department’s list of terrorist states, which the Obama administration has said it is reviewing.“Cuba is not normalizing relations with the United States but rather re-establishing diplomatic relations with the United States,” a senior foreign ministry official told reporters, in remarks carried in state news media. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because such statements are supposed to come from higher-ranking officials, added, “Normalization is a longer and more complex process.”A version of this article appears in print on January 22, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. and Cuba Set to Discuss Diplomatic Ties.
