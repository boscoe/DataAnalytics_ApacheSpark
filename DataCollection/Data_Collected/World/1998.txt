Cyclone Chapala, a storm gathering in the Arabian Sea, is heading for Yemen and Oman and may cause floods, landslides and infrastructure damage in countries that are ill-prepared for such weather, the United Nations climate agency said on Friday. The tropical cyclone has strengthened very quickly in the past day and is expected to become a supercyclonic storm in the next 24 hours, with sustained winds of up to 143 miles per hour, equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. It is expected to make landfall on Monday night. A spokeswoman for the agency, the World Meteorological Organization, said it was not aware of a tropical cyclone’s ever hitting Yemen before.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
