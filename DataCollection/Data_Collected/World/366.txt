An Algerian news channel reported that Al Qaeda had announced the death of the Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar, one of the most wanted extremists in North Africa. A Qaeda spokesman, Hassan Abderraouf, made the announcement in a recorded audio message released over the weekend, the Ennahar TV channel reported. Qaeda groups had earlier denied that Mr. Belmokhtar — responsible for an attack on an Algerian gas plant in 2013 that killed 38 foreign hostages — had died in an American airstrike in Libya in June. Mr. Belmokhtar’s death has been reported several times over the years. In 2013, the government of Chad announced he had been killed in an antiterrorism operation in Mali.A version of this brief appears in print on October 6, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Algeria: Al Qaeda Announces Jihadist’s Death.
