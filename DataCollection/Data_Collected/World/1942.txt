The lower house of Parliament voted Thursday to allow President Paul Kagame of Rwanda to extend his tenure beyond a second term that ends in 2017 and possibly to stay on until 2034, a move opposed by the United States and other aid donors. Draft amendments to the Constitution approved by the lower house still have to be approved by the upper house and be put to a referendum, but are not expected to stumble at either stage. After two days of debate, lawmakers agreed to reduce presidential terms to five years from seven, with a limit of two terms, but to make an exception for Mr. Kagame. Mr. Kagame, who is credited with rebuilding Rwanda after the 1994 genocide, has not said that he wants to run again but has said he is open to persuasion.A version of this brief appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Rwanda: Effort Advances to Extend Tenure of Kagame as President.
