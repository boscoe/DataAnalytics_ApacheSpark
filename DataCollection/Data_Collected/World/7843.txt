BUENOS AIRES — The judge overseeing an investigation into the mysterious death of a federal prosecutor here last month has asked forensic experts to identify DNA traces found at his home, it was revealed on Tuesday.The prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was found dead of a gunshot wound last month at his apartment, hours before he was expected to talk to lawmakers about his accusations that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had conspired to derail his investigation into the fatal bombing of a Jewish community center here in 1994.In the case, which has convulsed Argentina, it is unclear whether Mr. Nisman committed suicide or was killed. Judge Fabiana Palmaghini said the DNA did not belong to Mr. Nisman. The traces were found on a coffee cup in the kitchen sink, according to local news reports.Diego Lagomarsino, an aide to Mr. Nisman, says he made himself coffee when he visited the prosecutor the day before he was found dead to take him a .22-caliber Bersa pistol. Mr. Lagomarsino, who is charged with lending Mr. Nisman the pistol, which fired the bullet that killed him, says Mr. Nisman had sought a weapon for protection. Until now, only Mr. Nisman’s DNA traces had been found on items taken from his apartment for laboratory tests.Local news media reported that tests found no gunpowder residue on Mr. Nisman’s hands, corroborating previous results. But ballistics experts say the Bersa pistol might not have left residue.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
