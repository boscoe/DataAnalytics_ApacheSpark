JERUSALEM — A Palestinian resident of East Jerusalem rammed a car into a crowd of Israelis at a Jerusalem bus stop on Monday, according to the Israeli police, injuring about a dozen of them, including an 18-month-old baby.A civilian, a private security guard and a member of Israel’s security forces all shot at the driver before he exited the vehicle, killing him, a police spokeswoman said.The chief of the Jerusalem district police said through the spokeswoman that this “quick and accurate action” had “prevented a larger attack.”The spokeswoman identified the driver as Abed el-Muhsen Hassuna, a 21-year-old from the Beit Hanina neighborhood, and said an ax was found in his car, a white Mazda sedan.The incident — part of a 10-week stretch of near-daily stabbing, shooting and vehicular attacks by Palestinians against Israeli Jews — occurred near the Bridge of Strings, designed by Santiago Calatrava, at the entrance to Jerusalem.A version of this article appears in print on December 15, 2015, on Page A14 of the New York edition with the headline: World Briefing | Middle East; Israel: Palestinian Assaults Crowd.
