Around a dozen opposition protesters were arrested in Moscow on Thursday evening after scuffles broke out between supporters of President Vladimir V. Putin and Aleksei A. Navalny, Russia’s most prominent opposition politician. Thirteen anti-Putin protesters were detained at the rally under the walls of the Kremlin, according to OVD INFO, an opposition website that tallies protesters carted off in police vans. Most were released without charges late Thursday evening. Small scuffles broke out in the combined crowd of 500 between Mr. Navalny’s supporters and the so-called anti-Maidan, supporters of Mr. Putin’s hard-line policies in Ukraine.A version of this brief appears in print on January 16, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Russia: Opposition Protesters Are Arrested After Clash.
