The press office for military operations in eastern Ukraine said army outposts had been hit 50 times by small-arms fire, mortar shells and rockets over the past day. Separatists accused the Ukrainian Army of carrying out dozens of rocket attacks on Thursday and Friday. The intensification in hostilities comes one month after a renewed truce led to a marked lull in the fighting that originally broke out in the spring. Leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France are expected to meet Thursday in Kazakhstan to consider solutions to the conflict. Advertisement
