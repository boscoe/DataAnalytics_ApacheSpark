They are being held at a police station in London.The security services estimate that 600 Britons have gone to Syria or Iraq to join militant groups, including the man known as “Jihadi John,” who has appeared in several gruesome Islamic State videos. Hundreds of other Europeans are also believed to have joined jihadist groups.The steady trickle of young people from Europe to the Middle East battlefields has raised concerns about the possibility that some may return home, better trained and more radicalized, and ready to commit terror attacks in Europe.In the latest case, the British police said they learned on Friday that two 17-year-olds from northwest London had disappeared and were believed to be traveling to Syria.In the course of the search for the two, the police discovered that a third youth had joined them.“Inquiries revealed that they had traveled with a third male, aged 19,” said the Metropolitan Police statement. “Officers alerted the Turkish authorities who were able to intercept all three males, preventing travel to Syria.”The three suspects have not been named by the British police.The detention of the three men suggests that cooperation between the British and Turkish police has improved since international recriminations last month over another, highly publicized, case.Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.That involved three girls from London — Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 — who traveled from London to Turkey, apparently in an effort to reach Syria.CCTV footage subsequently emerged showing the three girls in Turkey waiting to board a bus for the Syrian border.Turkish officials complained that they had not been given enough warning about the disappearance of the three London schoolgirls — a claim that was disputed by the British.More generally, Turkey has been criticized for not policing its southeastern borders strictly enough, and for not preventing people from using Turkish territory to enter Syria.Turkish politicians tend to place the blame on European countries for failing to prevent their young citizens from traveling to join jihadi groups in the first place.Advertisement
