The search continued late into the night in a bid to find more survivors.“It’s a big wreck; we don’t often see this,” a Coast Guard official on Lesbos said by telephone, noting that most boats dispatched by smugglers from Turkey to Greece carry “40 or 80 people.”“We’ve seen boats with 160 or 170 but that’s rare,” he added. Inflatable dinghies have been the smugglers’ preferred vessel up to now. The official refused to speculate on whether the type of vessel used this time and the number of passengers aboard marked a new tactic by the smugglers.The wooden vessel flipped over in near gale-force winds about 4 in the afternoon, the official said. A Coast Guard boat sent out an alert and was joined by a helicopter, another Greek vessel and a boat belonging to Frontex, the European Union’s border-monitoring agency.“It was bad weather; thankfully we had boats nearby and the response was quick,” said the official who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.The three people confirmed dead were a man and two boys, a 4-year-old and a 1-year-old. No details were available about their country of origin.In total, eight migrants died on Wednesday in attempts to cross the Aegean from Turkey, according to the Greek Shipping Ministry, which cited four separate wrecks: two off Lesbos and two off Samos, another Greek island. Of the eight dead, six were children.The dramatic day at sea added to a grim catalog of deaths in the Aegean, a crossing point for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing strife or otherwise seeking a better life. The worsening weather did not appear to have deterred the migrants, or those who arranged their passage in vessels that are often dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy.The spread of the conflict in Syria and growing fears that more Balkan countries will close their borders to migrants seeking to travel to Northern and Western Europe appear to have spurred the latest wave of migration. On Wednesday, the Austrian interior minister, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said the country was planning to erect a fence along its border with Slovenia, something Chancellor Werner Faymann later denied.This summer, as the Majid family left Syria for Europe, The New York Times followed the group through weeks of defeat and triumph, disillusionment and determination.Although there are no exact figures for drownings in the Aegean, the Greek Coast Guard issues daily reports on migrants who have been found dead or reported missing. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 3,000 people have died or are missing after crossing into Europe this year.With more than half a million people arriving in Greece so far this year, the authorities acknowledge being overwhelmed and have appealed for European Union support.At Sunday’s summit meeting in Brussels on the refugee problem, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to host 50,000 refugees by the end of the year, in collaboration with the United Nations refugee agency. According to the agreement, another 50,000 migrants are to be hosted in other European Union and Balkan countries.In cash-strapped Greece, which is still struggling to revive its economy, the authorities are scrambling to find facilities to accommodate thousands of migrants. Sports venues used for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens are among the options being considered.Migration Minister Yiannis Mouzalas has emphasized in recent days that Greece will not become “a large concentration camp for refugees,” noting that the Greek authorities had rejected calls by European officials for the creation of a large camp in the Greek capital.Get news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter.
