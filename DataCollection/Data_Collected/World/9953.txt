After the police searched the home, they discovered four other corpses of babies in a large freezer, he said.Mr. Crépin said the man had been detained and was being questioned by the police, while his wife, age 35, had been taken to the hospital to undergo psychological and gynecological examinations. The couple have two daughters ages 13 and 15.The police said they were still investigating the mysterious deaths and were considering several possibilities, including whether infanticide had been committed, whether the babies had been stillborn, or whether the mother had been suffering from a condition in which women deny they are pregnant.Agence France-Presse reported that the initial findings of the investigation appeared to suggest that the mother, who worked at a garden nursery, had given birth to a baby alone in the couple’s house. It said the woman had been seen by neighbors in their sleepy village as recently as three weeks ago and did not appear pregnant. News reports said the man had told the police that he had not known his wife was pregnant.It is not the first time that France has been shaken by the discovery of dead babies.In 2010, the bodies of eight newborn babies were found buried in the garden of a home in Villers-au-Tertre, in the north of France. Their mother, Dominique Cottrez, told the authorities that she had killed them because she believed they were the product of incest.That followed a case in 2006 when Jean-Louis Courjault, a French engineer who was living in Seoul, South Korea, discovered the corpses of two newborn babies in his freezer. His wife, Véronique Courjault, was sentenced in June 2009 to eight years in prison for killing three of her babies, and was freed in May 2010.The police said that autopsies would be carried out on the Louchats bodies on Friday.Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.Advertisement
