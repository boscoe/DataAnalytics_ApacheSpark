Israel and its supporters fear similar economic measures could hurt the country or its business partners down the road.“Of the over 200 unresolved territorial disputes around the world, Europe decided that only these Jewish-made products deserved to be labeled,” Mr. Dermer wrote.The United States has opposed the disinvestment campaign. An amendment to a trade bill signed in June instructs American negotiators to pressure other countries not to support it. But after the bill was signed, the State Department took issue with t he  provision, saying that “by conflating Israel and Israeli-controlled territories,” it ran counter to longstanding United States policy.“The U.S. government has never defended or supported Israeli settlements and activity associated with them and, by extension, does not pursue policies or activities that would legitimize them,” Ned Price, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said in an email.The White House would not say whether President Obama had received any gifts from Mr. Dermer. As to who did receive the gift packages, a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy wrote in an email: “We are not divulging any information about the recipients.”Advertisement
