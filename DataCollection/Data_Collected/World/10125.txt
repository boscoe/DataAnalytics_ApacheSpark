NEW DELHI — Seven friends drowned in the western Indian state of Maharashtra after taking an abandoned boat to the middle of a natural reservoir, the police said Monday. A group of men ages 18 to 23 were celebrating a birthday on Sunday evening with a picnic in a remote village in the Nagpur district when eight of them decided to climb into the boat, using a stick to row to the middle of the 10-foot-deep reservoir, said the district police chief, Arti Singh. As they were taking selfies, the boat started leaking and eventually capsized. One of the men was saved by friends who remained on shore. The bodies of the seven others were dragged from the reservoir on Monday morning by the district police.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
