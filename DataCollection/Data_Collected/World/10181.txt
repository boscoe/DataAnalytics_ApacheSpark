Egypt’s Medical Forensics Authority on Tuesday dismissed its spokesman after he said last week that a poet and activist killed by police birdshot had died from her wounds only because she was too thin. State news media reported Tuesday that the Justice Ministry was opening an investigation to determine whether or not it was true that more body fat might have obstructed the pellets that pierced her heart and lungs, the injuries that coroners said had caused her death. The poet and activist, Shaimaa el-Sabbagh, 31, was taking part in a march to lay flowers in Tahrir Square on Jan. 24 when the police fired birdshot and tear gas from a few yards away. Prosecutors charged a police officer with a form of manslaughter in the shooting but have not named the officer. The spokesman for the medical examiner, Hisham Abdel Hamid, said in a television interview on Saturday that other marchers that day survived similar blasts of birdshot but that Ms. Sabbagh died because she was “too skinny.”A version of this brief appears in print on March 25, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Middle East; Egypt: Forensics Official Dismissed.
