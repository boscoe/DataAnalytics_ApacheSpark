A Chicago-area woman imprisoned in Bali on accusations of killing her mother has given birth to a baby girl, her lawyer said Tuesday. The woman, Heather Mack, 19, gave birth Tuesday in an Indonesian hospital, said Anthony Scifo, her civil lawyer. Ms. Mack and her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, could face the death penalty if found guilty of murdering her mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, whose body was found stuffed into a bloody suitcase outside a Bali resort last August. Ms. Mack has sued in Cook County, Ill., to get access to her trust fund to pay for her defense. A judge has granted her $119,000 so far from the trust fund.A version of this brief appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: Asia; Indonesia: Chicago Woman Held in Mother’s Killing Has a Baby.
