At least 42 deaths have been confirmed in Bangui since sectarian clashes erupted on Saturday, but Antoine Mbao-Bogo, the head of the national Red Cross, said that tally was far from complete as its workers had not been able to reach some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the United Nations reported that two of its peacekeepers had been severely wounded as they worked to take down roadblocks that militants had erected. Advertisement
