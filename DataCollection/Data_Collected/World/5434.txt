ROME — Virginio Gayda, often a spokesman of Italy’s foreign policy, warned interventionists in the United States today [Dec. 28] that American violations of neutrality, no matter how disguised, might mean entry into the war. In an editorial, he asserted that very few American politicians wanted open intervention in the war on the side of Great Britain, but that numbers of ‘‘important people’’ in the United States were trying to hide real intervention behind misleading formalities. These people, Gayda said, ‘‘seek to intensify American help to England in such a form and in such dimensions as to constitute a real, even though undeclared, intervention in the war.’’ — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 29, 1940
