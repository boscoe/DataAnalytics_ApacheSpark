Dozens of Iraqi villages that were under the control of the militant group the Islamic State suffered from looting and extensive property destruction after being retaken by pro-government forces, according to a study released Wednesday by Human Rights Watch. The study examined evidence from more than two dozen villages near Amerli, a town about 100 miles from Baghdad. Iraqi security forces have been fighting the militant group on many fronts since last fall, backed by militias and volunteer fighters. While these forces have made some gains, there have also been reports of sectarian violence where Shiite militias have helped retake Sunni majority towns from the Islamic State.
