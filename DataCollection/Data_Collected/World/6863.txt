Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius of France said that the aid worker, Claudia Priest, 67, had been released, and he thanked the Central African Republic authorities and especially the archbishop of the countryâ€™s capital for their help. Ms. Priest, who was working for a Catholic medical organization, was kidnapped along with her local co-worker when gunmen seized their vehicle full of medicine and medical kits, according to their driver. Christian militia fighters are believed to have kidnapped the two after the arrest of their commander, Rodrigue Ngaibona. The Central African Republic was hit by a wave of sectarian violence about a year ago when Christian militias were formed to combat a Muslim rebel coalition that had taken control of the country.
