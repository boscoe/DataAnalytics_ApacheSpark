There is no truth in it,” he added. “They are trying to prove that there are differences among Taliban that are getting so grave that they now fight against each other.”It was not immediately possible to confirm the message’s authenticity, although the Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, had hours earlier said the statement would be released soon. The statement itself referred to an episode that took place Friday in which civilians were killed by the Afghan National Army in an accidental attack.Two Taliban officials who knew Mullah Mansour, speaking on condition of anonymity to protect themselves from capture, confirmed that the audio was his voice and they believed it to be genuine.In recent days there were reports from some Taliban quarters as well as from the Afghan government that Mullah Mansour had been either killed or wounded in the shootout, which was said to have erupted after a dispute between the mainstream Taliban leader and dissidents.The dissidents were said to be upset by the killing of a breakaway leader, Mullah Mansour Dadullah, and hundreds of his followers, in fighting with the mainstream Taliban. Mullah Dadullah had reportedly aligned with the Islamic State.“Do trust me if I say that I have never been to Kuchlak for years,” the man in the recording said. “I am among my friends, fine, sound and well.” There was no proof, however, that the Taliban leader had not been wounded, as some accounts had insisted. Kuchlak is a suburb of Quetta.While the man purported to be Mullah Mansour in the recording said that “we would never fight for leadership positions,” the new Taliban leader has faced significant opposition from within the Taliban’s ranks, in addition to the Mullah Dadullah faction, since he emerged as the Taliban’s leader this summer.The Taliban were sensitive to claims that their new leader was dead, because Mullah Mansour himself took power after the organization falsely maintained for two years that its founder, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was still alive. That led to criticism within the organization because Mullah Mansour had apparently lied for many years, even to senior Taliban followers, about their leader.Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, Afghanistan.Advertisement
