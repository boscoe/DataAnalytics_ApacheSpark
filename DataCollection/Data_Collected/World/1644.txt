ROME — The Italian air force is taking an active part in the bombing of England, the people of this country learned today [Oct. 25]. The news arrived also of a renewed offensive in Egypt by the forces of Marshal Rodolfo Graziani, which were said to have reached a point thirty-eight miles east of Sidi Barrani, on the road to Cairo. The first news here of the part which Italy’s airmen are playing in the bombardment of Great Britain came in a military communique from Berlin, published in ‘‘Il Giornale d’Italia’’ this afternoon. ‘‘For the first time,’’ the communique said, ‘‘Italian forces have taken off from their base in occupied France and have shared in action taken against England by German aviation.’’— New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 26, 1940
