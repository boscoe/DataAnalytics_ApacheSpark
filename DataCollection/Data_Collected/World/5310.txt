LONDON — To their unbounded surprise, Londoners to-day [Dec. 25] experienced what is called an old-fashioned Christmas, at least as far as external temperature is concerned, and there is no reason to suppose that fewer tons of beef, turkeys and assorted fluids were consumed within doors than usual. Indeed, the many highly hilarious groups who patrolled town late in the day, singing hardly anything but “Annie Rooney,” argued an abundant harvest for Her Majesty’s excise. A thin hard layer of ice covered the streets this evening, causing the occupants of hansoms to eye the horse’s back suspiciously. Many of them got there after all. Many men are out of work at Liverpool, and they were not forgotten. Three thousand five hundred ‘‘hot-pots’’ were distributed, which means smoking meals for 20,000 people. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 26, 1890
