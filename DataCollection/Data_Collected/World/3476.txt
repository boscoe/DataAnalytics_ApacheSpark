Many other people were missing.The landslide occurred in the Kachin State area of Hpakant, said Brang Seng, a jade businessman, who watched as bodies were pulled from the debris and taken to a hospital morgue.“People were crying,” he said. “I’m hearing that more than 100 people died. In some cases, entire families were lost.”Lamai Gum Ja, a community leader, said that homes at the base of the mine dump had been flattened.He estimated that 100 to 200 people were still missing. Search and rescue teams wearing bright orange uniforms dug through the rubble for survivors on Sunday.Kachin, which is about 600 miles north of Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city, has some of the highest-quality jade in the world.The industry generated an estimated $31 billion last year, with most of the wealth going to individuals and companies tied to Myanmar’s former military rulers, according to Global Witness, an advocacy group focused on natural resources.Hpakant, the center of the jade industry, remains very poor, with bumpy dirt roads, constant electricity blackouts and high rates of heroin addiction.After Myanmar’s former military rulers handed over power to a nominally civilian government five years ago, resulting in the lifting of many Western sanctions, the already rapid pace of mining turned frenetic. Few scraps of ground or parts of daily life in Hpakant have been untouched by the fleets of giant yellow trucks and backhoes that have sliced apart mountains. In the past year, dozens of small-scale miners have been maimed or killed while picking through tailing dumps.“Large companies, many of them owned by families of former generals, army companies, cronies and drug lords, are making tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year through their plunder of Hpakant,” said Mike Davis, the Asia director at Global Witness. “Their legacy to local people is a dystopian wasteland in which scores of people at a time are buried alive in landslides,” Mr. Davis said.Advertisement
