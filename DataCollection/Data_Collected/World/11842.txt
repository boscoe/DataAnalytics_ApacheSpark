A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Nepal on May 12, less than three weeks after a devastating temblor there killed more than 8,000 people. People across the country had feared another powerful earthquake, in part because the first one left many buildings cracked and unstable. The new quake caused strong shaking across an area about one-twelfth the size that experienced strong shaking in the April 25 quake.

The Nepal earthquake caused an ice cliff to shear off, creating an avalanche that sent many tons of ice crashing more than 2,000 vertical feet down the face and toward Base Camp.

Much of the damage at Base Camp resulted from the air blast that was created in front of the avalanche. The blast was dense with suspended particles of snow and ice, and it blew tents and climbers across the glacier. The debris and blast caused more than a dozen deaths and many injuries.

The densely populated capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, suffered extensive damage from the earthquake. An analysis using satellite imagery captured before and after the earthquake found that about 180 structures in the city’s center were destroyed. The damage was most concentrated around Durbar Square, where many historical and cultural sites are located.

The earthquake touched off avalanches on Mount Everest, causing injuries and deaths at Base Camp. The avalanches also destroyed a portion of the route, trapping climbers who were at higher altitudes. An unprecedented helicopter rescue effort on Monday brought about 150 of the trapped climbers back to Base Camp.

A break in the weather on Monday allowed helicopters to reach Camp 1 for the rescue of more than 140 trapped climbers. The high altitude meant that only small helicopters could access the camp, rescuing the climbers two at a time. It was by far the largest rescue mission on Everest.Khumbu IcefallNormally a two-hour descent from Camp 1 to Base Camp, the Icefall route was partially destroyed by the avalanches, trapping climbers at the camps above it. Aftershocks and unsteady terrain have prevented the route from being repaired.Base CampAt least 18 were killed and more than 60 were injured after an avalanche sent snow, ice and boulders ripping through the camp. Helicopters transported some of the injured to Kathmandu.
The quake — Nepal’s worst in 80 years — leveled villages close to the epicenter, caused landslides and avalanches, crippled transportation networks and collapsed buildings across central Nepal.
