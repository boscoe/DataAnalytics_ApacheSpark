Felisa Miceli, the economy minister from 2005 to 2007, had been convicted of corruption-related charges, but last year that sentence was ordered to be reviewed. Ms. Miceli had been unable to prove that she legally obtained the money — cash in dollars and pesos worth more than $64,000 when it was turned up in 2007. Ms. Miceli said Monday in court in Buenos Aires, “It would be a terrible injustice if I went to prison,” adding, “I regret taking the money.” The judges also prohibited Ms. Miceli from holding public office for six years and ordered her to repay 100,000 pesos, or almost $11,400.
