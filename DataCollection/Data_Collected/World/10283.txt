Can the West trust Iran? Can Iran trust the West? A look at the bet each side is making in the nuclear talks, along with the challenges and risks that they face.Before dawn on a freezing February morning, Amar Bakshi watched as a crane lifted a gold-colored shipping container off a flatbed truck outside the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Conn. As diplomats consider a deal over Iran’s nuclear program, the shipping container is Mr. Bakshi’s attempt at restoring a relationship with that country.Mr. Bakshi, a Yale graduate student and artistic entrepreneur, enlisted a team based in the United States and Iran to transform the shipping container into a communications portal. Equipped with videoconference applications, the portal allows people in the two countries to have conversations with one another.“This is a project about traversing various forms of distance,” said Mr. Bakshi, 30, who is planning to run similar portals connecting the United States with Afghanistan and with Cuba in the coming months.In this New York Times video, Mr. Bakshi and his team face challenges as they try to build friendships between Iranians and Americans, offering a reminder of how difficult a permanent agreement with Iran may be to achieve.Advertisement“There’s this incredibly young, dynamic, educated population in Iran that is essentially pretty pro-American,” said David E. Sanger, the chief Washington correspondent for The Times “And the big question is: Can this young population win this one?”The talks have particular urgency as President Obama nears the end of his second term and negotiators reach what they say are the limits of compromise. Any agreement would be subject to internal politics in both Iran and the United States.Advertisement“There’s a sense now that time is really running out,” Mr. Sanger said. “If you can’t reach an agreement now, you won’t be able to.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
