Jesús Torrealba, a spokesman for the opposition coalition, said, “The government makes up these stories about coups to avoid talking about how the country is breaking down.” President Nicolás Maduro announced Thursday that a retired air force general had been arrested and that 13 other people had been implicated in the plot. The government frequently claims to have uncovered coup plots, often without providing much evidence. Diosdado Cabello, president of the National Assembly, said in a television broadcast that the United States had tried to buy the loyalty of air force officers. The State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, called the accusation “ludicrous.” Advertisement
