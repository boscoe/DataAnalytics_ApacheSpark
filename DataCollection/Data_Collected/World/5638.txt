The Ebola virus is still spreading in West Africa, especially in Sierra Leone, and the worldwide toll from the outbreak stood at 7,905 deaths among 20,206 known cases at year’s end, the World Health Organization said Wednesday. Sierra Leone reported 337 new cases in the past week, including 149 in Freetown, the highest incidence in the capital of the former British colony in four weeks, the W.H.O. said in its latest weekly update. However, the number of cases in Sierra Leone over a three-week period has fallen below 1,000 for the first time since Sept. 28, suggesting the spread of the disease is slowing. In neighboring Guinea, the three-week total rose for a second week to 346, suggesting the epidemic is growing there.A version of this brief appears in print on January 1, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Ebola Still Spreading, W.H.O.
