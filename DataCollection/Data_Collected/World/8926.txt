The defendant, Minh Quang Pham, 32, had been living in Britain. He went to Yemen in 2010; swore an oath of allegiance to the group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; and provided it with “expert advice and assistance in photography and graphic design of media,” an indictment charges. In Yemen, he worked with an American citizen who helped produce Inspire, an English-language online magazine published by the group, the authorities said. The indictment does not name the American, but he appears to have been Samir Khan, who was later killed in a drone strike. Mr. Pham’s lawyer did not respond immediately to messages seeking comment.
