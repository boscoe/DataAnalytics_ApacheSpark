Instead, they said, it has often been used by spouses to force a divorce or by those outside the marriage to blackmail married women who have cheated on their husbands. (The stigma of adultery is greater for women, making it harder to blackmail men who have committed adultery.)An estimated 53,000 South Koreans have been indicted under the law since the authorities began keeping count in 1985. But in recent years, it has been increasingly rare for defendants to go to prison, in part because courts have demanded stronger proof that sexual intercourse occurred. In many cases, police officers, tipped off by a spouse, have raided motel rooms.Additionally, more plaintiffs have been dropping charges after reaching financial settlements with their spouses.The adultery law was adopted in 1953, with the stated purpose of protecting women who had little recourse against cheating husbands in a male-dominated society. But divorce rates and women’s economic and legal standing have soared in the decades since, leaving many to argue that the law outlived its usefulness.Others, however, considered the ability to open an adultery case a necessary option for wronged wives in a society that, despite its rapid change, is still largely male-centered.Under the law, cases could be brought against people only by their spouses, and if a spouse chose to drop the complaint, the prosecutors could not continue.The law had been challenged four times before at the Constitutional Court since 1990, always unsuccessfully. In the last attempt, in 2008 — in a case brought by a popular actress, Ok So-ri, whose husband had pressed a criminal complaint against her — the justices came within one vote of striking the law down.On Thursday, two other justices voted to declare the law unconstitutional for other reasons; one suggested that adultery should be punished, but not with a prison term. A two-thirds majority was required to strike down the law.The remaining two justices voted to uphold the law, warning that abolishing it could lead to “disorder in sexual morality,” encourage extramarital affairs and undermine family life.Three major women’s groups in South Korea supported the court’s decision to abolish what they called “an ineffectual law.” But its abolishment “doesn’t remove moral and ethical responsibility,” they said in a joint statement.Anh Il-hwan, an official with the Ministry of Gender Equality, said on Thursday that the ministry respected the court’s ruling. “However, we need to prepare measures to protect the women victimized by adultery and will deliberate with relevant bodies to do so,” he said.Sungkyunkwan, an organization of Korean Confucianists that had championed the law, called the ruling “deplorable” and said that people should be ashamed of adultery.Share prices for a leading condom manufacturer, Unidus, rose by nearly 15 percent on Thursday, and shares of Hyundai Pharmaceutical, which markets so-called morning-after birth control pills, rose by 9.7 percent, gains that stock market analysts linked to the ruling. According to South Korean news media, analysts linked the rise of those share prices to the ruling because they began climbing as soon as the news was reported. Analysts said investors acted on the belief that the ruling might encourage extramarital affairs and use of condoms.Su-Hyun Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement
