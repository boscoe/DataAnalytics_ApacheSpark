German authorities said Thursday that they had foiled what they believed might have been an imminent attack on a professional cycling race planned for Friday. The authorities seized a cache of weapons, including a pipe bomb, and chemicals that can be used to make explosives when they raided a home outside Frankfurt. They detained a 35-year-old Turkish-German man and his 34-year-old Turkish wife in Oberursel. The couple, whose names were not released in line with Germany privacy rules, had been under surveillance. Officials were worried that the couple might have been planning an attack during the one-day Eschborn-to-Frankfurt race on Friday. The police said the race would be canceled in case the couple had accomplices or they had placed as-yet undetected explosive devices along the route. “According to our current information, we have prevented an attack,” said Stefan Mueller, the chief of police for Hesse State. Mr. Mueller declined to say whether officials believed that known extremist groups were involved.A version of this brief appears in print on May 1, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Germany: Officials Say They Foiled Plot for Attack on Professional Cycling Race.
