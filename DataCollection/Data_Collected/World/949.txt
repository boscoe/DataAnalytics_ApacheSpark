BUCHAREST — With the Russian border a military zone, forbidden to foreign correspondents, speculation in Rumania centers to-day [Oct. 15] on the possibility of a shift in Soviet-German relations. While few facts and many rumors come from the frontier zone, the extent of German Rumanian military preparations on this side of the Soviet border has suggested to many persons here the possibility that Great Britain and Germany might make a peace which would leave Adolf Hitler a free hand in the East. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 16, 1940
