MUNICH — “We can’t welcome everybody,” a Bavarian-based newspaper wrote recently. Crowding thousands of people from different cultures into tents and hoping that they follow German customs was simply irresponsible. There were 1,000 criminal acts, 2,000 police interventions and 3,000 injuries over a two-week period alone. All this self-congratulatory talk of hospitality had to stop.“Ban the Oktoberfest!” demanded the paper, The Süddeutsche Zeitung.Of course, the image for most readers right up until the punch line was likely not one of drunken Americans and Australians spoiling for a fight during Bavaria’s annual beer festival, but of migrants crammed into makeshift shelters across the country.Europe is witnessing a curious moment: In an age when one cannot pass through airport security with a bottle of water, tens of thousands arrive every day with little or no screening.As the number of migrants continues to rise, so do fears of unrest, crime and even Islamic State fighters hiding in the continuing stream of people.AdvertisementAbout 120 miles northeast of Munich’s festivities, in a donated tent near the Austrian border, Stephan Wittenzellner of the federal police was watching one recent evening as hundreds of fresh arrivals lined up to board buses that would take them to destinations across Bavaria. There were women and children but mostly young men.
                In recent months European nations have worked to block the main route taken by migrants fleeing war and upheaval.            Was he worried one of them might be a potential militant?“I would be lying if I said no,” said Mr. Wittenzellner.AdvertisementHe is not the only one expressing concern. President Milos Zeman of the Czech Republic has warned of “sleeper cells” coming to Europe. Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister as recently as 2013, called his country’s open-armed welcome “totally irresponsible.”But intelligence officials here and in neighboring countries appear more sanguine. “It isn’t actually as we speak today the main focus of where the threat is coming from,” Andrew Parker, the head of Britain’s main domestic spy agency, MI5, said last month. Far more worrying, officials said, were European jihadists returning from Syria and disaffected Muslims already in the West who have been recruited by the Islamic State.They echoed what researchers monitoring Westerners fighting for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have been saying: “If they want to come to Europe, there are easier ways,” said Shiraz Maher of the war studies department at King’s College London. “They have access to money, and they have networks. Why would they make such a difficult and dangerous journey?”Since the end of August, the German authorities have received more than 70 tips alleging that militants are among the migrants, the head of Germany’s federal crime-fighting agency, Holger Münch, told the radio station Deutschlandfunk earlier this month.Some allegations were made anonymously, and others reportedly came from migrants claiming to recognize members of the Islamic State who tortured or threatened them back home — perhaps, one police officer speculated, in the belief that it might help their own asylum application.
                The latest E.U. proposal addresses just a fraction of a human crisis numbering in the millions.            All of the claims have been investigated, officials said. But as Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière put it this month: “None of these tip-offs have had any truth to them so far.”AdvertisementNear the Austrian border, as migrants packed the bottom of a bus with their backpacks and plastic bags, Mr. Wittenzellner said his concerns were no reason to stop helping those in need.“We can’t deprive thousands of people of humanity because one guy might be a bad guy,” he said. “It’s a risk we need to take.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If left in legal limbo, stuck in mass accommodations and given no opportunity to work, there could be trouble, said Matthias Schacherbauer, who runs a temporary home for teenage migrants.“That’s when they will become frustrated and vulnerable to the propaganda of Islamists,” Mr. Schacherbauer said.“Right now,” he added, “they are the ones fleeing the Islamists. Let’s not forget that.”A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: As Migrants Settle In, Fears May Be Displaced.
