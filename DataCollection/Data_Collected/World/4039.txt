An army spokesman, Col. Didier Badjeck, said the troops had carried out the operation along Cameroon’s long border with Nigeria. Ryan Cummings, chief Africa analyst at the crisis management company red24, suggested that the campaign against Boko Haram would be a long one. “An operation like this may have hit one cell, but that does not create a major problem for Boko Haram’s ability to execute attacks in other areas,” Mr. Cummings said.A version of this brief appears in print on December 3, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Cameroon: Troops Kill 100 Militants and Free Hostages Held by Boko Haram.
