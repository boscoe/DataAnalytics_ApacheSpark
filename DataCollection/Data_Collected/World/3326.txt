The video showed him kicking and punching the teenager, Tariq Abu Khdeir, who is from Tampa, Fla.AdvertisementThe Israeli Justice Ministry said that Tariq had not been resisting arrest and that the border police officer had beaten the boy in the head, face and upper body while he was on the ground.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
