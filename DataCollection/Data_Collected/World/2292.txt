A British judge on Tuesday ordered a huge financial payout for a woman who claims that she was the “secret wife” of a former Saudi ruler, King Fahd, who died in 2005. Judge Peter Smith ruled that the woman, Janan Harb, 68, should receive more than $23 million and two apartments in London that had been promised to her. Ms. Harb had told the court that she secretly married the king in 1968 when he was still a prince and that he had promised to look after her financially for the rest of her life. Her testimony indicated that she had been promised the settlement by Prince Abdul Aziz, the son of another of the king’s wives, a claim the judge called credible. The prince denied the assertion in written statements but refused to testify in person.A version of this brief appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page A11 of the New York edition with the headline: Europe; Britain: Payout for Saudi’s ‘Secret Wife’.
