Guinea’s last known Ebola patient, a 19-day-old boy, has recovered and been released from a treatment center in the capital, Conakry, a health official said Monday. The baby’s release means that Guinea, the last country still battling the virus, can begin a 42-day countdown to formally end the outbreak. The baby was born in the treatment center to an infected mother, who did not survive. Sixty-eight people who had been in contact with the country’s last cluster of Ebola patients were released from quarantine on Saturday. The epidemic began in Guinea nearly two years ago.A version of this brief appears in print on November 17, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Guinea: Last Known Ebola Patient Has Recovered and Is Released.
