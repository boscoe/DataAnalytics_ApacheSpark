The second attempt to lift the fuselage of the crashed AirAsia jetliner failed Sunday as the wreckage sank back to the ocean floor when a rope linking the lifting balloons broke. A strong current was the main obstacle, said a navy spokesman, Manahan Simorangkir. Seventy bodies have been discovered from the jetliner, Flight 8501, which crashed Dec. 28 with 162 people on board while flying from Indonesia’s second-largest city, Surabaya, to Singapore. An attempt to lift the fuselage on Saturday failed because lifting balloons deflated. Divers reached the fuselage for the first time on Friday. Most of the victims are believed to be inside.A version of this brief appears in print on January 26, 2015, on Page A5 of the New York edition with the headline: Indonesia: Jet’s Wreckage Sinks Again.
