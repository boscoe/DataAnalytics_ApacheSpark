The shelling hit an open-air market and killed at least 40 people, antigovernment activists said, while world leaders met in Vienna at a conference aimed at resolving Syria’s civil war.The attack on the suburb, Douma, started around 7 a.m. and involved ground shelling as well as airstrikes, according to Hassan Taqulden, an opposition activist who lives in the area and spoke by Skype. The shells fell on shoppers picking up goods for breakfast before Friday Prayer, said Mr. Taqulden, who added that his 21-year-old cousin, a shopkeeper, had been among those killed.Video purportedly of the attack’s aftermath showed bodies slumped and bloodied among upended market stalls, scattered goods and small fires.What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.Bombardments by the government of President Bashar al-Assad are frequent in the insurgent-held suburbs of Damascus. Areas like Douma — where hundreds of people, mostly civilians, have been killed over the last two months — have been increasingly drained of their residents.The attack on Friday was part of a surge in violence across the country since Russia intervened in the civil war. The violence has driven tens of thousands of people from their homes and has led to warnings from aid agencies about the possibility of a new refugee exodus from Syria.Also on Friday, an independent Syrian news organization that was founded to report on atrocities by the Islamic State in the city of Raqqa, the terrorist group’s Syrian headquarters, said that one of its members had been killed in Turkey.The group, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, said that the member, Ibrahim Abelqader, a media activist, and his friend Faris Hamadi had been killed in Urfa, a city in southern Turkey, less than an hour’s drive from the border with Syria. The group blamed the Islamic State for the killings.Maher Samaan contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement
