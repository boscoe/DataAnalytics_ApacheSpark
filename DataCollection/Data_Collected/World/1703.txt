BRASILIA — Brazilian President Humberto Castello Branco today [Oct. 27] assumed almost dictatorial powers, dissolving all political parties, after leftists in Congress blocked the government’s internal security program. The new powers gave him the authority to suspend civil liberties and control the movements of any citizen. Mr. Castello Branco announced the new measures in a nationwide radio and television broadcast. ‘‘We need tranquility for the nation’s economic development,’’ the president said. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, October 28, 1965
