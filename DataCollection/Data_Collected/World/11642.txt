They ordered the victims to lie face down and shot seven in the head. An eighth man was shot but escaped, though he died at a nearby hospital.Detective Arlindo José Negrão ruled out a fight between rival fan clubs but did not suggest any other motive for the attack.The investigation “is not leading us to believe it was caused by fan rivalry,” he said at a news conference. The victims were having a barbecue at the club at the time and making flags with the soccer team’s colors for Sunday’s semifinals state championship match between Corinthians, which it supports, and Palmeiras. Pavilhão 9 was founded by a group of Corinthians fans who played soccer with inmates at the infamous Carandiru prison, known widely for a massacre in 1992 that left 111 inmates dead and that was turned into a movie. The prison is now closed.The Corinthians team did not respond to a request for information but posted the word “Mourning” against a black backdrop on its official Facebook page. Much of the soccer violence that breaks out in or near Brazilian stadiums is traced to fan clubs. The police often investigate fan groups for ties to drug traffickers.“It is widely known that criminal organizations are inside of all fan clubs” Juca Kfouri, one of Brazil’s best-known sports commentators, told the radio station CBN. “Organized crime uses these fan groups as a front for their misdeeds.”Last year, dozens of members of another Corinthians fan club, Gaviões da Fiel, invaded the team’s training center. Angered by the team’s performance, they attacked employees and grabbed the Peruvian striker Paolo Guerrero by his neck, forcing other players to flee into a locker room and barricade themselves until the police arrived.Advertisement
