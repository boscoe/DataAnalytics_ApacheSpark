PARIS — Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara said today [Dec. 15] that Communist China will probably be able to hit cities such as San Francisco and Berlin with nuclear missiles within ten years. Mr. McNamara, in a speech to the semi-annual NATO Council meeting, said Peking would have enough fissionable material by 1967 to start producing and test-firing medium-range nuclear missiles. By 1975, he said, they would probably have operable long-range missiles. He suggested, however, implicitly, that NATO should enlarge itself into a world-wide police force to withstand Chinese aggression. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, December 16, 1965
