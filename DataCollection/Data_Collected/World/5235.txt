Vendors offer scarlet poinsettia and white-berried mistletoe and trees to be decked for a cozy English Christmas — hardly the front-line emblems of a war against the encroachment of the superrich.Yet in Highgate, an upscale neighborhood five miles north of London’s heart, the familiar year-end trappings mark what researchers call an alpha territory fought over by two elites: Those who have for decades cherished it as a center of cultured, comfortable, largely professional affluence; and outsiders of newer and much greater wealth who see it as little more than a location for trophy mansions.The conflict is depicted as the consequence of a widening global divide between the überrich and the rest, reminiscent of the upstairs-downstairs gulf in Western society before World War I.Writ small, social researchers say, the tussle could foretell a future in which an ever-smaller upper crust will command financial heights far beyond the dreams of lesser mortals, even those who qualify, like many of the folks in Highgate, as pretty well off themselves.These days, equality campaigners say, 80 immensely rich people have amassed the same wealth as the poorer half of the world’s entire population.London, according to a report focusing on Highgate by researchers at two universities, is the location of choice for the global superrich, whose desire for homes in prestigious places is “displacing pre-existing elites” and reshaping the character of their adoptive neighborhoods.Indeed, the adversaries of ultrahigh-end redevelopment say they start new campaigns every month to resist the construction of immense mansions, often with multistory basements for cars, home cinemas, spas and panic rooms.There are those who shrug and say it was ever thus. Highgate and the neighboring Hampstead have long existed as an enclave of grand homes often created or remodeled by magnates who built their fortunes on coal or soap or beer, and were not shy about expressing their wealth in bricks and mortar.But it is those same houses, and the plots around them, that now attract more secretive outsiders from Russia and elsewhere. Many are said to hide their identity with high fences, security gates and thickets of front companies registered in tax havens.Among the most talked about is a 25-bedroom house called Witanhurst, said to be the second-biggest residential property in London, after Buckingham Palace, a vast pile with vistas over the 800-acre Hampstead Heath.According to news reports, the buyer paid some $75 million for it and resolved to spend the same again on enhancements, including basement excavations for features including a 70-foot swimming pool and a garage for 25 cars. Once the renovations are complete, the house will command a resale value of $450 million.As the huge remodeling progressed, mystery over the ownership deepened. Some even gossiped that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was building himself a high-end hide-out. Then The New Yorker identified Andrey Guryev, a fertilizer magnate from Russia, as the beneficiary of a company called Safran Holdings, said to own Witanhurst on behalf of his family.Since its days as a travelers’ halt on London’s northern approaches, Highgate has hosted prominent, sometimes mysterious, outsiders.The Russian Trade Mission, for instance, is rumored to be a nest of spies. The poshest thoroughfare has been home to the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the supermodel Kate Moss and many others. Its 19th-century cemetery is the final resting place of, among others, Karl Marx and Alexander V. Litvinenko, who was poisoned with radioactive polonium.But there is a particular unease about the newest arrivals. “We don’t want limos with smoked windows and men in dark glasses with bulging breast pockets, and the place surrounded by CCTV,” a local councilor, Michael Hammerson, told The Daily Mail. “That’s not Highgate.”That definition, though, is precisely what the skirmish is all about.alan.cowell@gmail.comAdvertisement
