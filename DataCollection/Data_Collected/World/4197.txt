GENEVA — From Balkan and Turkish sources there have reached here the following indications concerning the grouping of Turkish troops in Europe and Asia. A Turkish army is being concentrated in the region of Phillipopolis, in fulfilment of Turco-Bulgarian agreements. This army is stated to number 75,000 men. Its organization, however, is slow, and its intervention cannot be regarded as imminent. Guns of 305mm. and 210mm., sent from Germany, are reported to have arrived in the Gallipoli Peninsula, where the Turks are preparing for an offensive soon. It is asserted among German officers in Constantinople that the expedition against Egypt will set out about the beginning of next month. The Turks, evidently a prey to megalomania, state that by the spring they will have an army of two million men. — The New York Herald, European Edition, December 7, 1915
