WASHINGTON —  Cuba temporarily detained 178 political prisoners in January, Tom Malinowski, the State Department’s senior human rights official, said Tuesday.That was a decline from December, when there were 489 such detentions. The average monthly figure for 2014 was 741, added Mr. Malinowski, who based that number on reports by the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, an independent human rights group.Still, Mr. Malinowski, appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, cautioned that it was too soon to say if the reduced number of detentions represented a trend.“The nature of the Cuban regime has not changed, and we have not claimed so,” Mr. Malinowski said.AdvertisementThe Obama administration’s decision to restore diplomatic relations with Cuba was the major focus of a hearing led by Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican and potential presidential candidate who has been highly critical of White House Cuba policy.AdvertisementSenator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and another vocal critic, challenged the administration’s contention that its move to restore relations and broaden economic ties might open the door for political and human rights reforms in Cuba.
            Highlights from The Times’s coverage of the historic developments in relations between the United States and Cuba.        “We’ve compromised bedrock principles for virtually no concessions,” Mr. Menendez said.Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, asserted that the Obama administration had jettisoned a failed policy for one that might encourage political change in Cuba.But Mr. Rubio said that Josefina Vidal, Cuba’s senior negotiator, had suggested in an interview with The Associated Press last month that American diplomats would not be allowed to travel freely within Cuba unless the United States reduced its support for dissidents.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Jacobson, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, who visited Cuba last month for talks on restoring relations, responded that the United States would not agree to such a precondition for opening an embassy.“We would not curtail the activities we’re doing now,” said Ms. Jacobson, who plans to conduct another round of talks on restoring relations this month.American officials said in January that Cuba had released 53 dissidents it had promised to free under the accord with the United States to restore diplomatic relations. They have cautioned that Cuba may at the same time continue to harass its political opponents, including through short-term detentions, which typically last a few days or less.Mr. Malinowski, who is expected to conduct talks with Cuba on human rights issues this spring, told the panel that there had been about 140 detentions in January. But he later told reporters that the correct number was 178.“From December to January, we have actually seen a significant decrease, but I don’t want to say that one month represents a trend,” Mr. Malinowski said. “Even a single one of these detentions is too many. We’re going to be watching this very carefully.”A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Official Says Cuba’s Political Detentions Declined.
