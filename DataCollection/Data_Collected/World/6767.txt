At his weekly general audience at the Vatican, he said: “I have heard it said that families with many children and the birth of many children are among the causes of poverty. I think that is a simplistic opinion.” He attributed poverty instead to an economic system that places money at the center of a “throw-away culture.” His original comments, made on a plane returning from Asia, came in response to a journalist who said that many Filipinos believed that overpopulation was contributing to the country’s great poverty.
