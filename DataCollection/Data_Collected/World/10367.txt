Sierra Leone’s six million people were told on Friday to stay home for three days, except to attend religious services, as the West African nation attempted a final push to rid itself of Ebola. Thousands of teams went out to remind people how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it. Teams were also going to search for Ebola cases, particularly in regions around the capital and in the north, where flare-ups persist. Streets were largely empty Friday except for police officers on patrols and soldiers at their checkpoints. Muslims were allowed to go to Friday Prayer but attendance was low, and the streets emptied quickly after services. Christians will be allowed to go to church on Sunday.A version of this brief appears in print on March 28, 2015, on Page A10 of the New York edition with the headline: Africa; Sierra Leone: Citizens Told to Stay Home to Halt Ebola.
