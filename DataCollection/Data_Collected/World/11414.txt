Mr. Vaccari’s sister-in-law was also detained, and his wife was questioned in connection with a series of unidentified deposits in her account that investigators suspect might be related to a kickback scheme at Petrobras. Mr. Vaccari has maintained his innocence. Dozens of lawmakers and some former executive branch officials, including two former chiefs of staff to President Dilma Rousseff, are under investigation, but Mr. Vaccari is the closest figure to the president yet implicated in the scandal. Ms. Rousseff, who served as chairwoman of the Petrobras board during several years as the graft took place, has not been implicated in the scandal. Advertisement
