The Dominican Republic issued arrest warrants on Monday for a member of the European Parliament and two other French citizens who allegedly helped a pair of French pilots convicted on cocaine trafficking charges flee by speedboat in October. The attorney general’s office said warrants were issued against Aymeric Chauprade, the member of Parliament; Christophe Naudin, an aviation security specialist; and Pierre Malinowski, an aide to the far-right politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. In an interview last month with the magazine Paris Match, Mr. Chauprade said he planned the escape to help “compatriots in danger.” The pilots, Pascal Fauret and Bruno Odos, were under loose house arrest at the time and had been sentenced to 20 years in prison for possession of 1,500 pounds of cocaine with intent to traffic it. The drugs were seized aboard an aircraft in Punta Cana, in the country’s east, in 2013. The pilots denied the charges and were appealing. Two other men have been convicted in the “Air Cocaine” case and are being detained in the Dominican Republic pending an appeal.A version of this brief appears in print on November 24, 2015, on Page A15 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Dominican Republic: Warrants Seek Frenchmen in ‘Air Cocaine’ Escape.
