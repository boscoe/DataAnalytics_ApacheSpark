A suicide car bomb killed 12 Shiite militiamen and Iraqi soldiers on Monday in a town north of Baghdad, the Iraqi authorities said, setting off a battle between security forces and fighters with the extremist Islamic State group. The suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden car into a gathering of soldiers and Shiite fighters in the town of Abasiyat, just south of Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, the police said. Police officials and hospital workers said the attack killed 10 militiamen and two soldiers and wounded 18 people. Clashes between Iraqi security forces and militants from the Islamic State group erupted after the attack, the police said, although the extremists did not immediately claim responsibility for the bombing. Also on Monday, Iran’s semiofficial Fars news agency said Mahdi Norouzi, a member of the paramilitary wing of its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was killed while fighting the Islamic State in Iraq.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
