Following its election defeat last month and the resignation of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the caucus of the Conservative Party of Canada elected Rona Ambrose, 46, of Alberta, as its interim leader on Thursday. Ms. Ambrose, who was first elected to Parliament in 2004, has been the minister of eight departments, including the department responsible for environmental matters. She is widely seen as less partisan than many of her Conservative colleagues. Under the party rules, Ms. Ambrose will not be able to run in the coming party race to select a permanent replacement for Mr. Harper. But as leader of the opposition, she will get a pay raise as well as an official residence. Mr. Harper will continue to represent his Calgary, Alberta, constituency as a member of Parliament.A version of this brief appears in print on November 6, 2015, on Page A6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Americas; Canada: Interim Chief for Conservatives.
