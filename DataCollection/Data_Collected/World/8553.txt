Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that the Syrian government had dropped so-called barrel bombs on hundreds of sites in rebel-held towns and cities in the past year, flouting a United Nations Security Council measure.In a report released Tuesday, the group said it relied on satellite images, photos, videos and witness statements to conclude that the Syrian government had bombarded at least 450 sites in and around the southern town of Daraa and at least 1,000 sites in Aleppo in the north.The report focused on the period since Feb. 22, 2014, when the Security Council specifically condemned the use of barrel bombs, which are large containers filled with explosives and projectiles that can indiscriminately hurt civilians and are prohibited under international law.A doctor treating wounded Syrians told the group’s researchers that “women and children make up two-thirds of the victims they receive and that most were being injured by fragments of explosive weapons.”The group urged the Council to act to stop the bombardments when it meets Thursday to discuss Syria, but the prospects of any punitive measures are dim, given the support that the Syrian government enjoys from Russia, a veto-wielding member.In an interview with the BBC this month, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria flatly denied that his forces had used of barrel bombs. The United Nations special envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, said last week that Mr. Assad had agreed to halt aerial bombardments in Aleppo for six weeks as part of a proposed truce but declined to describe details of the deal. Rebel groups have yet to agree to the proposed freeze.A version of this article appears in print on February 25, 2015, on Page A8 of the New York edition with the headline: Syria: Rights Group Reports on Use of ‘Barrel Bombs’ by Assad Forces.
