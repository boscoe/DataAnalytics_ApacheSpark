TEHRAN —  The final step for Iran to start carrying out the nuclear agreement was completed Wednesday, after an oversight panel ratified the bill passed by Parliament supporting the deal with six world powers.The ratification by the veto-wielding panel, the 12-member Guardian Council, made within 36 hours after Parliament accepted the details of the agreement, now clears the way for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran to start dismantling thousands of centrifuges and redesign a heavy-water reactor into a much less a dangerous light-water reactor. It also needs to take several other measures.In exchange, as soon as the International Atomic Energy Agency verifies the steps, sanctions against Iran will be lifted.Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, speaking on state television on Tuesday, predicted that the process would take about two months.
                A short overview of highlights from the Iran nuclear pact.            Under the Iranian system, half the Guardian Council’s members are clerics, appointed by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and confirmed by Parliament. The other half are jurists, appointed by the head of the judiciary, Sadegh Larijani.AdvertisementThe council ratifies laws, or sends them back to Parliament if they are deemed in need of further study. During elections, the council vets candidates and can disqualify those it deems unsuitable.AdvertisementIn a sign of the underlying discord in Iran about the nuclear agreement, some hard-line members of Parliament complained Tuesday that Ayatollah Khamenei’s office had unduly sought to assure passage of the bill endorsing the nuclear pact. One hundred amendments to change the pact were ignored in a rushed session.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In a statement, it admonished Iranian news media to “exercise caution in attributing reports to the supreme leader’s office.”State television reported the news of the Guardian Council’s ratification, but devoted more attention to a video clip showing what appeared to be an underground ballistic missile storage facility, interviewing a commander boasting about Iran’s missile capabilities.That clip appeared to be part of the Iranian government’s efforts to project military strength and counteract doubts caused by the nuclear pact that Iranian security has been compromised.A version of this article appears in print on October 15, 2015, on Page A9 of the New York edition with the headline: Iran Is Set to Put Nuclear Deal, Now Ratified, in Motion.
