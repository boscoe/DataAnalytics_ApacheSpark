It also banned “transport vehicles” that are more than 10 years old from entering the capital, and ordered all taxis in the Delhi region to switch to compressed natural gas by March 1. In addition, the court doubled a tax on commercial vehicles carrying goods into Delhi to 1,400 rupees, about $20, for light-duty vehicles and two-axle trucks, and raised the tax to 2,600 rupees for larger trucks.The World Health Organization said last year that New Delhi had the most polluted air of the nearly 1,600 cities around the world that it had surveyed. The air quality index in the city for the first week of December soared past 300 at times, according to data from the United States Embassy, which is “hazardous” by American standards — a level at which people should avoid physical activity outdoors.The New York Times would like to hear from residents living in countries seriously affected by air pollution.The new restrictions are “a first step,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of the Center for Science and Environment, who acknowledged that the number of sport utility vehicles running on diesel was lower than the number of smaller diesel cars, which are not subject to the restriction. But the measures are important to limit the use of low-cost, subsidized diesel by wealthy commuters, she said.The air in the capital grows especially thick and hazy in the winter as exhaust from vehicles and diesel generators mixes with construction dust and particles from the burning of trash and crops.The government appears to have taken greater notice of the pollution in recent weeks. On Dec. 4, the Delhi government announced a plan to limit the use of private cars, allowing them on the road on alternate days, depending on whether the license plate ended in an odd or even number.Since then, the government has said that the restrictions would be in place for two weeks beginning on Jan. 1, and it announced an increase in public transportation.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
