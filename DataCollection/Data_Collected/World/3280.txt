Jonathan J. Pollard, a civilian intelligence analyst for the United States Navy, was convicted of passing thousands of pages of American intelligence to Israel from June 1984 until he was arrested in November 1985.He was sentenced to life in prison, becoming the first American to receive such a term for spying for an ally. Federal law required a parole hearing after 30 years, and the United States Parole Commission found that he had satisfied the terms of his sentence and was eligible for release.Mr. Pollard’s release will remove a longstanding irritant in the relationship between the United States and Israel. While Israeli prime ministers have pressed repeatedly for Mr. Pollard’s release in the past three decades, American presidents have ultimately resisted amid strong opposition from intelligence agencies.President Obama refused to release Mr. Pollard early, a move Israeli leaders had sought, but the Obama administration also did not object to granting him parole after 30 years. Some critics have said the president should have tried to stop Mr. Pollard’s release. Some have accused Mr. Obama of using the parole to try to assuage Israeli leaders who were upset over the nuclear deal with Iran, a charge the White House has denied. Mr. Pollard has asked to be allowed to move to Israel to live with his wife, Esther, even if it means renouncing his American citizenship. But under federal law, he cannot leave the country without permission for five years, and the Obama administration has made it clear that it does not plan to waive that requirement. Unless that changes, Mr. Pollard plans to live in New York.Advertisement
