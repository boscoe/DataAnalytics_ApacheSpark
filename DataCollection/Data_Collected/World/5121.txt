Cellphone cameras captured the moment a sea of earth struck an industrial district in the city of Shenzhen in southern China on Sunday.HONG KONG —  A landslide in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen sent a sea of earth crashing into an industrial district on Sunday morning, sending hundreds of people fleeing and destroying at least 33 buildings, including three dormitories for workers, the local government said. Scores of people were feared buried under the rubble and mud.The number of people reported missing climbed early Monday to 91, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. About 1,500 rescue workers were searching the rubble, according to a report on the official page of the Guangming New District government on Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social media site.The cause of the landslide was no mystery. A great pile of construction debris and earth, deposited on the side of a hill, gave way, the Twitter account of the official People’s Daily reported  Monday, citing China’s Ministry of Land and Resources. Rescue workers detected signs of life in three locations in the mud field, which spread out over about 15 acres, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
                On Sunday, a man-made hill of dirt and construction debris collapsed in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.            Images and video on social media showed a flood of dirt engulfing low-rise buildings and upending construction vehicles as if they were toy cars. At least four people were pulled from the rubble, three with minor injuries, the local government said. A section of a major pipeline that transports natural gas from China’s west exploded as the landslide struck, Xinhua reported.AdvertisementIn the hours after the accident, China’s government-controlled news media placed great emphasis on the concern felt by senior officials, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. Such expressions of concern appeared to reflect a newfound sensitivity on the part of the leadership after a series of deadly accidents highlighted the downside of the nation’s breakneck economic growth.The Weibo page of a local official newspaper, the Shenzhen Tequ Bao, reported that the giant pile of construction debris and earth was illegal and that it had been approved by local officials. Those posts were later deleted.AdvertisementJust a few miles south of the accident site, in Hong Kong, steep hillsides in populated areas are reinforced by elaborate networks of retaining walls to prevent landslides, which can occur frequently in a region pounded by heavy monsoon rains.
                A landslide in Shenzhen, China, which destroyed 33 buildings and buried dozens of people under excavated dirt and construction waste, was the latest in a string of deadly disasters linked to human error or activity in China this year.            In China, public criticism over lax government regulations and official corruption has grown recently after several disasters.In August, a chemical storage depot exploded in the northern port city of Tianjin, killing more than 170 people. In October, a building collapsed in the central province of Henan, killing at least 17 construction workers. A landslide in May in southwestern Guizhou Province caused a nine-story building to collapse, killing 16 people.The 2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province, which left more than 87,000 people dead or missing, including many children crushed in schools, brought national attention to the shoddy construction of many buildings, derisively called “tofu buildings.”In the case of Sunday’s landslide, one Weibo user, with the online handle “Tiger from Xinzhou,” criticized the news media’s emphasis on what leaders were doing. “Less talk about the leaders and more reports on the causes. What’s going on there now?” the person wrote.Kiki Zhao contributed research from Beijing.Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
