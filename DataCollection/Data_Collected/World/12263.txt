Lithuania’s Foreign Ministry said it was concerned about attempts to interfere with the construction of an undersea power link between Lithuania and Sweden through the Baltic Sea. It said a Russian Navy vessel entered Lithuania’s economic zone on Thursday and illegally ordered a course change for a Swedish-owned ship laying the 250-mile power cable. “For the time being, the cable isn’t covered with sand, and we have a special ship patrolling at the site to warn other vessels not to damage it with nets or anchors,” Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius told Lithuania’s national radio. “This ship has repeatedly been chased away by Russian military vessels.” A ministry spokesman, Kestutis Vaskelevicius, said Lithuania received no explanation from Russia’s ambassador or other officials on Friday.
