LONDON — In one bold raid delivered Monday night [Nov. 12] by its sea-borne bombers, the British fleet in the Mediterranean crippled at least two and probably three of the Italian Navy’s six battleships and put out of action two cruisers and several auxiliary vessels as they lay comfortably behind shore batteries of the naval stronghold of Taranto, on the heel of the Italian boot. This decisive blow, which immediately tipped the balance of Mediterranean naval strength in favor of the British, was announced to a wildly cheering House of Commons this morning by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. — New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, November 14, 1940
