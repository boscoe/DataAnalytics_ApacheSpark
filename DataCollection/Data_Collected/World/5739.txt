Uncertainty about the longevity of Saudi Arabia’s king intensified on Friday with the announcement that he was battling pneumonia and needed temporary help from a breathing tube.While a statement from the Saudi royal court said the king, Abdullah, was in stable condition at a hospital, there was no immediate word on his prognosis or a discharge date.The king, who turned 90 in August, has a history of medical problems, and his health is often scrutinized for any hint of a leadership change in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy and regional American ally that is perhaps the world’s most important oil producer.The royal court, in an announcement quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency, said a lung infection had been diagnosed in the king after he was admitted to King Abdulaziz Medical City Hospital in Riyadh, the capital, on Wednesday. Other news services said he was transferred on Thursday to a military hospital.AdvertisementThe combination of the king’s age and his latest affliction created new uncertainty over his health. It came against a backdrop of challenges faced by the Saudis on a number of major global issues.The biggest is plunging oil prices, caused in part by Saudi insistence on maintaining current high production levels in an effort to drive out higher-cost producers elsewhere and gain more control over the global market.Saudi officials, presumably acting under the king’s orders, have shown no inclination to curb production, despite complaints by others, including the country’s regional rival, Iran.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Most notably, Saudi Arabia is actively participating in the American-led bombing campaign against the Islamic State and other extremist groups involved in those conflicts.Crown Prince Salman, 79, a half brother of the king and his presumed successor, has increasingly acted as Abdullah’s representative, most recently standing in for him at a summit meeting of Persian Gulf countries last month in Qatar. Crown Prince Salman is also Saudi Arabia’s deputy prime minister and defense minister.Another half brother, Prince Muqrin, 69, who has served in a number of top government positions, including the head of intelligence and the king’s special adviser, was made second in line to the throne last March.AdvertisementAbdullah is the country’s sixth king, having assumed the throne in 2005.Despite the succession plan for Abdullah, a bigger question looming in Saudi Arabia’s future is the royal gerontocracy. Its members, many of them stooped and frail, are all sons of King Abdulaziz al-Saud, who founded the kingdom in 1932.Placing Crown Prince Salman and Prince Muqrin in line to succeed Abdullah effectively delays the time of reckoning when the next generation of princes, the founder’s grandsons, will be moved into positions of high authority.The deference to age within the Saudi monarchy partly explains the glacial pace of social change in the kingdom, where strict Islamic codes of conduct are enforced and women have far fewer rights than men.A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2015, on Page A4 of the New York edition with the headline: Saudi King, 90, Hospitalized; Pneumonia Is Diagnosed.
