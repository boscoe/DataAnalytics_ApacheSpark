Amnesty International is calling on the government to expand an inquiry on the coup to investigate the regiment’s suspected abuses.The Amnesty report, assembled after a review of videos, medical records and interviews with witnesses, accused the group of shooting, whipping and beating as many as 271 civilians.One pregnant woman standing in her home was shot in the stomach. Her child was delivered by cesarean section and had a gunshot wound on the buttock, the midwife who helped deliver the child told Amnesty. The studio of a hip-hop artist known as Smockey, a founder of a civil society group that opposed Mr. Compaoré, was damaged by an antitank rocket.Gen. Gilbert Diendéré, the leader of the coup, has been charged with high treason, murder, “attacking the security of the state” and “colluding with foreign forces to destabilize internal security.”Advertisement
