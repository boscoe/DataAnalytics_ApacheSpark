Four years ago Mr. Power started releasing deep, beatless soundscapes on his own; both Blanck Mass’s first record and his performances at the time were enveloping, somewhat abstract listening experiences. Subsequently, and especially now, with “Dumb Flesh,” his third album, he’s giving you something you might find familiar or even commercial by its basic outlines. But he’s still got ways to make it uncanny: close, loud and abrupt.“Dumb Flesh” has dance beats almost all the way through it, and grand, sinister atmospheres made with analog synthesizers; it may remind you of incidental music to an unsettling movie from the 1980s, with bubbling, twinkling, echoey or otherwise pneumatic sounds. There’s been a vogue for this kind of thing recently — soundtracks by John Carpenter and Tangerine Dream and Vangelis — and for obvious reasons: the power of repetition and the chill of dystopia. Mr. Power is manipulating old signifiers. He is experimenting with ways to warm up cold music.The album was announced several months ago with some context explaining that its theme is human frailty. But humanity appears only scrambled or unintelligible: a modified baby’s gurgle (I think) on “Lung”; a woman’s voice, maybe singing a foreign language, chopped up and quantized in the galloping stomp of “Dead Format.” It’s social music, though — danceable, basically shareable — up until “Detritus,” the album’s last track. Here you have almost three minutes of gnarled electronic fuzz until a tune starts to push through. Surprise: voices sing “ahh!” as if breaking a seal, and the grandest, most emotional melody of the whole record begins in earnest.Advertisement
