Painting and architecture used to be much closer, such that at least during the Renaissance artists sometimes practiced both. Joan Waltemath is a painter, although she taught at the architecture school at Cooper Union for many years, but her works are planned and constructed almost like buildings.Ms. Waltemath’s paintings here, which feature grid-based compositions, are measured and squared off, and you can see pencil lines on the sides of the wood panels. Some of the titles include orientations (“East” or “West”) or references to architectural elements like arches and thresholds. Several took longer to execute than most buildings — in one case, the serene “Oaxaca Blue/darkness too (East 4 1,2,3,5,8 ...)” (2007-2015), over seven years. (The gallery release also mentions, as a precedent to Ms. Waltemath’s paintings, the works of El Lissitsky, the Russian avant-garde artist whose two-dimensional “Prouns” were conceived as “interchange stations between architecture and painting.”)More important for Ms. Waltemath is the relationship between architecture and the human body, and how that is echoed in painting. The pieces in the “Torso/Roots” series at Hionas are vertical and narrow and emphasize the phenomenological — conscious, sensory and perceptual — experience of standing before a painting. Also significant are Ms. Waltemath’s use of unusual materials like graphite and luminescent phosphorous and fluorescent pigments, and the fact that the gallery feels like a crypt where you’d encounter a religious icon or a fresco embedded in a wall. The total effect is pleasing, surprising and structurally very sound.Hionas 124 Forsyth Street,Lower East Side Through March 14 A version of this review appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page C25 of the New York edition with the headline: Joan Waltemath.
