The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center did not always fare well in that regard in the years after it established its annual presentation of Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos for the winter holidays, in 1993, but in recent years it has found a groove.There seem to be at least a few new performers every year, as well as familiar ones in shifting combinations, so that a volatile chemistry is generally in play. And at this year’s first outing of the Brandenburgs, on Friday evening at Alice Tully Hall, a different player took the lead in each work.Well, almost each. You might have seen the violinist Erin Keefe, the excellent concertmaster of the Minnesota Orchestra, as the leader in the Fifth Concerto as well as the Third, but she was necessarily caught up in the Fifth’s lavish solos, along with Demarre McGill, the flutist, and Kenneth Weiss, the harpsichordist, so the violist Richard O’Neill pretty much directed the band.The other leaders were the violinists Daniel Phillips, Chad Hoopes and Paul Huang and the violist Paul Neubauer.Mr. Weiss and the double bassist Joseph Conyers firmly anchored all six concertos. Although the harpsichord can barely be heard at times when combined with modern instruments, it provides a consistent sparkle and serves as glue for the whole, and Mr. Weiss’s extended solo in the Fifth was propulsive and virtuosic.Many joys were provided by intertwining pairs of players — the oboists Stephen Taylor and Randall Ellis and the hornists Julie Landsman and Jennifer Montone in the First Concerto, the flutists Sooyun Kim and Mr. McGill in the Fourth — as well as by individuals. Other notable standouts were Brandon Ridenour, the clarino trumpeter; Marc Goldberg, the bassoonist; and Inbal Segev, a cellist, substituting for an injured performer, but all the playing positively brimmed with life.The Chamber Music Society will perform Bach’s Brandenburg Concertos again on Tuesday at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center; 212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety­.org.Advertisement
