CreditAndrea Mohin/The New York Times        Why don’t we see George Balanchine’s exquisite pas de deux “Sonatine” more often at New York City Ballet? Choreographed in 1975 to Ravel’s three-movement solo piano piece of that name, it’s an intricate, spellbinding vehicle for sensitive dancers. Although Balanchine originally made it for Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux as the opening of his Ravel festival, he soon revived it for Patricia McBride and Mikhail Baryshnikov (1979, for City Ballet’s European tour) and later for the radically dissimilar Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins.On Friday, it returned to repertory for the first time since 2004, danced by Tiler Peck and Joaquin De Luz (in new, too-somber blue-gray costumes), as part of a superb all-Balanchine quadruple bill to French music. (In the intervening years it’s been danced by Miami City Ballet and the Suzanne Farrell Ballet.) Watching it again, I marveled at how Balanchine, so many of whose ballets are in repertory, comes up with details that occur nowhere else. Sometimes this work’s dancers have simultaneous solos that reflect the different writing for the piano’s left and right hands; and one extended male solo ends, strikingly, with the ballerina entering and waiting on point.To one repeated four-note phrase in the piano, the ballerina, holding her partner’s hand as she winds her way, revolves as she steps from one point to another; the gorgeous three-dimensionality of the way she transfers her weight etches itself onto the music. In one exit, the dancers, though their hands are joined above their heads, are back to back. She, advancing on point, leads him into the wings; and he’s pulled backward by her — a classic image of the Balanchine man going where the ballerina leads without even seeing his way. And as the final movement ends, man and woman circuit the stage in opposite directions in turning garlands of sideways leaps.For Ms. Peck, a dancer of rare — and playful — musical refinement, this is her finest new vehicle in many months. In “Sonatine” she’s keenly and tenderly engaged every millisecond; the choreography shows her plasticity, delicacy and brilliance. Mr. De Luz also does well, but he’s content (as he often is) to give us a skillful but conventional account of leading-man flair rather than discover new facets of his own artistry.AdvertisementFriday night was rich fare. It opened with “Walpurgisnacht Ballet,” with Sara Mearns in its lead role. Recently, after the death of the Bolshoi ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, a British ballet friend of mine, marveling at the filmed evidence of her dancing, wondered in an email if this breathtaking level of musicality, commitment and immersion ever occurred today. Many New Yorkers, after watching Ms. Mearns’s “Walpurgisnacht” performance, will answer in the affirmative.Advertisement One of Ms. Plisetskaya’s most amazing vehicles was to this very music, from Charles Gounod’s “Faust.” Balanchine’s 1980 ballet (a wow as delivered by its original interpreter, Ms. Farrell) took that kind of Bolshoi bravura and allied it to rococo marvels of American technique. Ms. Mearns’s dancing in it is surely the greatest single ballerina performance before the public today. Glamorously, voluptuously, happily, she hurls thunderbolts, spins in tornadoes of her own making, swiftly reverses direction, arrives decisively with the music or finds hairbreadth ways of lingering around it, and accelerates in the intoxication of her own impetus. Watching, we know how lucky we are.Although Ask la Cour is a boring stage presence, he’s an admirable partner, and proved so again on Friday. The performance was heightened by the debut of Alexa Maxwell in the work’s soloist role. A corps dancer whose only solo role hitherto has been Coffee in “George Balanchine’s ‘The Nutcracker,’ ” she proved immediately winning in her expansive, appealing skill.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Deaths are rare onstage at City Ballet, but in Thursday’s “La Sylphide” and this “La Valse,” Sterling Hyltin got to die two nights running. She’s having a marvelous season: On Saturday she went on to dance both “Duo Concertant” and Terpsichore in “Apollo” at the matinee, and “Stravinsky Violin Concerto” on the evening program.She’s refining her performances of all these; in “La Valse,” her combination of fragility, impulsiveness and doom-hunger is very fine. (In “Apollo,” she’s enriching her lightness of touch with more sculptural firmness; in “Duo Concertant,” her calm falls backward in her partner’s arms are breathtaking in their line.)In “Symphony in C” (Bizet), Ashley Bouder (first movement), Maria Kowroski (second) and Brittany Pollack (fourth) establish high standards and vividly dissimilar moods. Too bad that Erica Pereira (third) is vapid and inconsequential; this soloist has been inexplicably overpromoted in a range of roles.This was the fifth different program that City Ballet presented in the first two weeks of its current season, and “Symphony in C” its 18th ballet. One of those (“La Sylphide”) is a new two-act production, two others (“Bournonville Divertissements” and “Sonatine”) are major revivals of works not danced by the company for over 10 years. Eight of those works have already been presented with alternate casts. At any other ballet company in the world this would be inconceivable; City Ballet and its audiences take it for granted.Among the season’s many delights, I must mention Saturday night’s suspense-laden and fearless “Stravinsky Violin” Aria I with Ms. Kowroski and Amar Ramasar. Russell Janzen’s “Duo Concertant” (a debut) was another feather in the cap of this terrific young dancer. Though Zachary Catazaro’s Apollo is no knockout, his second performance of the great role — musically incisive, quietly authoritative throughout, holding the ballet together as if it were all in his mind — had several moments of real beauty. Anthony Huxley’s dancing of the “Agon” Sarabande and “Square Dance” hero has been nothing short of superlative. He’s an impeccable classicist who has recently acquired new degrees of ignition and illumination; he dances his solos as if they were acts of his own imagination, an artist sharing his dream.An earlier version of a picture caption in a slide show with this review misidentified the three dancers pictured. They are Gretchen Smith, Lydia Wellington, and Marika Anderson — not Georgina Pazcoguin, Lauren King and Megan LeCrone.This program is in repertory at New York City Ballet until May 19; David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center; 212-496-0600, nycballet.com.
