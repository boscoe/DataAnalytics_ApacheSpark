The London-based auction house Christie’s said its 2014 art sales totaled 5.1 billion pounds, or about $7.7 billion, a 12 percent increase over 2013. Growth at Christie’s was led by postwar and contemporary art, which contributed £1.7 billion (about $2.6 billion) of the year’s £4.2 billion ($6.4 billion) in public sales.“Contemporary art is what resonates with clients aged 40 to 60,” said Jussi Pylkkänen, who was appointed the global president of Christie’s in December. “There’s been a generational shift in taste.”On Nov. 12, the company’s evening sale of contemporary works in New York grossed $852.9 million – a new high for any art auction, and more than double the $343.6 million taken by its rival Sotheby’s the previous night. The $81.9 million paid for Andy Warhol’s 1963 silkscreen “Triple Elvis (Ferus Type)” at that sale made it the most expensive of 86 works sold for more than $10 million at Christie’s in 2014.“The turnover is impressive,” said Philip Hoffman, chief executive of the London-based Fine Art Fund and a former director at Christie’s. However, he added: “The issue is profitability. Margins are very thin at the top end of the auction market.”Christie’s, which said that its sales of £5.1 billion translated to $8.4 billion under its use of a sales-weighted average exchange rate, is privately owned by the French billionaire François Pinault and only announces sales, with no indication of profit or loss. However, the introduction of a company-wide 2 percent “success fee” to sellers last year and the departure of its chief executive, Steven P. Murphy, on Dec. 2, barely two weeks after the publicly-listed Sotheby’s announced that its chief executive, William F. Ruprecht, would be standing down, were indications of the competitiveness of the sector.Private transactions contributed £916.1 million at Christie’s in 2014, representing 18 percent of the total. Online sales increased 54 percent to £21.4 million, or 0.4 percent of the company’s overall proceeds.Sotheby’s results have yet to be released. A provisional announcement by the New York-based company said it grossed $6 billion in auction sales (which does not include private sales) across all collecting categories in 2014, about $400 million less than Christie’s.
