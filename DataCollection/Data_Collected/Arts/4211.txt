For the final section of a trilogy delving into issues including identity, memory and ancestry, the choreographer Emily Johnson has aimed high in her multiday performance installation “Shore in Lenapehoking (New York City).” Each section — four equal parts — relates to her quest to find connections between live performance and life. An Alaska native of Yupik descent now based in Minneapolis, Ms. Johnson looks at those places where, as she puts it, “we meet and merge.”The experience begins with “Shore: Community Action (Volunteerism),” which takes place in the Rockaways and on Governors Island and focuses on dune and harbor restoration; “Shore: Story,” a reading featuring local authors; and “Shore: Performance,” combining movement, storytelling and live music at New York Live Arts. The installation wraps up with “Shore: Feast,” a pot luck in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, featuring oysters and wild Alaskan salmon cooked on an open fire, as well as storytelling and recipe sharing. They’ll be included in a coming “Shore” zine, Vol. 5. The enterprising Ms. Johnson will send copies to all participants.
