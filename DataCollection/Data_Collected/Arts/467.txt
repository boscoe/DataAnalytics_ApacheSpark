SCHUBERT: Impromptus, D. 935; Piano Pieces, D. 946; Hüttenbrenner Variations, D. 576 
Steven Osborne, piano
(Hyperion) Steven Osborne’s recent recordings for the Hyperion label have been marked by sensitive playing and interpretations that are sensible without ever being merely plain. His Schubert is clean and unfussy, much like that of Paul Lewis, but with a slightly softer grain. Those qualities pay dividends in a thoughtful, alluring account of the D. 935 Impromptus, but slightly veil the turbulent ambiguity of the three Piano Pieces of D. 946. The scarcely heard “Variations on a Theme by Anselm Hüttenbrenner,” though, are a rare joy. (David Allen)Times critics share what they’ve been listening to lately.NIELSEN, SIBELIUS: Violin Concertos, Two Serenades
Baiba Skride, violin; Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra; Santtu-Matias Rouvali, conductor
(Orfeo) The symphonies of Carl Nielsen (1865-1931) are increasingly part of the mainstream international repertory, thanks to important champions like the New York Philharmonic’s Alan Gilbert. In this disc the formidable Latvian violinist Baiba Skride makes a strong case for his violin concerto, which she records alongside the well-loved one by Sibelius and that composer’s two Opus 69 Serenades for violin and orchestra. Don’t look for Scandinavian reticence here: Nielsen’s solo violin, especially, simmers, trembles, pleads and struts above a lushly melodic orchestral score. The Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra plays with character and style under the direction of the young Finnish conductor Santtu-Matias Rouvali. (Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim)
