The Clive Barnes Foundation named Alex Sharp and Russell Janzen  winners of its fifth annual awards for young actors and dancers during a ceremony at Walter Reade Theater on Monday.Mr. Sharp, 25, currently stars in the Broadway play “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” a role he began just four months after graduating from the Juilliard school last May. Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called Mr. Sharp’s performance “the kind of smashing Broadway debut young actors classically dream about.”Mr. Janzen, also 25, has been a member of New York City Ballet since 2008 and was promoted to soloist with the company in October.  “Tall and broad shouldered, Mr. Janzen, with an adult authority beyond his years, deepens the world onstage by the power of his absorption in it,” Alastair Macaulay wrote in The Times.The winners of the award and its $5,000 prize are chosen by a panel of critics and performers. Previous recipients of the award include the actors Jonny Orsini (“The Nance”) and Nina Arianda, who won a Tony Award in 2012 for her performance in “Venus in Fur,” and the dancers Lloyd Mayor of the Martha Graham Company and Isabella Boylston, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theater.The Clive Barnes Foundation was established in 2009 to bestow the award named for Barnes, a dance and theater critic for The Times and The New York Post, who died in 2008.A version of this article appears in print on 01/29/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Clive Barnes Foundation Names Honorees.
