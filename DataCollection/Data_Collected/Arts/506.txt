But those hoping to hear him perform Gershwin with the jazz band Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks during the 92nd Street Y’s opening night on Tuesday were disappointed to learn that he had canceled on Monday. Shuman Associates, his publicist, cited “irreconcilable artistic differences” between Mr. Gerstein and the ensemble, led by the conductor Maurice Peress. Not that there was anything disappointing about the jazz pianist Ted Rosenthal, whom Hanna Arie-Gaifman, director of the Y’s Tisch Center for the Arts, recruited to replace Mr. Gerstein. Mr. Rosenthal has recently performed Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” with this ensemble and seemed unfazed at appearing on such short notice. His playing in that work and Gershwin’s Piano Concerto in F was notable both for its flair and languid, sultry expressive gestures.The program also included Mr. Peress’s arrangements of the Overture to “Strike Up the Band” and Mr. Giordano’s versions of “I’ve Got Rhythm” and “That Certain Feeling.”Mr. Peress, 85, an assistant to Leonard Bernstein in the 1960s, conducted lively if sometimes untidy renditions of Ferde Grofe’s version for jazz band of the “Rhapsody” and a reconstruction of Mr. Grofe’s jazz band version of the Concerto, arrangements that result in a leaner, lighter sound than that of the more often performed scoring for full symphony orchestra. The transparent orchestration also allows the dance rhythms and colorful use of woodwinds (including the heckelphone, the instrument invented for Strauss’s “Salome”) to be heard to particularly vivid effect.­Jennifer Koh and Shai Wosner perform on Monday in “Bridge to Beethoven I”; 1395 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan; 92y­.org.Advertisement
