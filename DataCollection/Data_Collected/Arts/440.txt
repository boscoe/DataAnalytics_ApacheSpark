“Bright Star,” a bluegrass-inflected musical with a score by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, will begin Broadway performances on March 7, 2016, following a previously announced run at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.The show, which premiered in 2014 at The Old Globe theater in San Diego, adds to a robust slate of new musicals vying for attention (and awards) this season, headed by the smash “Hamilton” but also scheduled to include “On Your Feet!,” “Allegiance,” “School of Rock,” “Waitress,” “American Psycho” and “Tuck Everlasting.” Joey Parnes, the lead producer, announced the Broadway plan on Tuesday, but would only specify that the show would play at a Shubert theater. (Translation: It will replace a show that’s currently flagging at the box office but hasn’t set a closing date yet.)Carmen Cusack, who earned sterling notices for the San Diego run, will reprise her role as a North Carolina magazine editor at the center of love stories set in the 1920s and 1940s. Among those joining her in the cast will be Paul Alexander Nolan, A.J. Shively and the Tony nominees Dee Hoty and Stephen Bogardus. The Tony winner Walter Bobbie is the director.“Bright Star” runs at the Kennedy Center from Dec 2 to Jan. 10. Opening night on Broadway is set for March 31.A version of this article appears in print on 10/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Martin-Brickell Musical to Broadway in March.
