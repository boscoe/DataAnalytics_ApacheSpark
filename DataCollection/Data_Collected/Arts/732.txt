CreditJason Henry for The New York Times        Artist-in-residence programs, which number in the hundreds across the United States, have been evolving in ways that benefit not only the participating artists but also more and more visitors.Ranging from a program in the Golden Gate Recreational Area in San Francisco to initiatives at scattered temporary quarters in Lower Manhattan, artist-in-residence programs offer courses for children and adults, studio visits, performances and exhibitions of work by the artists, and even opportunities to dine with them.Caitlin Strokosch, executive director of the Alliance of Artists Communities, an international association that oversees such programs, said that the residency concept, dating to 17th-century Italy, has traditionally been to provide an artist with a dedicated time and space for creating new work. Today the programs are usually meant to foster “open-ended exploration,” she said. “Few tend to be outcome- or production-oriented.”Ms. Strokosch estimated that some 500 artist-in-residence programs are now operating in the United States, and an additional 1,500 abroad. Among the earliest and best-known American programs are Yaddo, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and the MacDowell Colony, in Peterborough, N.H., both founded around the turn of the 20th century.
        A look at the upcoming auction season and the ways museums and galleries are innovating for the future.Other prominent initiatives include the Skowhegan School of Painting & Sculpture, founded in 1946 by three painters and a sculptor as a summer art school in Maine, with administrative offices in Manhattan; the Chinati Foundation, which was founded by the artist Donald Judd and opened its doors in Marfa, Tex., in 1986; the Headlands Center for the Arts, which in the 1980s took over and renovated nine early-20th-century military buildings in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area of the National Park Service; and Ox-Bow, whose program in Saugatuck, Mich., is an outgrowth of a school founded at the turn of the 20th century by artists from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.AdvertisementEstablished in 1973 by David Rockefeller Sr. and other Chase Bank and civic leaders, the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council had its home and artists’ studio space in the north tower of the World Trade Center destroyed in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; one of its artists in residence, the sculptor Michael Richards, was among the thousands who died. The council has since migrated to various spaces across Lower Manhattan, including studios at 28 Liberty, and has expanded to other places in the city, like Governors Island.AdvertisementThe Harlem-based interdisciplinary artist Sanford Biggers, who was an artist in residence at the organization before the Sept. 11 attacks, said that participating in the program “bumped up my level of production” and introduced him to “a great group of curators,” one of whom gave him his first solo show, in Berkeley, Calif.Now an associate professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, he tells his graduate students that artist-in-residence programs provide “a place to work and also a dialogue with other artists in residence.”“It’s important to keep the conversation going,” he continued. The programs also “challenge and push you as an artist,” he said.When the public takes part by visiting, such programs demystify what artists do, Mr. Biggers said. “It opens up the viewership to our work,” he said. “It’s a very different experience to go to a studio than to go to a gallery. The public can definitely learn how artists think.”The activities for the public range widely. Ox-Bow offers art courses affiliated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for amateurs and for students enrolled in academic programs in both the summer and winter. Skowhegan has offered public programs for many years in Manhattan and inaugurated a new program space on West 22nd Street late last year with a performance of John Cage’s “Variations VIII” by two former artists in residence, Ander Mikalson and John Dombroski.Chinati offers a weekend of public programming every October; this year’s featured viewings of its permanent collection, talks, performances and a showcase of work by local artists in Marfa. Chinati also provides tours and course offerings to local students of all ages; for example, ninth graders recently studied Carl Andre’s permanent installation there, while creating their own poems and artwork.The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council encourages the public to visit the studios of its artists in residence, both in Lower Manhattan and on Governors Island; its artists also lead workshops at centers for the elderly throughout New York.Similarly, the goal of public programming at Headlands, according to its executive director, Sharon Maidenberg, is not only to introduce the public to artists and their work, but also “to connect the public to their own creativity.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
