The Frank Sinatra Centennial train rolls along. The New Jersey Performing Arts Center announced its 2015-16 lineup of more than 120 performances Sunday, including several tributes to Sinatra, who was born in New Jersey in 1915. On Sinatra’s birthday, Dec. 12, the singer and pianist Michael Feinstein will perform a tribute with a big band. Additional tributes include “The Real Sinatra Songbook” (Nov. 9) and “Sinatra at the Movies” (May 28). Other musical performances include Dianne Reeves and Sharon Jones (Nov. 14), the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis (Sept. 11), and Jessye Norman with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra (May 21). Choreographer Randy James will present the world premiere of a dance interpretation of C.S. Lewis’s “The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,” to be performed by the 10 Hairy Legs Dance Company, on Jan. 30 and 31. Two ballet troupes from Russia will also be making appearances (“Romeo and Juliet” on Dec. 6 and “Cinderella” on March 10). A handful of comedians will also take the stage, including Jerry Seinfeld (Dec. 4), Paula Poundstone (Dec. 12) and Darrell Hammond (June 27 and 28). More information can be found at njpac.org.
