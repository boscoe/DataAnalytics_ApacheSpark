With 500 acres of verdant exhibition space, Storm King Art Center, in New York’s Hudson Valley,  is uncommonly positioned to execute large-scale earthworks conceived by Dennis Oppenheim but never fully realized in his lifetime.In May, the  sculpture park, in collaboration with the estate of the artist who died in 2011, will present “Dennis Oppenheim: Terrestrial Studio” with some dozen sculptures installed throughout the fields as well as sound pieces, films, smaller sculpture and drawings in the museum building.“Dead Furrow,” his 1967 design of turquoise PVC piping embedded in the ground in a geometric pattern evocative of Mayan ruins and only shown indoors previously, will be recreated at a 48-foot-square scale with a pyramidal tower at the center that visitors can climb to view the expansive manmade and natural landscape. “Entrance to a Garden,” a 16-foot-high sculpture to be sited atop the highest hill, takes the surrealistic form of a man’s dress shirt, with an arched entryway under the tie.Oppenheim designed an accompanying garden as its shadow, with a hedge of low trees recalling the shape of a torso with outstretched arms and concrete benches forming buttons and cuffs, which Storm King is putting together for the first time.“Dennis played with architecture and whimsical forms,” said John Stern, president of Storm King. “His whole career was about getting art out of the galleries.”
