These terms are either mentioned in the gallery release, written by the Spanish artist Javier Peñafiel, or implied by this show of paintings by Jack Davidson, a midcareer Scottish painter based in Barcelona, Spain.As for geometry, most of the canvases in this exhibition are composed within a strict framework: a grid, an X shape or a circle. One painting, “you’ve said something I’ve never forgotten” (2014), even looks like an updated canvas by Kazimir Malevich, who liked to string his slanted rectilinear forms along a diagonal to suggest an airplane or other mechanical objects. And yet, nestled with the geometry, Mr. Davidson has channeled the sunny weirdness of Barcelona’s artistic tradition, famous particularly for the biomorphic shapes of Antoni Gaudí and Joan Miró. The bright, painted forms look like flattened flowers, drying liquid or pieces of translucent paper. Sometimes Mr. Davidson uses gold leaf and arranges the blobby shapes into a lackadaisical display that recalls the collages of Jean Arp, who supposedly used accident and chance to make his compositions (which nonetheless ended up looking rather tidy).In the news-release paean to his friend, Mr. Peñafiel stresses the importance of music for Mr. Davidson, as well as relationships within a flexible social network, manifested here in a bench upholstered with Mr. Davidson’s stitched-together painting rags and made for viewing the art. If nothing else gets you closer to a painter’s process, this will. MARTHA SCHWENDENERAdvertisement
