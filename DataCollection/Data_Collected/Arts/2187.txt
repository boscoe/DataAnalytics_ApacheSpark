Every live theater event convenes an impromptu community in which artist and audience create a shared experience. The choreographer Moriah Evans examines this in much of her work, including “Social Dance 1-8: Index,” a new piece commissioned by the Issue Project Room.Despite outward ease and nonchalance, there’s a formal rigor to Ms. Evans’s movement. She often makes the body do awkward things, but in a way that feels natural and significant. In this work, five dancers embody a distinct physical lexicon and follow complex spatial patterns inspired by the grid-like floor of Issue’s ornate 1926 Brooklyn home. The intimate community that gathers for “Social Dance” — limited to 30 members each performance — will be the last in this space before it begins an 18-month renovation.
