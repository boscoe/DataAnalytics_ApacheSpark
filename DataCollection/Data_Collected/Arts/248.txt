In the comments section of a YouTube video clip from two years ago, a user named powerofalto wrote, “One wonders, at times, whether Silas Riener is, in fact, human.” The video referred to is of a solo that Mr. Riener performed as a member of the final tribe of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. It was a reasonable thing to wonder: The extraordinary focus and physical control Mr. Riener displays in the clip — not to mention his air time — does seem superhuman.In his own work, he has carried over the rigor but stirred in a bit more tenderness and a bit more questioning. Mr. Riener dances as if he’s searching for something. He seems to discover each move for the first time, but also with a sense of having done it before, like in a past life. His new solo show, “Blue Name,” is a compilation of small dances created over 18 months. Thankfully, it’s running for two weeks.
