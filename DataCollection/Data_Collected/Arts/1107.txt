Viewers will soon have to turn elsewhere for snarky snippets from “Party Down South” and “Bad Girls Club.”E! announced on Wednesday that “The Soup,” the weekly Friday night survey of batty reality-show clips and other TV eccentricities, will end on Dec. 18. Joel McHale, who hosted the show for 12 years, “will once again deliver the laughs as he hangs up his signature skinny tie for the last time,” the network said in a release. Throughout its 22 seasons, the show has used caustic mockery to highlight TV’s crasser quarters, allowing viewers to remain vaguely abreast of the goings-on on “The Jersey Shore” or “The Bachelor” without actually having to watch the shows themselves. (Or admit that they do, anyway.)The show debuted in 1991 as “Talk Soup,” so-named because its favorite targets in the early days were trash-talk shows like “The Jerry Springer Show.” Greg Kinnear, the first host, stayed on until 1995 and went on to an acclaimed acting career. Other hosts included John Henson, Hal Sparks and Aisha Tyler, until “Talk Soup” ended in 2002.The show came back as “The Soup” in 2004 with Mr. McHale as host, and it had a new favorite target: the then-blossoming world of reality television. In its later years the show began to welcome actors, comedians and other celebrities for green-screen shenanigans. Mr. McHale stayed on even as the hosting job led to work in film and on television, most notably as the star of the sitcom “Community,” which ran on NBC and Yahoo. In the weeks leading up to the Dec. 18 finale, “The Soup” will look back on some of its most memorable moments, the network said.
