The Victoria and Albert Museum surpassed its goal on Sunday of raising 2.5 million pounds ($3.8 million) to purchase four statues created by the Italian sculptor Benedetto da Rovezzano for the tomb of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, an adviser to Henry VIII and once one of England’s most powerful men. The statues, known as the Wolsey Angels, were commissioned in 1524, just before the cardinal lost his power after failing to convince the pope to annul the king’s marriage. The cardinal appeared in Hilary Mantel’s novel “Wolf Hall.” Ms. Mantel said in a statement that the recovery of the angels “is one of those miracles that historians pray for; something that seems irrevocably lost has been there all the time.” After Wolsey’s death in 1530, Henry VIII acquired the statues for his own tomb, which was never completed. They were eventually sold during the 1640s to raise money during England’s Civil War and were unheard of again until two surfaced at an auction in 1994. The other pair was discovered in 2008 at a country house in Northamptonshire in central England. The majority of the funds for the purchase came from a two-million pound grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, while another 500,000 pounds came from the Art Fund, a charity that helps British museums purchase art. Additional funds came from donations and museum supporters — including 33,000 pounds from on-site donations and one-pound “Save the Wolsey Angels” badges. The statutes are on display at the museum but will be temporarily removed to undergo conservation treatment.A version of this brief appears in print on February 9, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Wolsey Angels’ to Go to the V&A; Museum.
