It’s the most wonderful time of the year — especially if you’re a producer on Broadway, where a handful of shows saw record-setting ticket sales last week.Of the 37 shows now playing on Broadway, 18 grossed over $1 million for the week ending Dec. 27,  including three (“The Lion King,” “Aladdin” and “Wicked”) that grossed over $2 million.“Aladdin” set a new record for the New Amsterdam Theater, pulling in $2,095,364 over eight performances, more than it earned during a nine-performance week this summer.Yet total year-to-year box office receipts were down, according to figures compiled by the Broadway League, as Broadway’s have-nots — including “Dames at Sea” and “Sylvia” — had trouble filling seats in a season when audiences flock to spectacle and the tried-and-true. The last two weeks of the year are typically blockbusters for Broadway, especially for shows that draw tourists. That proved true this year:  the glitzy magic show “The Illusionists” grossed $1,362,681, up $819,500 from the week before, while the long-running “The Phantom of the Opera” raked in $1,458,784, a whopping jump of $860,033.This holiday season has also been lucrative for several Broadway newcomers. The critically acclaimed revival of “Fiddler on the Roof” pulled in $1,339,255 in its first full week of performances after opening. “School of Rock,” Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical adaptation of the 2003 film, grossed $1,506,236, its biggest total yet and up $483,128 from the week before. And the revival of “The Color Purple” pulled in a respectable $1,008,774.A version of this article appears in print on 12/29/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Lucrative Holiday for Broadway Shows.
