For a singer who received a near-coronation — from best new artist to song of the year — Sam Smith played it modest at the 57th annual Grammy Awards, broadcast on Sunday night from the Staples Center in Los Angeles.He shared his performance of his hit “Stay With Me” (song of the year and record of the year) from the album “In the Lonely Hour” (best pop vocal album) with Mary J. Blige, whose voice found the heat in Mr. Smith’s ardent plea to a one-night stand. Mr. Smith dedicated the record of the year award to “the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year. Thank you so much for breaking my heart, ’cause you got me four Grammys.”“Stay With Me” is a song in a reverent, hymnlike mode — one of many near-hymns on the awards show, which packed 23 performances around nine awards presentations; 74 more awards were given before the telecast. The broadcast swerved among the somber, the overblown and the head-scratching. The more inexplicable, the more memorable. Madonna sang her gospel-infused “Living for Love” wearing a one-piece outfit in matador red, surrounded by male dancers wearing silver masks and bulls’ horns.There was Pharrell Williams (best urban contemporary album, best pop solo performance), dressed like a bellhop, starting his hit “Happy” amid a crashing, minor-key orchestral arrangement that sounded like something out of “Carmina Burana,” with a splashy piano interlude from Lang Lang.AdvertisementBut there was a message in the choreography: men wearing hoodies and holding their hands up, recalling the “Hands up, don’t shoot” chant of protests spurred by the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

The country songwriter Eric Church sang his “Hometown,” which bemoans the way corporate development steals small-town character, in front of a video montage of riots. Miranda Lambert (best country album) sang her “Little Red Wagon” in a kind of sci-fi cowgirl outfit, black and silver, with video flames behind her; one line went silent for its four-letter word.Hymnlike songs came from some unlikely candidates. Katy Perry, who recently flaunted her airborne showmanship at the Super Bowl, was swathed in pure white — with the giant silhouette of a dancer behind her — to sing “By the Grace of God,” a post-breakup healing song positioned after a videotaped call from President Obama for an end to domestic violence.AdvertisementAriana Grande, who rose from Broadway to Nickelodeon to her own teeny-pop career, moved her creamy voice into a more grown-up mode for the lovelorn orchestral ballad “Just a Little Bit of Your Heart.” Adam Levine, of Maroon 5, and Gwen Stefani shared an unctuous, overlong version of Maroon 5’s “My Heart Is Open.” In the kind of cross-generational collaboration the Grammys like to feature, Tom Jones and the British pop singer Jessie J belted “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” — a tribute to its songwriters, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, who were given a Trustees Award. Kanye West was in Auto-Tuned devotional mode, singing “Only One,” which imagines a message from the afterlife from his mother.

The Irish songwriter Hozier shared his “Take Me to Church” — a kind of inverse hymn that promises to “worship in the bedroom” — with Annie Lennox, who segued it into a wide-eyed, leather-lunged version of “I Put a Spell on You.”Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, whose album together, “Cheek to Cheek,” was named best traditional pop vocal album,” made a jovial, cross-generational duo. And AC/DC, who opened the show, demonstrated that the basics of their hard rock haven’t changed in decades.But this was a show that put its hymns in the forefront. The finale started with Beyoncé, whose “Drunk in Love” (with her husband, Jay-Z) was named best R&BsSong and best R&B performance. She sang the gospel standard “Precious Lord, Take My Hand.” Men in white suits were arrayed behind her, but there was no gimmick in the performance: just a voice rising with fervor. It was followed by John Legend and Common, backed by orchestra and gospel choir, performing “Glory,” their song for the movie “Selma,” with Common’s rap citing civil-rights causes from Rosa Parks to Ferguson. It was music striving for something more than a hit.A Critic’s Notebook article on Monday about performances at the Grammy Awards ceremony misstated the title of a song performed by Kanye West in some editions. It is “Only One,” not “Chosen One.”A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: An Evening of Hymns and Repeated Praise.
