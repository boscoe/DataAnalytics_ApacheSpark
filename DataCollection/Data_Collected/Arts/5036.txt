Bluewater Productions, which publishes comic book biographies, has come down with 2016 presidential campaign fever. On Wednesday the company will release “Hillary Clinton: The Road to the White House,” written by Michael L. Frizell and illustrated by Joe Paradise. It follows the release of a comic devoted to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and there are plans for comics focusing on Jeb Bush, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.Bluewater’s biography series was announced in 2008 with two books published the following year devoted to Mrs. Clinton and Sarah Palin under the banner “Female Force,” which went on to profile other powerful women. The company also began the biographical lines “Political Power” and “Fame.” “What I love the most about the biographies we do is the diversity of all the subjects,” Darren G. Davis, the president and publisher of Bluewater, said. “I do not want anyone to know who I vote for or who I listen to.” The Hillary Clinton comic is $3.99 and can be ordered on Amazon.com or downloaded on Comixology.
