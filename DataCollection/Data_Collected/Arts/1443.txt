Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz. A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.★ Tim Berne’s Snakeoil (Friday) Mr. Berne, an alto saxophonist and composer of granite conviction, has had a superb recent outlet in Snakeoil, a chamber-improv quartet with the clarinetist Oscar Noriega, the pianist Matt Mitchell and the drummer and vibraphonist Ches Smith. The band seems likely to draw here from its three fine albums on the ECM label — but Mr. Berne likes to spring new music on his audiences, which means all bets are off. At 8:30 p.m., I-Beam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Nate Chinen)George Cables Quartet (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Cables is a judicious and seasoned pianist whose extensive career as a sideman has finally taken a firm back seat to his profile as a composer-bandleader. He has a sparkling new album, “In Good Company,” that features the same partners found here, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. Joining on tenor saxophone is Craig Handy, who should have no problem fitting in. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Gerald Clayton (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Clayton, a pianist of great touch and soulful exposition, appears with two quintets this weekend, as part of the Jazz Gallery’s 20th anniversary celebration. On Friday he works with partners like the saxophonist Godwin Louis and the drummer Rodney Green; on Saturday his cohort includes the singer-songwriters Becca Stevens and Gretchen Parlato and the bassist Alan Hampton (a singer-songwriter himself). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementFourplay: ‘Blue & Silver Holiday Celebration’ (through Sunday) Fourplay, a gleaming standard-bearer for smooth jazz, is celebrating its 25th anniversary with an aptly titled new album, “Silver,” and a related tour. The band still features three of its accomplished charter members — the pianist Bob James, the bassist Nathan East and the drummer Harvey Mason — alongside the well-traveled guitarist Chuck Loeb. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Robert Glasper Trio (Saturday) Mr. Glasper has carved out his niche as a serious jazz musician in breezy dialogue with several strains of pop, and an entertainer whose crowd-pleasing gestures are by no means incompatible with his art. “Covered,” his simmering new album, consists of cleverly retooled pop songs by the likes of Jhené Aiko and Radiohead, performed by his sleek acoustic trio with Vicente Archer on bass and Damion Reid on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Chinen)Allan Harris: Love Came, The Songs of Strayhorn featuring the Eric Reed Trio (Through Sunday) Mr. Harris, a jazz-cabaret singer of smooth but earthy projection, pays tribute here to the peerless composer Billy Strayhorn, with accompaniment worthy of the gesture: a trio led by the astute pianist Eric Reed. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Marquis Hill Quintet (Monday) The trumpeter Marquis Hill, a recent transplant from Chicago, won the 2014 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition, and has been meeting high expectations since. He leads a five-piece band. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)Jon Irabagon Trio (Friday) A smart young saxophonist who has successfully ducked in and out of the mainstream jazz tradition, Jon Irabagon leads a trio with Peter Brendler on bass and Vinnie Sperazza on drums. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com.

At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Owl Trio (Friday) This coolly chamberlike trio — with Lage Lund on guitar, Orlando le Fleming on bass and Will Vinson on saxophones — recently released a self-titled debut album marked by deep intuition and unhurried self-possession. The group plays a concert as part of the Sound It Out series. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)★ Saxophone Summit (through Saturday) The prominent postbop saxophonists David Liebman, Joe Lovano and Greg Osby constitute the front line of this aptly named supergroup. The band’s rhythm section, no less distinguished, consists of the pianist Phil Markowitz, the bassist Cecil McBee and the drummer Billy Hart. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementJohn Scofield and Jon Cleary (Monday) Groove has always been an essential element for the jazz guitarist John Scofield, expressing itself in ways either subtle or obvious. It will be a natural focus in this duo performance with Mr. Cleary, a jazz pianist, rhythm-and-blues singer and adopted son of New Orleans. At 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, bbkingblues.com. (Chinen)★ Wadada Leo Smith/Douglas R.
