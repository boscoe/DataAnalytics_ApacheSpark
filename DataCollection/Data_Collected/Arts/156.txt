Would Darth Vader have seemed nearly as villainous minus his heavy-breathing respirator helmet? Could Princess Leia have captivated millions of fanboys (and Jabba the Hutt) without her metal slave bikini?George Lucas apparently didn’t think so. “Star Wars and the Power of Costume: The Exhibition,” opening Nov. 14 at Discovery Times Square, features more than 70 costumes and dozens of artifacts born in “a galaxy far, far away” — in other words, Mr. Lucas’s mind.  “The detailed precision of a design can be as bold a measure of storytelling as words on a page, leading to truths at the core of a character, situation or shared history,” Mr. Lucas, the franchise’s creator, said in a statement. The costumes and memorabilia span the first six “Star Wars” films as well as “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” opening in theaters Dec. 18. Using short films, sketches, photographs and production notes, 15 galleries chronicle the costumes’ evolution from Mr. Lucas’s initial vision into actual outfits by designers including John Mollo, who won an Oscar for the original “Star Wars.” They also chart the cultural, historical and even mystical sources for the robes of the Jedi masters Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda; the military uniforms of the Imperial Stormtroopers; C-3PO’s gold armor; the lavish royal gowns of Queens Amidala and Jamillia; and even the yak hair and mohair outfit of the Wookiee Chewbacca.Do clothes really make the intergalactic traveler?
