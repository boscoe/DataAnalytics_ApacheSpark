The goal of Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival — to explore how music and the performing arts can illuminate our inner lives — may seem rather nebulous. Still, for several years now the festival’s programs have been imaginative and memorable. Two very different offerings this week look enticing. “Partita 2,” conceived by the Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, begins with the violinist Amandine Beyer playing Bach’s Partita No. 2 for solo violin in near darkness. There then comes an episode of silence and movement with two dancers (Ms. De Keersmaeker and Boris Charmatz) until the three artists join for a final “union of movement, music and light,” to quote the festival’s program notes. (7:30 p.m., Oct. 29-30, Gerald W. Lynch Theater, whitelightfestival.org.)Another highlight should be the performance of Handel’s seldom-heard oratorio “Theodora,” by the conductor William Christie and the acclaimed ensemble Les Arts Florissants. (7 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 31, Alice Tully Hall.) The soloists include the soprano Katherine Watson in the title role and the acclaimed countertenor Philippe Jaroussky.A version of this article appears in print on October 25, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Classical; Inner Worlds Expressed Onstage.
