The art of sleep, New Zealand gang culture and a man who believes he is the key to putting another Clinton in the White House are among the offerings slated for a new theater festival at LaMaMa in March.The New Zealand New Performance Festival will take place March 12 through 29 and feature nine comedy, dance, installation and theater works by eight performance groups, the Playground NZ, the theatrical company that is presenting the festival, said Tuesday.Among the highlights is “On the Conditions and Possibilities of Hillary Clinton Taking Me as her Young Lover,” Geoff Pinfield and Arthur Meek’s play, in which a lecturer (played by Mr. Meek) makes the case that Ms. Clinton not only wants a young lover, but also needs one to win the 2016 presidential election — and that he is the perfect candidate for the position.Other performances include The PlayGround Collective’s production of Eli Kent’s “All Your Wants and Needs Fulfilled Forever,” about a young man who receives a mysterious box after the death of his father; “Break Up (We Need to Talk),” Binge Culture Collective’s six-hour endurance performance; “Chet Baker: Like Someone in Love,” Goldthorpe Creative’s musical exploration of the jazz great’s life; “Sleep/Wake,” an artistic look at the science of sleep from the Playground NZ; and “So-So Gangsta,” James Nokise’s satirical take on New Zealand’s gang culture.More information and a complete lineup are at nznewperformance.com.A version of this article appears in print on 01/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Zealand Festival Coming to La MaMa.
