Riffs on Greek and Egyptian mythology, “algorithmic theater” based on the Beatles’ “Yesterday,” and work from Australia’s independent arts scene will be among the offerings at the 2016 edition of Coil, the boundary-pushing festival of music, dance and performance presented by Performance Space 122.The festival, which runs from Jan. 5 to 17 at venues around the city, will be the last before P.S. 122 returns to its renovated home in a 19th-century school building in the East Village.  Vallejo Gantner, its artistic director, said in a statement that the 15 featured works will challenge “the very concept of boundaries,” including those “between ideologies, life and death, the contemporary and historic, human and machine, light and darkness, audience and performer.”Highlights include “Go Forth,” a performance and photo installation by Kaneza Schaal based on the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and Annie Dorsen’s “Yesterday Tomorrow,” in which humans and computer algorithms work together to gradually break down the Beatles’ “Yesterday” and then reconstruct it as “Tomorrow” from the musical “Annie.” More overtly political offerings include Chris Thorpe and Rachel Chavkin’s “Confirmation,” which draws on interviews with a British right-wing political activist to explore the phenomenon known to psychologists as “confirmation bias.” Dance offerings include Michael Kliën’s “Excavation Site: Martha Graham U.S.A.,” which uses an intergenerational group of performers to explore Graham’s work, and Jillian Peña’s “Panopticon,” described as “a duet that is simultaneously a solo and a work for 100 dancers using mirrors and video to create a kaleidoscopic arena of bodies.” This year’s festival draws on artists from around the world, with particular emphasis on Australian imports, such as Helen Herbertson and Ben Cobham’s “Morphia Series,” a series of visual haikus based on the Greek god Morpheus and performed for an audience of 12, and “Song,” an immersive sound installation by Ranters Theater, a company from Melbourne.A version of this article appears in print on 10/29/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Coil Festival Brings Mythology and Beatles.
