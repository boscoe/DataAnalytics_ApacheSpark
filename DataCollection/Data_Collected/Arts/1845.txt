Brown and Kyle Abraham. On Thursday, start your New Year’s Eve festivities with a tribute to the Ailey muse and former company director Judith Jamison, celebrating her 50th anniversary with the company. The repertory that night includes Ailey’s “Blues Suite,” with live music, Ms. Jamison’s “A Case of You,” the powerful “Cry,” which Ailey created for Ms. Jamison in 1971, and “Revelations” to give you a spiritual nudge into 2016. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Thursday at 7 p.m.; City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, 212-581-1212, alvinailey.org. (Brian Schaefer)★ American Dance Machine for the 21st Century (through Jan. 3) The original American Dance Machine ran from 1976 to 1987 with a mission to preserve, and pass on, great musical-theater choreography. Rebooted in 2012 and returning to the Joyce for its second year, this iteration showcases more than a dozen classic Broadway dances grabbed from “A Chorus Line,” “Pippin,” “West Side Story” and more, reconstructed by veterans of the original shows and set on a fresh crop of current Broadway gypsies. Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m., Sundays at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 3 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Schaefer)★ Company XIV (through Jan. 17) If the traditional “Nutcracker” evokes the transition from childhood to adolescence, then Company XIV’s “Nutcracker Rouge” might be the subsequent crossover into adulthood and the accompanying sexual awakening. The choreographer Austin McCormick combines a strong dose of burlesque, baroque and ballet with glittered pasties and G-strings for a charmingly sensual and playful holiday romp. Tchaikovsky never sounded so scandalous. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 5 p.m., (no performance on New Year’s Day), Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, 800-745-3000, companyxiv.com. (Schaefer)★ New York City Ballet (through Jan. 3) Usually the seasoned principal dancers of City Ballet star in “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker.” For the remainder of the weekend, the company is presenting a blizzard of debuts, casting soloists and members of the corps de ballet in the featured roles of the Sugarplum Fairy and her Cavalier, among others, bringing a fresh spark to familiar characters. See a holiday favorite and discover a rising star. Then for the final week of performances, the veterans return. At various times (no performance on Christmas), David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-496-0600, nycballet.org. (Schaefer)★ Noche Flamenca (through Jan. 23) Traditional Spanish dance and ancient Greek theater are an unlikely but well-suited pair in Noche Flamenca’s sharp production “Antigona,” based on Sophocles’s famous tragedy. The dance lights a fire under the play while discovering in itself a knack for narrative drama. In the title role, the powerhouse Soledad Barrio is both fierce and fragile. The century-old church where the performance takes place is filled with striking sets, darkly amorous music played by a live band and a ferocious Greek chorus of dancers. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with an additional performance at 3 p.m. on Saturday (no performance on Christmas Day), West Park Presbyterian Church, 165 West 86th Street, Manhattan, 866-811-4111, nocheflamenca.com.
