LOS ANGELES — Even the Super Bowl couldn’t crowd out Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper,” which again topped the domestic movie box office, with an estimated $31.9 million in sales during its sixth weekend in theaters and third weekend in wide release. The strong haul — a record for any film during Super Bowl weekend, if the estimates hold — pushed total domestic sales for the reality-based Iraq war story to about $249 million. According to Deadline.com, the film’s weekend performance beats “Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert,” which posted about $31.1 million in sales, a prior record, during the 2008 Super Bowl weekend. The overall box office rose about 20 percent from the same weekend last year, to about $103 million from $86.1 million, the Rentrak reporting service said. “American Sniper” is still climbing in the Top 10 best-sellers among movies released last year; while the numbers and rankings are close, and in flux, it places just behind a handful of fantasy and animated hits led by “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,” which picked up $545,000 in weekend sales, for a domestic total of $335.1 million since its Nov. 21 release by Lionsgate.In its third weekend, “Paddington,” a fuzzy bear adventure released by the Weinstein Company, placed second with an estimated $8.505 million in weekend sales, for a total of $50.5 million to date. That may have edged aside Paramount’s “Project Almanac,” a newly released time-travel tale that posted $8.5 million in sales — but only if the closely matched estimates hold up when actual Sunday sales are finally counted.Another new release, “Black or White,” from Relativity Media, ranked fourth with $6.5 million in sales; it was a modest opening for a film that was directed by Mike Binder and starred both Kevin Costner and Octavia Spencer, in a story of racial conflict and conciliation. In its second weekend, “The Boy Next Door,” a steamy thriller from Universal Pictures, with Jennifer Lopez in a leading role, placed fifth, with about $6.1 million in sales, for a total of $24.7 million since opening.
