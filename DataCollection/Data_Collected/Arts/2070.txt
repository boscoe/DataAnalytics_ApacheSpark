The Broadway musical “If/Then,” a star vehicle for the Tony Award winner Idina Menzel that portrays the implications of career and romantic choices on a modern-day New Yorker, will close on March 22 at the conclusion of Ms. Menzel’s run in the show, the producers announced on Friday. The musical opened in March to mixed reviews but had strong ticket sales through the spring and summer, in part thanks to Ms. Menzel’s popularity from her hit song “Let It Go” in the movie “Frozen” and from her past Broadway outings (“Wicked,” “Rent”). “If/Then” also stood out as the only Broadway musical last spring with an original score and story; the music is by Tom Kitt and the lyrics and book  by Brian Yorkey, the Tony-winning creators of the Broadway hit “Next to Normal.” “If/Then” ended up nominated for only two Tonys, for best score and best actress for Ms. Menzel. The show proved to be neither a durable hit from the 2013-14 season – like “Aladdin” and “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” – nor a flop like “Rocky” and “Bullets Over Broadway.” The musical will partially recoup its $10 million capitalization.
