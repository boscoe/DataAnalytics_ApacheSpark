Wavves“V”(Ghost Ramp/Warner Bros.)“Sorry if I woke you up this morning, it was early/The sun was coming up and I’ve been drinking too much/Drinking too much.” That’s how Nathan Williams, frontman and id for the Los Angeles punk outfit Wavves, opens “Way Too Much,” the second song from “V,” the band’s fifth album.But like anybody who has had to apologize one too many times for misbehavior, he doesn’t quite mean it, or can’t. “V” is a peppy album about the tragic pleasures of wallowing in poor choices. Throughout, Mr. Williams paints himself as unreliable and unpleasant, but he sounds positively thrilled about it, as if nothing could be more fun. On “All the Same,” he details a sentiment that spills throughout this album: “I lost my mind today standing in the rain/I’m more insane each day, but I’ll be O.K.”The balance of good cheer and dark clouds is partly in the arrangements — “V” comprises exceedingly bright songs verging on true pop-punk. It’s probably the cleanest-sounding Wavves album to date, thanks to the bassist Stephen Pope, the guitarist Alex Gates and the drummer Brian Hill, who have refined their punk chug without succumbing to the usual abrasion. On “My Head Hurts,” they revive some of the garage-rock swing that was a linchpin in early Wavves music.Mr. Williams’s shrugging sneer, too, is insouciant without collapsing into brattiness, maybe because most of his problems seem to come from being rejected: “I’ll do anything you want me to dooooooo/I’m getting off because I’m being used by yoooooou,” he trills on “Heart Attack,” and it’s hard not to sympathize.A version of this review appears in print on October 1, 2015, on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Review: Wavves Celebrates the Joys of Bad Decisions on ‘V’.
