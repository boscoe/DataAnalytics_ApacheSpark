As a child growing up in Taiwan, Huang Yi both longed for and identified with robots. To meet his parents’ high expectations, he says, he found himself adopting the obedient, emotionless characteristics of a machine. He was also lonely and sought the companionship of something selfless and reliable. These strong emotional currents flow through “Huang Yi & KUKA,” presented by 3-Legged Dog, making it more than just an amusing exercise in blending dance and technology.In the way that Wall-E represented both nostalgia and hope, KUKA, the industrial robot at the center of this work, seems to embody innocence and isolation. Mr. Huang, who created the sleek choreography as well as the computer program that gives KUKA life, manages to depict a relationship that is both moving and chilling. The wonder is how much of ourselves we project onto metal.
