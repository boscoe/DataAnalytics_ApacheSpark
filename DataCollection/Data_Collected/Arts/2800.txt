America’s favorite female superhero has a new medal to pin on her Stars-and-Stripes bustier, thanks to the New-York Historical Society, which has awarded its annual American History Book Prize to Jill Lepore’s best-selling “The Secret History of Wonder Woman.”The book, which traces the character’s roots back to the ideas of the pioneering birth-control activist Margaret Sanger (followed by a detour through the huckster, researcher and bondage enthusiast William Moulton Marston), was chosen from a field of 132 submissions, many no doubt heavier on different kinds of uniforms. “The book pushes forward the frontiers of knowledge around the story of women’s rights as it retrieves crucial but forgotten history,” Louise Mirrer, the society’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. Ms. Lepore, a professor at Harvard, noted that “this was an incredibly fun book to write.”The prize, whose other recent winners include Doris Kearns Goodwin, Drew Gilpin Faust and Gordon S. Wood, will be presented at a black-tie dinner on April 17, during the society’s Weekend With History event. It comes with the title American Historian Laureate and an engraved medal, which might complement some of the Wonder Woman-related memorabilia Ms. Lepore encountered during the course of her research.“Favorite object encountered?” she wrote in an email. “A lock of William Moulton Marston’s hair, clipped by his mother in 1894, wrapped in tissue, and labelled ‘Baby’s First Hair Cut.’ Second favorite? A women’s health center newsletter from 1973 featuring Wonder Woman wielding a speculum on the cover and, inside, instructions on how to conduct a vaginal self-exam.” A version of this article appears in print on 02/18/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Wonder Womanu2019 Book Wins History Prize.
