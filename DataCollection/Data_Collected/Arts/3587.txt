Sony Pictures Entertainment on Sunday said that it had closed a deal to bring “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” to the big screen.Sony’s decision to bring “Beautiful” to multiplexes is not entirely unexpected. The studio’s corporate sibling, Sony/ATV owns most of the music rights, and “Beautiful” has been a breakout success on Broadway. Featured songs include “The Locomotion,” “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman” and “So Far Away.”But musicals — even ones based on stage smash hits — are among Hollywood’s riskiest propositions. Disney’s “Into the Woods” succeeded in finding an audience last year, but recent adaptations of “Jersey Boys” and “Rock of Ages” have fallen flat. Sony was pleased with the performance of “Annie,” released last Christmas, but box-office analysts were unimpressed.The film version of “Beautiful” will be produced by Tom Hanks; Gary Goetzman, a producer whose movie credits include “Mamma Mia!” in 2008; and Paul Blake, the lead producer of “Beautiful” on Broadway. Douglas McGrath, who wrote the book for the stage production, will work on the screenplay.No casting decisions were announced. “Beautiful” is now in its second year on Broadway. A London production opened last month, and a North American touring production is slated to begin in the fall.“Audiences both on Broadway and in the West End have responded to ‘Beautiful’ not only to relive Carole King’s timeless classics, but to experience the ways they illustrate her triumphant and joyful life story,” Michael De Luca, a senior Sony movie executive, said in a statement.A version of this article appears in print on 03/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Carole King Musical Coming to the Screen.
