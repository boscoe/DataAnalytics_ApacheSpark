Last week’s winter storm in the Northeast did only minimal damage to ticket sales for Broadway shows, according to box-office data released on Monday. Broadway musicals and plays grossed $17.5 million for a total of 25 productions, compared to $16.7 million for 26 productions for the same week in January 2014. Attendance was 177,158 last week, compared to 183,092 a year ago. Shows benefited from the snow coming during a traditionally slow-selling week and on a night – Monday – when few performances are held anyway; and snowfall was below projections in New York City, leading most shows to resume performances on Tuesday.Among the hardest-hit shows were “The Lion King,” “The Phantom of the Opera,” “Mamma Mia!” and “Aladdin,” which each had a performance canceled on Monday or Tuesday. All four musicals are sturdy box-office successes, however, making one-week dips fairly negligible.Over all ticket sales last week were especially soft for the new musical “Honeymoon in Vegas,” which grossed $369,342 (or 32 percent of the maximum possible amount for its theater), and the musical revival of “On the Town,” which grossed $491,489 (or 27 percent of the maximum amount). “Honeymoon” opened to relatively strong reviews last month but has struggled to find an audience. “On the Town” opened to raves in the fall but has been losing money recently because it costs about $675,000 to run each week; the producers are discounting tickets heavily given that there are so many to  sell for the musical’s cavernous 1,874-seat theater.
