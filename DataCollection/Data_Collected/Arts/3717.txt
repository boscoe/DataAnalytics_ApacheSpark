Aptly called “Unidentified Suspended Objects” (USOs), they consist of flat, geometric wooden elements assembled into angular, planar volumes with their outer surfaces clad in all kinds of inexpensive materials, including rubber, fake fur, leather and colored plastics. He painted their interiors, visible through skewed openings, with fluorescent colors so that they seemed to glow from within. This exhibition presents eight pieces. They hover close to the ceiling like a flock of strange birds or stylish drones.These works have two distinct and contradictory aspects. Neatly made with tight joints and sharp edges, the basic wooden structures evoke early 20th-century play with purely abstract forms that you see in Cubism and Russian Suprematism. Suspension in midair suggests a desire to escape the gravity of ordinary reality toward some as-yet-unknown transcendental realm. On the other hand, with their snazzy, cheap surface treatments applied without fussy craft and redolent of the punk and New Wave trends of the 1970s, they project attitudes of skeptical irreverence about art’s utopian claims. Three-and-a-half decades after they were made, Mr. Keister’s works still hit the sweet spot for an art culture divided between faith in putatively eternal aesthetic and spiritual values and allegiance to the hodgepodge of the material world.Mitchell Algus 132 Delancey Street, Lower East Side Through April 19 Advertisement
