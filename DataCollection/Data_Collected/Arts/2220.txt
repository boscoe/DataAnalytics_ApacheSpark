It’s too soon to say if the new Broadway musical “Honeymoon in Vegas” will be able to capitalize on its mostly positive reviews last Thursday and turn around its lackluster ticket sales during recent weeks of preview performances. But ticket sales did almost triple last weekend, a spokesman for the producers said on Tuesday, though the producers declined to provide dollar amounts that would put that box-office jump in context. Meanwhile, according to ticket-sale data released on Tuesday, “Honeymoon in Vegas” – a musical adaptation of the 1992 film comedy of the same name – grossed a modest $440,476 last week, or 43 percent of the maximum possible amount.Two other musicals concluded their Broadway runs last week with relatively strong sales. “Motown the Musical” grossed $1,299,340, or 81 percent of the maximum amount, and “Rock of Ages” grossed $492,533, or 87 percent of the maximum. The producers of “Motown” intend to bring the show back to Broadway in summer 2016.Over all Broadway musicals and plays grossed $24.4 million last week for a total of 29 productions, compared to $20.1 million for 26 shows during the comparable week in January 2014. Attendance was 236,545 last week compared to 196,042 a year ago.
