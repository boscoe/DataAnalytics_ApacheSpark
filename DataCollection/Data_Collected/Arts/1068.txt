Svetlana Alexievich, the Belarussian journalist and winner of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature, is about to expand her reach in the English-reading world.Random House announced on Monday that it would publish English translations of three works by Ms. Alexievich in the coming years. All three books are oral histories compiled from extensive interviews.“Second-Hand Time” will be published next summer. Originally published in 2013, it describes the decline of Soviet culture through hundreds of interviews with Russians who lived through the fall of the Soviet Union.In 2017, Random House will publish translations of “War’s Unwomanly Face” and “Last Witnesses.” “War’s Unwomanly Face” was Ms. Alexievich’s first book (1988), and it is composed of the words of women who took part in World War II. “Last Witnesses” describes that war from the perspective of people who were children at the time.Ms. Alexievich’s most well-known work already available in English is “Voices From Chernobyl,” a compilation of interviews with survivors of the nuclear reactor accident. That book, published in 2005, won the National Book Critics Circle Award.A version of this article appears in print on 11/18/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nobel Winneru2019s Books to Appear in English.
