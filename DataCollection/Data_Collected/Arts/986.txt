On Friday, just as the fall auction season was drawing to a close, Sotheby’s offered its employees voluntary buyouts to cut costs.“I certainly understand that announcing a cost reduction program right after two weeks of dazzling sales may be unexpected,” Tad Smith, the chief executive of Sotheby’s, said in a memo emailed to its staff on Friday that was obtained by Bloomberg News.The auction house’s stock price has been steadily declining over the last six months. On Monday the company released its third-quarter results, showing that commissions from Sotheby’s auction sales during the period were $56 million, a decrease of 12 percent from the same period in 2014.Concerns have also been raised about the $515 million that Sotheby’s guaranteed to the family of A. Alfred Taubman, its former chairman, to secure his collection for the most recent sale cycle. With more than $1 billion in auction sales this fall, Sotheby’s has said it is on track to break even on that commitment. Mr. Smith said in the email that the assessment made over the summer concluded that “Sotheby’s is not as efficient a company as it could be” and “that our company would benefit from a lower and more flexible cost structure.”He added that management wanted to begin downsizing by giving “colleagues an attractive economic opportunity to volunteer to resign, should they wish to do so.”Should the buyouts fail to achieve the necessary cost reductions, Mr. Smith said, Sotheby’s may turn to layoffs.
