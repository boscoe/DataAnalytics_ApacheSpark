Never underestimate what Disney can do with a princess. “Cinderella,” a live-action retelling of the classic fairytale with Lily James in the title role, took in $70.05 million at North American theaters over the weekend, a result on par with the initial sum generated by Disney’s smash hit “Maleficent” last year. “Cinderella” sold an additional $62.4 million in tickets in initial overseas release, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. A relatively old-fashioned PG-rated movie that relies heavily on sumptuous costumes and sets, “Cinderella” received mostly positive reviews from critics and an A grade from moviegoers in CinemaScore exit polls. It cost Disney roughly $95 million to make and was most popular, as expected, with children: 43 percent of the domestic audience was under the age of 16. About 66 percent of the opening-weekend turnout was female. Walt Disney Studios, which has been on a roll under the leadership of Alan F. Horn, paired “Cinderella” with an animated “Frozen”-related short, a clever move that bolstered interest, analysts said. The weekend’s only other new wide-release movie, “Run All Night,” arrived to a disappointing $11.02 million in ticket sales, continuing the recent uneven performance of Warner Bros. releases at the box office. An R-rated crime movie anchored by Liam Neeson, “Run All Night” cost Warner an estimated $50 million to make. Of note in extremely limited initial release: “It Follows” (Radius-TWC), one of the rare horror films to receive rapturous reviews, took in a sturdy $163,453 from just four screens.A version of this article appears in print on 03/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Cinderellau2019 Is the Belle of the Weekend Box Office.
