The coming season of Miller Theater at Columbia University will showcase the present with its Composer Portraits series focusing on contemporary music, the past with early-music concerts and the future with a new holiday program aimed at children and families that it hopes to make an annual tradition.Seven composers will be featured in next season’s Composer Portraits concerts: Ashley Fure, Alex Mincek, Iancu Dumitrescu, Hans Abrahamsen, Hannah Lash, Francesca Verunelli and Michael Gordon. The early-music series will feature performances by the Tallis Scholars, Orlando Consort, Le Poème Harmonique, New York Polyphony and Vox Luminis.And in December, for the holidays, the theater will offer a pair of family-friendly performances of Saint-Saëns’ “The Carnival of the Animals,” featuring poetry by Ogden Nash, in a staging that it describes as a “modern twist on Victorian toy theater.” The season will open Sept. 17 with “Run Time Error,” featuring the JACK Quartet and Simon Steen-Andersen. As previously announced, there will be a three-night tribute to the composer John Luther Adams, featuring several large-scale works never played in New York. And the cellist Matt Haimovitz will perform the complete Bach cello suites, alongside new works that he commissioned, in pop-up style concerts all over the Columbia campus and in two concerts at the theater in October.A version of this article appears in print on 05/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Miller Theater to Eye Present, Past and Future.
