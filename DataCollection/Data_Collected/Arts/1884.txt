True, there are wonderful exhibitions all over town continuing into January, but finding new ones is as tough as finding a taxi on New Year’s Eve.With that — and the coming of 2016 — in mind, here’s an alternative (or better, an addition) to gallery going: a conversation between James E. Hansen, the renowned scientist whose testimony before congressional committees on climate change in 1988 sounded the alarm bell, and Peter Sarsgaard, the actor and activist.The event, on Wednesday night, Dec. 30, is part of a lecture series at the Rubin Museum of Art in Chelsea exploring the idea of karma. It previously featured speakers like the writer and actor Mike Daisey, the film director Jonathan Demme, the writer and visual artist Gary Indiana and the multimedia artist Tracey Emin.Dr. Hansen will speak about the results of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris and discuss what the future might hold for the planet.
