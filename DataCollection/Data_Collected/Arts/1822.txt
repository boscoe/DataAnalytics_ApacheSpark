Celebrations for the centennial of Arthur Miller’s birth are not over yet.Commemorative events around the country have hovered around the playwright’s birthday, Oct. 17. On Jan. 25, however, the Arthur Miller Foundation will present “One Night 100 Years,” a showcase of performances and readings from A-list stars of Hollywood and Broadway.The event — at the Lyceum Theater on Broadway, where the revival of Miller’s “A View From the Bridge” is playing — will include excerpts from the playwright’s autobiography and unpublished works, as well as scenes from plays like “Death of a Salesman,” “The Price” and “All My Sons.”So far, the cast includes Alec Baldwin, who starred in a production of “All My Sons” in the Hamptons this summer, as well as Greta Gerwig, Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Ellen Barkin, Laurence Fishburne and LaTanya Richardson Jackson. Also among the performers are the playwrights Tony Kushner, Sam Shepard, Ayad Akhtar and Katori Hall.Gregory Mosher — who directed the Tony-nominated revival of “A View From the Bridge” in 2010 — will direct this performance. Proceeds from ticket sales will go to the Arthur Miller Foundation for Theater and Film Education, which provides support for public schools.Tickets for the performance range from $71 to $252; premium packages, which include a reception with the performers, start at $1,500 per ticket.
