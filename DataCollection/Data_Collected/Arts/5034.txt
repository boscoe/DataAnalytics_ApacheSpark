National Gallery employees in London began a new wave of strikes on Tuesday at one of London’s most-visited museums to protest ongoing measures to privatize some staff positions.The strike is expected to last 10 days, until June 4, and gallery officials said in a statement that it could limit access to some of the gallery’s works, scheduled educational events and school visits. However, they said the gallery’s popular “Inventing Impressionism” exhibition will not be affected during its run through SundaySome 200 employees are participating in the strike, according to the Public and Commercial Services union, which represents workers who guard paintings, give information to the public and field complaints. The gallery, which has had its annual state funding decline by more than 15 percent over the last five years to about $40 million, has seen ongoing strikes by workers since February.Their ire is aimed at the gallery’s modernization program, a strategy to attract a broader and younger audience by adding more nighttime and public events that would affect employees’ hours. “This privatization plan risks the worldwide reputation of one of our country’s greater institutions,” Mark Serwotka, the union’s general secretary, said in a statement.Union representatives accuse the museum’s management of trying to cope with funding cuts by shifting jobs to the private sector, including to a security agency. They have organized an online petition in support of gallery employees that has collected almost 45,000 signatures, and on Saturday the union plans to stage a rally outside the museum at Trafalgar Square.Representatives have also been pressing for a change in strategy with the arrival of a new director to replace the current one, Nicholas Penny, who presided over the modernization program. In mid-August, Gabriele Finaldi, who is the deputy director for collections and research at the Prado in Madrid, is to take over the gallery’s leadership.
