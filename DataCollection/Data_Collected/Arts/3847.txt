The galleries are immense, the Renzo Piano design is arresting and the views of the Hudson River are expansive. As it prepares to open its new $422 million Lower Manhattan home on May 1, the Whitney Museum of American Art is pulsing with anticipation as it plans the inaugural events, including a neighborhood block party.But behind the scenes the museum is also preparing for the challenge of paying to operate a building that is three times as large as the old one.Museum officials project a close to 50 percent increase in the operating budget — to $49 million a year up from $33 million — for the new building, as compared to its former home on the Upper East Side.In a financial filing and interviews, museum officials expressed confidence they would be able to cover that gap with a plan that included an enhanced endowment, a jump in memberships and an increased number of visitors, driven in part by the museum’s location at the southern end of the heavily trafficked High Line.AdvertisementOn Thursday, the Whitney also plans to announce that it’s raising its admission price to $22 from $20, with advance tickets to go on sale Friday.AdvertisementThe High Line drew about six million visitors last year, and Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney’s director, said the museum expected that a good portion of those touring that landscaped elevated park would visit, in addition to its own audience.As to whether the admission fee will be a hurdle to attracting more visitors — the High Line is free — the Whitney has thought this through, Mr. Weinberg said, and hopes to draw people to the building with a free lobby gallery and an outdoor loggia that he refers to as a “public zone.”“Of course we’ve made estimates about how many people are going to come, of course we’ve projected increases,” said Mr. Weinberg, who declined to provide estimates. “But it really is anybody’s guess to a degree.”The Whitney’s move is part of a building boom among cultural institutions sometimes referred to as the Bilbao Effect, after the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim satellite that transformed an obscure Spanish town into a tourist destination. Such projects, though, have met with mixed results.

Lee/The New York Times        “It’s very expensive to run a bigger space,” said Tom Finkelpearl, New York’s commissioner of Cultural Affairs, who oversaw a renovation of the Queens Museum while its director.The Whitney’s staff, for example, will soon grow to 300 from 225 and the museum will expand operations to six days a week, from five.But over breakfast at the Standard Grill on Washington Street — which has replaced his former spot, Three Guys diner on Madison Avenue — Mr. Weinberg said his team was prepared for the potential hurdles ahead.Advertisement“The idea is to have as much of a plan as you possibly can,” he said. “I feel totally confident that we have a sustainable building and program.”A key part of that preparation has been building the endowment to more than $275 million from $53 million when Mr. Weinberg started as director in 2003, an increase meant to provide enhanced investment earnings to support yearly operations.The Art Institute of Chicago has made a similar use of its endowment to offset higher operating costs. When it built its modern wing in 2009 — also designed by Mr. Piano — at a cost of $400 million, 25 percent of the money it raised went toward the endowment. This “has taken the pressure off fund-raising because it covers the expenses for the modern wing,” said Douglas Druick, the institute’s director.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Hurst, the Whitney’s chairman with Brooke Garber Neidich, said he expected annual attendance, which averaged 350,000 in the museum’s old Marcel Breuer building, to triple at the outset — known in museum parlance as “the surge” — “and then settle.”Libby Ellis, a principal at AEA, a cultural consulting firm, said the Whitney has always lagged its peers in admissions. “You’re looking at a huge potential to grow attendance,” she said.Donna De Salvo, the chief curator and deputy director for programs at the Whitney Museum of American Art, speaks to the direction the collection has taken over since its beginning in 1930.In addition to novelty, the Whitney has other factors in its favor, namely the explosive growth in residential and commercial construction in the surrounding meatpacking district and the spillover from the High Line, which ends at the Whitney’s door on Gansevoort Street.Is the museum worried about tying its fortunes too closely to the High Line, whose number of visitors, while huge, is greatly affected by the seasons?Advertisement“There will be spikes because of the High Line, no question,” Mr. Weinberg said. But, he added, “We’re the major cultural facility down in this area and it’s a real magnet.”Mr. Weinberg said he was convinced the higher admission charge would not discourage visitors. There was some debate internally, he said, about raising the price to $25, the cost at the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art. But he argued for $22, partly in recognition of the public spirit that fueled the city’s $57 million contribution to the project. (The Whitney went to $20 from $18 in 2013).“I don’t know what the future holds, but I do know this: We’ve been closed for six months and we want to be as open and as generous as we possibly can,” Mr. Weinberg said.The museum will also have longer hours, remaining open until 10 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights through Sept. 27 for its inaugural exhibition, “America Is Hard to See,” and regularly staying open on Fridays for pay-what-you-wish hours from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.Still uncertain is what will happen to the Breuer building after its lease to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ends, possibly as early as 2023. The Whitney had promised its leading donor, Leonard Lauder, that it would not sell the building for the foreseeable future. The cost for the Whitney to operate both buildings would be high, especially since there is room to expand at its new location.Mr. Weinberg said all possibilities are on the table; the Whitney could decide to operate both buildings, to give up the Breuer, even to share the Breuer with the Met. Officials declined to discuss how a sale of the building is possible given the commitment it made to Mr. Lauder.Ms. Garber Neidich, the other Whitney chairwoman, said she was not worried that fans of the Breuer building or Upper East Siders will abandon the museum because it moved. “I raised my children at the Whitney, I felt really connected to the Breuer building,” said Ms. Garber Neidich, who recently moved downtown.But the new building “takes your breath away,” she said. “I don’t think anyone’s going to walk through and say, ‘I miss the old Whitney.’ ”Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the new home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, which is to open May 1 at the southern end of the High Line, from which the museum expects to attract visitors, included an outdated number of visitors to the park. The High Line drew about six million visitors last year; it is no longer the case that is has “nearly five million” a year.A version of this article appears in print on April 2, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Museum Contemplates the Cost of a Bigger Future.
