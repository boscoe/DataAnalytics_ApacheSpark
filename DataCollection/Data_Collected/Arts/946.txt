LONDON — A poem written by Percy Bysshe Shelley during his first year as an Oxford student has been acquired by the Bodleian Libraries there and placed on public display.The poem was published in 1811 in a pamphlet titled “Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things,” and the pamphlet became the 12 millionth book to join the Bodleian collection, the libraries said.The Bodleian version is the only known existing copy of the text. It was acquired by the libraries this year and published online on Tuesday. The pamphlet is on view in an exhibition at the Weston Library in Oxford through Dec. 23.Vanessa Redgrave read an extract from the “Poetical Essay” on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday morning. A recording of the reading is available on Radio 4’s website.Shelley published his “Poetical Essay” anonymously, using the name “a gentleman of the University of Oxford.” It was first attributed to him around 60 years later, when a biographer pieced together evidence that he wrote it. The attribution has since become broadly accepted, a spokeswoman for the libraries said in an email.The poem was written as a manifesto in support of the Irish journalist Peter Finnerty, who was jailed for his reporting. The preface to the poem describes it as “subversive to the existing interests of Government.” (Shelley was expelled from Oxford in 1811, after he published a work on atheism.)The pamphlet first came to public attention in 2006, when a London-based antique bookseller acquired it from a private collection. The libraries bought it with the help of a private donor; the spokeswoman declined to say how much they had paid to acquire it or to identify the private donor who financed the purchase.
