Following in the footsteps of Netflix, the streaming video site that has released entire seasons of its TV shows all at once, NBC announced Wednesday that it would make all 13 episodes of its summer series “Aquarius” available to watch on NBC.com and other on-demand platforms. They will be available to stream for four weeks following the show’s two-hour premiere on May 28. Despite the binge option, NBC will still air a new episode of “Aquarius,” which stars David Duchovny as a detective in 1967 Los Angeles on the trail of the charismatic Charles Manson, every Thursday at 9 p.m.“With ‘Aquarius’ we have the opportunity to push some new boundaries, to give our audience something no broadcast network has done before,” said Bob Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC’s entertainment division, in an announcement. “We are fully aware how audiences want to consume multiple episodes of new television series faster and at their own discretion, and we’re excited to offer our viewers this same experience since all 13 episodes of this unique show have been produced and are ready to be seen.”A version of this article appears in print on 05/01/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: NBC, With ‘Aquarius,’ Joins the Stream.
