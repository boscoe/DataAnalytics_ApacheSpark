His demands: to be made a name partner alongside Jessica Pearson and Harvey Specter — or he’ll tell the world that Mike Ross is a fraud. “Suits” has long been an underrated guilty pleasure, set in an aspirational fantasyland whose impeccably turned-out inhabitants lob zingers at one another’s tender spots with the kind of aplomb you only wish you could muster at the office. Rick Hoffman, magnificent in full-on angry-rodent mode as the newly enlightened — and enraged — Louis, lets it rip as Season 4 resumes Wednesday night on the USA Network. And with Gabriel Macht, the show’s Harvey, pulling the strings in his directorial debut, the barbs hit their mark with the intensity of quarrels from a crossbow. Meanwhile, Patrick J. Adams, the actor behind Mike and a serious photographer, is exhibiting images taken on the set at 402 West 13th Street in Manhattan through Sunday on behalf of Pablove Shutterbugs, which helps children with cancer express themselves through photography.Advertisement
