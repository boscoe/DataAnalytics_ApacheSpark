The Spanish-language variety show “Sábado Gigante” is ending its run in September after more than 53 years on the air, Univision Networks announced Friday.“Sábado Gigante,” or “Giant Saturday,” is hosted by Mario Kreutzberger, who also created it and is known on the show as Don Francisco. The three-hour weekly program features a mix of games, celebrity interviews, music and comedy. It is Univision’s longest-running program, as well as the longest-running variety series in TV history.Ratings for “Sábado Gigante” have been steady in recent years and it is the top-rated show among Hispanics in the United States on Saturday nights. The program drew 2.1 million viewers last week, according to Nielsen. Its final show is planned for Sept. 19.Mr. Kreutzberger started the series in 1962 on Chile’s Channel 13 and brought it to the United States in 1986. He is expected to continue to contribute to Univision with new projects, hosting entertainment specials and scouting new on-air talent.“When we began in the United States in 1986, we told them that we were ‘separated by distance and united by the same language,’” Mr. Kreutzberger said in a statement. “Today I can say with great pride and satisfaction that that distance turned into closeness and affection.”Randy Falco, the chief executive of Univision Communications, said Mr. Kreutzberger’s knowledge of the industry and commitment to innovation would help the network to define the future of media. “During my 40 years in the industry,” he said in a statement, “ I have met few people with the same energy, creativity and passion for television and the audience as Mario.”A version of this article appears in print on April 18, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Univision’s ‘Sábado Gigante’ to End.
