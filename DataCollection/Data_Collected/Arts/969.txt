A decade after her last album, Missy Elliott released a music video for her new single, “WTF (Where They From)” on Thursday morning. Within minutes of posting the song on Twitter, the rapper, 44, was the subject of breathless reaction from nostalgic fans. Ms. Elliott grew famous for frank (but playful) lyrics layered over contagious, thumping bass beats and quirky audible ephemera, a sound that stays largely intact on “WTF.” She has made guest appearances on tracks from Janet Jackson, Ciara and Pitbull in recent years. “WTF” is the first song in years where Ms. Elliott takes the lead. The music video features Pharrell Williams and showcases several of Ms. Elliott’s trademarks, including audible nods to her past songs for the nostalgia crowd: “Pop that, pop that,” she raps at one point, a wink to one of her most popular tracks, “Pass That Dutch.” The video looks just like Ms. Elliott has always sounded: Quirky, playful and futuristic.Except now it’s 2015, and we have hoverboards.
