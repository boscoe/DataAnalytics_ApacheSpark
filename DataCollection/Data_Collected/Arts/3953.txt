The Festival d’été de Québec, an 11-day citywide event, will run from July 9 to 19 and feature performances by Foo Fighters, Keith Urban, Iggy Azalea and the Rolling Stones — on the final date of the Stones’ summer tour —  organizers announced on Wednesday. Those headliners, and more, are scheduled to appear on the main stage at the Plains of Abraham, a battlefield turned public park that is one of 10 of the festival’s venues. Things begin with Jack U, the D.J. duo Skrillex and Diplo, on July 9, followed by Mr. Urban (July 10), Foo Fighters (July 11), Ms. Azalea (July 12), the Doobie Brothers (July 13), Patrick Bruel (July 14) and the Rolling Stones (July 15). The full lineup is available at  infofestival.com.In addition to the diverse bill of artists — smaller acts include the Coathangers, Run the Jewels and Future Islands —  the Festival d’été de Québec boasts one of the lower price tags on the summer festival circuit: Early buyers can score a festival pass, which gives access to some 300 events over the 11 days, for 78 Canadian dollars (about $62) starting on Thursday at noon Eastern time. Full-price passes are not much more, at 88 Canadian dollars (about $70), and go on sale on Saturday.
