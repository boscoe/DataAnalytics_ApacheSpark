Album release dates might add an asterisk: *if there is no leak. An unauthorized online leak on Monday of the rapper ASAP Rocky’s new full-length “At.Long.Last.ASAP.” led his label, RCA Records, to put the album on sale a week early, an increasingly common tactic in the digital download era. Rocky announced the change of plans Monday night on Twitter, just hours after the album appeared on file-sharing sites and blogs: OFFICIAL ALBUM RELASE IN STORES AND ONLINE @ MIDNIGHT TONIGHT , THANX FOR LISTENING , HOPE YALH ENJOYED . BLESS …. A$VP X LIFE X RIP YAMS— LORD FLACKO JODYE II (@asvpxrocky) May 26, 2015In a statement on Tuesday, RCA said, “Due to the Memorial Day holiday, we shipped physical product early to the stores to ensure we were prepared for the June 2 release date. In light of the album leak on Monday, we asked the stores to place the product on the shelves and we expedited all assets to the digital music providers to get the album up by midnight in support of the new release date.” The sudden drop after a leak follows similar plays in recent months for albums by Kendrick Lamar, whose “To Pimp a Butterfly” was also moved up a week, and Björk, whose “Vulnicura” leaked more than two months before its scheduled release date and was then rushed to digital retailers. “At.Long.Last.ASAP.” (ASAP Worldwide/Polo Grounds/RCA) is Rocky’s second official album and the first since the death of his creative partner, ASAP Yams, from an accidental drug overdose earlier this year. Guests on the album include Kanye West, Lil Wayne, Miguel and Rod Stewart.
