Three days before the release of Adele’s highly anticipated new album, “25,” brief snippets of what appeared to be songs from the album were leaked online, although where they came from was unclear.On Tuesday afternoon, a Twitter user posted a picture of the CD, saying that it was from Target, which has a deal with Adele to release a special version of the album. “Retweet if you want me to leak it,” the message said, according to a report in Billboard. Spokesmen for Adele and the retailer both denied that the album, which is scheduled to be released Friday, had come from Target. Cosmopolitan magazine posted an article on its website about the songs, linking to a British retailer named Juno Records that it said was streaming two-minute previews of songs. The retailer’s page was subsequently taken down, a sign of how great a priority the release is for Adele’s record label, XL Recordings. Shorter snippets of some songs remained on YouTube on Tuesday evening, however, with titles that corresponded to known track names from Adele’s new album, and featuring the singer’s unmistakable, powerful voice.Adele has posted images of the CD as it was being manufactured.The leak was a rare slip in what has otherwise been a tightly controlled publicity campaign for Adele’s new album, her first release in more than four years. In the United States, “25” is projected to sell well over a million copies in its first week, and possibly as many as two million. Her last record, “21,” sold more than 30 million copies around the world.The music industry is still waiting word on whether “25” will be released on streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.
