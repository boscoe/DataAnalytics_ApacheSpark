Idina Menzel is hitting the road.A Broadway star who crossed over into pop culture fame with the megahit “Frozen” anthem, “Let it Go,” Ms. Menzel will tour with her latest Broadway show, “If/Then,” beginning this fall.She’ll kick off the tour in Denver in October, and stay with it through January, with stops in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Tempe, Ariz., and Costa Mesa., Calif. Touring by a Broadway star has become rare, but is not unprecedented; just recently, Angela Lansbury toured with a revival of “Blithe Spirit.” The “If/Then” tour will continue after Ms. Menzel’s departure with another actress, who has not yet been named, in the lead role.The musical, which closed on Broadway in March after 29 previews and 401 performances, imagines how differing choices made by a city planner might have affected the course of her life. The show was created by the same team that collaborated on “Next to Normal”: the composer Tom Kitt, the writer Brian Yorkey and the director Michael Greif.Ms. Menzel was nominated for a Tony Award last year for her performance in “If/Then.” She won a Tony in 2004 for originating the role of Elphaba in “Wicked,” and was nominated for one in 1996, for “Rent.”
