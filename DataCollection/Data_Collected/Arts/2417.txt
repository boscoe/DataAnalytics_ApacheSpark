LONDON — The Irish Arts Council has announced that the Man Booker prize-winning novelist Anne Enright will serve as Ireland’s first laureate for fiction.Over a three-year term Ms. Enright will hold university residencies, deliver lectures and take part in public events as she promotes that  country’s vibrant literary culture at home and abroad. The title also comes with a cash prize of 150,000 euros (roughly $170,000), distributed between now and 2018. Among her teaching duties will be a semester of creative writing at New York University, a supporter of the award.Ms. Enright, who was born in 1962 in Dublin, wrote her first novel, “The Wig My Father Wore,” in 1995, after a self-described “breakdown” forced her to abandon her career as a television producer. She wrote two more novels before winning a surprise Man Booker Prize in 2007 for “The Gathering,” a dark saga tinged with notes of humor about a family reeling from a brother’s suicide. (Ms. Enright was far from the favorite in a field of prominent authors that included Ian McEwan.)The six-member selection committee, which was led by the poet Paul Muldoon, also included the New Yorker fiction editor Deborah Treisman and the author Juan Gabriel Vásquez. The panel chose the winner from nominees that they had solicited in letters to arts groups, bookstores, libraries, and authors across Ireland. Other nominees included Emma Donoghue — the author of the international megahit “Room,” about a young kidnapped mother raising her child in captivity — and John Banville, also a Man Booker winner.Ms. Enright has written five novels, a string of short stories and a book of essays. Her new novel, “The Green Road,” will be published this spring.A version of this article appears in print on 01/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Anne Enright Named Ireland’s Fiction Laureate.
