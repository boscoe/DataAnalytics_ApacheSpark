But Milka Djordjevich is putting three dancers onto an actual pedestal in “MASS,” her new collaboration with the composer Chris Peck. The constantly changing bodily shapes will be seen as moving sculptures in a surrounding sea of darkness. Far from treating her dancers as idealized figures, Ms. Djordjevich often has them deliberately stumble in space. She says that she is interested in choreography that allows room for error and that she likes to blur distinctions between conventional dance and nondance movements. Her title, “MASS,” takes on more than one meaning: It can refer to the physical bulk of the sculptures and to the fact that the dancers sing a complex score inspired by various forms of liturgical music.
