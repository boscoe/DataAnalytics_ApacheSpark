“Berlioz tells it like it is. You take a trip, you wind up screaming at your own funeral,” Leonard Bernstein said about Berlioz’s colorfully macabre “Symphonie Fantastique,” a musical hallucinogenic that evokes an opium-using, heartbroken artist. There is also plenty of emotional tumult in Brahms’s Piano Concerto No. 1, which James Levine will conduct on the same program on Sunday at Carnegie Hall. The pianist Yefim Bronfman — a consummate Brahms performer who combines burly firepower and elegance — will no doubt bring out the wild side of this fiery work with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra as superb partners. (3 p.m. on Sunday, Carnegie Hall, carnegiehall.org.)On Tuesday at Roulette, two adventurous ensembles — the JACK Quartet and the International Contemporary Ensemble — join forces to present selections from Jason Eckardt’s new CD, “Subject,” whose title piece explores the destructive use of music as an “enhanced interrogation” device. The program also features Mr. Eckardt’s “Tongues” — which depicts speaking in tongues and features the soprano Tony Arnold — and John Zorn’s string quartet “Necronomicon” and “Autumn Rhythm.” (8 p.m. Tuesday, Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org.)A version of this article appears in print on May 17, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Classical; The Wild Side of Berlioz.
