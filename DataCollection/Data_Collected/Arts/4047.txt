Those fans of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from the New York area who have not been able to hear Andris Nelsons, the storied ensemble’s new music director, in its hometown hall will have three chances to do so at Carnegie Hall. So far, Mr. Nelsons, the 36-year-old Latvian dynamo who began his tenure in Boston in the fall, has won consistent praise for his energy, expertise and charisma. He has yet to reveal a clear artistic vision for the ensemble. The programs he has chosen for these Carnegie concerts suggest that he is still cautious about contemporary music. There is just one short work by a living composer: Gunther Schuller’s “Dreamscape.”Still, the concerts should reveal how things are going in Boston. Wednesday’s includes Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 27 (with Richard Goode) and Richard Strauss’s “Ein Heldenleben.” The main works on Thursday are Beethoven’s Violin Concerto (featuring Christian Tetzlaff) and Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony. Friday’s program offers Mahler’s epic Sixth Symphony.
