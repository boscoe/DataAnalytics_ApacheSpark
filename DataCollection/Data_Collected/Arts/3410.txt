BOSTON – To mark a somber date, the 25th anniversary of the largest art theft in American history, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum here, has created a “virtual tour” of the 13 items, including paintings by Rembrandt and Vermeer, that were stolen from the museum on March 18th, 1990.The museum has long been reluctant to mark the date, a reminder that there has been little progress in recovering the works, valued at $300 million to $500 million. They were stolen by two men who gained access to the museum, just after midnight, by posing as Boston police officers.But the online tour not only marks the anniversary but, perhaps, presents some hope that someone will recognize an image and contribute to an item’s return. The online display features panoramic views of the galleries, where blank spaces and empty frames remain, as well as archival photos showing the stolen items, in place, before the heist.The website  details how Isabella Stewart Gardner, the style-setting Boston arts doyenne who founded the museum in 1903, acquired the items, including images from the letters, receipts, shipping orders and payment stubs accumulated by Mrs. Gardner and her globetrotting art buyers.  Dig a little and you will see that Mrs. Gardner bought Rembrandt’s “Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee” from the Hope Collection in London on Nov. 24, 1898, for about $150,000. (Add three zeros to that price to get an idea of what museum officials think it is worth today.)
