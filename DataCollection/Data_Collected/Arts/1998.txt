The song she is most famous for — “Buffalo Stance,” from the album “Raw Like Sushi” — was full of self-conscious hip-hop style and smart, joyous, Madonna-like pop, an almost perfect 1989 New York radio record, even if made by a Swedish-British bohemian with meaningful roots outside of the mainstream. (Her stepfather was the jazz trumpeter Don Cherry, and she had already been a member of the important English post-punk bands Rip, Rig + Panic, and the Slits.)Since then she’s passed through various styles, including a strangely aggressive collaborative record with the Swedish free-jazz trio the Thing, but “Blank Project,” a cool, sparse, largely electronic record made with Kieran Hebden of Four Tet, is her first real solo record in 18 years. Her tour for it puts her in front of a New York audience this week, with the pop polymaths Sinkane and Kaki King as opening acts.
