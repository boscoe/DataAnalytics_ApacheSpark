Time was when Impressionist and Modern works were the big news of the auction season, the ultimate trophy art. But as the Christie’s sale on Thursday night attests, those stars have dimmed in the eyes of many of the world’s major collectors.Coming at the end of a two-week run of auctions, in an era when the art market is dominated by contemporary art, the auction on Thursday of what are known as Imps & Mods felt like a step into the past — and not only because many of the heads in the salesroom were gray and several of the chairs were empty. Even established names such as Matisse, Sisley, Pissarro and Braque failed to garner princely prices: Only one painting sold for more than $10 million, including fees.Despite the lack of fireworks, the bidding was solid at the middle range — around $3 million to $5 million, where auction houses make more money because they are able to charge higher fees than they can on the most expensive works. Eighty-three percent of the 59 lots sold, leading to a total of $145.5 million, including auction commissions, on a low estimate of $108.8 million.“The room was quiet,” the dealer Helly Nahmad said. “But when you look at the prices, they were pretty strong.”AdvertisementThe muted nature of the Christie’s sale on Thursday was, in a sense, the result of a calculated strategy: This year, the privately owned auction house had skimmed off its best Imps & Mods and offered them in two mixed-owner “masterpiece” auctions, in the spring and the fall.
                Art auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.            The latest, “The Artist’s Muse” on Monday, showed yet again that prices for earlier-20th-century art could be buoyed by crossover interest from wealthy contemporary collectors. Some 19 of 34 works in that sale fell into the Imps & Mods classification, selling for $342 million in an auction that brought $491.4 million including commissions.But the strategy creates challenges. “If the very best lots are siphoned off, it may leave the regular sale lacking in star lots,” said Guy Jennings, managing director of the Fine Art Fund Group in London, “and star lots always help to lift the mood in the room.”AdvertisementThe category brought a higher total this week at the auction house’s archrival, Sotheby’s, whose 47 lots brought in $306.7 million with fees, above the low estimate of $275.6 million.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bought by its British seller at Christie’s in 2008 for $7.3 million, the painting was one of the Spanish-born artist’s monochromatic “Analytical” Cubist compositions, which, for all their art historical importance, tend to have a niche commercial appeal. This example sold to the art adviser Abigail Asher for $10.5 million with fees against an estimate of $6 million to $9 million.Early-20th-century Modernist works held their value, while 19th-century Impressionist paintings appeared more problematic. Alfred Sisley’s early Impressionist landscape “La Seine à Bougival,” from 1873, was on the block for the fourth time in 25 years with an estimate of $1.5 million to $2.5 million. In 1990, the Sisley sold for $1.65 million, in 2000 for $2 million, and in 2010 for $2.8 million. These steady returns ground to a halt on Thursday night when the painting failed to sell.Dealers said there were some bargains to be had. The London dealer Alan Hobart snapped up the Henry Moore bronze “Two Piece Reclining Figure: Points” for a hammer price before fees of $6.7 million, against a low estimate of $7 million, saying after the sale, “I loved the price.”A version of this article appears in print on November 13, 2015, on Page A32 of the New York edition with the headline: Christie’s Ends Run of Auctions With Solid Bids.
