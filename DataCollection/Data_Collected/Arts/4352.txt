The underlying sensibility is that the job, however quirky or unheralded, is important and interesting and that the people doing it deserve respect.Now imagine that sensibility applied to one of the most controversial practices in the United States today: hydraulic fracturing, the petroleum-extraction technique commonly called fracking. “Boomtowners,” a series that begins Sunday on the Smithsonian Channel, is about the oil boom in the Bakken shale formation, which covers parts of Montana, North Dakota and Canada.Like the oil companies, the show performs a type of extraction. It tries to tell the story of the transformation the boom has wrought in the region by extracting certain character types from among the population. There are oil workers, of course, some just there to grab a few good paychecks and then move on, others with families looking to set down roots. There is a minister, a lesbian couple, a judge who talks bluntly about the type of people the boom has brought to the area. “The people that we’re seeing in these courtrooms now are belligerent, confrontational,” the judge, Greg Mohr, says. “I’ve asked people to remove their hats in the courtroom, and one guy says, ‘What happens if I don’t?’ ” And, of course, there are fracking opponents. The series gives them plenty of time, and yet people who view fracking as a long-term environmental disaster of our own making will find this show glib. It’s as concerned with the price of groceries and the hazards of driving big-rig trucks on mountainous roads as it is with what fracking might be doing to the landscape. Sure, watch it if you want a view of life in a fracking zone that tries to give it a rugged, Wild West-style chic. But then go watch a documentary about fracking, like “Gasland.”  Advertisement
