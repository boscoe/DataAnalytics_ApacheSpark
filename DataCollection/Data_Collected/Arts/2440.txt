While barely if at all known in the high-art realm, Jim Woodring is a giant in the world of comics and graphic novels. Scott Eder Gallery, which specializes in comic art, here presents an assortment of recent drawings and paintings that display Mr. Woodring’s extraordinary gifts as a draftsman, storyteller and creator of hilarious characters and hallucinatory situations.Mr. Woodring is best known for wordless, comic narratives chronicling the adventures of a hapless, accident-prone innocent named Frank. Frank is a generic, bipedal, anthropomorphic animal with rubbery limbs; Mickey Mouse hands and feet; and a head combining the features of a dog, a cat and a beaver. The show includes 15 original pages from “Fran,” about a female version of Frank, with whom he has a tempestuous love affair that ends badly early in the story. Over the nearly 100 pages of “Fran,” Frank goes on a picaresque, surrealistic journey to try to retrieve his lost love in a world populated by all kinds of monsters, demons, and bizarre objects and architecture. Its black-and-white sequences of frames are drawn in a style that owes something to antique European woodcuts, Walt Disney, Looney Tunes and R. Crumb and other underground, psychedelic comic artists who emerged in the 1960s.The exhibition also presents stand-alone paintings and drawings made with impeccable technique. In profusely detailed charcoal images like “Frog Alchemist Taunted” and “Zoo in Ruins,” and in paintings like “Interfenestration on the Veranda,” Mr. Woodring envisions an alternative universe in which the ridiculous and the sublime interpenetrate to hair-raising effect.Scott Eder Gallery 18 Bridge Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn Through Feb. 27 A version of this review appears in print on January 30, 2015, on Page C30 of the New York edition.
