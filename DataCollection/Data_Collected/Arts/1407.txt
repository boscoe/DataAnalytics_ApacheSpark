It might seem a little early to predict the biggest book of 2017, but there is already a leading contender: Oprah Winfrey’s memoir.Flatiron Books announced Thursday that it will publish Ms. Winfrey’s memoir, “The Life You Want,” in January 2017. The book will be the lead title from Ms. Winfrey’s new imprint, which will include several nonfiction titles a year.“We all know how extraordinary Oprah’s instincts are when it comes to choosing books, instincts borne of her lifelong love of reading and the power of the written word,” Bob Miller, president and publisher of Flatiron Books, said in a statement. Ms. Winfrey’s entry into publishing, an industry that she has wielded enormous influence in through her book club, marks her latest effort to expand her media empire following the end of her talk show in 2011. Her book club selections propelled sometimes obscure books onto the best-seller list. Many of her choices, among them Eckhart Tolle’s “A New Earth” and Wally Lamb’s “She’s Come Undone,” went on to sell millions of copies.While Ms. Winfrey has been a co-author of previous books about health and weight loss and has released a collection of short inspirational writings, “The Life You Want” will combine personal stories with inspirational advice for readers. “All of my experiences, even the painful ones, have been there to teach me something about life,” Ms. Winfrey said in a statement.  “I’m still learning and I hope my story inspires other people to live the highest, fullest expression of themselves.”A version of this article appears in print on 12/05/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Winfrey Memoir.
