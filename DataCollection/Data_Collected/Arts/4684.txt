Prominent artists, architects and gallerists have urged Mayor Bill de Blasio and Meenakshi Srinivasan, chairwoman and commissioner of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, to deny the Frick Collection’s expansion plan.“Those of us in the art world who cherish the unique and tranquil ambience offered by the Frick are urging the Frick to withdraw its proposed plan and consider alternative methods of expansion that would preserve the character essential to its appeal,” the artists said in a May 6 letter to the public officials, signed by 54 people, including artists Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman and Chuck Close, and dealers like Paul Kasmin, among others.The Frick is planning a new six-story wing that will increase its exhibition space, open private upstairs rooms and create a new roof garden on East 70th Street. The addition would extend the building to the east — using space currently occupied by a gated garden on East 70th Street that is closed to the public — connecting the museum to its art reference library on East 71st Street.“We strongly believe that the Frick’s effectiveness as a display space lies in its intimacy,” the letter said. “Viewing highlights of the collection — whether the photorealism of Vermeer’s ‘Officer and Laughing Girl’ or the diffused softness of Renoir’s ‘La Promenade’ — we are transported by the gallery’s serene environment, and encouraged to reflect on what it means to let art inhabit one’s daily life.”The Municipal Art Society announced Monday that it too had written a letter, this one to the museum itself, saying that it would oppose any design that would endanger the gated garden, which was created by the landscape architect Russell Page.The Frick pointed out that its plan has the backing of other art-world luminaries, adding in a statement: “Our plan will not compromise the Frick’s intimacy but will enhance it. The existing galleries will remain unchanged and for the first time a portion of the second floor of the historic mansion will be opened to the public as new permanent galleries.”
