The singer Emmylou Harris and the percussionist Evelyn Glennie will share the 2015 edition of the Polar Music Prize, the award committee announced on Tuesday. Both will be honored by Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf at a ceremony in Stockholm on June 9, and will receive one million Swedish krona, or about $117,000, in prize money.“No one in the history of popular music has harmonized like Emmylou Harris,” the announcement said. “Her voice follows the contours of the American landscape, from the highest peaks to the endless prairie.” Ms. Harris was also honored for her “work for feminism, animal rights and the care of people affected by war.”Ms. Glennie, who is deaf, “has widened our understanding of what music is and shown us that listening is only partly to do with our ears,” the jury said. The rare solo percussionist with a fan following, she has collaborated with Björk and Béla Fleck, and released more than 30 albums.In an interview with the BBC, Ms. Glennie said: “There’s no such thing as total deafness. If the body can feel, that is a form of hearing. Sound is vibration, that’s what it is.”Of her own win, Ms. Harris told Billboard,  “Every day brings a new adventure.” She added, “I have to admit, I thought, ‘Oh boy, a trip to Sweden!'”Stig Anderson, the lyricist and manager for Abba, founded the Polar Music Prize in 1989. First presented in 1992, the award is typically given to a pop artist and a classical musician. Previous honorees have included Paul McCartney, Chuck Berry, Peter Sellars and Patti Smith.A version of this article appears in print on 03/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Harris and Glennie Win Polar Music Prize.
