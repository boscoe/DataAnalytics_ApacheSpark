Opera Theater of Saint Louis will experiment with reaching younger and more diverse audiences with a variety of programs, including one that will send singers into houses of worship to perform, to work with choirs and to connect with people who do not normally go to the opera.The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra will start a new concert series pairing performances of contemporary classical music with indie rock artists. And Cal Performances, at the University of California, Berkeley, plans to build on its recent efforts to attract more undergraduates to its performances with a new program aimed at recent graduates.Those performing arts institutions were among 26 from around the nation that will receive grants to help them build new audiences as part of a six-year, $52 million Wallace Foundation initiative that was announced on Wednesday.Will Miller, the president of the Wallace Foundation, said in a statement that the grants it was distributing were intended to help institutions reach more people at a time when “attracting and engaging new audiences is challenging for arts organizations because, even as the number of arts groups has grown, national rates of participation in the arts have declined, arts education has waned, and competition for ways to spend leisure time has increased.”The idea is to help dance companies, opera troupes, orchestras and theaters develop new audience-building programs and study the results. The Wallace Foundation, which has been doing case studies on audience growth, plans to examine these groups’ experiences in a series of public reports aimed at helping other institutions replicate what works.Marin Alsop, the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, said the ensemble would use its grant to find ways to connect with young professionals in Baltimore who do not attend concerts. “We are extremely appreciative to have this opportunity not only to try new artistic initiatives, but to gather data on why this community has not been coming to our performances and how we can better engage them,’’ she said.Roughly $10.2 million was awarded in the first round of grants, which ranged in size from $60,000 to $770,000 and went to organizations around the country. In New York, both the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the New York Philharmonic received large grants, which both hope to use to explore ways of connecting with young audiences.
