Even as the film “Selma” has recreated the civil rights march to Montgomery for moviegoers, the New-York Historical Society is about to present images of the event captured by someone who was actually there. The exhibition, “Freedom Journey 1965,” features photographs by Stephen Somerstein, who traveled to Alabama to document the march as a student in City College of New York’s night school, where he was picture editor of his student newspaper.Over the five-day, 54-mile march, Mr. Somerstein took about 400 photographs of participants, from spectators who lined the rural roads to whites who heckled the marchers to leaders like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks. “I had five cameras slung around my neck,” he recalled.
