A familiar face from Jerry Seinfeld’s television past and a couple of newly ascendant late-night hosts are among the performers that will share road trips and caffeinated beverages with him in the newest episodes of his online show, “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.” This Emmy-nominated digital series, on which Mr. Seinfeld invites friends and colleagues to join in low-key interviews and comic riffs, will return for a sixth season on Sony’s Crackle digital platform on June 4, its spokespeople said on Tuesday. In these segments, Mr. Seinfeld will share driving duties with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the star of “Veep,” “The New Adventures of Old Christine” and – oh, yes – “Seinfeld.” Other guests will include Stephen Colbert, the former host of Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report” and soon-to-be star of CBS’s “Late Show,” and the comedian Trevor Noah, the newly appointed (and already controversial) host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” Also on this season’s itinerary are Bill Maher, of HBO’s “Real Time”; Steve Harvey, host of “Family Feud” and “The Steve Harvey Show”; and Jim Carrey, who clearly doesn’t need any sugar in his morning cup of joe.
