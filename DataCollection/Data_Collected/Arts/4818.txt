What was the likelihood of the museum’s coming up with the idea on its own? Practically zero. Historically, women were rarely shown there; nonwhite women, never. And, most of Ms. Ono’s work was on a far-out fringe of art-world orthodoxy where, to her cost and our good fortune, she chose, in her early years at least, to stay.Tangible evidence of that 1971 MoMA solo exists. There are photographs of Ms. Ono standing with her work in the museum’s Sculpture Garden. There are newspaper clippings of advertisements for the show, even a few reviews. But, it turns out, the “reviews” are just quotes collected from visitors. The Sculpture Garden shot is a cut-and-paste job. So is a promotional image of her seen standing outside the museum, under an awning emblazoned with its name. She holds a large shopping bag printed with the letter “F” and positions it near the “A” in Art.And as to what was in the purported show? There seemed to be just one piece: a bottle holding a swarm of houseflies that Ms. Ono claimed she had doused with her favorite perfume and released in MoMA’s garden, from which point they dispersed into the museum and the city beyond. The art lover’s task then became to track the flies down, an effort that demanded close, diligent looking at everything, everywhere, at buildings all over town, at people passing by, at trash in the street. And it meant keeping all senses alert: for the telltale sound of a buzz, the whiff of a scent, the tickle of tiny feet on the skin.So what began as a fiction, a political gesture, a guerrilla gag mocking institutional pretensions and exclusions, became, potentially, something else, and more: a proposal that art is a state of sharpened attention that infiltrates and elevates life. Did the fiction have any effect at the time? Hard to say. But now, more than 40 years on, it’s become a reality in “Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960-1971,” which opens at MoMA on Sunday.AdvertisementOrganized by three of the museum’s curators — Klaus Biesenbach, Christophe Cherix, and Francesca Wilmott — it’s essentially an archival display. Filled out with objects and films, and enhanced by a sound track, it consists mainly of works on paper. And most of those carry words, the outstanding example being the 151 hand-typed note cards that, in 1964, became “Grapefruit: A Book of Instructions and Drawings.”AdvertisementThe book, probably Ms. Ono’s best known piece, had an inauspicious start. Ms. Ono compiled it from accumulated manuscripts and self-published it in the cheapest possible format. At the time, her reputation was still confined to a small circle of avant-garde artists, writers and musicians in New York and Tokyo. Even though what she was doing in the book with language and ideas was radical, work that would bring fame later to Conceptual artists like Joseph Kosuth and Lawrence Weiner, she could barely give copies away.All that changed a few years later. In 1970, “Grapefruit” was reissued by Simon and Schuster, with an introduction by John Lennon, who had married Ms. Ono the previous year. It was a hit, an instant staple of college-kid libraries. It was, however, more often treated as an object to own rather than as a book to read. And when it was read, it was misread. With its haiku-length texts directing readers to perform one gnomic act or another, it was often taken for head-trippy, fake-Zen fluff.A mistake. It’s a fibrous, beautiful, cleareyed document, seriously speculative, diarylike in its intimacy. It has a dose of Dada wit, as in its suggestion that the reader “walk all over the city with an empty baby carriage.” And there’s the lyricism — “Take a tape of the sound of snow” — of a natural poet, which Ms. Ono is. But the overall tone is a light-dark mix, hard to pin down. One entry that begins “Imagine one thousand suns in the sky at the same time” and ends “Make one tunafish sandwich and eat” is like a vision of the apocalypse punctuated by a pratfall. Then comes this:“When a person hurts you badlyline up 100 panes of glass inthe field and shoot a bulletthrough it.Take a copy of a map made byThe cracks on each glass andSend a map a day for 100 daysTo the person who has hurt you”And this:“Hide until everybody goes home.Hide until everybody forgets about you.Hide until everybody dies.”Prickly and pain-laced, (the first work in the MoMA show is an apple placed on a plexiglass stand, where it will stay until it rots), the book can say violent things in an unperturbed way, can sound simultaneously chipper and desolate. To read the entire typescript, installed in sequence across a long museum wall, takes a little time but is well worth doing. It’s an absorbing experience and a useful introduction to the mood of much of the rest of the show.  Ms. Ono was born in Tokyo in 1933. When she was 12, she saw the city firebombed and leveled. She grew up in cosmopolitan comfort: Her father was a banker; her mother was from an aristocratic family. One parent was Buddhist; the other Christian. After the war, she moved with them to the United States, lived in Westchester and went to Sarah Lawrence College, where she wrote poetry and studied philosophy. Temperamentally, she felt herself an odd fit wherever she was.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The couple settled in Manhattan in a community of downtown avant-gardists. John Cage was the presiding senior figure, George Maciunas an organizational force on the rise. Conceptual Art, which privileged ideas over things, was in the process of being invented. Ms. Ono had a foundational part in that, initially by hosting concerts and dance performances in the Chambers Street loft she shared with Mr. Ichiyanagi, and then through her own cross-disciplinary output.With her first New York gallery show in 1961, she began chipping away at divisions between art and life, artist and audience, making paintings composed on cast shadows, and others that people could add to, and walk on. A trip to Japan the next year turned into a long, fertile sojourn. There she developed some of the extraordinary vocal pieces — ululating, keening, infantile, erotic — that play in the exhibition and that would eventually change the sound of pop music, as the careers of contemporary singers like Björk, who has a simultaneous show at MoMA, attest.AdvertisementIn Japan, Ms. Ono presented her first texts-only exhibition, and some of her most radical performances had their debut. One was “Cut Piece,” for which she knelt on a bare stage, placed a pair of tailor’s scissors in front of her and directed the audience to snip off her clothing. Dating to 1964, it opened a path for younger performance artists like Marina Abramovic to place themselves physically in harm’s way at the hands of an audience.Back in New York, now married to the artist Anthony Cox and loosely affiliated with a network of Conceptualists known as Fluxus, she produced films and objects of only middling interest: interactive things like the hand-held, mirrored “Box of Smile” and poetical “Glass Keys to Open the Skies.” With her daring earlier ephemeral art now scattered and half-forgotten, her work gained a reputation for whimsy that it has never quite shaken.In 1966, came a circumstantial change. John Lennon visited a London show Ms. Ono was preparing and liked what he saw. They became a collaborative couple. Jointly conceived projects like their 1969 peace campaign, with its bed-ins and billboards announcing “War Is Over! (If You Want It),” were very much a product of her sensibility. Mr. Lennon, for his part, encouraged and promoted her vocal work. (A set-aside room devoted to Plastic Ono Band material documents that.)In a larger way, though, her position as his wife obscured her independent career. Worse, it left her a natural target for the misogyny and racism that she had always battled. Her subsequent roles, honorably assumed, as celebrity-widow and political spokeswoman have tended to blunt the edge and limit the variety of new art she’s made in recent decades, and set a ’60s aura around it.This impression is neatly countered by the exhibition’s most recent piece, dated 2015. Commissioned by MoMA and titled “To See the Sky,” it’s a free-standing steel spiral staircase that leads upward toward something I had never noticed before: a clear glass skylight piercing the museum’s sixth-floor gallery ceiling. The sky, limitless and shifting, source of nurture and destruction, has been a central image in Ms. Ono’s art all along. Viewed through the gallery skylight, it makes an attractive goal for a climb.But as you reach the top of the staircase, something unnerving happens. The structure starts to wobble and sway, like a ship on a moody sea. Looking skyward becomes hard; your gut tells you to focus on where your feet are. Even when you’ve come back down, it takes a minute to find your land legs. So, just when you thought you were in for a bit of transcendence, free and clear, you’ve been given a wake-up poke, a little slap of fear, a reminder that looking for light is perilous; danger is always near; which is the message that this imaginative, tough-minded and still underestimated artist has been delivering for years.“Yoko Ono: One Woman Show, 1960-1971” runs from Sunday to Sept. 7 at the Museum of Modern Art; 212-708-9400, moma.org.
