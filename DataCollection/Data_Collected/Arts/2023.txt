Updated, 7:23 p.m. | Jackie Hoffman and John “Lypsinka” Epperson will star in a Transport Group revival of the musical “Once Upon a Mattress,” the company announced on Tuesday. Ms. Hoffman will play Princess Winnifred and Mr. Epperson (whose alter ego is the drag persona Lypsinka) will be Queen Aggravain in the comic retelling of the story “The Princess and the Pea.” (Carol Burnett and Jane White played the roles in the original Broadway production in 1959.) Ms. Hoffman and Mr. Epperson will reprise their roles from a concert version of the show that Transport Group mounted in 2013 (above). The new production is set to run Nov. 29 through Jan. 3, 2016, at the Abrons Arts Center.The company also announced that its new season will include the premiere of the musical “The Blonde Streak,” set to run this summer from July 5 to Aug. 16 at Theater 79. Written by Dan Lipton and David Rossmer (“Rated P for Parenthood”), the show is about “three thirtysomethings, forced to deal with the endless and ageless struggle of growing up,” according to a news release. Casting details were not announced. Both musicals will be directed by Jack Cummings III.
