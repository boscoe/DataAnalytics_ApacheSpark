She was there the day in 1956 when ground was broken for Frank Lloyd Wright’s concrete spiral. And the other evening, at the age of 91, she stood in the rotunda of that spiral, using a reporter to help her fend off a crowd of admirers pressing in from all sides.“Oh, my God — come over here and sit down and pretend to talk to me; maybe they’ll leave me alone,” she said, aiming for a perch along the museum’s reflecting pool. It did no good. The crowd followed, and for the next 15 minutes she shook hands, pecked cheeks and signed catalogs for the Guggenheim’s exhibition of her dazzling mosaic-style work, “Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian: Infinite Possibility. Mirror Works and Drawings 1974-2014.” To say that the show — her first solo exhibition in a major New York museum — has been a long time in coming would be not only an understatement but an object lesson in several kinds of history: the West’s long-wary relationship with Middle Eastern art; Modernism’s scorn for art seen as too decorative; and Ms. Farmanfarmaian’s own long love affair with New York, where she has spent half of her adult life.Few artists — much less an Iranian one who has lived in Tehran for periods of more than 30 years — could claim the kind of Zelig existence she has had in postwar American art. When she first came to New York for art school in 1945, she studied dance with Martha Graham, frequented the Cedar Tavern when Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning were holding court there (“Larry Rivers was always trying very hard to date me,” she said) and began a long friendship with Andy Warhol when both were trying to make ends meet in Bonwit Teller’s advertising department.“I was a pretty Persian rug, an exotic find, so people invited me to things,” she said, shrugging, in an interview at the Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where she was staying for the exhibition’s opening last week. (In 2004, after decades in New York, she returned to Tehran, partly to be closer to the master craftsmen who help make her sculpture’s intricate metal and mirror work.)AdvertisementComing of age during the heady years of Abstract Expressionism was valuable, Ms. Farmanfarmaian said, if only to show her early on what kind of artist she was not going to become. But it was years before she found the geometric abstraction, based in both Islamic tradition and Modernism, that have become her signature, examples of which are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Tate Modern and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. When she began making such work, in the 1970s, she said: “Nobody understood what the hell I was doing, and I really didn’t understand it myself.”AdvertisementShe added: “I was so unsure of myself. I just always knew that I had to make work, and I kept on making it. But I never thought it would lead to anything successful.”Suzanne Cotter, the curator who organized the Guggenheim show, said that when she first saw Ms. Farmanfarmaian’s work at an art fair in Dubai almost a decade ago, “I didn’t know who it was by, and they said, ‘She’s in her 80s,’ and it wasn’t surprising to me because it seemed, in all its simplicity, to have a real clarity that you would associate with an artist who had been refining something for a long time.”Ms. Cotter, formerly the curator of the Guggenheim’s Abu Dhabi project (the museum is under construction) and now director of the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto, Portugal, added: “I think it is a challenge to present this sort of work to an audience whose main associations are to Western abstraction. But I also think Monir’s work holds up precisely because of that tension, between an art object and something than can be read as decorative.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In a talk last week at the Guggenheim between Ms. Farmanfarmaian and Frank Stella, one of America’s most celebrated abstract painters, Mr. Stella recalled visiting her in Iran once and being struck by the starkness of the sunlight and the plateau landscape.“It’s a little bit like being the bee on the white piece of paper,” he said, explaining that he came to realize how deeply the environment had pervaded Ms. Farmanfarmaian’s work.But Iran has also taken much away from her. She and her husband, Abolbashar Farmanfarmaian, a lawyer and investor, had to flee in 1979 before the Islamic Revolution, and she later learned that the art collection she had built over decades — including pieces by Warhol, Alexander Calder and Tom Wesselmann — had been confiscated, along with much of her own work.“They took everything, even my shoes and my underwear,” she said over tea and pistachios in her hotel room. “Don’t talk to me about it or you’ll make me cry.”Ms. Farmanfarmaian rarely lowers her armor in such a way, about a life that has been full of privilege but considerable personal loss. (Two sisters died as young children; her husband died of leukemia in 1991.) In person, she is a formidable presence with a scathing wit, a kind of Persian Bette Davis, dressed the other day in an elegant cowl-necked sweater with a diamond necklace she had designed herself in the shape of a reconfigured hexagram. In a recent documentary, “Monir,” directed by Bahman Kiarostami, she is shown in her modest studio in Tehran discussing a work in progress and telling her listener, with unassailable finality and a twinkle in her eye: “That’s how I see it. I don’t care how you see it.”She said she was gratified by the attention that had flooded her way in recent years but knows herself well enough as a nonagenarian to realize that what brings her the greatest pleasure these days is usually to be at home, in Tehran, by herself, drawing.Advertisement“These are so simple, made just with Magic Marker,” she said, showing a pile of drawings anything but simple, filled with prodigiously complex geometric designs. “They’re the shapes I see when I close my eyes, right before I fall asleep. It’s like I’m dreaming them.”A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Mixing Modernism and Memories of Iran.
