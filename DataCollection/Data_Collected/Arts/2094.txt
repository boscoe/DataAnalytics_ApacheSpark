The weekend box office provided a primer on why Hollywood spends more time pumping out sequels than it does attempting to make meaty, well-reviewed original movies. “Taken 3,” starring Liam Neeson and receiving a paltry 12 percent positive score on the review-aggregation site RottenTomatoes, was a huge No. 1 at North American multiplexes, taking in an estimated $40.4 million – one of the best opening results on record for January. Billed as the final chapter in an action trilogy, “Taken 3” was released by 20th Century Fox and produced and financed by France’s EuropaCorp for $48 million. Meanwhile, the civil-rights drama “Selma” — with a 98 percent positive review score, Oscar buzz and Oprah Winfrey as a backer — also arrived in wide release and took in about $11.2 million, for a total since opening in limited release on Dec. 25 of $13.5 million. Paramount Pictures, which spent $20 million to make “Selma,” said on Sunday that 83 percent of ticket buyers were older than 25. (Translation: Because older moviegoers are typically reluctant to rush out to theaters, it may be a long march to financial success but the film could still get there, especially if it starts winning awards.) All of the other best-selling movies over the weekend were holdovers, led by “Into the Woods” (Walt Disney Studios), which generated about $9.8 million in ticket sales, for a three-week total of $105.3 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data.
