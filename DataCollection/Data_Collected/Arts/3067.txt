New chamber music by Augusta Read Thomas is the focus of the Miller Theater composer portrait on Thursday, but don’t expect to see much free space onstage during the New York premiere of her “Resounding Earth,” scored for a truckload of percussion instruments played by the Chicago-based Third Coast Percussion.By contrast, the world premiere of “Capricci” for violin and viola, and a new octet, “Selene,” fusing percussion and string quartets (with the intrepid JACK Quartet), promise more intimacy. (8 p.m., Broadway and 116th Street, Columbia University, millertheatre.org.)On Saturday, the New York Philharmonic decamps to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for an installment of its Contact! new-music series dedicated to works by Nordic composers.The works include a cello concerto by Per Norgard, a chamber symphony by Kalevi Aho and the American premiere of “Terra Memoria” by the expressive Kaija Saariaho. Alan Gilbert conducts. (7 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, nyphil.org.)A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Classical: Percussion to the Extreme.
