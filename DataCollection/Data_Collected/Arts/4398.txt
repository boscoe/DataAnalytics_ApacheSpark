G. P. Putnam’s Sons has scooped up North American publication rights to “Maestra,” a psychological thriller that has already been optioned by Columbia Pictures.“Maestra” features a feisty, morally complex and sharp heroine who may appeal to fans of Stieg Larsson’s “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” and Gillian Flynn’s “Gone Girl.” Putnam bought the novel, the first in a trilogy by L. S. Hilton, in a low-seven-figure pre-emptive deal.The story centers on Judith Rashleigh, an assistant at a London art auction house who is fired after she discovers a forged painting. She suspects a conspiracy, fears for her life and flees to the French Riviera.Tara Singh Carlson, a senior editor at Putnam, said that Judith reminded her of “a female Talented Mr. Ripley.” “She’s sexy, smart and very, very bad in all the best ways,” Ms. Carlson said in a statement.Columbia optioned the novel for Amy Pascal to produce through her new company, Pascal Pictures. Ms. Pascal, the former chief of Sony Pictures Entertainment, called Judith “one of the most memorable females in recent fiction.”Ms. Hilton, a journalist and novelist who lives in London, has published several other books, including a history of England’s medieval queens and a novel set in 15th-century Europe.“Maestra,” which will be published in Great Britain by Zaffre, a new adult imprint at Bonnier Publishing, is scheduled for publication next spring.
