The Belarus Free Theater troupe, banned from its homeland for its politically charged works, will be returning to New York this spring with the American premiere of the original play “Trash Cuisine.” The work addresses capital punishment and opens on April 29 at La MaMa’s Ellen Stewart Theater. It runs through May 17.The company was founded in 2005 and  soon ran afoul of Belarus’s dictatorship. Their last major performance in New York, “Minsk, 2011: A Reply to Kathy Acker,” came in January 2013 during the Under the Radar festival. Ben Brantley praised the group in The New York Times as “one of the most powerful and vividly resourceful underground companies on the planet.”“Trash Cuisine” had a successful run at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and in London. The play uses a documentary style and food metaphors to explore stories of torture and punishment from around the world. The upcoming New York run is produced by La MaMa in conjunction with the Public Theater, and will be the first time that the company will perform in English.The logistics for the group remain difficult, as several members live in exile in London, and obtaining visas has been something of a challenge, according to Mia Yoo, La MaMa’s artistic director. “It’s incredible to see them find a way — to use Skype and whatever tools necessary to continue their important, urgent work,” Ms. Yoo said in a phone interview.In addition to the play, the troupe will also host discussions and panels on global capital punishment and on criminal justice systems.A version of this article appears in print on 04/06/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Arts, Briefly; Belarus Free Theater Returns to New York.
