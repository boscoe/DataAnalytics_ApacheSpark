Lauryn Hill, the Grammy-winning rapper and R&B singer, has canceled a performance in Israel on Thursday, citing her inability to schedule a separate concert in the Palestinian territories. “I’ve wanted very much to bring our live performance to this part of the world, but also to be a presence supporting justice and peace,” Ms. Hill wrote on her official Facebook page Monday. “It is very important to me that my presence or message not be misconstrued, or a source of alienation to either my Israeli or my Palestinian fans.” Instead of performing just once, at the Live Park amphitheater in Rishon LeZion, Ms. Hill said she would “seek a different strategy to bring my music to ALL of my fans in the region.”  In recent days, ahead of Thursday’s scheduled concert, activists representing the B.D.S. movement, for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, have targeted Ms. Hill using the hashtag #KillingMeSoftly, a reference to her hit song with the Fugees. A petition calling on Ms. Hill to cancel her performance was signed more than 11,700 times. Amplified by social media, similar campaigns calling on artists to boycott Israel have seen mixed results.On Friday, Ms. Hill was also forced to pull out of a show in Lagos, Nigeria, because of travel issues. As a gesture of apology to those fans, she shared an acoustic rendition of the song “Doo Wop (That Thing)” on Facebook.
