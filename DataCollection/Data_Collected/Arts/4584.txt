It’s not only a jury of 12 angry men that has ruled in favor of Amy Schumer this week: on Thursday, HBO said it had signed up this stand-up and actress to star in her first comedy special for the cable network, to be directed by Chris Rock, a man who knows his way around a stand-up stage.Ms. Schumer, the star of the Comedy Central series “Inside Amy Schumer,” has seen her popularity surge since its third season began in April, propelled by provocative sketches that include a parody of the NBC series “Friday Night Lights,” an episode-long parody of the Sidney Lumet drama “12 Angry Men,” and a scene, co-starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tina Fey and Patricia Arquette, whose forthright title cannot be printed in a family newspaper. “Inside Amy Schumer” won a Peabody Award and its star was cited for her “comic intelligence that’s smart, distinctively female and amiably profane.” Ms. Schumer also wrote and stars in the forthcoming summer comedy “Trainwreck.” Mr. Rock is, of course, the Emmy Award-winning star of comedy specials like “Kill the Messenger,” “Never Scared” and “Bigger & Blacker,” and recently wrote, directed and starred in the feature film “Top Five.” HBO said Ms. Schumer’s  special would be taped at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on May 29, and will be shown later this year.
