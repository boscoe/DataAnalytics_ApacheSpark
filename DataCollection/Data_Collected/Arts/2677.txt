Does the knowledge that Thomas Jefferson has been semi-alive all these years and masquerading as Steven Weber change the way we think of “Wings,” “Single White Female” and the rest of Mr. Weber’s TV and film work? And what is going on with Frank and Katrina?As the episode began, three workers who were poking around in the sewers stumbled into a secret underground chamber that Jefferson, played by Mr. Weber, had built in Revolutionary times and was still inhabiting, at least in some sort of spirit form. Weirdly, the slave-owning Jefferson seemed not at all surprised when a black police officer — i.e. Abbie Mills — confronted him; perhaps, being a smart guy, he realized that changes had probably taken place while he was hanging out underground for almost 200 years.In any case, Abbie (Nicole Beharie) and Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) went down there in search of the three workers but found a dilemma: Should they save the men or preserve a trove of information from Jefferson that could help them with apocalypse prevention. I wasn’t entirely clear on why they had to choose one or the other. Yes, the chamber was guarded by creepy zombie-like guys, but they seemed to be pretty killable. Yet Abbie and Ichabod decided they had to blow up the place after rescuing the workers. It seemed as if the writers had started with an intriguing premise but then couldn’t figure out a way to wrap it up.And what was that exchange between Abbie and the brother of the rescued worker near the end? Was flirting going on there? Fill me in.
