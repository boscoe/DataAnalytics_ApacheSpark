Another week, another eye-popping sales statistic for Adele.Adele’s “25” (XL/Columbia) holds the No. 1 spot on Billboard’s album chart for a third time, easily beating new releases by Coldplay, G-Eazy and Rick Ross. “25” sold 695,000 copies in its third week out, Nielsen reported. According to Billboard, it is the only album to sell more than 650,000 copies in each of its first three weeks since at least 1991, when reliable sales data was first collected from retailers.Since it came out, “25” has sold about 5.2 million copies in the United States alone, and has consistently beaten all industry projections. With three weeks of sales still left in the year, the album should breeze past six million sales; how far it goes beyond that is anyone’s guess. On Monday, Adele announced that she would begin a North American tour in July.Also on this week’s chart, Coldplay’s new album, “A Head Full of Dreams” (Parlophone/Atlantic), opens at No. 2 with 195,000 sales and nine million streams. The album was released widely on Dec. 4, but was not made available on Spotify until a week later (a fact that the band publicized with a handwritten note, which Spotify posted on Instagram).Also this week, Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” (RBMG/Def Jam) is No. 3, and Pentatonix’s year-old holiday album “That’s Christmas to Me” (RCA) is No. 4. “When It’s Dark Out” (RCA), by G-Eazy, a rapper from Oakland, Calif., fond of leather jackets and slicked-back hair, opened at No. 5, while the rapper Mr. Ross is in sixth place with his latest release, “Black Market” (Def Jam/Maybach).A version of this article appears in print on 12/15/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: More Big Numbers, and a Big Tour, for Adele.
