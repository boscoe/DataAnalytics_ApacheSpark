The Philharmonie de Paris,  a sleek modern performance complex in the outskirts of Paris  that opened in January amid much trepidation and controversy,  will close its main hall this summer to continue construction.The satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné (and later Le Figaro) reported the closing this week, saying that the main performance space would be shuttered throughout July and August, pushing several performances of the “Days Off” festival into the Cité de la Musique (a smaller venue in the same complex) and causing bands like the British group Alt-J to cancel plans to play during the festival. It was also reported that construction crews have been at work in the hall during the evenings after daytime concerts.The Philharmonie’s spokesman, Philippe Provensal, said in an email that  the closings were overblown.  He said the “Days Off” concerts had never been scheduled for the Philharmonie’s main space. Further, he added, it is typical for French organizations to close operations in July and August, particularly shortly after opening a new space. He did not respond to a question about Alt-J’s concert.The Philharmonie is home to the Orchestre de Paris. Its opening was marked by major delays and a ballooning budget, and it was clear from the start that the construction was not completed. The hall’s architect, Jean Nouvel, denounced the venue’s managers in the lead-up to its opening in a column in “Le Monde,” saying that the opening was premature by as much as nine months. He refused to attend the opening concert.But many have praised  the building’s modern design and its mix of high- and low-brow programming. An exhibition dedicated to David Bowie is showing in the Philharmonie’s museum space through May.A version of this article appears in print on 04/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Paris Concert Hall Needs More Construction.
