With female faces becoming an increasing rarity on TV talk shows that are shown after sundown – currently none of the major late-night shows are hosted by women – the E! network is continuing to do its part to reverse that trend.On Monday, the cable channel announced that it had ordered a new prime-time comedy talk show to be hosted by Grace Helbig, a Los Angeles-based comedian and multimedia star who has gained a wide audience from her personal YouTube channel. E!, which was previously home to Chelsea Handler’s late-night talk show, “Chelsea Lately,” said that Ms. Helbig’s series, tentatively titled “The Grace Helbig Project,” will make its debut in April, and will be produced by Embassy Row.Jeff Olde, the network’s executive vice president for original programming and development, said in a statement that Ms. Helbig’s show, featuring  a mixture of pop-cultural trends and celebrity guests, will offer “a fresh take on the conventional talk show with a very unconventional host who has already captured an enormous fan base of young viewers on the Web.”Ms. Helbig said in a statement, “Congratulations to E! for giving an internet-obsessed introvert a talk show. I’m looking forward to working with humans.”
