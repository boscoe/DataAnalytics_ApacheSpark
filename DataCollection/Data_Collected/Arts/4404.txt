The show closes on Sunday at the Longacre Theater.Updated, 2:00 p.m. |  This week’s video features a scene with Renée Fleming and Douglas Sills of Joe DiPietro’s “Living on Love,” a new Broadway comedy, based on the play “Peccadillo” by Garson Kanin, about the romantic shenanigans of an opera star and her egomaniacal husband. In this excerpt, the opera diva Raquel De Angelis (Ms. Fleming, in her Broadway debut) gives her husband, the conductor Vito De Angelis (Mr. Sills), a snow globe she got for him during a visit to Vienna.  But along with the gift she has a question: did he keep his promise to have “no more extracurricular romances, no more peccadilloes” while she was on tour? The show, directed by Kathleen Marshall, announced today that it will close on Sunday at the Longacre Theater after not receiving any Tony Award nominations.Recent theater videos in this series include Kelli Barrett singing the number “He’s There” from the new Broadway musical “Doctor Zhivago,” and a scene with Lesley Manville of “Ghosts” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.Coming soon: Peter Sarsgaard in a scene from “Hamlet” at Classic Stage, and songs from Sierra Boggess of “It Shoulda Been You” and Ruthie Ann Miles of “The King and I.”
