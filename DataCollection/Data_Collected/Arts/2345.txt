Last year, the British singer Sam Smith scored a big hit with his gospel-tinged song “Stay With Me,” which reached No. 2 and established Mr. Smith as a major new vocal talent.But to the music publishers behind Tom Petty, the melodies in “Stay With Me” sounded a little too close to those in Mr. Petty’s 1989 song “I Won’t Back Down.” And now, after one of those friendly discussions in the music industry in which songwriting credits are hashed out, Mr. Petty and his original co-writer, Jeff Lynne, will receive writing credit along with Mr. Smith and his two writing partners, James Napier (a.k.a. Jimmy Napes) and William Phillips. Online records at Ascap, the music licensing agency, already reflect the change.The news was first reported by the British newspaper The Sun.A representative of Mr. Smith said in a statement that the similarity between the songs was unintentional. “Not previously familiar with the 1989 Petty/Lynne song, the writers of ‘Stay With Me’ listened to ‘I Won’t Back Down’ and acknowledged the similarity,” the statement said. “Although the likeness was a complete coincidence, all involved came to an immediate and amicable agreement.”“Stay With Me” sold more than 3.5 million downloads in the United States, and next month Mr. Smith is up for six Grammy Awards, including best new artist and album, song and record of the year.
