Coming off a hugely profitable run of performances during Christmas week, Broadway musicals and plays did even better last week over the New Year holiday, grossing the highest amount ever – $42.8 million – for a week’s worth of performances, according to box-office data released on Monday by the Broadway League.“Wicked” set a new record for an eight-performance week for any Broadway show, grossing $2,740,642, while “The Lion King” – the top-grossing Broadway show for 2014 – set a box-office record at its theater with a gross of $2,514,994. The producers of the new musical “Aladdin” and the play revivals of “It’s Only a Play” and “The Elephant Man” also announced box-office records at their theaters thanks to last week’s grosses.Several musicals ended their runs on Broadway last weekend on a high note, none more than “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s Cinderella,” which grossed $1,873,246 for nine performances – the highest weekly amount in the show’s history. “Once,” the 2012 Tony Award winner for best musical, wrapped up its run with a terrific $967,968, while “Pippin” – which won the 2013 Tony for best musical revival – finished strong with $907,253. The musical revival of “Side Show,” a fast flop in spite of good reviews, ended its 10-week run grossing $810,486 – by far the most it ever made.Among plays, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” stood out as a major hit, considering that it is a new work with no celebrity actors; the show, which earned stellar reviews, grossed $1,089,779. Its producers announced on Monday that they were now selling tickets through Labor Day weekend, signaling a bullish outlook for the future of “Curious Incident,” which will surely be a top contender for the 2015 Tony for best play.Overall 19 musicals and plays, out of 37 running, grossed more than $1 million. Three of those grossed more than $2 million, with “The Book of Mormon” joining “Wicked” and “The Lion King.” Attendance also reached a record weekly high of 346,913, compared to 253,730 for the same New Year holiday week last season.A version of this article appears in print on 01/06/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Broadway Receipts Break Record.
