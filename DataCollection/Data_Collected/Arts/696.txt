In January, Sotheby’s will offer an American folk art collection with some dark and risqué imagery. The auction consignors, Petra and Stephen Levin, philanthropists based in Florida, had filled their Vermont home with woodcarvings of prostitutes wrapped around clients ($30,000 to $50,000 for two pairs) and a shoeshine boy leering at a female customer’s legs ($30,000 to $50,000). In a diorama of a bar crowded with disheveled drunks ($20,000 to $30,000), cigarette butts are smeared on the floor.Nancy Druckman of Sotheby’s American folk art department described the Levins as intrepid collectors who pursued bold, whimsical objects, sometimes made by obsessive artisans. The sale of about 100 pieces also includes models of a gingerbread-trimmed parsonage ($10,000 to $15,000) and a gabled church ($15,000 to $20,000) made from cattle bones.Most of the artworks were acquired in the past decade. A statue of Lord Dundreary ($120,000 to $180,000), a character from the play “Our American Cousin,” which Lincoln was watching when he was assassinated, brought $409,000 at Christie’s in New York in 2007.A version of this article appears in print on October 30, 2015, on Page C34 of the New York edition with the headline: Folk Art With an Edge.
