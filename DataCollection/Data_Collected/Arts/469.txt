The best comedy sketch about the current political campaign that I’ve seen this year was not on “Saturday Night Live.” It was on the stage of the Upright Citizens Brigade in Chelsea on Oct. 12 when its weekly late-night stand-up showcase Whiplash presented a surprise debate between “Bernie Sanders” and “Donald Trump.”James Adomian, a virtuoso comic with a gift for impersonating cranks and eccentrics (his Jesse Ventura is a classic), played Mr. Sanders masterfully (with a Brooklyn accent that’s a croaky delight) and Anthony Atamanuik impersonated Mr. Trump with pursed lips and haywire nonchalance.In good news for political comedy junkies, there will be a rematch next month as part of the New York Comedy Festival. “Trump vs. Bernie: The Debate! – Starring Anthony Atamanuik and James Adomian” will be at the Bell House in Brooklyn on Nov. 11.Both Mr. Adomian and Mr. Atamanuik have done these characters before, but last week was their first time onstage together. After the debate, an edited video was released online and received praise online from outlets like the Daily Dot and Salon.More information on the New York Comedy Festival is here.
