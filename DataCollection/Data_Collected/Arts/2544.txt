“Falsettos,” the Tony Award-winning musical about a man who leaves his wife and son to be with another man in the early years of the AIDS crisis, will be revived on Broadway in the spring of 2016, the show’s producer, Jordan Roth, announced on Thursday. A musical-theater benchmark for its candid depiction of a gay relationship and the specter of AIDS, “Falsettos” features music and lyrics by William Finn (“The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee”) and a book by Mr. Finn and James Lapine (“Into the Woods”).  Casting, run dates and a theater are to be announced. Mr. Lapine, who directed the original Broadway production in 1992, will reprise his duties next year.A mix of family drama and witty comedy with a Jewish mien, “Falsettos” is a pairing of Mr. Finn’s one-act musicals “March of the Falsettos” and “Falsettoland,” which were produced Off Broadway in 1981 and 1990. (Both are part of a trio of related works that includes the 1979 show “In Trousers.”) The original Broadway production opened to mostly positive reviews; writing in The New York Times, Frank Rich called it “exhilarating and heartbreaking.” It was nominated for seven Tony Awards and won two, for best original score and best book.In a statement, Mr. Roth, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns five Broadway houses, said “Falsettos” was on his “bucket list” of shows he’d long hoped to produce.“I am part of a large club of theater lovers who were changed by this show, who passionately believe that Falsettos is ‘our show,’” said Mr. Roth.  “I can’t wait to have our show on Broadway again.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/06/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Falsettos’ Revival on Broadway.
