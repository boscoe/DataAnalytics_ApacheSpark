The Korean market is a relatively new institution in New York, but it has precedents in older corner stores, bodegas and delis where various cultures have mingled and clashed. “Sing’s Millennium Mart,” organized by Seung-Min Lee, is billed as “the corner deli of the future,” rather than any particular type — although Ms. Lee was born in Korea and her family has worked in the food business in New York.Ms. Lee’s is a humorous, sometimes political, sometimes poetic take on the minimart. (And it’s in a gallery basement rather than a storefront.) There are vacuum-sealed packages of homemade kimchi kale chips and candy made with herbal concoctions; eerily colored tapioca balls (for bubble tea) and nutritional capsules filled with glitter and ginkgo biloba.A wall of edible plants growing in plastic bottles, conceived in collaboration with Simone Frazier, provides a living salad bar. Water bottles filled with tap water brought in from Detroit are being sold to fund the Detroit Water Project, which helps pay the overdue utility bills of Detroit residents facing water shut-offs. Contributions by Jonathan Butt, Arkadiy Ryabin, Mores McWreath, Amanda Turner Pohan and others include a poetry chapbook, vegetables cast in concrete and benches built like fruit stand shelves.The best way to experience “Sing’s Millennium Mart” might be to attend the last evening of related performances on Saturday night. It will be harder to see all the objects described here. But earlier performances by Clifford Owens and Jaeeun Lee, among others, used fruit, banana pudding and dialogue to raise issues of race, class and urban culture.Interstate Projects66 Knickerbocker Avenue, at Grattan Street, East Williamsburg, Brooklyn Through Sunday A version of this review appears in print on January 30, 2015, on Page C30 of the New York edition.
