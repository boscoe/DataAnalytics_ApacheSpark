LONDON — A set of 12 gilded bronze animal-head sculptures by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei sold late Thursday night at Phillips in London  to one of three telephone bidders for  £2.9 million, with fees, or about $4.4 million. It far exceeded the $1.2 million paid in April 2014 at Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong  for Mr. Ai’s sculpture, “Map of China.”   This was the first time a complete set of the  2010 work, “Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads” — representing the Chinese zodiac (snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, pig, rat, ox, tiger, rabbit and dragon) — had come to auction. The piece was inspired by the astrological sculptures that once decorated a fountain at the Old Summer Palace near Beijing, which was ransacked by French and British troops in 1860. The seller had purchased the set, one of 12 that was gilded, from the Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York. A much larger, 10-foot high version of the piece in plain bronze, was made in an edition of eight. Examples of both are on a world tour of museums and public spaces. “Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads: Gold” is currently being exhibited at the Palm Springs Art Museum in California.A version of this article appears in print on 02/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Ai Weiwei Sculpture Set Sells for $4.4 Million.
