With James Baldwin, Saul Bellow, John Cheever and Alice Walker on the roll call of writers who had residencies at Yaddo, the artists’ retreat founded in Saratoga Springs in 1900, its literary history has often eclipsed awareness of the visual artists who worked there, among them Helen Frankenthaler, the abstract painter who died in 2011. To bolster the presence of the visual arts at Yaddo  and honor the community’s importance to the artist, the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation has  just given $250,000 to underwrite a new, 1,000-square-foot live-work studio for a visual artist. It will be the largest of five freestanding studios to be completed this spring along a wooded ridge overlooking newly restored ponds, as the first phase of a master plan  by Ennead Architects. Yaddo has previously retrofitted existing spaces as artists’ studios,  but the Frankenthaler studio, with its 18-foot-high cathedral ceiling and retractable wall,  is the first to address the needs of contemporary artists, and will be built outside the footprint of the original 400-acre estate. (Design of all five new studios is by Phinney Design Group.)  “Until this moment, we haven’t had first-class visual arts facilities,” said Elaina Richardson, president of Yaddo, which will honor the sculptor Martin Puryear, another alumnus, at its benefit in May. “We’re taking a critical eye to these very old buildings and thinking harder about the promise of good working conditions and what we offer visual artists.” A version of this article appears in print on 12/03/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A $250,000 Gift for Yaddo Retreat.
