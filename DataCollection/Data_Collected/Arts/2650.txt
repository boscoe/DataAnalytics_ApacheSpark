The Off Broadway Playwrights Horizons theater company announced the six productions for its 2015-16 season on Monday. They include a world premiere by Anne Washburn – the author of the critically acclaimed drama “Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play” – and works by Taylor Mac (“A 24-Decade History of Popular Music”), Danai Gurira (“In the Continuum”) and Jordan Harrison (“Maple and Vine”).Ms. Washburn’s new play, “Antlia Pneumatica,” centers on a once-close group of friends in the Texas Hill Country who reckon with their pasts as they bury one of their own. The play will run March-May 2016 at Playwrights Horizons, where “Mr. Burns” ran in 2013; Ken Rus Schmoll will direct.The season will begin in August with “The Christians,” about challenges facing the faithful attendees of a mega-church, written by Lucas Hnath (“A Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay About the Death of Walt Disney”) and directed by Les Waters. Mr. Mac’s new comedy, “Hir,” about a man returning from war to face a domestic battle between his mother and transgender brother against his ailing father, will start performances in October and be directed by Niegel Smith.Mr. Harrison’s “Marjorie Prime,” a sensitive comedy set in the near future, about an elderly woman in the age of artificial intelligence, will begin in November under the direction of Anne Kauffman (“Belleville”). In February 2016 will come “Familiar,” about a Zimbabwean family having a wedding in Minnesota. It is written by Ms. Gurira (who plays the character Michonne on AMC’s “The Walking Dead”) and will be directed by Rebecca Taichman (“The Oldest Boy”). “Indian Summer,” a world-premiere comedy written by Gregory S. Moss, about young love and class warfare in a Rhode Island beach town, will start performances in May 2016 and be directed by Carolyn Cantor (“After the Revolution”).A version of this article appears in print on 02/11/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Washburn Premiere at Playwrights Horizons.
