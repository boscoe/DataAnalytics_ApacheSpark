George Washington during the Revolutionary War. Season 1 found Abraham struggling to keep his family life and his spying life separate, and it ended spectacularly with him killing a British ensign and then watching as his wife burned their house down in a hastily formed cover-up plan. The plot only thickens in Season 2, with a new character added to the mix: Benedict Arnold, played by Owain Yeoman.“If Season 1 was about the formation of America’s first spy ring, Season 2 is about seeing that ring in action,” Craig Silverstein, show runner and an executive producer for the series, says in a promotional video. “We get to see them participate in the shadow war.”Advertisement
