LONDON — The author Margaret Atwood — perhaps best known for her dystopian-future-set novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” — made a further contribution to the fictional future today, handing over a secret manuscript to Oslo’s public library to be published in 2114.The handoff is the first phase of the Scottish artist Katie Paterson’s “Future Library” project. For the next century one author a year will contribute a new written work to the project. They will be sealed in secrecy by the library until being published 100 years from now on paper made from trees planted in a local forest.The day’s events began with a public walk from a local train station to the wood near the northern edges of Oslo whose trees were planted for the project. There, Ms. Atwood gave a reading (not from her new work). She handed the secret manuscript to Ms. Paterson who then gave it to a representative of the library. A similar ritual is to take place every year for the next 99 years.Ms. Atwood announced that her manuscript is named “Scribbler Moon,” but revealed no other details. “She won’t tell anything at all,” Anne Beate Hovind, a project manager for the Future Library project, said in a phone interview. “She’s very, very strict on this. She won’t even talk about the process of writing. No content, no process, no nothing. Nada.”Ms. Paterson will announce the name of the author who is to  contribute next year on Wednesday.“People have been crying,” Ms. Hovind said of the ceremony. “We had just enough rain.”A version of this article appears in print on 05/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Atwood Delivers Work for 2114 in Oslo.
