Fans of the writer David Mitchell should wake up from their long winter’s naps long enough to take note: He will publish his seventh novel, “Slade House,” on Oct. 27, Random House announced on Wednesday.While the author has previously gone two or three years between novels, this book will arrive just one year after Mr. Mitchell published “The Bone Clocks,” a best-seller that was noted on many year-end lists. The new work grew out of a short story, “The Right Sort,” which Mr. Mitchell published last summer on Twitter.In a news release, Mr. Mitchell said that the original 2,000-word story called for expansion. “Scenes grew, bred and sprouted new scenes until ‘The Right Sort’ passed the 6,000 word mark and announced itself as part one of a five-part novel,” he said. The novel’s five sections span 36 years in the life of a haunted house, and the disappearances of five individuals, from October 1979 through October 2015.“Slade House” is set in the same fictional universe as “The Bone Clocks,” which was an ambitious 624-page effort to amplify the low-wattage supernatural elements that radiated through Mr. Mitchell’s earlier work. Mr. Mitchell described it as a sort of “uberbook,” bringing together characters from all of his books, spanning the globe and much of human history. “The Bone Clocks” was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize.“Slade House” is a shorter book, but David Ebershoff, Random House’s executive editor, said in a statement that  “readers of ‘The Bone Clocks’ might recognize one of the characters.”
