Several years ago, the actor Alec Baldwin told The New York Times that he was interested in being mayor of New York City. “I am someone who is fully prepared for the fact that I could go into this and do it and completely have my ass kicked,” he said at the time of the prospect of running for office. “I could throw a party and no one could come. And it would be this staggering lesson for me.”This week, he got the job — on TV.As first reported by Deadline Hollywood, HBO is developing an untitled television pilot that would star Mr. Baldwin as a billionaire who becomes mayor of New York City after tragedy strikes the office’s previous occupant. It will be Mr. Baldwin’s first TV project since the NBC sitcom “30 Rock,” for which he won two Emmy Awards. The hourlong drama will be written by Wells Tower, the author of the short-story collection “Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/07/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Alec Baldwin as Mayor (On Television, That Is).
