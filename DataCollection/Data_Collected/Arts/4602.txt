In The New York Times Book Review, Tom Perrotta reviews Kate Atkinson’s new novel, “A God in Ruins.” Mr. Perrotta writes:Atkinson’s book covers almost a century, tracks four generations, and is almost inexhaustibly rich in scenes and characters and incidents. It deploys the whole realist bag of tricks, and none of it feels fake or embarrassing. In fact, it’s a masterly and frequently exhilarating performance by a novelist who seems utterly undaunted by the imposing challenges she’s set for herself.“A God in Ruins” is especially impressive because it’s a sequel of sorts — a “companion volume,” in the words of the publisher — to “Life After Life,” Atkinson’s fascinating 2013 novel, which introduced readers to the Todds of Fox Corner, a well-to-do British family whose lives intersect in various ways with the major historical events of the first half of the 20th century. On this week’s podcast, Mr. Perrotta discusses “A God in Ruins”; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; Ruth Franklin talks about Shirley Jackson; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Pamela Paul is the host.
