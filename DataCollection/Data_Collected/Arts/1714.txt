The old Hudson Theater is a bit hard to spot these days, sandwiched between two hotel towers on West 44th Street, still handsome but a bit of a quiet presence on a noisy block.Inside, it’s more lavish, with Tiffany glass, plaster ornamentation, and a marble-lined lobby; well-preserved thanks to having been designated a landmark in 1987.But how was it viewed in 1903, when it opened? The news this week that the Ambassador Theater Group had acquired a long-term lease to the building — which is owned by Millennium Hotels and Resorts — and would restore it for use as Broadway’s 41st theater, sent us scurrying for the archives, curious what critics at the time said about the building.The assessment, in The New York Times, was a rave. An unbylined review of the theater’s first production, “Cousin Kate,” starring Ethel Barrymore, reserved its most exuberant praise — “a word of rapture” — for the building itself. Here’s what the critic said (with the original punctuation and spelling):It is impossible to close without a word of rapture on the new playhouse. Its verd-antique, in Graeco Roman marble, silk plush and metal trimmings, harmonizes admirably with the dull old ivory of the proscenium arch, tricked out with the iridescence of fevrile glass. The masked lights in the golden house coffers and the moons of opalescent luminaries of the foyer ceiling, the constellations of dull incandescence in the ceiling of the auditorium, all combined to suffuce the house with a rich brilliancy never to be forgotten. No richer and more tasteful auditorium is to be found short of the splendid Hofburg Theater in Vienna, with its old crimson, ivory, and gold.Who knew that “tricked out” was a phrase in vogue in 1903? As for the Hofburg, it’s now called the Burgtheater and remains a major home for German-language productions.In any case, you’ll be able to check out the Hudson in a year. The building, which in recent years has been used for meetings and events by the hotel, will be renovated in coming months and is scheduled to reopen next November, according to Howard Panter, the co-founder of Ambassador Theater Group.
