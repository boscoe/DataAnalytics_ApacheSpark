The American Writers Museum, set to open in Chicago in early 2017, announced on Tuesday that it would be leasing a location on North Michigan Avenue, the city’s premier shopping strip, a short walk from attractions like Millennium Park and the Art Institute of Chicago. The United States has many small museums dedicated to particular writers or genres. But the planned Chicago museum, which was founded in 2010 by Malcolm E. O’Hagan, a retired executive, bills itself as the first to celebrate American writers generally by exploring “their influence on our history, our identity, our culture and our daily lives.”The 11,000-square-foot space will feature permanent and temporary exhibits, some with a strong interactive component, like a “Visitors’ Favorites” section where visitors can nominate favorite quotes, books and authors. In addition to a broad overview of the development of American literature and displays dedicated to classic authors, there will be sections dedicated to children’s literature and to westerns, mysteries and other genre fiction, as well as an exhibition about Chicago writers.The institution has raised more than $3.3 million toward its planned startup costs of $10 million, according to Publishers Weekly. Nike Whitcomb, the museum’s executive director, told the magazine that it expected to draw some 120,000 visitors annually and net $1.75 million in revenue by 2021.A version of this article appears in print on 10/29/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nice Chicago Address for a Writers Museum.
