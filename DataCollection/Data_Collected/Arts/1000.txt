A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Azealia Banks (Thursday) In the video for the single “212,” this rapper from Harlem delivers exuberantly filthy couplets while clad in a Mickey Mouse sweater, and her gleeful bawdiness is a joy. Since that formidable debut, the artist has released her first studio album, “Broke With Expensive Taste,” an uneven but still charismatic effort, and continues to court controversy via a volatile social media presence. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Stacey Anderson)Tony Bennett (Friday) One of the finest of the Great American Songbook crooners, Mr. Bennett is still riding a wave of bittersweet adulation for his 2011 album, “Duets II,” which includes a collaboration with the late Amy Winehouse. For his 2012 album, “Viva Duets,” he collaborated with Latin American artists like Chayanne, Thalía and Marc Anthony; in Newark, he’ll tread the boards with one of his daughters, the singer Antonia Bennett. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, 888-466-5722, njpac.org. (Anderson)Cooder, White, Skaggs (Saturday) Hosted by Rosanne Cash, the eminently cool daughter of Johnny Cash, this one-off jam features three roots/bluegrass music stars: the spry singer Sharon White, the mandolin virtuoso Ricky Skaggs and the slide guitar showman Ry Cooder. At 9 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Anderson)★ Matthew Dear (Saturday) This experimental microhouse D.J. and producer channels Detroit techno in his reedy, subtly dystopian brushes of beats. This summer, he broke ingenious ground for the New Museum with DELQA, a new collaborative project; it urged visitors to manipulate his music by pushing on fabric structures, their efforts were translated on motion technology. He is currently prepping new material for his cult-hit techno side project, Audion. With DJ Koze and Valentino Kanzyani. At 11 p.m., Verboten, 54 North 11th Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, verbotennewyork.com. (Anderson)EL VY (Friday and Saturday) Matt Berninger, the baritone frontman of the National, generally cuts a morose, ponderous figure with that group. However, in his new project El VY, a collaboration with Brent Knopf of the indie-rockers Menomena, he purrs cheeky lines about space travel above New Wave guitar and fey harmonies, or yelps sleazy entreaties in a nu-disco funk state. It’s a curveball, to say the least; the group’s debut album, “Return to the Moon,” was released last month. Friday at 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, boweryballroom.com. Saturday at 9 p.m.,Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, 718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Anderson)Gesaffelstein (D.J. Set) (Saturday) The French techno star and fashion scene darling (whose real name is Mike Lévy) also has a green thumb with the American mainstream: He co-produced Kanye West’s single “Black Skinhead,” and has also remixed Phoenix and Lana Del Rey. His D.J. sets are charismatic dance bursts with fleet pacing and aggressive borders. With Jon Hopkins, GENER8ION, Flat White and more. At 10 p.m., Brooklyn Hangar, 2 52nd Street, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, black-nyc.com, 718-492-7400. (Anderson)★ Grimes (Monday and Wednesday) The Canadian electro-pop star Grimes (whose real name is Claire Boucher) yodels on the edge of shrillness, darting between crushing synths. The tense formula would falter without her clever melodies anchoring it; her third studio album, “Visions,” is both skittish and stalwart. A new album, “Art Angels,” dropped abruptly earlier this month. With Nicole Dollanganger. Monday at 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. Wednesday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, 718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; sold out. (Anderson)GWAR (Sunday) Less a band of blood-spewing, priapic demon beasts than a darkly hilarious satire on death metal — though they are certainly a band of blood-spewing, priapic demon beasts — this elaborately costumed group from Virginia delivers an obscene live spectacle unlike any other. Its lead vocalist, Dave Brockie, died last year; the group is now fronted by another outsize rager, Berserker Blóthar. With Born of Osiris, Battlecross and SYKA. At 7:45 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Anderson)Billy Joel (Thursday) The piano man has achieved what the Knicks can only fantasize about: a yearlong winning streak at Madison Square Garden. His open-ended monthly residency, which began in January 2014, has been billed by the arena as its fourth franchise. So far, it has included hearty appearances by Sting, John Mellencamp and Brian Johnson of AC/DC, as well as many euphoric singalongs to “New York State of Mind.” At 8 p.m., 800-745-3000, billyjoelmsg.com. (Anderson)★ Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings (Saturday) Ms. Jones and the Dap-Kings, the finest soul-funk revivalists in town, deliver a spectacle to rival James Brown on “The T.A.M.I. Show” each time they perform. After undergoing treatment for cancer, Ms. Jones has resumed blazing her way across stages to promote the group’s recent album, “It’s a Holiday Soul Party,” which peaks with a supremely swinging version of “White Christmas” that invokes the Ronettes and Tina Turner. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, 888-466-5722, njpac.org. (Anderson)★ Hudson Mohawke (Wednesday) After cofounding LuckyMe, a label and artist collective, this D.J. and producer became the unofficial dance don of his native Glasgow. His own genre-toying electro-hop work on Warp Records and Kanye West’s imprint, G.O.O.D. Music, elevated his profile internationally and created a ready audience for his excellent recent bangers; the brassy, bawdy “Chimes” skates on distorted treble squiggles of chirped, childlike vocals, while “Ryderz” opens in scratchy retro soul before dropping into a joyous British Garage-infused beat. With The-Dream. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret Many big guns of cabaret have lined up with new shows to carry Manhattan’s fall season through the Thanksgiving holidays. Leading the list are John Pizzarelli and Jessica Molaskey with “My Generation,” at Café Carlyle through Nov. 28 (35 East 76th Street, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com).At Feinstein/54 Below, Randy Graff, Cady Huffman and Judy Kaye perform “The Songs of Cy Coleman” through Friday. They are followed by the cabaret legend Andrea Marcovicci on Wednesday and Thursday; Julia Murney, an alumnus of “Wicked,” Nov. 19 through 21; Ann Hampton Callaway, celebrating women songwriters, begins the first of seven performances on Nov. 22; and the red-hot Broadway star Lena Hall (“Kinky Boots,” “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”) has the first of 10 performances of her new show, “The Villa Satori: Growing Up Haight Ashbury,” on Nov. 28. (254 West 54th Street, 646-476-3551, 54below.com.)At Birdland, the Tony Award-winning actress Christine Ebersole and the Grammy-winning musician Billy Stritch reunite Nov. 23 through 26. (315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.) At the Italian restaurant and bar Pangea, the singer-pianist Eric Comstock performs Tuesdays evenings and the ethereal vocal phenomenon Carol Lipnik on Sundays (178 Second Avenue, East Village, 212-995-0900, pangeanyc.com). And Melissa Errico will debut her autobiographical show, “Sing the Silence,” on Nov. 18 and 19 at Joe’s Pub (425 Lafayette Street, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com). (Stephen Holden)★ Public Image Limited (Monday) Rotten by name but a workhorse at heart, the singer John Lydon led this band after the Sex Pistols. Public Image’s members were progenitors of post-rock and challenging, thoughtful musicians, especially on their landmark record, “Metal Box” of 1979. Their 2010 reintroduction at the Music Hall of Williamsburg was a raucous, watertight marathon; they now fete the recent release of “What the World Needs Now…,” the group’s 10th studio album. At 8:30 p.m., PlayStation Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, 888-929-7849, playstationtheater.com. (Anderson)Puscifer (Tuesday) Maynard James Keenan, the ever-restless frontman of Tool and A Perfect Circle, steeps his latest electro-industrial rock outfit in the mathy aggression and droning vocals of his other breadwinners. “Conditions of My Parole” balances the lurid rap-rock of the title track with skittish synthscapes; the group just released a simmering follow-up, “Money Shot.” At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)★ Allen Stone (Saturday) The young musician strikes worldly gospel-pop tones on “Radius,” his major-label debut on Capitol. Live, he sings with a gregarious showmanship that echoes vintage R&B – and he has dance moves to spare. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, 800-745-3000, apollotheater.org. (Anderson)The Weeknd (Monday, Wednesday and Thursday) The clarion-voiced Canadian R&B singer and producer of the sinuous summer electro-R&B hit “Can’t Feel My Face” also paired with Disclosure on “Nocturnal,” a floorshaker on that band’s new disc “Caracal.” He’s reached such cultural ubiquity, even Tom Cruise shimmies to his beat; the actor recently lip-synced along to his croons on “The Tonight Show.” With Banks and Travis Scott. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 866-858-0008, thegarden.com. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com. (Anderson)Advertisement
