Sleater-Kinney started 2015 by returning to the road to support “No Cities to Love,” its first album in a decade, and ended the year with a unique live challenge: a run of five consecutive shows in New York, each in a different space, which concluded Wednesday. The band’s drummer, Janet Weiss, described it as a “shrinking tour” — the Portland-based trio started big, with the Kings Theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn (capacity: nearly 4,000, where most fans had assigned seats) and played a subsequently smaller stage every night until it reached the recently revamped Market Hotel in Bushwick (capacity: approximately 300, where attendees were packed shoulder to shoulder, crammed into window frames and wrapped around pillars).Ms. Weiss, who assembles the group’s set lists, had a host of variables to consider: How the sound would reverberate in the various-sized rooms; if fans would return on multiple nights and wish to hear different picks; the emotional and physical demands on the band’s singers; how the musicians could feed off the energy of the crowd.Near the end of the first show in the cavernous Kings Theater, the band — which also includes Carrie Brownstein and Corin Tucker on vocals and guitars, and the touring guitarist and keyboardist Katie Harkin — made an on-the-fly call to cut from the set the sprawling “Let’s Call It Love,” from the 2005 album “The Woods.”“I think because people were sitting down and the energy was not as frenetic in the room with all that space and all that air, when we got to it, it just seemed too daunting to have to play that song in those surroundings,” Ms. Weiss said. They substituted the punchier, dancier “Turn It On.”"Price Tag"
“It was not a unanimous decision to open the show with that song every night. Switching things up, sometimes something really interesting can happen. But we switch up a lot of other stuff, so I think it totally works. And it is a good first song, it kind of gets us going. It’s not too much, not too little. It’s a good opener.”
"Youth Decay”
“I tried to put more fast songs on, because fast songs in the bigger rooms don’t work as well, because by the time you hear the note in the back of the room, there’s like four more notes that have already gone by and it becomes real washy. Whereas in a small room like that, you can play all fast songs and they’ll really, really translate.”
"Get Up"
“The song that translated the least was ‘Get Up,’ which is kind of a slower song.”
"Far Away"
“We put ‘Far Away’ into the mix, which we didn’t do on the other tours, and ‘Ballad of a Ladyman’ and ‘Wilderness.’ There were some songs we worked up just for this little run, knowing that there would be people coming back. In the other cities, it was the first time we’d been there, but we knew in New York there would be people who had already seen the main tour so we wanted to throw in some songs they hadn’t heard.”
"The Fox"
“I think you could hear ‘The Fox’ in any room. Corin can really nail that song, it’s not even that hard for her. We didn’t do ‘What’s Mine Is Yours,’ which is fine, we’ve been doing that a lot. For some reason The Fox’ is right in her sweet spot.”
"Entertain"
“I’m just playing off how Carrie sings it, because if she is slowing down with her vocals then I match her with the drums. We’re kind of playing off her emotional state. It’s like pushing and pulling on the song a little bit. I think it makes people be like, ‘What’s happening?’ It surprises them, and surprise, to me at a show, is a really, really great thing. We improvise sometimes, we do segues. We like to try sort of heightening the experience. Playing the songs exactly like the record is probably not our number one rule.”
"Jumpers"
“I think ‘Jumpers’ is our favorite Sleater-Kinney song. I feel like the heaviness and meaning and sadness of it is very real; loss and death is very real in all of our lives, and I think it’s important to have that present so it feels like we’re dealing with real life, which is the goal. Lyrically, subject matter, the playing, the parts, the arrangement – we really enjoy it. I can’t think of a show where we haven’t played it in the past year. We used to close every show with it and then it started moving around a little bit.”
"Rock Lobster"
“It was fun. It’s always fun. I’m not sure I still had hearing at that point, but I did have a good time.”
"Call the Doctor"
“That’s the room for that song. That intimate sort of thing, those early records translate really well. New York is so old school for us, I feel like the fans are very thorough here, so we can pretty much draw from any record. Sometimes when we get a crowd that mostly knows the newer record, they didn’t really know ‘Call the Doctor.’ You can always count on New York to know the old songs.”
"Modern Girl"
“We did actually have to cut a few songs because we couldn’t hear.”

On the second night, at Terminal 5 in Manhattan (capacity: 3,000), the band introduced a cover song it had played only once before, in 1997: the B-52’s playful surf-rock party jam “Rock Lobster.” Fred Armisen (Ms. Brownstein’s co-star on “Portlandia”) joined on vocals and smacked a cowbell that doubled as a lyrics cheat sheet. “It’s just the most fun song,” Ms. Weiss said. She added that the group practiced it two or three times at sound check: “Everybody showed up very prepared and I was impressed with all of us for studying and being ready.” And “Let’s Call It Love” made its return. “That’s the perfect venue for that song. You need energy from the crowd to sort of propel you through that song because it’s so tough,” she said. “Improvising is always more exciting when the crowd is into it and you don’t feel like you’re in a fishbowl. When you feel like you’re with the crowd, it’s easier to go out on the ledge.”AdvertisementMs. Weiss said the band was exhausted by the time it hit the stage at Irving Plaza in Manhattan (capacity: 1,025) on the tour’s third night, after spending the day at “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” repeatedly playing the “No Cities to Love” track “Bury Our Friends” for broadcast that night. “Everything felt like, really scrappy and sort of wild, slightly out of control,” Ms. Weiss said. “It’s a smaller, more live-sounding stage, so it was loud and super raw sounding.”AdvertisementThe band was most chatty onstage the following night, at Music Hall of Williamsburg (capacity: 650), where the crew sported matching T-shirts showing their appreciation for Ms. Weiss, and Ms. Brownstein made a few remarks about the Republican debate airing on CNN. “To me, that’s a really perfect-sized room,” Ms. Weiss said. “It’s super intimate but it sounds good; you can see everyone but it’s not impersonal like the Kings Theater. In a smaller place like the Music Hall, you feel like you’re performing with the people.”“Little Babies,” from their 1997 album, “Dig Me Out,” made its sole appearance of the run that night: “Songs like ‘You’re No Rock n’ Roll Fun’ and ‘Step Aside’ or ‘Little Babies,’ we like those songs, but in the context of this tour it felt a little campy and out of place,” Ms. Weiss said. “So those didn’t surface as much as some of the more tough songs.”Sleater-Kinney’s sprint down memory lane ended in a space reminiscent of the tiny, unpolished spots the group played in its early days, Market Hotel, where someone doodled the letters “S K” and hearts on the fogged-out windows behind the stage, and the elevated M train was visible rattling by. “In a way, it was interesting to be in that position again, to be on stage and thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m going to be deaf after this show.’ It definitely became very scrappy and energetic,” Ms. Weiss said. (Which explains the condition of that night’s set list, pictured above). “I remember those days and I feel like we became a good band in venues like that, but I don’t have to play those venues to prove that we are still true to the music and still raw. I still feel that raw, even in a bigger place. People could just get closer. It was for the hard-core fans.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
