Odd, in other words, for an artist who considers the ordinary unacceptable.The thought lasted six bars. Suddenly, in what is often an innocuous reply to the arching opening phrase, slicing accents began to undercut the poised serenity. The orchestra seemed to kick down a gear, searching for a crisper response.With that began an exhilarating account that reimagined received ideas at every turn. From measure to measure, you had no idea what soloist and conductor alike would do with (or to) such familiar music. Mendelssohn the amiable, pristine and dreamy? Think again: This was a nightmare, and chillingly powerful.Not that every curve was successfully negotiated. Mr. Tetzlaff’s freedom with rhythm and his tendency to push ahead of the beat often left the orchestra, already in the brusque form that Mr. Heras-Casado prefers in early Romantic music, scrambling to catch up. The finale, in particular, was long on vigor but short on whimsy. When everything was in sync, though, this performance was supreme.So, too, was Mr. Heras-Casado’s work in Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 1, a piece that, had it been written by anyone else, would most likely never be heard now. At times it’s plain weak, and the conductor was unafraid to show it. The more momentum he built, the more his orchestra’s playing became taut and secure, and the more he drew out the work’s incoherence. He made a decent argument as well for Stravinsky’s Suite No. 2, a quartet of dances as droll as it is brief.The Orchestra of St. Luke’s returns to Carnegie on March 10; 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org.Advertisement
