Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays one half of one of television’s most memorable couples on “Modern Family.” But when he returns to Broadway in April, he’ll be all alone. Mr. Ferguson will star in the one-man show “Fully Committed,” a comedy about foodie culture by Becky Mode, starting April 2 at the Lyceum Theater.Jason Moore (“Pitch Perfect”) will direct the play, which originally opened Off Broadway in 1999 at the Vineyard Theater. Peter Marks, reviewing the show in The Times, wrote that the play “does as much to shake the foundations of the temples of haute cuisine as a squadron of flies in the vichyssoise.”“It’s definitely timeless, and I think it’s one of those plays that only gets richer because food culture has gotten even more intense,” said Mr. Ferguson in a phone interview.Ms. Mode has updated the play to match both Mr. Ferguson and the newer, app-based aspects of foodie culture. Mr. Ferguson will play more than 40 characters and often engage in dialogue with himself. “You’re keeping six plates spinning at the same time,” he said.Mr. Ferguson was part of the original Broadway cast of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee” in 2005, and appeared in Shakespeare in the Park’s “The Tempest” last summer. He also already has a foot in the restaurant world: He is an investor in the Los Angeles restaurant Terrine, which opened last year.Previews begin April 2, with the official run spanning April 25 to July 24.
