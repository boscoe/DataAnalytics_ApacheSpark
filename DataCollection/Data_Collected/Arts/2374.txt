CreditAndrea Mohin/The New York Times        A reader recently left a voice mail message telling me, “The Russians invented ballet!” No, they certainly didn’t, but you can see why many people believe that they must have — especially the Mariinsky Ballet of St. Petersburg. Last weekend, the company ended a two-week season of three different programs at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; this week it moves on to the Kennedy Center in Washington with a program of late-19th- and early-20th-century choreography.No other company of dancers exudes such stylistic authority, such emphatic sense of ’twas-ever-thus tradition, such three-dimensionally sculptural shapeliness in motion. When other great ballet troupes have off periods, they seem to forget the things that once distinguished them. But when the Mariinsky Ballet is off, its dancers look unable to forget anything about their prestigious past: They look imperiously jaded or just lifelessly faithful.And yet this company’s seeming assurance is a facade. While I’ve been watching the troupe — almost 34 years — the Mariinsky has revised its style more frequently and thoroughly than any other major ballet company. I have seen the angles of knee (in arabesque), pelvis, wrist and jaw change and change again.Just now, the Mariinsky is undertaking another change of style, which, though hard to gauge, may prove its biggest to date: namely, its way with music. The results differ across the repertory. In its closing program, “Chopin: Dances for Piano,” which I watched on Saturday, you could see three different aspects of the Mariinsky. And the company looked least at home in the ballet it has been dancing the longest: Michel Fokine’s 1908 “Chopiniana.”AdvertisementBetween 1989 and 2008, the Mariinsky’s forays into the repertory of George Balanchine’s choreography brought it into contact with the most advanced and complex Western form of ballet rhythm and dynamics. Somehow it managed this — sometimes quite gloriously — while still maintaining its old way of dancing the 19th-century classics. The great asset of the Mariinsky tradition lay in what Russian dancers have long called cantilena, an Italian term for melodic legato in singing; the drawbacks, in the old ballets, included using the downbeat for preparation rather than the step itself, taking slow tempos and often falling behind the beat.AdvertisementThe weekend’s Chopin program included one of this company’s first American imports, Jerome Robbins’s “In the Night” (1970), which has been in its repertory since 1992, and “Without,” a ballet made for the Mariinsky in 2011 by Benjamin Millepied, the French choreographer whose main dance career has been in the United States. In these two, you could feel the two-way rewards of the St. Petersburgs company’s contact with Western choreography. With the ballerinas Anastasia Matvienko, Yekaterina Kondaurova and Viktoria Tereshkina, “In the Night” looked — if not wholly fresh — grandly handsome, enriched by rich Russian legato, which in turn was lightened by Robbins’s rhythmic variety and range of dynamics. Lyudmila Sveshnikova’s account of the all-nocturne score was gorgeous.“Without” is a 21st-century foray into a 20th-century genre (largely shaped by Robbins) of the Chopin piano ballet, a collage of changing moods. It’s at best intermittently successful. Mr. Millepied skates over the surface of his music (15 pieces: nine preludes, five études and finally one nocturne). Though his 10 dancers keep coming and going, he has no skill with exits and entrances; the piece becomes a miscellany of fragments. And the Russian performers’ versions of charm, love, fun, tension tend to be played out for the audience, not quite believably.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Philipp Kopachevsky’s eloquent playing gave new fascination to the piano pieces.These are both, in various senses, Romantic ballets, so it’s worth remembering the audacious remark made by Balanchine when he returned to his native Russia in 1962, with New York City Ballet. “Welcome to Moscow, home of the classical ballet!” he was told, but he replied: “I beg your pardon. Russia is the home of the Romantic ballet. The home of classic ballet is now America.”We could (and should) debate at length the implications of his statement, but it’s true that Russian classicism since the 1960s has often been controversial in the West, and sometimes disappointing, while the Russian way with Romantic ballets — notably “Giselle” and “Chopiniana” — has usually been wonderfully alive and nuanced.Not so with Saturday’s “Chopiniana,” however. The company was still dancing this moonlit, sylvan reverie (sylphs and a poet) beautifully on its 2008 visit to New York; let’s hope Saturday’s bland, stony reproduction of the old classic was some temporary aberration. By performing the choreography to Chopin’s piano originals, the troupe showed how much its formerly exquisite style in Agrippina Vaganova’s version of this 1908 ballet has been gauged to lush orchestral sound. (Alexander Glazunov’s 1893 orchestral suite, “Chopiniana,” helped give Fokine the idea.) Dancing to the more sharply focused sound of solo piano, the dancers on Saturday were approximate in timing: They made no virtues of on-the-music moments or after-the music phrasing. Alexandra Zhilina’s pianism did not redeem matters.What’s gone wrong here? I’m inclined to blame no individual dancer: Oxana Skorik and Timur Askerov, who danced the pas de deux, showed many incidental refinements that could easily illumine an inspired performance. But the same unloving chill is blighting both this ballet and the company’s “Swan Lake.” It seems likely that Valery Gergiev, now in charge of artistic policy at the Mariinsky, is dictating a revised musical accentuation of the company’s home classics. That’s no bad thing, but the troupe dances these works as if the change of emphasis had been externally imposed on dancers and rehearsal staff, not as if they believed in it.The Mariinsky Ballet opens on Tuesday and dances through Sunday at the Kennedy Center in Washington; 202-467-4600, kennedy-center.org.
