The Goethe-Institut New York  will reopen in renovated headquarters on Irving Place on March 28, after spending the last five years in a temporary residence on Spring Street. The institute, part of an international network of similar institutions sponsored by the German government to promote German language and culture abroad, plans to expand its programs and to offer its own language courses for the first time. In the past language students attended courses at Deutsches Haus at New York University.The institute’s offices, at 30 Irving Place, were built in 1912 by the Central Realty Company. Karo Architects, a collaboration between the Brooklyn firms Sebastian Kaempf Architects and Anke K. Roggenbuck, added two glass entryways, and opened up the first floor to expand its public spaces.For the opening the institute will present a program of avant-garde German and American films, with electronic music by Stummfilm:dj, and a site-specific work by the Berlin artist Wanda Golonka. Future programs include Kino! 2015, a series with German Films devoted to contemporary German cinema, and a project on surveillance, state secrecy and “data capitalism” with the German theater collective Rimini-Protokoll.A version of this article appears in print on 02/11/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: News That Would Ease Young Wertheru2019s Sorrows.
