She is also the author of a memoir and two novels, including “The Giant’s House,” a finalist for the National Book Award in 1996.In The New York Times Book Review, Sylvia Brownrigg called “Thunderstruck” a “restorative, unforgettable” book. “The fact that there is nothing depressing about the ubiquity of accident and disaster” in the collection, she wrote, “is a powerful testament to the scratchy humor and warm intelligence of McCracken’s writing.”The first Story Prize was awarded in 2004.
