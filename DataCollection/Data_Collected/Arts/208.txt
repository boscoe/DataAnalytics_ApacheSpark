The show’s central feature is a group of 18 of the 19 pieces from her 1970-71 “Chorros” (or, “Jet Stream”) series. They hang from the ceiling nearly to the floor, made their New York debut at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1971 and have not been seen in New York since.Born Gertrud Goldschmidt in Germany in 1912, Gego trained as an architect and did not turn to art until she was in her 40s and had relocated to Venezuela, her home until her death in 1994. Today, her art is ever more prescient — of the current interest in recycling slight materials, in ephemerality and in what might be called a feminine/feminist sensibility. Her works also harmonize here with several new sculptures in nylon, mesh and sand by Senga Nengudi that are sparse recyclers in their own right and are inaugurating the Dominique Lévy Gallery’s small project space.Gego used only what she could manage without help, bending and piecing together different lengths of wire and metals with various twists, bolts and nylon threads. She made a kind of passive kinetic art that also relates to textiles and fiber art. Each piece pulses with its own energy, interval and implied spatial volume, while occasionally spilling out onto the floor like spiders’ legs.The “Chorros” works receive an elegant backup here from earlier and later pieces, some of which use iron mesh as an everyday grid. And behind these stand a clutch of wonderful drawings and woven collages. Gego’s art is less transformation than salvation, both mechanical and sublime.‘Gego’‘Autobiography of a Line’Senga NengudiDominique Lévy909 Madison Avenue, at 73rd StreetThrough Oct. 24‘Gego’‘Autobiography of a Line’Senga NengudiDominique Lévy909 Madison Avenue, at 73rd StreetThrough Oct. 24Advertisement
