It is a little like a bake sale, but one that offers works by famous artists instead of snickerdoodles. The Metropolitan Opera, which has been struggling financially in recent years, announced Friday that 14 major visual artists — including Chuck Close, William Kentridge and Cindy Sherman — have donated artworks for the company to sell to raise money.The works will be displayed at the opera house in Gallery Met through May 13 in a show called “Artists for the Met.” The company hopes sales will raise more than $1.5 million.The Met, which ran a $22 million deficit last year, has been working to lower costs and raise money this year: its unions agreed to cuts, many of its soloists voluntarily reduced their fees, and last fall the company sold a diamond brooch it owned. The “Artists for the Met” project was organized by Dodie Kazanjian, the director of Gallery Met, in collaboration with Amy Cappellazzo, a co-founder of Art Agency, Partners. “The Met extends sincerest thanks to the artists who donated works, and to their galleries,’’ the company said in a statement.Most of the artists have created works in the past for Gallery Met, and some of the pieces being sold have opera connections, including Elizabeth Peyton’s portrait of the tenor Jonas Kaufmann in Bizet’s “Carmen,” Peter Doig’s poster for Wagner’s “Siegfried,” and Mr. Kentridge’s triple portrait of the composer Alban Berg, his wife, and his mistress.The roster of artists who donated works for the sale also includes Cecily Brown, Francesco Clemente, George Condo, Genieve Figgis, Walton Ford, Ragnar Kjartansson, Julie Mehretu, Dana Schutz and Michael Williams. Gallery Met, located in the south lobby of the opera house, is free and open to the public Mondays through Fridays from 6 p.m. to the end of the last intermission, and on Saturdays from noon to the end of the evening’s last intermission.
