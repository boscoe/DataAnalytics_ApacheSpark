“Game of Thrones” once again reigned supreme as the most-pirated television show of 2015, according to the news site TorrentFreak, with its season finale amassing 14.4 million downloads via the filesharing system, BitTorrent, an increase of more than six million from the year before. It was the fourth consecutive time that the mythically themed show ranked as the year’s most pirated, and in 2015 it easily bested the runner-up, “The Walking Dead,” which had 6.9 million downloads, and “The Big Bang Theory,” which was downloaded 4.4 million times, landing the bronze. But unlike those of the two other shows, the download figures for “Game of Thrones” dwarfed the size of its traditional United States television audience, which was 8.1 million for the season’s final show.The figures, which tabulated the most downloaded single episodes worldwide, were estimates made by TorrentFreak based on “several sources, including statistics reported by public BitTorrent trackers,” the site said.  Actual figures would undoubtedly be much higher, according to the site.
