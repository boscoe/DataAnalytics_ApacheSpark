The words are now a shorthand for support of freedom of expression. The sign is the creation of Joachim Roncin, 39, the art director of Stylist, a free Paris weekly magazine. Now, with the aid of pro bono lawyers and the good will of France’s patent office, he’s trying to prevent people from capitalizing on it. “I can’t trademark it. It’s not something that belongs to anyone,” Mr. Roncin said in a telephone interview. “If it’s a slogan, it cannot be a brand.” Mr. Roncin said that even arms manufacturers had filed requests with the French patent office, hoping to sell weapons with the phrase. He said that the patent office has said it will not trademark the slogan. Mr. Roncin has only granted Reporters Without Borders permission to use the image to help raise money for Charlie Hebdo. (In its first issue published after the attacks, the magazine ran a cartoon depicting people in Bangladesh hunched over sewing machines sewing “Je Suis Charlie” T-shirts.) Mr. Roncin posted his image on Twitter not long after the killings. With only around 400 Twitter followers, he expected only a few friends to share the image, but it swept across social media, and tens of thousands marched in Paris on Jan. 11 holding “Je Suis Charlie” signs. “It’s incredible,” Mr. Roncin said. “Now it’s crazy.”Advertisement
