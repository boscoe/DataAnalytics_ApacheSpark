Really, what is there left for one to do after playing a nun in charge of an insane asylum, a powerful New Orleans witch, and the proprietor of a Florida freak show? For Jessica Lange, apparently, not much more.When “American Horror Story” had its premiere in the fall of 2011, Ms. Lange was just one piece of a larger ensemble that included Dylan McDermott and Connie Britton, fresh off “Friday Night Lights.” But as the show became an anthology series — set in a different time and place every season — she quickly became its star. This weekend, she confirmed what many have assumed for several months: she won’t be coming back for the show’s fifth season, subtitled “Hotel.”When asked at Paleyfest, a TV festival in Los Angeles hosted by the Paley Center for Media, on Sunday night whether she would join Lady Gaga in Season 5, Ms. Lange said: “We’ve had a great run. I have absolutely loved doing these four characters, and in all the madness, I loved the writers, actors, Ryan, the whole insanity of it, the stories, shooting here, shooting in New Orleans, everything. To cut to the chase, yes, I’m done.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/17/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Lange Is Leaving ‘American Horror Story’.
