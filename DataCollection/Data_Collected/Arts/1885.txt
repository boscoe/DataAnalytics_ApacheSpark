It’s home. The season winds down Sunday, Jan. 3, with a special finale program featuring Ailey’s “Revelations.” But as wonderful as that 1960 classic is, it can feel a little like “The Nutcracker” around this time of year — used and abused.So start a new tradition: This season, not to be missed is Rennie Harris’s biting and poetic look at human fragility in “Exodus.” Like “Revelations,” it has a spiritual base but is framed within the world we live in, with an appropriately shocking ending. And Ronald K. Brown, another choreographer-poet, offers his sixth work for Ailey, “Open Door,” along with a couple of poignant others: “Four Corners,” filled with angels and spiritual seekers, and “Grace,” a 1999 dance in which God is played by a woman. It’s Mr. Brown’s answer to “Revelations,” and it remains a master stroke. (alvinailey.org.)Advertisement
