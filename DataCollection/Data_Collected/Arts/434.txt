It plays straightforward, outward hard-core punk that over the course of a song moves toward something inward and not straightforward at all: billowing effusions of sound and improvised noise. It sounds like one band that keeps transubstantiating into another.It’s fronted by the singer and guitarist Ryan Rousseau, but at Alphaville in Bushwick on Saturday night he did what he usually does: he stood to the side of the stage, facing the band at a half-turn from the audience, as if to signal that he’s not entirely the leader, and he’s not entirely doing this for you. (It was the band’s third Brooklyn gig of the weekend, and not officially part of CMJ but piggybacked on to it; the presenter was the music and culture publication AdHoc.)From a distance, especially on the band’s new record, “Negative Feedback Resistor” (Sacred Bones), Destruction Unit’s sound is a hazy cloud of guitars with vocals buried in the mix, reminiscent of the Stooges’ “Fun House” but more decentered. It’s a mess, in fact, now more than ever, seemingly held together only by the bassist Rusty Rousseau — Ryan’s brother — and the drummer Andrew Flores. But this is a band with inside-out logic, and this is a mess that’s also a method. If you’re trying to find the center of a song, you’re not looking in the right place.The band played about two-thirds of the new album on Saturday, all songs with a similar procedure: a squeal of feedback, much too long to be unintentional; a solid guitar riff and a driving beat — usually fast, sometimes medium — and Mr. Rousseau’s barked singing. But then the feedback gained importance, and the central riff started refracting through phase effects and 20 fathoms of reverb, and you were suddenly not listening to a song anymore. You were listening to a process.Advertisement
