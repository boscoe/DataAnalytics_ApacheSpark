What we’re really talking about is our albums of our years. When we (Jon Pareles, Jon Caramanica, Nate Chinen and I) make year-end lists, we apply all sorts of methods. We think about the consistency of our satisfaction with an album, or we gauge the quality of its first impact, or we consider how a new piece of work is responding to a tradition or steering it. We’re reminding ourselves not to forget about epiphanies from February that may or may not feel the same in December. We’re thinking about the general now but also about the future, with last-minute correctives. Kendrick Lamar, yes, but also Vince Staples. Kamasi Washington, yes, but also Steve Coleman. Future, yes, but not as confined to only one album. Also: Mbongwana Star, Ava Rocha, Colleen, Ben Wendel.Advertisement
