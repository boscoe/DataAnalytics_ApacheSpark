In The New York Times Book Review, Adelle Waldman reviews Clancy Martin’s “Love and Lies: An Essay on Truthfulness, Deceit, and the Growth and Care of Erotic Love.” Ms. Waldman writes: “Love and Lies” fuses memoir, pop psychology and Martin’s academic interest in the philosophy of deception, an interest, he tells us, that was born of personal experience. He has long struggled with truthfulness, particularly in his romantic relationships; infidelity contributed to the end of his first two marriages. (He is recently married to his third wife.) But Martin also dislikes the idea that love depends on absolute honesty — he calls this notion “the greatest threat to a mature and enduring conception of erotic love.”It’s a provocative and promising thesis, and Martin proceeds by first discussing in brief what philosophers have said about lying. Then, at far greater length, he lays out a set of ideas about love. This is when the problems begin to mount.
On this week’s podcast, Ms. Waldman discusses “Love and Lies”; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; Dana Goldstein talks about Anya Kamenetz’s “The Test”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Pamela Paul is the host.
