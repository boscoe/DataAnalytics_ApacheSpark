It speaks a local version of an Esperanto based on the variously conceptual, installation and filmic strategies of 1970s art. Liberal use is made of found objects that connote hard work and impoverished lives, often collected from villagers in India, where Mr. Gupta was born and works. Ubiquitous are aluminum and stainless-steel cooking vessels, some new, most dinged and blackened with age. These appear in (and attached to) generic Photo Realist paintings or are strung together with plaster in “Pearl,” a giant necklace that hangs on an amazing old nail.Most impressively, these cooking vessels are amassed in a ragtag large pile punctuated with old faucets and running water and puckishly titled for insiders “This is not a fountain” — after Magritte’s painting “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” (“This is not a pipe”) and Duchamp’s urinal-as-art, “Fountain.”Cherished handmade tools and hookah pipes are placed in matching openings in a thick, alluring floor of pounded earth, suggesting open graves. When Mr. Gupta created this work in a performance piece near Delhi in 1999, the dirt included cow dung, a traditional mixture that is both practical and spiritual in Hindu households.Typical of successful global art, the show’s 20-some works occupy seven immense spaces doing a good imitation of a museum, right down to the explanatory labels for each piece, but I would trust your eyes. Despite the labels’ repeated references to Mr. Gupta’s biographical connections to the pieces, the palpable lack of personal connection, like the setting itself, creates an exploitative aura.Hauser & Wirth 511 West 18th Street, Chelsea Through April 25Advertisement
