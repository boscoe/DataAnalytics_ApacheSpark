The New School for Drama has established the Arts Integrity Initiative, a project that will both study and take an active role in instances in which theatrical and other works are censored or altered without authorization.The initiative will be headed by Howard Sherman, a former executive director of the American Theater Wing and an arts advocate who on his blog, hesherman.com, has tracked various occasions of censorship and violations of artist’s rights, such the cancellation last year of a high school production of “Spamalot” in South Williamsport, Penn., reportedly because of concerns over its gay-themed content.The new initiative will develop courses and offer public programs concerning censorship, copyright protection and “the broader use of the arts as a vehicle for social engagement and justice,” according to a news release.Allegations of censorship and obstruction of artists’ rights have received wide attention in recent years, including continuing copyright lawsuits over David Adjmi’s play “3C,” a dark parody of “Three’s Company,” and the cancellation of high school productions of “Almost, Maine,” “Rent,” and “Sweeney Todd.”Some of those productions were ultimately restored. But Mr. Sherman, in an interview, said that the problem remained extensive. After a speech last year at the annual conference of the Educational Theater Association, he asked attendees how many had proposed shows that had been turned down.“Probably a third raised their hands,” he said. “Then I asked, ‘How many of you have shows you’d like to do that you don’t even bring up?’ Every single hand went up.’ ”Even professional companies, he added, too frequently alter texts without approval from the artists, as when a production of “Hands on a Hardbody” in Houston last year reordered songs and made other changes, another incident highlighted on Mr. Sherman’s blog.“If we have this at the professional level,” he said, “how can we make the argument that high school productions need to respect texts in the same way?”A version of this article appears in print on 02/14/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New School Announces Effort  To Defend ‘Arts Integrity’.
