Nathan Lane will return to Terrence McNally’s comedy “It’s Only a Play” at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater on March 31, the play’s producers announced on Wednesday.  He replaces Martin Short, who has been pinch-hitting since Mr. Lane left on Jan. 4 to honor a previous commitment to appear with Brian Dennehy at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in the Eugene O’Neill drama “The Iceman Cometh.”  Mr. Lane will remain in “It’s Only a Play” until its scheduled closing date of June 7.With the return of Mr. Lane, one of Broadway’s most potent one-two combinations swings back into action.  He and his co-star, Matthew Broderick, have been a powerful box office draw in past productions. Their form has held in “It’s Only a Play,”  which, by the time it opened on Oct. 9, was already taking in more than $1 million a week at the box office,  recouped its capitalization of $3.9 million in December and has twice extended its run. After Mr. Lane departed, the show, while still profitable, saw its box office receipts drop by half.Mr. Lane plays James Wicker, a television star whose best friend, Peter Austin (Matthew Broderick), nervously awaits the reviews of his new show at an opening-night party.  The cast includes F. Murray Abraham, Stockard Channing, Katie Finneran, Maulik Pancholy and Micah Stock.
