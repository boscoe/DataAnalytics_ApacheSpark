The Roy Cockrum Foundation, established recently with part of the proceeds of a $153 million Powerball jackpot, has announced that its second grant will go to the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago, to support a production of “Mary Page Marlowe,” a new play by the Pulitzer Prize-winner Tracy Letts (“August: Osage County”).The foundation, which considers grants by invitation only, is dedicated to helping nonprofit theaters “reach beyond their normal scope of activities and undertake ambitious and creative productions.” Its first grant, described as in the high six or low seven figures, went to the Goodman Theater to support a five-hour adaptation of Roberto Bolaño’s 900-page novel “2666,” which spans a period of 100 years and features far-flung characters drawn to a fictional Mexican border city.Mr. Letts’s play, perhaps more prosaically, is about an accountant from Ohio who has “led an ordinary life, making the difficult decisions we all face as we try to figure out who we really are and what we really want,” according to a news release.A spokesman for Steppenwolf declined to specify the size of the grant, but called it “a large and unprecedented contribution.” The previously-announced production will run from March 31 to May 29, 2016 as part of the theater’s subscription season, has 17 characters and multiple settings and “could not have been done in the normal subscription ‘slot’ without support,” the spokesman said.Mr. Cockrum, 58, a former actor and stage manager who studied theater at Northwestern University near Chicago, became an Episcopal monk in 2003 but left his order several years ago to care for his parents in Tennessee, where he won the lottery last summer.In a statement, he called Mr. Letts “one of the great playwrights of our time,” adding: “It is necessary that we as a society support our artists’ big dreams and financially enable our important theater companies such as Steppenwolf to create new contributions to the theatrical canon.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Foundation Makes Second Theater Grant.
