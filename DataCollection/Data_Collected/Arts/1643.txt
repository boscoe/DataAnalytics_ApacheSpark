Make that house of prayer: The dramatic 19th-century red sandstone West Park Presbyterian Church is a fab home for this fusion of Greek tragedy and Spanish passion.“Antigona,” which had its premiere in July and receives a welcome six-week encore this season (starting Dec. 11), contains text (spoken in Spanish, written in English), live music that is both rousing and foreboding played by an onstage band, smart stagecraft and top-notch dancing, especially by the flamenco virtuoso Soledad Barrio in the title role. It’s a visual feast and effective theater, yes, but more rewardingly it’s a powerfully visceral experience. The thunderous stomps of the skilled ensemble strike like heaven’s anger, ricocheting around the sanctuary, predicting doom. It makes the pews shiver.
