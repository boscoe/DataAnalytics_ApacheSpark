This week he conducts performances of Nielsen’s Clarinet Concerto with the orchestra’s new principal clarinetist, Anthony McGill, taking on the solo part that flips through emotions ranging from sardonic humor to deep melancholy. The program also includes Ravel’s “Valses nobles et sentimentales” and selections from Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake.” (Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, nyphil.org.) As a member of the string quartet Brooklyn Rider and the Silk Road Ensemble, Johnny Gandelsman is one of the most versatile violinists around. At Bargemusic, he offers a traversal of Bach’s complete sonatas and partitas for unaccompanied violin that reflects his study of historically informed performance using a Baroque-style bow. (Saturday and next Sunday, Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, bargemusic.org.)Advertisement
