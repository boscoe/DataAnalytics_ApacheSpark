Adele has set a 56-date North American tour, to begin July 5 and 6 at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul and continue through Nov. 14 and 15, at the Palacio de los Deportes in Mexico City.The arena tour, Adele’s first major outing in five years, will include six nights at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, on Aug. 5, 6, 9, 10, 12 and 13, and six nights at Madison Square Garden, on Sept. 19, 20, 22, 23, 25 and 26. Tickets for all shows will go on sale Thursday through Adele’s website.It will follow her European tour, which will begin in Belfast in February. That tour has already sold out, according to an announcement Monday morning.Adele has said going on the road is a daunting proposition. “Performing to that many people for every night, for that long, I find something very lonely about it,” she said in interviews for a feature in The New York Times. “Which sounds weird, because you’re performing for like, 20,000 people every night, but you leave on your own. You don’t go home and, like, share a bed with 20,000 people and have a little pajama party and watch movies. Obviously I’m going to have my friends with me and I’m going to have my family with me, but the thought of how lonely that could be frightens me more than the load of doing a worldwide tour.”On Monday night NBC will broadcast “Adele Live in New York City,” a concert film shot at Radio City Music Hall last month, in Adele’s first concert in four years.Adele’s “25” was released Nov. 20 and sold a record-breaking 3.38 million copies in its first week.
