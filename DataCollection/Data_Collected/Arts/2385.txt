Superman flying with a GoPro, an intricately choreographed OK Go music video and a trip inside a volcano will  all be part of  the first New York City Drone Film Festival, organizers announced Wednesday.The festival, beginning March 7, was organized by Randy Scott Slavin, who specializes in aerial cinematography. “The festival wants to be a bridge between the public sphere — their understanding about these flying robots that people might be scared of — and the art, which is amazing,” Mr. Slavin said. “It’s giving a tripod wings.”Because Mr. Slavin didn’t know what kinds of submissions he would get, he waited until after he and a committee saw all the films before creating competition categories like “Architecture,” “Narrative” and “Dronie” (a selfie taken with a drone). The festival judges include the director Steve Carr, the producer Scott Macaulay and the NY1 anchor Pat Kiernan.Mr. Slavin said the festival — now sold out — represents another step forward for drones in film. Drones have been used for “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Skyfall,” and were approved for use on film sets in the United States last September by the Federal Aviation Administration. “I think these are going to be on every film set in the future,” Mr. Slavin said. “I’m sure of it.” .The festival will take place at the Directors Guild of America Theater.
