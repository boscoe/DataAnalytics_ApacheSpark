Anna Deavere Smith, known to millions of “West Wing” fans as President Josiah Bartlet’s national security adviser, will be returning to Washington on April 6 to take up a different role: the 44th Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities. The annual Jefferson Lecture, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, is considered the federal government’s highest honor in the humanities. Ms. Deavere’s talk, titled “On the Road: A Search for American Character,” will include reflections on and excerpts from the documentary theater projects she began developing in the early 1980s as a means of “transforming the words of ordinary people into dramatic monologue,” according to a news release. Tickets, which are free, become available in mid-March at www.NEH.gov. The lecture will also be streamed online.Ms. Deavere Smith’s works include the solo shows “Fires in the Mirror: Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and Other Identities,” in which she took on the words and gestures of 29 individuals to explore tensions between the Orthodox Jewish and black communities in the wake of the 1991 turmoil there, and “Twilight: Los Angeles 1992,” for which she interviewed more than 200 people affected by the upheaval that followed the acquittal of Los Angeles police officers charged with assaulting Rodney King. She is currently working on “The Pipeline Project,” an exploration of the so-called school-to-prison pipeline that funnels low-income and minority students into the criminal justice system.
