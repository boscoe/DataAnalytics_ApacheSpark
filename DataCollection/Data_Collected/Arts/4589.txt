How do you say goodbye to the late-night host who has long been a source of inspiration, but who happens to anchor a directly competing program? If you’re one of the late-night entertainers who owes a spiritual debt of gratitude to David Letterman but still has the professional obligation of hosting a show, there is no single answer to the question of what to do on May 20, when Mr. Letterman’s last show runs on CBS.Jimmy Kimmel, the host of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” is so far the only rival broadcaster who has chosen to substitute a repeat of his program on the night of Mr. Letterman’s grand finale. Mr. Kimmel will still broadcast new episodes on the other four nights of this competitive sweeps week. But Mr. Kimmel said he was giving May 20 a pass out of deference to Mr. Letterman, who is a cultural hero of his.“I have too much respect for Dave to do anything that would distract viewers from watching his final show,” Mr. Kimmel said in an email. “Plus, I’ll probably be crying all day, which makes it hard to work.”NBC’s “Tonight” show, the late-night institution that provided an early launching pad for Mr. Letterman’s career (before it broke his heart) and is now hosted by Jimmy Fallon, will run a new episode opposite the final “Late Show.” A press representative for “Tonight” said the program was “in originals that entire week.” At TBS, Conan O’Brien, who succeeded Mr. Letterman at NBC’s “Late Night” and has been effusive in his praise of him, would seem like a likely candidate to pay tribute to Mr. Letterman in some form. But a press representative for “Conan” said only that the program plans to run a new show on the night of May 20.Over at Comedy Central, Jon Stewart and Larry Wilmore are off the hook: their programs, “The Daily Show” and “The Nightly Show,” are both in repeats that week.
