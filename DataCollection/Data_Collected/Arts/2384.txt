LONDON — Employees at the National Gallery here have voted in favor of a five-day strike in response to the museum’s decision to outsource visitor and security services to a private company. The change would affect approximately 400 of the 600 staff members. About 250 employees who are members of the Public and Commercial Services union voted in favor of the strike, which is planned for Feb. 3 to 7. Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the union, said in a statement that the museum’s plan “risks damaging the worldwide reputation of what is one of the U.K.’s greatest cultural assets.”The gallery, which like many British museums does not have an entrance fee, cited decreased government funding and the need to find new revenue as reasons for the decision. “We need to be able to guarantee the provision of essential security and services,”  the gallery said in a statement in an article in The Guardian in July, when these changes were first proposed. The statement added that any staff members affected would be protected and there would be no layoffs.Nicholas Penny, the director of the National Gallery, defended the decision to privatize staff employment, which follows a similar move by London’s Imperial War Museum in 2013. In a letter published in The Guardian on Tuesday, Mr. Penny disputed several points raised in an article protesting the decision, writing, “We recognise that change creates uncertainty but believe it is essential to enable us to deliver an enhanced service to our 6.4 million annual visitors for many years to come.”The gallery is expected to remain open throughout the strike.
