Iggy Azalea’s spring tour, scheduled to have started next month, has been postponed until the fall “due to tour production delays,” according to a statement on Tuesday.Ms. Azalea’s “Great Escape Tour,” one of the highest-profile pop tours of the season, was to have started on April 14 in Fresno, Calif., and continue through May. Now it has been moved to September, with its routing schedule slightly changed. It will open on Sept. 18 in San Diego and continue through Oct. 27 in Glendale, Ariz., coming to Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Oct. 11 and the Prudential Center in Newark the next day.The postponement comes as Ms. Azalea, an Australian-born rapper, has apparently ceded control of her social media accounts to her handlers. “Until further notice Iggy’s Instagram will be run by management,” a post announced four days ago. “Iggy is taking a break from social media.” Ms. Azalea was nominated for four Grammy Awards last month and had one of the biggest hits of last year with “Fancy,” but she has also clashed with American rappers like Azealia Banks over issues of race in hip-hop.This week news reports surfaced about rumored friction between Ms. Azalea and her various business representatives. Billboard, which was the first to report the official postponement of the tour, quoted an unnamed “rep” as saying that “there’s no truth to the rumor that there’s any conflict between her and her management.”On Tuesday afternoon, a post on Ms. Azalea’s official Twitter account said: Iggz HQ: The tour getting pushed back only means that it’ll be way more amazing than it would’ve been in April.
