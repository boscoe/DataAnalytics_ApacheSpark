LOS ANGELES — In a surprise announcement intended to highlight the 25th anniversary of its midnight screening series, the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday — at the stroke of midnight, Mountain time — unveiled its 2016 late-night lineup. Several selections feature celebrity offspring, including Francesca Eastwood and Lily-Rose Depp.The midnight series, where “Saw” and “The Blair Witch Project” were born, will include nine films at the next festival, which is scheduled for Jan. 21-31 in Park City, Utah. Notable selections include the frontier-themed “Outlaws and Angels,” which stars Ms. Eastwood, Chad Michael Murray and Luke Wilson; and “Antibirth,” which stars Natasha Lyonne and Chloë Sevigny and is set in a desolate community of drug-addled marines.Kevin Smith’s semi-comedic “Yoga Hosers,” about two high school girls who uncover an evil presence, is a family affair: The film co-stars his daughter, Harley Quinn Smith and  Ms. Depp, acting beside her father, Johnny Depp. And “31,” the latest from Rob Zombie, finds his wife, Sheri Moon Zombie, in the story of five friends who are kidnapped and forced to play a violent game against evil clowns.All of the 2016 selections were directed by men, but seven have women as the lead characters, which is fairly unusual for Sundance’s midnight series.A version of this article appears in print on 11/24/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Sundance Announces Late-Night Lineup.
