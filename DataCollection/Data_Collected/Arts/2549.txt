Wherever there is a strong Internet connection, there will be “The Beast of Yucca Flats.”That and dozens of other “Mystery Science Theater 3000” episodes will be among the classic television programming available for free streaming with the launch of Shout! Factory TV, a new digital streaming service from Shout! Factory, which has previously specialized in selling contemporary and classic DVDs and CDs.The digital streaming service will be available beginning Thursday at shoutfactorytv.com, on mobile devices, Internet-ready televisions and through Roku. Much like the Hulu streaming service, the content will be supported by advertising, with commercials appearing where they would have when the programs aired on television, said Gene Pao, Shout! Factory’s vice president of digital. But unlike many streaming services, Shout! Factory TV will be free across all platforms.Initial offerings will include 1,000 hours of programming from the Shout! Factory catalog, including “Father Knows Best” (seasons 1-3), “The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,” “A Night in Casablanca” (starring Groucho Marx), and “Steve Martin Stand-Up Showcase,” with plans to add 200 additional hours of programming each month.Original long- and short-form content is also planned, as well as special live events, like a live webcast from last year’s Power Rangers convention in Pasadena, Calif.The service was a “natural next step” for the company, Mr. Pao said, especially at a time when “the DVD business as a whole is declining.”“Our DVD business continues to be pretty strong,” he said, “but we see digital as a way to really accelerate the growth of the company, and also to provide a hedge in case the bottom falls out of the DVD market.”
