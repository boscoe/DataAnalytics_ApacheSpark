No shrubbery or other sacrifices will be need when the Tribeca Film Festival embarks on a quest next month to honor  the 40th anniversary of “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” with special screenings and an appearance by the surviving members of the influential comedy troupe, festival organizers said Wednesday. John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, who reunited last summer in London for several live shows, will be on hand April 24 at the Beacon Theater when “Holy Grail” is shown.  The festival-within-a-festival, running April 24-26,  will also screen “Monty Python’s  Meaning of Life,” “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” and a new documentary, “Monty Python — The Meaning of Live,” about preparations for the 2014 shows. The performers plan to take part in Q&As after the screenings, the organizers said.In a statement announcing the tribute, Mr. Palin said: “The Pythons are looking forward very much to the Tribeca Film Festival and the chance to meet anyone who can remember why we made ‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail.’ All we know is that it was a documentary about coconuts that rather lost its way.” Tickets to “Holy Grail” will be on sale beginning March 23 at tribecafilm.com.A version of this article appears in print on 03/12/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Monty Python Reunion At Tribeca Film Festival.
