With her short hair, multiple ear piercings and penchant for wearing a leather jacket, Kath Mainland gives off an aura of hipness that has long seemed appropriate for her role in helping to oversee the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the enormous arts festival that pops up annually in the Scottish capital and includes a lot of scrappy productions. But after seven years as chief executive of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, the organizational force behind the event, Ms. Mainland is leaving. Beginning in February she will take over as executive director of the Melbourne Festival.“I love the Fringe and I have lived in Edinburgh for over 20 years because of it,” Ms. Mainland said in a statement. “I’m immensely proud of the Fringe Society staff and their achievements. I have had the opportunity to work with an amazingly hardworking, imaginative and talented group of people.”Ms. Mainland joined the society in 1991 as an administrative assistant and became general manager of the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2005 before taking on her current post in 2009. During her tenure,the Fringe has grown steadily; the 2015 festival reported almost 2.3 million tickets sold, an increase of more than 5 percent over the prior year. The number of productions, too, has grown by more than 1,200 during her tenure. (The 2015 festival included more than 3,300 shows in 313 venues, with 49 countries represented.)In Australia, Ms. Mainland will join another new leader, Jonathan Holloway, who has recently begun his tenure as artistic director there. And in Edinburgh, where the 2016 festival will run Aug. 5-29, a search is under way for Ms. Mainland’s successor.
