And then I will give the character a name, and by probing him and questioning him, I begin to find out things I need to know about the character, and out of that will emerge a story.”What makes this a particularly satisfying “American Masters,” especially for theater lovers, is its generous helping of clips of well-regarded actors like Phylicia Rashad and Roscoe Orman performing excerpts from Wilson’s plays. Having heard his description of how his characters start out, we now get to see their fully formed selves.It’s easy to give a biographical sketch of a cultural figure, and Wilson’s improbable emergence from a hardscrabble life makes a good one, but it’s harder to put across the nature and importance of that figure’s creative output. This episode does that quite well. It makes you want to watch or rewatch Wilson’s cycle of plays about his Pittsburgh neighborhood — “The Piano Lesson,” “Fences,” “Jitney” and the rest.The disappointment of the program is that it doesn’t probe too deeply into Wilson’s combative side. That’s odd because the episode is called “August Wilson: The Ground on Which I Stand,” a reference to a line from an attention-getting speech he delivered in 1996 about black theater. His exchanges with the critic and educator Robert Brustein about race and the purpose of theater jolted the often complacent theatrical world but feel underrepresented here.Yet the program still conveys what Wilson’s work and the respect it was accorded (including two Pulitzer Prizes) meant in terms of defining the black experience to a general audience, not to mention furthering the careers of many black actors. It’s a contribution worth revisiting at this particular cultural moment.American MastersAugust Wilson: The Ground on Which I StandOn PBS stations Friday night (check local listings).Produced by WQED and Thirteen Productions LLC’s “American Masters” for WNET.
