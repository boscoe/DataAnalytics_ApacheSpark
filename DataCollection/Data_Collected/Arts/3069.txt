Vicky Shick’s “Pathétique, Miniatures in Detail,” which Vicky Shick Dance offers as part of the Harkness Dance Festival, is composed of vignettes showing oddities of behavior.These scenes flicker to a score by Elise Kermani that combines wisps of Beethoven’s “Pathétique” Sonata with layers of other sounds, and the costumes, designed by Barbara Kilpatrick, rustle and rattle. Most Harkness Festival productions begin with the choreographer analyzing a work in a stripped-down presentation, after which it is danced in its fully theatrical version. But Ms. Shick will begin with what she calls a “playful exaggeration” of “Pathétique,” in which she adds to or rearranges elements of its choreography, costumes and music. After these details have accumulated, she will show the piece in what she considers its finished form. (8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 3 p.m. next Sunday, 92nd Street Y; 92y.org.)Advertisement
