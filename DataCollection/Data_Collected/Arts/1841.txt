New Year’s Eve (Thursday) Believe it or not, Lower Manhattan used to have all the fun. Before 1904, Trinity Church was New York’s gathering point for crowds to ring in the New Year. But then The New York Times opened its building in the recently renamed Times Square and began throwing the city’s new flagship celebration. The first ball to drop, a 700-pound iron-and-wood ball illuminated by 100 light bulbs, was lowered from The Times’s flagpole to welcome in 1908.This year’s ball, weighing 11,875 pounds, is covered in 2,688 Waterford crystal triangles and 32,256 lights. And the party — with musical performances, fireworks and the brightness of Times Square — has the dazzle to match. Last year’s musicians included Taylor Swift; this year’s full lineup will be announced on Saturday. Thousands are expected to crowd Midtown, and while early birds get the best view (the sound system will be set up where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross), large screens around One Times Square are meant to provide an egalitarian experience. More information is at newyearseve.nyc.If that sounds overwhelming, Brooklyn has a more modest outdoor countdown. Starting at 11 p.m., the borough president’s office and the Prospect Park Alliance will host a party with live performances and hot chocolate at Grand Army Plaza, on the northwest corner of the park. Fireworks will welcome the new year at midnight. Details are at prospectpark.org.American Museum of Natural History: ‘Countdown to Zero’ (continuing) Smallpox is the only human disease to have been eradicated, but what about Guinea worm, polio, malaria and others?
