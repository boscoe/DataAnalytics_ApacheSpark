LOS ANGELES — Another one bites the dust: “Our Brand Is Crisis” collected a dismal $3.4 million at North American theaters over the weekend, extending a cold streak for Warner Bros. and exacerbating concerns in Hollywood about the recent failure of high-profile dramas, including “Steve Jobs” and “The Walk,” to find audiences.“The Martian” (2oth Century Fox) remained at No. 1, taking in about $11.4 million, for a five-week total of $182.8 million.Starring Sandra Bullock as a political strategist, the heavily marketed “Our Brand Is Crisis,” which received weak reviews, cost roughly $28 million to make. Warner, which has suffered flops like “Pan” and “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” is now counting on a pair of dramas to salvage its year: “Creed,” a boxing movie that attempts to revive the “Rocky” series, and “In the Heart of the Sea,” about the sinking of a whaling ship.“We’re very proud of the film,” Jeffrey B. Goldstein, Warner’s executive vice president for domestic distribution, said in an email on Sunday about Ms. Bullock’s movie. “We had hoped to get a wider audience, and I’m disappointed with this result.”Hollywood always struggles when Halloween falls on a Saturday, but two other new releases also disappointed, taking in less than analysts had predicted based on surveys that track interest. “Burnt” (the Weinstein Company), starring Bradley Cooper as a bad-boy chef, took in about $5 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. “Burnt” cost a little under $20 million to make.“Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse” (Paramount Pictures), which cost roughly $15 million, collected $1.8 million; several theater chains refused to play the horror movie after Paramount announced plans to rush it to video-on-demand systems.A version of this article appears in print on 11/02/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Our Brand Is Crisisu2019 Flops at Box Office.
