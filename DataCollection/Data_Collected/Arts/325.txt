Since it opened in 1987, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Iris and Gerald B. Cantor Roof Garden has sprouted all manner of art – giant safety pin to balloon dog to towering bamboo village – much of it newly made or conceived for the warm-weather space, overlooking Central Park and sitting atop one of the world’s best collections of art. Next year, the British sculptor Cornelia Parker, known for work in which everyday objects have been smashed, blasted or stretched into another kind of existence, will take on the roof from May through October, with commissioned work that has not yet been determined.“In her large-scale installations, Cornelia opens our eyes to the special qualities – and sometimes darker significance – of familiar places and things we tend to overlook,” said Sheena Wagstaff, the Met’s chairwoman of modern and contemporary art, in a statement. In an interview later, she added that Ms. Parker’s work would pursue “one particular idea that deals with iconic images of American architecture.”Ms. Parker is perhaps best known for “Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View,” from 1991, a reconstruction of an exploded shed in which every collected shard has been suspended in air, lighted from within by a bulb that casts a sinister comic-book shadow play on the walls. The work is sometimes on display in the collection of the Tate Modern in London, where Ms. Wagstaff previously served as chief curator.
