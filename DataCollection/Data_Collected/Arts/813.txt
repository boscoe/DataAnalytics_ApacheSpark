Daytime auctions don’t usually make big news. But at Sotheby’s Taubman Modern and Contemporary Art sale on Thursday afternoon, the results, which totaled $42.7 million with fees, left the auction house feeling encouraged enough to announce that it was on track to cover the $500 million it had guaranteed in selling the collection of its former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman. With 123 scheduled lots, the estimate for the sale was $30.2 million to $43.4 million.“We expect to cover the Taubman guarantee in its entirety,” said Tad Smith, Sotheby’s president and chief executive, in a statement, noting that the day sale — coupled with Wednesday night’s auction — represented 90 percent of the value of the property in the Taubman collection of art and objects. More than half of all the lots Thursday sold above their high estimates, Sotheby’s said. There are still two more sales from the collection to come – one of American art, on Nov. 18, and one of Old Masters on Jan. 27.One of the highlights was a circa 1906 Richard Gerstl portrait purchased for the Neue Galerie, which sold for $3.7 million, or four times the high estimate, setting a record for the artist.Wednesday’s sale, which brought mixed results, left many art insiders concerned about the prospects for the remaining auctions at all three houses. The sale brought $377 million with fees, just squeaking past the $375 million low estimate.
