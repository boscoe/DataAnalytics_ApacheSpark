A Robert Rauschenberg “combine” painting from 1955 that once belonged to his collaborator and lover Jasper Johns is among the 42 artworks that the husband and wife collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson have donated to the Art Institute of Chicago — a gift valued at nearly  $500 million. The gift also features important early paintings by Mr. Johns, including a “Target” image from 1961 and an “Alphabet” painting from 1959; nine paintings by Andy Warhol; four by Gerhard Richter; and six photographs by Richard Prince and six by Cindy Sherman.In order to secure this gift, which dramatically improves its Pop Art and Contemporary holdings, the Art Institute agreed to keep all of the work on display for a minimum of 50 years. Mr. Edlis, 89, emigrated from Austria to the United States during the Holocaust and made his fortune in plastics, founding the Apollo Plastics Corporation.A version of this article appears in print on 04/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Art Institute of Chicago Gets a Huge Gift.
