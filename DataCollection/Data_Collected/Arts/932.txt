She was never given much to do in the show, but I’ll miss her waxy obsessiveness anyway.Being murdered by someone in a red devil costume was no doubt traumatic for the candle obsessive, whose real name was apparently Jennifer (who knew?), but the character who suffered the most trauma Tuesday was Grace. She saw the back story she had imagined for herself ripped to shreds, primarily by two Scotland Yard investigators hired by Chanel to try to pin the murders on her or Zayday. They determined that she was not the baby in the bathtub and that her mother was the boozy floozy seen in the initial flashback. Mom had gone on to a life of crime, including, as Chanel put it, “drunken driving with a baby on top of the car.”The best thing about the episode: when Chanel interrupted those Scotland Yard guys long enough to ask them, “Would you please stop peppering your speech with ‘indeed’?” The second-best thing: Denise the security guard, more or less invisible last week, really asserted herself this week, proclaiming herself in charge of Kappa House and bullying Chanel by threatening to take her boyfriend, Chad.Also not to be messed with: Dean Munsch, who we learned had picked up fighting tips from an Asian lover, and Grace’s father, who got to ominously stare into a mirror, a classic horror device. The possibility of two babies somehow being involved in the origin story; Jamie Lee Curtis beating up someone in a Scalia mask; a Joaquin Phoenix reference; a commercial for the new “Star Wars” movie – my head is spinning.
