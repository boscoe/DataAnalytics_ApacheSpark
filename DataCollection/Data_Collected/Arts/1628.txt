As Sunday turns into Monday, it is serving up a midnight premiere of “The Robot Chicken Christmas Special: X-Mas United,” its latest effort to root out and kill holiday smarminess. By the time this demented 15-minute show is over, you’ll know numerous ways to kill a rabid elf and possibly never be able to watch “The Polar Express” again.“Robot Chicken” is a stop-motion animated series that relentlessly skewers pop-culture phenomena and sacred cows. That has resulted in some memorable holiday specials. Last year’s featured a character called Baby New Year Resolution Enforcer who meted out rather severe punishments to those who did not keep their promises. This year, the character known as Robot Chicken Nerd goes to the North Pole in the belief that Santa Claus is his real father, sort of a reverse “Elf.” And speaking of elves, it turns out that exposure to outsiders can have a drastic effect on their dispositions; soon the nerd and Santa are running for their lives, automatic weapons blazing.By the end, you’ll have encountered a Lindbergh baby reference, a homage to “Dr. Strangelove” and a surprise revelation about the lad’s parentage, among many other things too ribald to mention. And those made-for-TV holiday movies will, at least for the moment, be a distant memory.Advertisement
