CreditByron Smith for The New York Times        The seemingly dry, narrow-gauge art of the Conceptual giant On Kawara is profound — profoundly simple, human and deep. And, as proved by that artist’s first full-dress retrospective, “On Kawara — Silence” at the Guggenheim Museum, its quality is most apparent when it is seen in quantity.Mr. Kawara, who was born in Japan in 1932, lived mainly in New York and died last summer at the age of 81. He assiduously avoided the art world spotlight, dedicating his creative life to measuring the passage of time. His tallying took the form of paintings of numerical dates made on the one they depicted; telegrams announcing that he was still alive; postcards recording the time he arose that morning (the “I Got Up” series), as well as sundry maps, calendars and lists — starting with ones detailing the people he encountered in a given day and culminating in three-ring notebooks enumerating hundreds of thousands of years, past and future.Mr. Kawara was a founding member of Conceptual art’s first and greatest generation, along with artists like John Baldessari, Sol LeWitt, Hanne Darboven and Joseph Kosuth, and his meditative, diaristic work is among its signal achievements. His work has a wonderful economy and clarity, and also a strange combination of self-effacement and freakish control. Even so, it has always seemed to rank high on the “best in small doses” art list, and never more so than when the list of works planned for the Guggenheim show arrived at my door. It indicated that there would be almost two full ramps of the artist’s small, dark-gray date paintings, a total of 90. A forced march upward through visually wan repetition seemed likely.But this show, is an enthralling experience. It makes of the Guggenheim spiral a vortex suffused with consciousness of life’s supreme ruler, in both its quotidian daily unfolding and its enveloping, almost incomprehensible grandeur. It gives you time as local, global and cosmic; as solitude, relationship and motion through space, for the most part in terse, adamantly visual ways. The exceptions are “One Million Years: Past” and “One Million Years: Future,” an ongoing performance that will command space with sound. On Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays during museum hours, a pair of volunteers (a man and a woman) will sit at a table on the rotunda’s floor, reciting for one hour in alternation the years from the notebooks in which Mr. Kawara listed one million going forward and one million going backward. If it sounds arcane, keep in mind that nearly all the slots for volunteers are already reserved.AdvertisementThe show was organized by Jeffrey Weiss, the Guggenheim’s senior curator, with Anne Wheeler, an assistant curator, and installed in 12 sections according to a plan devised by Mr. Kawara. It is supremely beautiful, and confirms the continuing adaptability of Frank Lloyd Wright’s eccentric Guggenheim building, and the skill of the museum’s design staff. The show unspools up the ramp like time itself. And the 90 date paintings look especially good, progressively announcing the days from “Jan. 1, 1970” to “Mar. 31, 1970” in neat Helvetica lettering, hand-painted in white on the gray, starkly yet extravagantly celebrating time.AdvertisementLike a true Conceptualist, Mr. Kawara stuck to the facts and also transcended them, endowing them with a resonant appeal and a sense of form as fine-tuned as any Minimalist sculptor’s. His art helped shape Conceptualism’s love of uninflected information. It fused the movement’s basic duality of image plus text into an instantly legible unit before it actually existed. It also bridged the gap between the modernist monochrome as devotional object and the Duchampian ready-made. For example, each date painting comes in a cardboard box lined with a newspaper clipping from the day it was made, mostly from The New York Times. Nearly all of these are displayed with the paintings at the Guggenheim, surrounding their calm specificity with history’s chaos. The combination also pinpoints reciprocal processes: The way humans both generate and consume information in the mere act of living.Mr. Kawara’s strictly determined formats evolved over more than a decade of trial, error, education and distillation. He began precociously with paintings of surrealistically deformed bodies that were inspired by the horror of Hiroshima, when he was just out of high school. These works made him something of a star in Tokyo’s small, determined postwar art world, an experience he did not enjoy. In 1959, he followed his father, an engineer, to Mexico City, attending art school and traveling around the country, finding that he loved being on the move.From 1962 to 1964 he was back and forth between New York and Paris, playing a game of catch-up that was soon ahead of its time. He made about 200 drawings that dallied and cavorted among many of the radical ideas that Conceptual art — not yet named — would soon develop.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Their motifs include delicate stripes and grids like those of the Minimalist painter Agnes Martin, yet also parody the style, as in a drawing of a pink box sprouting irregular black wires. Minimalism frazzled, after a hard day at the office. Other drawings depict installation pieces that fill rooms with networks of string. There are savvy intimations of earthworks and performances and numerous signs of Kawarian things to come: interests in language, maps, lists and numbers; an airmail envelope addressed to the artist. Especially prescient is a meticulous all-capitals Helvetica rendering of the word EGG, which echoes the earliest work here, from 1963: a drawing that simply and tantalizingly states “SOMETHING.”Settling in New York, Mr. Kawara found he couldn’t realize his installation ideas to his satisfaction; also that he was too interested in language to pursue abstraction. By 1965 he was within sight of his “something”: a triptych of magenta paintings that ricochets suggestively among the phrases “One Thing,” “1965” and “Viet-Nam.” Also from 1965, “Location,” a gray painting, announces the more specific if obscure data of longitude and latitude. Nearby, his first date painting, “Jan. 4, 1966,” small and compact and on a blue ground, sits in a vitrine like a relic. He would soon expand his palette, not only to gray but to bright red, and evolve eight sizes of canvas, up to a bit over four by six feet. The exceptions are the three paintings, roughly five by seven feet, executed on July 16, 20 and 21, 1969 — three days when the world was riveted by the moon landing. Each sits majestically in its own bay here, the size commensurate with the event’s historical weight.If the date paintings are like stones surrounded by the ripples of the news of the day, the other strong works here, Mr. Kawara’s various first-person series, take us deep into the individual, where body and mind and time and space are known on an intimate basis, and we all struggle to generate our own ripples. The “I Got Up” postcards are installed in big plexiglass screens. Both their images and messages are visible, the last in stamped Helvetica letters stating the time the artist arose that morning, along with the location of both sender and receiver. Here, movement through space and location are specified, as well as relationships and social networks, and national monuments and preoccupations. Above all, the text-image duality of Conceptual art receives some humorous twists.Mr. Kawara’s later work lapses into Conceptual obscurantism, but also shows his obsessive penchant for letting information generate more information, more structure. “Journals” consists of 48 notebooks documenting the date paintings in terms of their colors, dates and titles — which can derive from their accompanying newspaper clipping or more personal data. Occasionally wires cross: One painting is titled “I Got Up at 12:53 p.m. and Painted This.”The exhibition’s final ramp is a relatively unruly arrangement of 48 date paintings, one from each year Mr. Kawara made them. They unwind down, not up, the ramp, revealing the range of sizes, colors and languages and implying that there is more to be gleaned by retracing your steps.I also look forward to hearing “One Million Years” being performed, the years passing almost like seconds and drifting up Wright’s great spiral.“On Kawara — Silence” runs through May 3 at the Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street; 212-423-3500, guggenheim.org.
