The Dowager Countess is done and there’s no use in trying to convince her otherwise. Maggie Smith, who plays the quip-ready matriarch on the hit British series that just finished its fifth season in the United States, said in an interview with The Sunday Times that she was done with the character following the upcoming season. “They say this is the last one, and I can’t see how it could go on,” she said.Neither the show’s creator, Julian Fellowes, nor an executive producer, Gareth Neame, has confirmed that the show will run past Season 6. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Fellowes said, “It’s not really my decision. I don’t own ‘Downton Abbey’ now. NBC Universal owns ‘Downton Abbey.’ So I could walk away, but I wouldn’t walk away. It’s too much my baby. It won’t go on forever — I’m not a believer in that. But I can’t immediately now tell you where the end will be.”Mr. Fellowes plans to begin work on a pilot later this year for a new NBC drama titled “The Gilded Age,” which is set in New York in the 19th century. As to her character’s age, Ms. Smith, 80, said in her Sunday Times interview, “I mean, I certainly can’t keep going. To my knowledge I must be 110 by now.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/03/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Smith to Leave u2018Downton Abbeyu2019 After Next Season.
