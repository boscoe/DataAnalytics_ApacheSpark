Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night? Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic? Well, perhaps the Library of Congress can help alleviate those sensations when it adds “Ghostbusters” and 24 other classic movies to its National Film Registry. On Wednesday the library is to announce that “Ghostbusters,” the 1984 comedy that starred Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd as wisecracking investigators of paranormal activity, has been chosen for preservation in its film registry, along with motion pictures like “Top Gun,” “L.A. Confidential” and “The Shawshank Redemption.” In a news release the Library of Congress said that the films selected for its registry “epitomize the diversity and richness of the nation’s cinematic heritage,” and had been chosen “because of their cultural, historic or aesthetic importance.” Other works selected this year include “Being There,” Hal Ashby’s comedy-drama about an oracular gardener; the Douglas Sirk melodrama “Imitation of Life”; the silent 1920 “The Mark of Zorro,” starring Douglas Fairbanks; the Preston Sturges comedy “Hail the Conquering Hero”; and the 1946 educational film “The Story of Menstruation,” produced by the Walt Disney Company and sponsored by Kimberly-Clark.
