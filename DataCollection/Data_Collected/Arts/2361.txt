Plácido Domingo, the general director of the Los Angeles Opera, plans to open the company’s 30th anniversary season in September with a feat few other impresarios could attempt:  He will sing the title role in Puccini’s one-act opera “Gianni Schicchi” and then, after the intermission, move down to the orchestra pit to conduct Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci.”The double bill —  a revival of Woody Allen’s production of “Gianni Schicchi” and Franco Zeffirelli’s “Pagliacci” — will open a season of six opera productions on the company’s main stage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  The season will also include the Los Angeles premiere of Jake Heggie’s “Moby-Dick,” conducted by the company’s music director, James Conlon;  a production of Bellini’s “Norma” reuniting the highly-praised pairing of Angela Meade and Jamie Barton; a revival of Barrie Kosky’s silent-film inspired production of Mozart’s “The Magic Flute”; and Puccini’s “La Bohème” and “Madame Butterfly.”Gustavo Dudamel, the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will make his company debut, conducting the final two performances of “La Bohème” in June.The company will also perform elsewhere in Los Angeles: it will give the West Coast premiere of Missy Mazzoli’s “Song for the Uproar” at Redcat, present Philip Glass performing his new score for the “Dracula” film starring Bela Lugosi in the restored move palace at the Ace Hotel, and feature the premiere of David Lang’s “Anatomy Theater.” The season will run from Sept. 12 through June 19.A version of this article appears in print on 01/29/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Singing Conductor: Busy Night for Domingo.
