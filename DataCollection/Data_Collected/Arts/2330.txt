Schubert’s music, in which a single moment can blissfully expand into a spacious, contemplative arc, offers an ideal forum to explore the concept of time. When devising the program for his two coming concerts at the 92nd Street Y, the pianist Shai Wosner was inspired by differing notions of time — comparing the multitasking, contemporary 140-character attention span with Schubert’s era, when a seven-minute piece was deemed short.The program offers works by Schubert and by contemporary composers he influenced. On Wednesday, Mr. Wosner will perform Schubert’s Sonata in A (D. 959), and the Parker Quartet will play Kurtag’s “Aus der Ferne V” for String Quartet, which reflects the second movement of Schubert’s turbulent “Death and the Maiden” quartet, also on the lineup. Missy Mazzoli’s alluring “Isabelle Eberhardt’s Dreams of Pianos” blends Schubertian fragments into a dramatic, digitally enhanced soundscape.On Sunday, the program includes Schubert’s “Moments musicaux” for Piano (D. 780) and Kurtag’s “Moments Musicaux” for String Quartet, as well as Schubert’s beloved “Trout” Quintet. (At 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday and 3 p.m. next Sunday at the 92nd Street Y; 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500, 92y.org.)A version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Moments in Time With Schubert.
