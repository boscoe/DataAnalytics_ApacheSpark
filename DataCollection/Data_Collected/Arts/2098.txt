A few dozen of them will gather to pay respects, in words and music, at his memorial celebration on Tuesday at Town Hall. Organized by his widow, Ruth Cameron, the service will include two of his flagship ensembles: the Liberation Music Orchestra, featuring the composer Carla Bley and, for this occasion, the bassist Steve Swallow; and Quartet West, with Scott Colley on bass. Members of Mr. Haden’s musical family — his son, the singer-songwriter Josh Haden, and his daughters, known as the Haden Triplets — will appear.Also scheduled to perform are many artists who memorably recorded and performed with Mr. Haden, including the guitarist Pat Metheny; the pianists Geri Allen, Kenny Barron, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Brad Mehldau and Ethan Iverson; the saxophonists Lee Konitz, Ravi Coltrane and Joshua Redman; and the drummers Denardo Coleman and Jack DeJohnette. Plan to arrive early. (7 p.m. — doors open at 6 — 123 West 43rd Street, thetownhall.org.)Advertisement
