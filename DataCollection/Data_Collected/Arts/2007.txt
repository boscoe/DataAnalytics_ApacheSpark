It is a daunting task: raising hundreds of millions of dollars to renovate Avery Fisher Hall while simultaneously doubling the New York Philharmonic’s endowment fund. Now that task will be assigned to Lisa Mantone, who has been appointed to the new position of the orchestra’s senior vice president of institutional advancement, the Philharmonic announced on Monday.Ms. Mantone’s appointment comes at a critical time for the orchestra, which hopes to begin renovating its hall as soon as 2019 and which wants to effectively double its endowment, which was valued at $200 million in its most recent annual report. There are signs that the long-delayed renovation may finally be getting underway: the heirs of Avery Fisher recently agreed to a deal that will allow the hall to be renamed for a new large donor who helps pay for the renovation, which is expected to cost more than $500 million.Ms. Mantone, who was previously the director of development at the Museum of Modern Art and a vice president at WNET New York Public Media, will oversee the Philharmonic’s development department, as well other departments including public relations, publications and archives. The orchestra’s vice president of development, Melanie Forman, has decided to resign, the orchestra said.Matthew VanBesien, the Philharmonic’s president, noted that it would be a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Mantone, who previously worked as the orchestra’s annual fund director. “She brings invaluable experience in high-level philanthropy and major gifts, with a proven track record in advancing major institutions during pivotal times,’’ he said in a statement.The Philharmonic also announced that Bill Thomas, a senior vice president, will assume the title of chief operating officer.
