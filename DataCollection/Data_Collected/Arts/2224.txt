Chilina Kennedy, who previously starred on Broadway in “Jesus Christ Superstar,” will take over the title role of “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” on March 7. Ms. Kennedy has big shoes to fill: she is replacing Jessie Mueller, who won a Tony Award in June for her performance as the seminal singer-songwriter. Since opening last January, “Beautiful” has been both critically and commercially successful. It was the first original musical of the 2013-14 theater season to turn a profit. Ms. Kennedy has been a leading actress at Canada’s Stratford Festival for many years, playing Maria in “West Side Story” and the title role in “Evita.” Responding to her Mary Magdalene in “Jesus Christ Superstar” there, Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised her “simple ardor and rich voice.” Ms. Mueller is leaving “Beautiful” to star in “Waitress,” which is scored by the pop songwriter Sara Bareilles and will open at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. this year.
