AMC’s monster hit “The Walking Dead” drew 14.6 million viewers for its sixth season premiere on Sunday, down from last year’s debut but still a strong showing.“The Walking Dead” has been a ratings boon for the network since its 2010 debut. It is the most-viewed scripted show on cable, and its season premiere last season, which drew more than 17 million viewers, ranks as the third most-viewed nonsporting event in cable history. (It had set the record but this year’s first two Republican debates, on Fox News and CNN, both drew more viewers.)Sunday’s premiere episode averaged 9.4 million viewers in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic most significant to advertisers, which was also down from last year’s 10.9 million people.The numbers are expected to rise in the next few days after delayed viewing is factored in. Last week, AMC announced that “The Walking Dead” spinoff, “Fear The Walking Dead,” was the highest-rated first-year cable show in history among 18- to-49-year-olds in Nielsen’s live plus three days ratings.AMC is taking its franchise seriously. On Friday, the network hosted a “Walking Dead” premiere at Madison Square Garden in front of more than 13,000 fans.
