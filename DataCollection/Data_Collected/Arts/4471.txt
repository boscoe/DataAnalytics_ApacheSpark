A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Eric Church (Saturday) A determined country singer of gritted-teeth stances such as “They’re the in crowd/We’re the other ones,” Mr. Church’s last album, “The Outsiders,” debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart in 2014. His victory was proof positive of country interweaving with the rock mainstream, a trend that has only increased since. At 7:30 p.m., Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry Street, Newark, 800-745-3000, prucenter.com. (Stacey Anderson)★ Ciara (Tuesday) Eleven years after Ciara’s debut album, “Goodies,” elevated the then-19-year-old singer to R & B radio ubiquity, she remains a honeyed and flirtatious pop presence with clear poise. Her sixth album, “Jackie,” titled after her mother, features collaborations with Missy Elliott and Pitbull and will be released this week. At 8 p.m., Best Buy Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, 888-929-7849, bestbuytheater.com. (Anderson)Eric Clapton  (Friday and Saturday) The vaunted guitarist of Cream, Blind Faith, the Yardbirds and his own solo slowhand albums celebrates his 70th birthday with a two-night stint at the Garden, a hall he has performed in over 40 times throughout his career. He will be joined by his band; his last studio effort, a tribute album to his late collaborator JJ Cale, was released in 2014 and included cover turns with Tom Petty, Willie Nelson and John Mayer. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 866-858-0008, thegarden.com. (Anderson)Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds  (Thursday) The former guitarist-songwriter of Oasis veers only slightly from the Britpop grandiosity of that band — though he drops the constant percussion of his fists connecting with his brother Liam’s face, and vice versa — in this post-Oasis sonic-pop collective. Their self-titled debut, released in 2011, boasted a female choir, woodwinds and strings and harmlessly broad choruses that beg for stadiums. The group’s relatively pared-down second album, “Chasing Yesterday,” landed in February. At 9 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events; sold out. (Anderson)★ Glasser  (Thursday) Anxiety and lust struggle for dominance on “Interiors,” the most recent electronic-pop album by the East Village artist Glasser (whose real name is Cameron Mesirow). Declarative and intimate, the album coaxes out an underlying theme of architecture that proves literal and figurative. With Missy Mazzoli and Victoire. At 7:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, 212-505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com. (Anderson)Holy Ghost! (DJ Set)  (Thursday) The breakout dance-pop act of 2011 pulls its stage antics from Freddie Mercury and New Order; its disco-ready riffs from the Bee Gees and LCD Soundsystem; and its cameos from, unfathomably, Michael McDonald. He’s fantastic, incidentally, on “Some Children,” which was one of the many addictive moments on this duo’s self-titled debut; the follow-up, “Dynamics,” released in 2013, was a more atmospheric effort. The group DJs an all-vinyl set; with Shadow Child. At 10 p.m., Verboten, 54 North 11th Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, verbotennewyork.com. (Anderson)‘100 Disciplines: A Composition for 20 Performers by Kid Millions’ (Sunday) John Colpitts, the drummer of the local art-rockers Oneida, often moonlights as the percussionist Kid Millions. Between the two, he’s known below 14th Street as a purveyor of the most inexhaustible solos around. In this performance commissioned by Red Bull Music Academy Festival New York, Mr. Colpitts leads a group of percussionists in a series of experimental performance pieces. With Niños du Brasil. At 3 p.m., Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Anderson)★ Kiesza and Betty Who  (Monday) The Canadian house and pop singer Kiesza contorts her way through some eccentric moves in her video for “Hideaway,” a single-shot journey through Brooklyn that shows her weaving and leaping with panache. It’s the lead single from her Juno Award-winning album “Sound of a Woman.” With Betty Who, an Australian singer whose breakout electropop single “Somebody Loves You” is propulsive on polished synths and a wholesome glee. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800, irvingplaza.com. (Anderson)Lenny Kravitz  (Tuesday) The rocker flashes comedic chops as both a lacquered game show host and a preening bandleader in the video for his single “Stand,” off his ninth album “Black and White America.” In the recent film adaptation of “The Hunger Games” novels, Mr. Kravitz put his smoldering charisma to good use onscreen, though his amiable riffs could benefit from a similar shot of theatrics. He released the album “Strut” last year on his own label, Roxie Records. At 9 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events; sold out. (Anderson)★ Ministry (Wednesday) As godfather figures of industrial rock, Ministry’s scabrous early-1990s albums paved the way for the mainstream careers of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson. The thrash-happy group released the remarkably named record “From Beer to Eternity” in 2013, which the singer Al Jourgensen maintains will be the group’s final album together. With the Sixxis. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800, irvingplaza.com. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret (through May 30) Judy Collins, above, the enduring wild angel of pop, has visited more musical planets than any other singer of her generation. A short list would include Stephen Sondheim, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. And there is also her own considerable body of sturdy original songs. Her return to Café Carlyle for an engagement that runs Tuesday through May 16 is this month’s cabaret high point. Also at the Carlyle, the Southern California singer-songwriter J.D. Souther performs on May 9, and that brash blond bombshell Megan Hilty returns May 19-30. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8:45 p.m.; Saturdays at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m.; 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan; 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com. The pop-jazz belter Diane Schuur makes her debut at Birdland, May 19-23, to celebrate her 60th birthday and a new album. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., 315 West 44th Street, Clinton; 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. At 54 Below, the many events include memorial tributes to Lesley Gore (May 6 at 7 and 9:30 p.m.) and to Julie Wilson (May 9 and 14); 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan; 646-476-3551, 54below.com. Leading the list of several rising talents at the Metropolitan Room this month is the young baritone Arlo Hill, who begins a four-performance engagement on May 7 singing the work of Frank Loesser. Thursday, and May 14 and 21 at 9:30 p.m., May 28 at 7 p.m., 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district; 212-206-0440, metropolitanroom.com. (Stephen Holden)Of Monsters and Men (Thursday) Iceland’s biggest recent cultural exports since Sigur Ros and skyr, Of Monsters and Men specialize in boisterous, Celtic-based rock chants and sensitive acoustic balladry akin to Arcade Fire and the Decemberists. The group’s vaguely twee debut album, “My Head Is an Animal,” reached No. 6 on the Billboard chart — the highest rank ever for an Icelandic artist. The follow-up, “Beneath the Skin,” will be released in June. At 8 p.m., Manhattan Center Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Anderson)Paramore  (Wednesday) The Tennessee emo-rock upstarts Paramore spent a good amount of 2010 reeling from the departure of the founding members Josh and Zac Farro, as well as their accusations that the seemingly defiant band was being manufactured by their label. It was a calculated strike: In such a proudly scrappy genre as punk-pop, the words went straight for the jugular. But the band’s self-titled fourth album, released in 2013, debuted at the top of the Billboard charts. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)★ Sufjan Stevens (Friday and Saturday) This ambitious baroque-pop singer-songwriter once vowed to write an album about every state in the country; he abandoned this musical manifest destiny after releasing albums about Michigan and Illinois. His newest, “Carrie & Lowell,” is titled after his mother and stepfather, and it is his most gorgeous effort to date — a dauntlessly intimate song cycle that wrestles with the specters of abandonment and disconnection, all inside transcendent electro-meets-acoustic pop arrangements. At 8 p.m., Kings Theater, 1027 Flatbush Avenue, near Tilden Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, kingstheatre.com. (Anderson)Toro y Moi (Friday) After morphing his lo-fi bedroom project into an inventive, smoothly professional touring band, the Toro y Moi frontman Chaz Bundick takes a hairpin turn on the new album “What For?” Blips of electronic effects and his tinny, two-bit vocals supplant previously warm guitar textures; the result is smart and airy electropop with giddily danceable hooks and a pronounced funk undercurrent. With Vinyl Williams and Sinkane. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Saul Williams (Thursday) This actor-poet-musician received praise for his performance in the Broadway musical “Holler if Ya Hear Me,” which featured songs by the rapper Tupac Shakur. A leader in the Afropunk movement, the versatile Mr. Williams is currently working on an album and graphic novel. With Sons of an Illustrious Father and Haleek Maul. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com. (Anderson)Advertisement
