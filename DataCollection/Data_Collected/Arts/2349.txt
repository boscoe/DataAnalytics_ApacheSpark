This multidisciplinary festival of arts and ideas was founded in 2013 by New York Live Arts, a Chelsea group. Each year has a different theme, with previous festivals focusing on the works of the neurologist Oliver Sacks and the playwright and author James Baldwin. This year’s edition, assembled by the visual artist and performer Laurie Anderson, is themed “S K Y — Force and Wisdom in America Today.” “The sky — a multidimensional symbol of aspiration, vastness, change, threat and now information storage — is a fitting image for this year’s festival,” Bill T. Jones, New York Live Arts’ artistic director, said in a statement. Highlights of the festival, taking place April 15-19, include a new commission by the Bessie Award-winning choreographer Beth Gill and screenings of films by Julian Schnabel. Tickets range from free to $65. Information is at newyorklivearts.org.Advertisement
