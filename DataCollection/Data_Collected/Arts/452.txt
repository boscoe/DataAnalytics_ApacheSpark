The Warner Music Prize — a $100,000 award to a young musician — made news in an unexpected way last month when it surfaced as a bone of contention at the top echelons of Carnegie Hall. But now it has its first winner: the violinist Augustin Hadelich.Mr. Hadelich, 31, a sensitive player with a wide repertoire that includes Bach, Beethoven, Ligeti and Thomas Adès, was selected to receive the prize by a panel of judges who considered all the young singers and musicians presented by Carnegie Hall last season. He said in a statement that the prize would be “an extraordinary help to me as I continue to build my career.”Before it was awarded the prize gained unusual notoriety. When the billionaire Ronald O. Perelman announced last month that he would step down as the chairman of Carnegie Hall, he said that he was doing so in part because he was upset that Carnegie officials had gone ahead with a contract related to the prize after he had asked them to put it on hold. Mr. Perelman wanted the prize to be vetted for potential conflicts of interest, since the Warner Music Group is owned by a firm founded by Len Blavatnik, who sits on Carnegie’s board. Mr. Blavatnik’s firm had beaten out several other suitors when it bought Warner Music, including Sony/ATV Music Publishing, which was working with Mr. Perelman.In addition to awarding the prize, Warner Music and the Blavatnik Family Foundation will be making a contribution to the Harmony Program, a nonprofit that provides after-school music education in underserved neighborhoods in New York City. Mr. Blavatnik said in a statement that “acknowledging and helping outstanding young artists early in their careers is essential to the ongoing vibrancy of the classical world.”It is unclear when and where the prize event will be held; plans to award it at Carnegie have been scrapped.A version of this article appears in print on 10/21/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Violinist Wins Prize That Roiled Carnegie.
