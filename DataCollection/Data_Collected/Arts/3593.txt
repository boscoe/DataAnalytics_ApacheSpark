Populated by creatures called Mounds, the work seems to be the residue of a postmodern fever dream, borrowing as much from museum walls (Peter Saul, Mike Kelley) as from comic-book pages (Basil Wolverton, Spain Rodriguez). On Thursday, the Studio Museum in Harlem opens “Trenton Doyle Hancock: Skin and Bones, 20 Years of Drawing,” the first extensive look at Mr. Hancock’s drawings, collages and works on paper. Organized by Valerie Cassel Oliver of the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston, the works on display, as Ms. Oliver says, “blend absurdist imagery with trenchant commentary to create a profoundly contemplative meditation on the strange fruit of intolerance.” (Through June 28, 144 West 125th Street; 212-864-4500, studiomuseum.org.)
