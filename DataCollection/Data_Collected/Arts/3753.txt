She was 86. The cause was cancer, said her publicist, Judith Goffin. Sally Forrest was born Katherine Sally Feeney in San Diego on May 28, 1928. The daughter of amateur ballroom dancers, she began studying dance at an early age and was signed to an MGM contract shortly after graduating from high school. She had several uncredited roles as a dancer before being cast as a woman who has a child out of wedlock in the 1949 drama “Not Wanted.” The actress Ida Lupino took over as the director of “Not Wanted” after the original director, Elmer Clifton, had a heart attack. Lupino, one of the first prominent female directors in Hollywood, later cast Ms. Forrest in “Never Fear” (1949) and “Hard, Fast and Beautiful” (1951). After moving to New York, Ms. Forrest replaced Vanessa Brown in the original Broadway production of “The Seven Year Itch,” assuming the role later played by Marilyn Monroe in the movie version. She also appeared on “Rawhide,” “The Millionaire” and other television series in the late 1950s and early ’60s. Ms. Forrest was married to the writer and producer Milo Frank from 1951 until his death in 2004.  The New York Times contributed reporting.Advertisement
