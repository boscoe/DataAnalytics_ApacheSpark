Making an aggressive move into theater publicity, a national public relations firm is hiring most of the employees from one of Broadway’s largest agencies.DKC, a New York-based public relations and government affairs company that represents an array of business and individual clients, has hired Rick Miramontez, the theater publicist who represented the last three shows to win a Tony Award for best musical: “Fun Home,” “A Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder” and “Kinky Boots.” DKC is a privately held company that bills about $40 million of work annually.The company will also hire about a dozen of Mr. Miramontez’s employees at O&M Co., the company he now heads; O&M will cease to exist as a separate company, and will instead become a unit of DKC called DKC/O&M. The publicists expect to retain their current clients, and will make the case that joining the larger firm will allow them to provide more services nationally. The hirings will enable DKC to expand its entertainment practice, led by the former theater publicist Joe Quenqua, to include Broadway, where theater publicists are unionized as members of the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers. Mr. Miramontez and the other publicists at his firm are members of the union, allowing them to maintain contracts with Broadway producers.
