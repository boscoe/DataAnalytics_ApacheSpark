The stars will be out at the World Science Festival at the end of May, in multiple senses of the word. The actor Alan Alda, the authors Diane Ackerman and David Quammen, and three renowned scientists, Brian Greene, Edward Witten and Steven Weinberg, will be among those to appear at the five-day festival, which also includes a night of stargazing in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The festival, which takes place from May 27-31, will center on a celebration of the 100th anniversary of Einstein’s general theory of relativity on May 27.  Mr. Greene, co-founder of the festival, will star in a dramatic re-enactment of Einstein’s discovery, which includes animation and music from the composer Jeff Beal, who has worked on “House of Cards.” Discussions about satellites, New York City’s marine life, sleep and electrical brain stimulation will also take place in venues around the city. And, stargazing, with live music and astronomers on hand, will be held at Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 1 on May 30. A complete schedule can be found at worldsciencefestival.com.
