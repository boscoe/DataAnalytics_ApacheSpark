U2 will shortly begin its next world tour, with a physically damaged lead singer and after the release of “Songs of Innocence,” a record whose influence was, as Jon Pareles puts it, “uncertain.”U2’s “Songs of Innocence,” through an agreement between the band and Apple, landed as a gift in the iTunes music libraries of about 500 million people last September. This started a discussion about arrogance and spamming, which we brought into an earlier Popcast. Many downloaded the album, though perhaps without realizing it. The big question is how many people heard it.   The band has no idea.Mr. Pareles met with the band recently in Vancouver; its members talked about uncertainty and hesitation around the tour, which will include at least half a dozen songs from “Songs of Innocence,” and its physical demands. (Bono’s bicycle accident in Central Park last November resulted in damage to his eye-socket, shoulder, elbow and left hand.) But what does uncertainty and hesitation look like for U2, a band that’s rarely on the back foot, rarely expressing uncertainty and hesitation about anything?They talked about the invigorating aspects of their setbacks. They also talked about rethinking the sight-and-sound dynamics of the arena concert, using screens that divide the rooms in half, and building a set of enormous speakers that hang from the ceiling of the arena, to spread out the sound more evenly within the space.   And they are trying to capitalize on all this momentum by setting up a studio in the same Vancouver arena where they have been rehearsing, and flying in producers to work on their next album, “Songs of Experience.”Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
