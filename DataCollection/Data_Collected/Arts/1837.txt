With an excellent chorus and reliably top-notch soloists, the annual performances of Handel’s “Messiah” by Musica Sacra, under the direction of Kent Tritle, command a loyal following. Some of those soloists, too, are loyal to Mr. Tritle, and return to perform with him year after year.Tuesday’s “Messiah,” at Carnegie Hall, afforded many pleasures, including burnished choral singing and shapely orchestral playing. But the standout of the evening was the soprano Kathryn Lewek. I had heard her two years ago in a “Messiah” that Mr. Tritle conducted with the Oratorio Society of New York and was quickly won over by her voice and stage presence.It was a joy to see how much her artistry has matured in the intervening years. Ms. Lewek’s soprano has an appealing weight and warmth across its range, with blooming, unforced top notes. Combined with voluptuous phrasing and careful attention to the text, those qualities gave each of her solos lasting emotional resonance.The bass Matt Boehler, meanwhile, brought powerful drama to each of his numbers with a booming, rich voice that commanded attention. In Handel’s torrential coloratura passages, Mr. Boehler exhibited an uncanny ability to create space in between the fast notes so that the runs took on a stenciled clarity.AdvertisementFrom his opening recitative, the tenor Mingjie Lei impressed with a beautifully plush voice and elegant musicianship. On the word “peace,” his messa di voce — a gradual swelling and tapering of sound on a single sustained note — was tasteful and deeply moving. But his delivery of the words was sometimes a touch vague and wanting in dramatic conviction.In contrast, the countertenor Christopher Ainslie brought plenty of bite to his diction, along with a clear, golden sound. But his singing sometimes felt too refined and poised for the raw emotion of the oratorio’s second part.AdvertisementOver all, Mr. Tritle led a buoyant performance that centered less on the drama of individual moments than on a gracious pace and swing. The excellent chorus sang with pliant phrasing and balance, with much of the emphasis laid on the middle voices, especially the outstanding tenor section. The chamber orchestra, though prone to minor coordination problems, proved responsive and light on its feet.An earlier version of the picture caption with this review misspelled the conductor’s surname. As the review correctly notes, he is Kent Tritle, not Trittle.A version of this review appears in print on December 24, 2015, on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Reuniting for a Treat They Relish         .
