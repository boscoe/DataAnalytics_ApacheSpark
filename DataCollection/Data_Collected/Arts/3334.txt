A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.AACM50: Thomas Buckner (Thursday) Interpretations, the new music series, has been celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. This concert finds Mr. Buckner, a baritone, performing works composed for him by the association members Muhal Richard Abrams, Leroy Jenkins, Roscoe Mitchell, Amina Claudine Myers, Wadada Leo Smith and Henry Threadgill. (He’ll be accompanied by an ensemble that includes Ms. Myers.) At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Nate Chinen)Lucian Ban and Mat Maneri (Friday) The pianist Lucian Ban and the violist Mat Maneri have a lovely and restive recent album on ECM — “Transylvanian Concert,” recorded in Mr. Ban’s native land — that reveals their shared interest in enfolding mystery. They reconnect as part of the Sound It Out concert series. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)Gary Bartz Quartet (Saturday) An alto and soprano saxophonist whose career has taken him through postbop, jazz-funk and free jazz, Gary Bartz, 74, continues to draw connections in his music. His quartet includes the guitarist Paul Bollenback, the bassist James King and the drummer Greg Bandy. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, East 38th Street, 212-885-7000, kitano.com. (Chinen)ELEW and Ben Williams (Friday and Saturday) ELEW, the pianist formerly known as Eric Lewis, has made a custom, and something of a cottage industry, out of his heroically vaulting covers of rock anthems. It’s an open question whether that will comprise his approach in this intimate setting, joined only by Mr. Williams, a nimble and soulful bassist. From 9 to 11:30 p.m., Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, near Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. (Chinen)Michael Formanek’s Cheating Heart (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Formanek, a bassist and composer drawn to scintillating frictions, probably has no intention of forming a Hank Williams cover band. Instead his Cheating Heart is a quintet with a front line featuring two saxophonists — Tim Berne, his longtime compatriot, on alto and Brian Settles on tenor — and an adaptable rhythm section that includes the pianist Jacob Sacks and the drummer Dan Weiss. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Bill Frisell and Thomas Morgan (Tuesday through March 22) Mr. Frisell, an introspective but expansively creative guitarist, has worked countless times at the Village Vanguard, both as a leader and as a member of a magical trio anchored by the drummer Paul Motian. Mr. Morgan, an intuitive young bassist, made his appearances in the club with Mr. Motian, who died in 2011. This duo — a rarity at the Vanguard — might not make reference to Mr. Motian, but it should uphold compatible values, among them a sense of unforced discovery. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Roy Haynes 90th Birthday (Friday through Sunday) The drummer Roy Haynes, who becomes a nonagenarian on Friday, has a history that stretches past the birth of bebop, and he has kept his relevance through every successive epoch in the music. Along with the Fountain of Youth Band, his longtime quartet, he’ll welcome a succession of friends during this engagement — starting on Friday with the guitarist Pat Metheny and the bassist Christian McBride. Saturday’s guest is the trumpeter Roy Hargrove; Sunday’s is the tap dancer Savion Glover. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ Lee Konitz and Dave Douglas Quintet (Thursday through March 22) At 87, Mr. Konitz is not just one of jazz’s most venerable alto saxophonists but also one of its most steadfast searchers. Which means he has the right artistic temperament to fall in easily with the trumpeter Dave Douglas and a dynamic rhythm section comprising Matt Mitchell on piano, Linda Oh on bass and Ches Smith on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Steve Kuhn Trio  (through Sunday) The erudite and lyrical pianist Steve Kuhn made his most recent album, “Wisteria,” in the trio format, with the alert and effervescent drummer Joey Baron. Those two regroup here with a wise, authoritative bassist, Buster Williams. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Latin on Lex: A Latin Jazz Festival (Friday and Saturday) The 92nd Street Y wraps up its first Latin jazz festival this weekend, organized by the trumpeter Brian Lynch. “New Cuban New York,” a concert on Friday, will highlight the current wave of accomplished Cuban jazz musicians in New York, like the saxophonist Yosvany Terry, the percussionist Pedrito Martínez and the pianist Manuel Valera. And “Bolero Meets Jazz,” on Saturday, will be a celebration of balladic bolero form, featuring the Cuban singer Xiomara Laugart, the American saxophonist Phil Woods and others. At 8 p.m., 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500, 92Y.org. (Chinen)Kevin Mahogany  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Mahogany, a soulful baritone, released his first album a little more than 20 years ago, soon afterward becoming a jazz-vocal sensation. His career has been quieter in the past decade, but he has lost nothing in the vocal department, and he still knows how to command a room. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Marcus Miller (Wednesday) The electric bass virtuoso, bandleader and producer Marcus Miller has a new album due out on Blue Note on Tuesday, “Afrodeezia,” featuring a global perspective and an array of special guests, including the blues man Keb’ Mo’, the singer Lalah Hathaway and the rapper Chuck D. Celebrating the album’s release, he leads his airtight band. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, bbkingblues.com. (Chinen)★ Jason Moran Celebrates the 80th Anniversary of the Village Vanguard  (through Sunday) As part of the Village Vanguard’s anniversary festivities, the club commissioned this tribute from the pianist Jason Moran, who never met a programming challenge he couldn’t enliven. On Friday his trio, the Bandwagon, plays the music of Thelonious Monk. On Saturday he presents a recent commission inspired by the quilt makers of Gee’s Bend, Ala., with his wife, the mezzo-soprano Alicia Hall Moran, and the guitarist Bill Frisell. And on Sunday he’ll play the part of a sideman — with the Charles Lloyd Quartet, which is accustomed to playing much larger rooms. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)NettWork Trio (Tuesday through March 21) The bassist Charnett Moffett has led more than one version of this powerhouse postbop trio — which suggests that he’s the first among equals in its lineup, featuring two more virtuosos who came to prominence in the 1980s: the guitarist Stanley Jordan and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Johnny O’Neal (Friday, Saturday and Thursday) A pianist in the Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson lineage, and a singer of gruff erudition, Mr. O’Neal has been enjoying a late-career comeback possibly sweeter than his so-called prime. He plays the late shift, from midnight to 2 a.m., every Friday and Saturday at Mezzrow. Next week he also plays uptown, with a trio. Fridays and Saturdays at Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, near Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. Thursday at 8 p.m., Ginny’s Supper Club at Red Rooster, 310 Lenox Avenue, near 125th Street, 212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com. (Chinen)Maceo Parker (Tuesday through March 22) Mr. Parker, the alto saxophonist best known for his longtime service with James Brown, has soldiered on in the name of funk, and his live show never fails to connect. His most recent album, “Soul Classics,” features him in the company of a spit-and-polish big band; he works here with a smaller but still potent crew. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592 bluenote.net. (Chinen)Renee Rosnes Quartet (Tuesday through Thursday) A thoughtful and adaptable pianist, Renee Rosnes leads a working band full of longtime collaborators: the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Lewis Nash. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Christian Sands Trio (Sunday) A gifted young pianist working with all the right fundamentals — strong technique, clear ideas and the imprimatur of some of jazz’s savviest mentors, here and gone — Christian Sands leads a trio with the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Rodney Green. At 5:30, 7 and 8:30 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com. (Chinen)Saxophones Supreme (Thursday) This installment of the long-running Highlights in Jazz series will go heavy on saxophonists, with none heavier than Lou Donaldson, who at 88 still works steadily with his quartet. Also on the bill is a so-called “Battle of the Saxes,” with the twins Peter and Will Anderson, Grant Stewart and Ken Peplowski in the rotation. At 8 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, near Greenwich Street, 212-220-1460, tribecapac.org. (Chinen)Kendrick Scott Oracle (Tuesday and Wednesday) With his most recent album, “Conviction,” the drummer Kendrick Scott advanced his case for a soulful and fluidly modern strain of postbop. For this run, his Oracle band will have John Ellis on saxophone, Mike Moreno on guitar, Taylor Eigsti on piano and Joe Sanders on bass. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Arturo Stable Group (Saturday) Arturo Stable is a versatile Cuban percussionist who has worked in settings ranging from the folkloric to the orchestral. He leads a group with Jure Pukl on saxophone, Benito Gonzalez on piano and Ricky Rodriguez on bass; the billing of a “special guest” could mean a number of things, all of them good. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Jacky Terrasson Quintet (Friday through Sunday) “Take This” is the whirligig new album by the pianist Jacky Terrasson, and its title — a nod to Dave Brubeck and Paul Desmond’s “Take Five,” with a playfully combative spin — suits the results therein. Celebrating the album’s release all weekend, Mr. Terrasson enlists the bassist Burniss Travis III, the drummer Justin Faulkner and the percussionist Mauricio Herrera. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Charenee Wade and the Gil Scott-Heron Forum (Friday) Ms. Wade is a jazz singer with a firm root system — this time last week, she was paying tribute to Betty Carter at Jazz at Lincoln Center — and she brings her full enthusiasm to this celebration of the poetry and music of Gil Scott-Heron. Among her musical partners are the saxophonist Lakecia Benjamin, the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the guitarist Dave Stryker. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Advertisement
