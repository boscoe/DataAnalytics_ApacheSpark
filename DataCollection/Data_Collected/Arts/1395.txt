It’s time to dismantle the barricades once again.The British producer Cameron Mackintosh announced Wednesday that the current Broadway revival of “Les Misérables” will run for another nine months and then will close on Sept. 4, 2016.The much-loved show won the 1987 Tony Award for best new musical and was given renewed life by a film version in 2012; the current revival opened in March 2014 at the Imperial Theater, and will have run 1,026 performances when it closes. The original ran from 1987 to 2003; a 2006 revival ran for 14 months. In all, according to Mr. Mackintosh, the show will have run 8,202 performances on Broadway when the current production wraps up.The revival, directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell, has performed unevenly at the box office — during many weeks last year it grossed more than $1 million, but this year its weekly grosses have been lower, bottoming out at $480,903 in the week ending Nov. 1. The show generally does better when there are a lot of tourists in town; last week, a big week for Broadway because of Thanksgiving, it grossed $847,062. But the show’s superfans include some notable New Yorkers as well:*wipes tears, climbs atop the barricade*
