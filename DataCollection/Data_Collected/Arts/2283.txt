LONDON — The Broadway revival of “The Elephant Man,” starring Bradley Cooper, will travel to London in May, the play’s producers announced on Friday.The production, which has had huge success at the box office on Broadway, will run at the Theater Royal Haymarket in the West End of the city from May 19 to Aug. 8. (The New York production is playing at the Booth Theater through Feb. 21.)The actors Patricia Clarkson and Alessandro Nivola, and the director Scott Ellis, will join Mr. Cooper in the London production. The four were also involved in a 2012 production of “The Elephant Man” at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.The play, by Bernard Pomerance, first opened on Broadway in 1979 and centers on Merrick, a severely deformed man whom Mr. Cooper plays by twisting his body into contortions. (Joseph Merrick, the real-life basis for the character, spent much of his life in London.)“I’m honored that Alessandro, Patricia, the entire company and I have the opportunity to continue to tell his story,” Mr. Cooper said in a statement.Mr. Cooper, 40, was nominated last week for an Academy Award for his role in the Clint Eastwood film “American Sniper.” (That movie also created a hubbub on social media this week because of a conspicuous fake baby in several scenes.)A version of this article appears in print on 01/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Elephant Manu2019 Heading to London.
