The director and chief executive of the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust says that he will step down at the end of the year. The director, David G. Marwell, took the post in 2000 and oversaw a major expansion in Battery Park City, breaking ground for an 82,000-square-foot addition a few weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks.“I have had a book project in mind for some time that will detail my involvement with the Josef Mengele investigation,” Dr. Marwell, 63, said in a letter to the museum’s chairman, Bruce Ratner, “and I think that now is the time to sit down and write it.”From 1980 to 1988, Dr. Marwell worked in the Justice Department’s Office of Special Investigations, which handled cases against Nazi offenders living in this country. He helped hunt for Mengele, who, it turned out, drowned in Brazil in 1979, and was involved in an investigation about the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie.The museum opened in 1997 as a tribute to victims of the Holocaust and survivors’ lives after World War II.Before taking the director’s job Dr. Marwell was associate director for museum programs at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. From 1994 to 1997 he was executive director of the Assassination Records Review Board, mandated by Congress to find and declassify material about the death of President John F. Kennedy. Earlier in his career he ran the Berlin Document Center, an archive that includes an index of Nazi Party members.
