In its search for a topical satirist to fling timely zingers and pierce overinflated egos at its annual dinner, the White House Correspondents’ Association is keeping it 100: Larry Wilmore, the host of “The Nightly Show” on Comedy Central, will be the principal entertainer at this annual Washington event on April 30, the association said Wednesday. In a statement Carol Lee, the president of the association, said of Mr. Wilmore, “Larry’s edgy, even provocative, brand of humor means he’s certainly up to the task of skewering politicians of all ideological stripes, and we don’t expect the nation’s news media to escape unscathed, either.”The correspondents’ dinner, which is traditionally attended by the president and first lady, as well as prominent politicians and celebrities, is a delicate balancing act for the comedians who host it. Their task is to be funny – but neither too tepid nor too scathing – and to lampoon Republicans and Democrats equally, without appearing too partisan. The 2015 dinner was hosted by Cecily Strong of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and also featured an appearance by Keegan-Michael Key of Comedy Central’s “Key & Peele.”A version of this article appears in print on 12/17/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Wilmore to Host Dinner.
