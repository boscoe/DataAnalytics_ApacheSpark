LOS ANGELES — Hollywood apparently thinks that acerbic comedy is the antidote for awards telecast weariness: A week after Chris Rock was named  the next Oscars host, NBC said on Monday that Ricky Gervais would return as the next Golden Globes emcee.“Disarming and surprising, Ricky is ready to honor — and send up — the best work of the year in film and television,” Robert Greenblatt, chairman of NBC Entertainment, said in a statement. “Fasten your seat belts.”Mr. Gervais served as host of the Golden Globes for three years starting in 2010. The British comedian’s first outings were controversial; he cracked Scientology jokes, made fun of the elderly president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which bestows the honors, and took potshots at major stars like Johnny Depp. But some television critics complained that his routine had grown timid by the third year.He vowed not to return. “I’ve told my agent to never let me be persuaded to do it again,” Mr. Gervais wrote on his blog in 2012.NBC and the press association did not say what changed his mind; Mr. Gervais did not give a comment. On Twitter he joked about the job and posted NBC’s ad for his return. The last three Golden Globe ceremonies featured Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as hosts. They served up zingers but generally steered the telecast in a softer, goofier direction. NBC noted on Monday that Mr. Gervais delivered strong ratings when he was host. Still, he attracted fewer viewers in his last telecast than Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler did in theirs. About 16.8 million people watched his 2012 Golden Globes. About 20.9 million people watched their 2014 ceremony. The Globes, organized by the Hollywood Foreign Press and produced by Dick Clark Productions, are scheduled to be broadcast live on NBC on Jan. 10.A version of this article appears in print on 10/27/2015, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Gervais Back as the Host of Golden Globes in u201916.
