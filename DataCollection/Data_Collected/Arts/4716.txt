“Buried Child,” Sam Shepard’s Pulitzer Prize-winning family drama, will be staged by New Group next winter, marking the play’s first major production in New York in two decades.The 1978 play, which examines family and economic troubles through the lives of an Illinois farm couple, will star the Oscar nominees Ed Harris (“Pollock”) and Amy Madigan (“Twice in a Lifetime”), and will be directed by Scott Elliott, who is the artistic director of the New Group.Mr. Harris and Ms. Madigan, who are husband and wife, were part of the starry ensemble cast of Beth Henley’s “The Jacksonian,” which the New Group presented in 2013.New Group’s season will open this summer with “Mercury Fur,” a play by Philip Ridley in which two brothers plan gruesome parties for high-paying, and high, guests. Mr. Elliott will direct.Writing in The New York Times after seeing a London production, Ben Brantley called the play “savage and utterly gripping” but also noted that he had clamped a hand over his eyes while watching and that some theatergoers had walked out.The season will also include the world premiere of  “Steve” by Mark Gerrard, which will be directed by Cynthia Nixon. Ms. Nixon made her directing debut with the company this season with “Rasheeda Speaking.”“Steve” is about “a group of longtime, theater loving friends as they navigate the many facets of midlife and mortality,” the theater said in a statement.
