In the four absorbing but conceptually overbearing video and film works in this show, the Danish artist Joachim Koester addresses a persistent anxiety of modern life: that we are all just cogs in a giant machine.The 33 ½-minute “The Place of Dead Roads” is projected in a darkened space partly enclosed by rustic wooden walls, like those of an old barn. In the video, a man and three women perform a kind of dance in a similarly rustic space. Costumed like western movie characters in black hats and grungy clothes, with holsters at their hips, they appear possessed by a repertoire of stereotypical, mechanical moves. They swagger, circle one another, look askance through narrowed eyes and point their fingers as if shooting.Projected onto one wall of a smaller gallery, “Body Electric” is a close-up study of a running movie projector, mirroring the actual projector in the room. On an adjacent wall, “Of Spirits and Empty Spaces” presents only lines of text in what looks like an old, slightly degraded found film. It describes a 19th-century séance in which entranced participants act in concert, like the parts of a sewing machine. Elsewhere, a fourth film shows someone’s hands and fingers imitating the permutations of partly formed cubes in Sol LeWitt’s 1974 sculpture “Incomplete Open Cubes.”If we are unconsciously programmed elements of a big machine, what’s the purpose? Mr. Koester doesn’t venture to speculate. If he thinks escape to freedom is possible, he’s not saying, and a viewer is left feeling more entrapped than enlightened.Greene Naftali508 West 26th Street, Chelsea Through Feb. 14 A version of this review appears in print on January 23, 2015, on Page C28 of the New York edition with the headline: Joachim Koester: ‘Body Electric’.
