Netflix already streams popular films, television series and, increasingly, its own original entertainment to 57 million subscribers in more than 50 countries. The service is expanding rapidly — Cuba was added this week — and Netflix now projects it will be available in 200 countries by 2017, giving the company essentially global coverage.The company’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, acknowledged in a recent conference call that such sweeping expansion will require Netflix to overcome “cultural barriers” as it tries to make its offerings more global. In Europe, some of those challenges are already apparent.After successful starts in Britain and Scandinavia, Netflix entered six more European countries last fall, tapping into a huge potential market with 66 million broadband households. But the company immediately found itself navigating fierce competition from local streaming services and pressure from new apps that make watching pirated movies and shows easier than ever before.AVAILABLENOT AVAILABLEBreaking BadHouseof CardsLostMad MenThe Office (Britain)The Office (U.S.)MILLIONS OF PAIDSUBSCRIBERSTITLESAVAILABLEUnited States37.708,522Canada3.104,306Britain3.303,186Sweden1.102,342Netherlands0.942,127Norway0.902,359Denmark0.792,349Finland0.542,284Germany0.471,646France0.511,686Ireland0.183,189Switzerland0.141,842Austria0.051,602MILLIONS OF PAIDSUBSCRIBERSTITLESAVAILABLEUnited States37.708,522Canada3.104,306Britain3.303,186Sweden1.102,342Netherlands0.942,127Norway0.902,359Denmark0.792,349Finland0.542,284Germany0.471,646France0.511,686Ireland0.183,189Switzerland0.141,842Austria0.051,602AVAILABLENOT AVAILABLEU.S.CanadaBritainSwedenNetherlandsNorwayDenmarkFinlandGermanyFranceIrelandSwitzerlandAustriaIn a letter to shareholders in January, Netflix cited a Google Trends graph of searches that showed how one such service — Popcorn Time — had become a serious competitor in the Netherlands.AdvertisementNetflix also has fielded complaints that its offerings in European markets are worse than those available in the United States. The company does not release the number of titles in each of its territories, but according to Netflixable.com, there are more than 8,500 films and TV shows on the United States version of Netflix compared with 3,100 in Britain and about 2,000 in most European countries. A big sore spot in France is the absence of Netflix’s signature drama “House of Cards,” which enters its third season this year. (The series was licensed to local channels before Netflix expanded in Europe.)AdvertisementAs a result of the uneven selection, some international viewers have taken to using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to cloak their country of origin, allowing them to access the American version of Netflix from abroad. The British research firm GlobalWebIndex estimates that on a monthly basis 54 million people access Netflix via a VPN — including about 20 million in China, where Netflix is officially unavailable.Netflix has struck deals with a number of European cable companies to offer the service through their set-top boxes, but in France at least, television viewers seem reluctant. “I haven’t heard that there was extraordinary enthusiasm for Netflix,” Stéphane Richard, the chief executive of Orange, one of the services that offers Netflix, said at a news conference last month. “The experience is disappointing.”Netflix may be banking on the arrival of the French-language crime drama “Marseille” — created by the Parisian novelist Dan Franck, the co-writer of the critically acclaimed miniseries “Carlos” — to increase its popularity. Set in the port city, the series is being positioned as the Mediterranean version of “House of Cards.”A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2015, in The International New York Times.
