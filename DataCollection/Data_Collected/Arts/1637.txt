The Public Theater’s popular Public Works program will return in the summer with a musical adaptation of “Twelfth Night,” created by Kwame Kwei-Armah and Shaina Taub. The Public Works program brings together professional and nonprofessional actors from across New York City’s five boroughs with song-and-dance productions of classic works. “The performers come together to create a vibrant theatrical tapestry; you may be able to tally the newcomers onstage, but in this embracing context they bring as much pleasure as the polished performers,” Charles Isherwood wrote in The New York Times about last season’s “The Odyssey.” This season will lead off with “Twelfth Night,” Shakespeare’s comedy of crossed signals which appeared in its nonmusical form at Shakespeare in the Park with Anne Hathaway in 2009. The Public Theater puts on Shakespeare in the Park. The music and lyrics for the musical will be written by Ms. Taub, who has ample experience in both the pop and Broadway worlds. Mr. Kwei-Armah, a British actor and the artistic director of Baltimore’s Center Stage, will direct.According to Ms. Taub, the production will be set in a port city during a carnival. While the spoken text will be in Shakespeare’s words, the songs will be in contemporary language. “It’s so amazing to start from a play that works so well, and just zoom out the emotional moments and turn them into big songs,” Ms. Taub said.Additionally, the Public Works program will expand on both a local and national level. The Public Theater will partner with community centers around the city for workshops, classes, and the creation of theatrical pieces. And affiliated theaters in Dallas, Seattle, and Detroit will be given the chance to present their own community-based productions. More information can be found at publictheater.org.
