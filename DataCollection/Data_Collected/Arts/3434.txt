Alan Moore, best known for his graphic novels, including “Watchmen” and “V for Vendetta,” is set to publish his second non-graphic novel, “Jerusalem,” next year. If past interviews with Mr. Moore are any indication, the book could clock in at more than one million words.“Jerusalem,” centered on Northampton, England,  Mr. Moore’s hometown, will combine historical fiction and fantasy. Mr. Moore has said the novel, which explores, among other subjects, the time-space continuum, is intended to “disprove the existence of death.” He has also mentioned the varying styles of each chapter:  among them,  one modeled after a Samuel Beckett play, another written in “a completely invented sub-Joycean text” and another “somewhat in the style of Dos Passos.”  The book will include appearances by John Bunyan and Buffalo Bill.“Jerusalem” is tentatively scheduled for publication in the United States in fall 2016 by Liveright, an imprint of W. W. Norton & Company. Knockabout Comics will publish the book in England.A version of this article appears in print on 03/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Novel Coming From Alan Moore.
