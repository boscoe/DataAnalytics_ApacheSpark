Broadway is getting Queen Elizabeth II this spring in “The Audience,” a play starring Helen Mirren as the monarch, and in all probability Broadway will get her son soon afterward with “King Charles III,” Mike Bartlett’s future-history play that has earned critical acclaim in London. Two Tony Award-winning veteran producers, Stuart Thompson (“The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”) and Sonia Friedman (last season’s “Twelfth Night”/”Richard III” double-bill on Broadway), are aiming to open “King Charles III” on Broadway this fall, according to Rick Miramontez, a Broadway press agent who would be the publicist for the likely production. The British film and theater actor Tim Pigott-Smith, who is now playing the title character in London, is expected to reprise his performance in New York, Mr. Miramontez added. The play, which imagines the current Prince Charles assuming the throne and causing a government crisis when he refuses to sign a bill that would limit freedom of the press, caused a stir in London last spring when the play opened at the Almeida Theater. It was a hit there and transferred to the West End, where it is running through Saturday. The director is Rupert Goold.
