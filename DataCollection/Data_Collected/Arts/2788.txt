LOS ANGELES — What everyone at “The Daily Show” really wants to do, apparently, is direct.Sara Taksler, a senior producer of the satirical news program, said over the weekend that she had clandestinely directed a documentary called “Tickling Giants” about Bassem Youssef, the Egyptian comedian whose Jon Stewart-style skewering of the politically powerful became emblematic of post-revolutionary Egypt. Under pressure, he ended his show in June 2014.Mr. Stewart, who last week announced plans to step down as host of “The Daily Show,” notably made his directing debut in the fall with “Rosewater,” a drama about Maziar Bahari, who was jailed in 2009 in Tehran while covering the Iranian elections.Ms. Taksler shot “Tickling Giants” in secrecy, she said, because of security concerns in Egypt. “Because the government of Egypt had begun checking hard drives, to get the last drive out of Egypt someone unrelated to the film had to fly the footage out of the country,” she wrote in an email.She may only be starting to understand the fortitude documentarians often need to complete their vision, however. To raise funds for editing and translation, Ms. Taksler has turned, as many indie directors do these days, to passing a tin cup on the Internet. Among the perks she is offering to people who contribute to her Indiegogo fund-raising campaign: an outgoing voicemail message recorded by Mr. Youssef.
As of Monday, she had raised about $45,000 toward her $150,000 goal.
