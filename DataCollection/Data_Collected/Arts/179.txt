The album also formally unveiled his new band, a young quintet with the creative resources to hit the ground running. “Brazen Heart,” Mr. Douglas’s assured new release, showcases the same group at a more advanced stage in its evolution, as he again tries to transcend grief with art.The album bears a dedication to Mr. Douglas’s older brother, Damon, who died in June after a long fight with cancer; Mr. Douglas made this album months before his brother’s death, in a style that proposes something flintier than an elegy. As on “Be Still,” there are soft-spoken interpretations of traditional hymns — the spirituals “Deep River” and “There Is a Balm in Gilead” — without a vocalist. (“Be Still” featured Aoife O’Donovan, winningly.)Mr. Douglas is famously inclined to work on multiple projects at once: “High Risk,” his mindfully atmospheric fusion album with the electronic artist Shigeto, appeared just months ago. But Mr. Douglas has long been particularly drawn to the acoustic postbop quintet as a delivery system for his music. His partners in this one are the saxophonist Jon Irabagon, the pianist Matt Mitchell, the bassist Linda Oh and the drummer Rudy Royston. (They’ll play the Jazz Standard, Nov. 19-22.)That these players have developed a vital shorthand, a band dialect, should be no surprise. Still, “Brazen Heart” clears a high bar for chemistry, starting with the bond between Mr. Douglas, with his jabbing chatter, and Mr. Irabagon, with his alert and gusty control. This front line works by cooperative tension with the rhythm section; at times, as on tracks like “Wake Up Claire” or “Inure Phase,” their outflow runs hot and cool at the same time.Advertisement
