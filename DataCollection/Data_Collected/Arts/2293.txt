A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Datsik (Saturday) This dubstep wunderkind peppers his futuristic dance music with the sounds of hip-hop and rap. A subtly intelligent D.J., as well as a producer, Datsik has boisterous beat drops that have also anchored remixes of songs by Diplo and the Crystal Method. With Kennedy Jones and others. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Stacey Anderson)Steve Earle (Monday) This Texas singer has received a second career wind thanks to TV showrunners who aspire to his grittiness. He’s appeared either in person or through song on “The Wire,” “Longmire,” “Treme,” and most recently, “True Detective.” And like that newest series, Mr. Earle’s music is entrenched in the backwater past: bluesy slide guitars, lo-fi vocals, plenty of heart and fury. He continues his monthlong winter residency at City Winery. At 8 p.m., 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, 212-608-0555, citywinery.com. (Andrew R. Chow)Nick Hakim (Tuesday) A lot of young artists are putting out minimalist R&B these days, but Mr. Hakim is not just another face in the crowd — his delicate guitar work and hazy harmonies make him a singular and vital presence in the genre. His 2014 EPs (“Where Will We Go,” Parts 1 and 2) have been exercises in restraint, drenched in liquor and physicality. At 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com. (Chow)Gladys Knight (Friday) One of the strongest voices of Motown’s heyday, Ms. Knight gripped R&B and soul glory as the frontwoman of the Pips. The evening will not be complete without a typically sweet, understated run through the Grammy-winning song “Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye).” She performs on a bill with the harmonizing R&B hit makers the Spinners. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, 888-466-5722, njpac.org. (Anderson)Bettye LaVette (Tuesdays through Saturdays, through Feb. 7) Her 2005 comeback album, “I’ve Got My Own Hell to Raise,” a collection of songs by women, was a soulful highlight of that year. A performer since the early ’60s who toured with James Brown and Otis Redding, Ms. LaVette has the steamroller charisma to invigorate the night. “Thankful n’ Thoughtful,” released in 2012, celebrated her 50th anniversary in the business. At 8:45 p.m., Café Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com. (Anderson)★ Yungchen Lhamo (Wednesday) This Tibetan singer-songwriter, who fled her homeland in 1989 and now lives in New York, contains a surfeit of sorrow in her stunning a cappella folk songs. Her heavily spiritual ruminations often include Buddhist mantras on nature and inward reflection. She performs as part of the Global Salon series at Symphony Space. At 7 p.m., 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Anderson)Linkin Park (Sunday) Somehow, in the 15 years since this alt-metal band’s multiplatinum debut, “Hybrid Theory,” its scream-happy lead singer, Chester Bennington, has not shredded his vocal cords into ribbons. After taking an electronic-rock detour, this band has returned to its cocoon of guitar distortion on “The Hunting Party,” its sixth album, released last summer. At 7 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com. (Anderson)★ London Grammar (Tuesday) This British electro-pop trio plumbs vulnerable depths without a whiff of desperation, a delicate balance that’s largely achieved by its assured singer, Hannah Reid (left, with Dot Major on keyboards and percussion). Also adaptable as club-pop collaborators, the band worked with Disclosure on the invigorating dance-floor staple “Help Me Lose My Mind.” And with its song “Hey Now” setting the mood for a particularly glittery Dior perfume commercial, the band is following its expected chic trajectory. With Until the Ribbon Breaks. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Marilyn Manson (Monday) Nostalgic industrial-rock fans should make a beeline for “The Pale Emperor,” the new album by the once-provocative Marilyn Manson; just as in his controversial 1990s heyday, when he was widely accused of inspiring the Columbine school shootings, he continues to sneer barbed screeds about bloodshed and misanthropy. (The opening track, “Killing Strangers,” is a sharp, insightful slam on American gun culture.) The record’s title alludes to David Bowie’s Thin White Duke period, and its homage sprawls from there — the croak in Mr. Manson’s voice and slick guitar production suggest a more irascible sequel to Mr. Bowie’s album “The Next Day.” At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret: Christine Ebersole and Cheyenne Jackson (through Jan. 31) Among this month’s high points are the return of Christine Ebersole to 54 Below in her tart semi-autobiographical show, “Big Noise From Winnetka.” Friday, Saturday and Wednesday through Jan. 31 at 7 p.m., 54 Below, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, 646-476-3551, 54below.com. Other highlights include the Broadway heartthrob Cheyenne Jackson’s debut (Friday at 8:45 p.m., Saturday at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m.) at the Café Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com. (Stephen Holden)★ Owen Pallett (Thursday) This nerdy baroque-pop auteur, who won the 2006 Polaris Prize for an album inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (“He Poos Clouds”), wrote the score for Spike Jonze’s futuristic fable “Her” with William Butler of Arcade Fire. As a solo artist, Mr. Pallett tread tangled pathways, with strings and sobs to spare, on last year’s “In Conflict.” At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com. (Anderson)‘Round-Up’ With Sufjan Stevens  (Friday through Sunday) This ambitious baroque-pop singer-songwriter once vowed to write an album about every state in the country; he eventually abandoned this musical manifest destiny after releasing albums about Michigan and Illinois. For this new project, commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he has composed the score for a slow-motion portrait of bull riders and calf ropers at a rodeo, titled “Round-Up.” He will perform the work alongside the new-music ensemble Yarn/Wire, and the result, in his hands, should be gentle splendor. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Anderson)Savages (Saturday, Monday, Wednesday and Jan. 31) The singer of this British postpunk quartet, Jehnny Beth, remains the heir apparent to the Joy Division frontman, Ian Curtis — she possesses the same androgynous beauty and cagey charisma. This all-female band whipped a furious lather on “Silence Yourself,” one of the best debuts of 2013 — not least for its fractious anthem “Husbands,” which should be screeched at all contentious divorce hearings. Over the course of nine area shows this month — all sold out — the band plans to debut new material. Saturday and Jan. 31 at 8 p.m., Saint Vitus, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, at Clay Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, saintvitusbar.com. Monday at 8 p.m., Baby’s All Right, 146 Broadway, near Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, babysallright.com. Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com. (Anderson)★ Sylvan Esso (Friday) Outrè folk meets chipper electropop to strange and beauteous results with this duo from North Carolina; they merge arrhythmic Moog bleats, found sounds and lithe, askew roots harmonies. The band’s self-titled debut was the most interesting dance record released last year, and included the smooth singles “Coffee” and the dubstep-leaning “Dreamy Bruises.” With Mr. Twin Sister. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Trey Songz, Chris Brown and Tyga (originally scheduled for Thursday, this show has been postponed) The singer-rapper Trey Songz is an especially lurid skirt-chaser in his songs. On his most recent album, the Billboard chart-topping “Trigga,” he flings cash and his trousers at a moment’s notice, in between smooth boasts about inventing sex and packing superhuman stamina. He headlines the subtly named “Between the Sheets Tour” with Tyga and the much less alluring Chris Brown. At 7:30 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com. (Anderson)Years & Years (Monday and Tuesday) This London trio has yet to put out an album, but its handful of glossy singles, featuring the stirring vocals of its frontman, Olly Alexander, set against bright synth hooks and a hefty base, have racked up millions of views on YouTube and earned the band coveted spots performing alongside the likes of Sam Smith and Clean Bandit. The group will perform its blend of electro-pop and ’90s R&B at two shows next week. Monday at 10:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, 212-505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com. Tuesday at 9 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, roughtradenyc.com. (Jonathan Wolfe)Zola Jesus (Sunday and Monday) This Russian-American sphinx, born Nika Roza Danilova, mixes her piercing wail with electro-industrial melodicism. Her 2013 album, “Versions,” was a set of collaborative remixes with the avant-garde composer JG Thirlwell that landed like a heavy screed from Siouxsie Sioux. The dark momentum lessened not the slightest on “Taiga,” an even more brooding dark-wave effort released last fall. With Deradoorian. At 8 p.m., Saint Vitus, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, at Clay Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 877-987-6487, saintvitusbar.com. (Anderson)Advertisement
