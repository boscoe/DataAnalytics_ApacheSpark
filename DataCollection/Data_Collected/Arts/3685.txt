Last week, Kendrick Lamar released his second album “To Pimp a Butterfly” (TDE/Aftermath/Interscope), one of this year’s most anticipated releases in any genre, and also one of the least likely. (It was surprise-released online, a week before its advertised release.)Mr. Lamar is a hip-hop star with barely a hip-hop hit to his name, a dissenter from the mainstream who’s developed a large enough following to undermine notions of what mainstream might mean in this era. It’s an album of shocking conscience and self-laceration, one that shows Mr. Lamar to be not only one of hip-hop’s most provocative thinkers, but one of its most history-minded as well.On this week’s Popcast, Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The Times, speaks with The Times’s pop music reporter, Joe Coscarelli, about Mr. Lamar’s back story, his place in hip-hop, and his potential long-term effect on the genre.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
