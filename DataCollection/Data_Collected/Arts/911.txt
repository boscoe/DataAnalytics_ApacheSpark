Now the first full retrospective of Lewis’s art since his death opens on Friday, Nov. 13, at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.The show, “Procession: The Art of Norman Lewis,” contains more than 90 paintings and works on paper. They follow Lewis’s seemingly effortless movement between representation and abstraction. “Fantasy,” a remarkably early allover abstraction from 1936, is contemporary with beautiful, often sharply political, Social Realist works. By the mid-1940s, those renderings lean increasingly toward a delicate, jazz-inspired abstraction. This gains the upper hand in the late ’40s, only to be infused with intimations of the massed figures of civil rights marches. The exhibition provides a welcome opportunity to assess the rich and varied path of Lewis’s art.Advertisement
