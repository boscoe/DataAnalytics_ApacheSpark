Clive Owen, an Oscar nominee for “Closer” who is now starring on the Cinemax series “The Knick,” will make his Broadway debut in the fall in a revival of Harold Pinter’s “Old Times,” Roundabout Theater Company announced on Monday. The director will be Douglas Hodge, the Tony Award-winning actor (“La Cage aux Folles”) who considered Pinter a mentor and starred in several of his plays in London. (Pinter, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005, died in 2008.) “Old Times,” a chilling drama about the intersecting relationships among a husband, a wife, and her best friend, will begin performances on Sept. 17 at either the American Airlines Theater or Studio 54, which are both Roundabout houses. Roundabout has another play lined up for Broadway this fall, “Thérèse Raquin” starring Keira Knightley, whose theater has yet to be announced. Roundabout executives are now discussing which theater is best for each play. A different revival of “Old Times” ran in London in 2013, starring Rufus Sewell, Kristin Scott Thomas and Lia Williams, in which the two women traded roles at different performances. Casting for the two female characters is underway for the Roundabout production.
