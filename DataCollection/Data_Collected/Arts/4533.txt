A less visible game, but one just as important culturally to those who play it, is profiled Tuesday night on the World Channel in an absorbing documentary called “9-Man.”The sport, a variation of volleyball with nine men on each side, is played with gusto by Chinese-Americans and other Asian-Americans — the distinction is important and sometimes a source of contention — in cities all over North America. The film, by Ursula Liang, chronicles the journey to an annual tournament that brings teams from many cities together over Labor Day weekend to crown a champion.The tournament, though, just provides a framework for the film. Its heart is its exploration of the sport as an expression of cultural identity. It was developed in China and played by immigrants looking for a shared activity suited to the cramped geography of urban Chinatowns. In the middle of the last century, teams from different cities began competing regularly.“We had a great time,” says a 91-year-old former player named Henry Oi, “not just because of having fun playing volleyball, but socializing with other Chinese-Americans from other cities and learning how they were getting along in this country.”Ms. Liang, a former staff editor at The New York Times, shows that cultural identity is not as clear-cut as it might have once seemed. The current rules of the sport specify that six of the players on each side must be 100 percent Chinese and that the other three have to be at least partly Asian, though what that means is vague and the subject of challenges at the intracity tournaments.The racial component is somewhat connected to a broader issue of survival for the sport as first-generation players age and wonder if they’ll be able to pass on the tradition to younger athletes. “My goal is not to win this thing,” Paul Chin, coach of a Washington, D.C., team, says of the tournament. “My goal is to make sure it keeps going.”Advertisement
