The Chris Brown drama continues. The embattled R&B singer announced on Monday night that he was being forced to postpone his “Between the Sheets” tour with Trey Songz and Tyga after his probation was revoked following a nightclub shooting earlier this month. The 26-date arena tour was scheduled to begin on Tuesday night at the Hampton Coliseum in Virginia, followed by a show on Thursday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.The complications started when five people were shot while Mr. Brown was performing at a private party in San Jose, Calif., on Jan. 11. At a subsequent court hearing, a Los Angeles County judge said Mr. Brown had violated his probation — stemming from the 2009 assault of his then-girlfriend Rihanna — by not receiving permission to travel for the concert and failing to complete his court-ordered community service.“The judge would not sign off on my travel to do the tour until I finish these last 100 hours of community service,” Mr. Brown wrote on Instagram on the eve of the tour’s first show. “This is the most disappointing news I’ve gotten in a while.”“The show must go on,” he continued, vowing to complete the work. “Out of 1,000 hours I only have 100 left.” Of the tour, he added, “It’s not canceled. Just moved around a couple weeks.” Live Nation, the promoter and ticketing company behind the shows, has not yet announced new dates.
