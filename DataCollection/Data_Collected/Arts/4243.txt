Phil Rudd, the drummer for the still-kicking Australian rock band AC/DC, pleaded guilty to charges of threatening murder and drug possession on Tuesday in New Zealand, the BBC reported. Mr. Rudd, 60, was arrested in November and charged with trying to hire a hit man — apparently because of  frustrations with the release of his solo album, “Head Job,” last year — although that more serious charge was promptly dropped because of  a lack of evidence.Craig Tuck, a lawyer for Mr. Rudd, said on Tuesday that “this matter essentially revolved around an angry phone call, that was it.” Mr. Rudd had previously pleaded not guilty to the lesser offenses. He will be sentenced in June for the threat charge, as well as possession of cannabis and methamphetamine.Mr. Rudd joined AC/DC in 1974 but was fired in 1983; he rejoined the group in 1994. After his arrest the AC/DC guitarist Angus Young told The Age: “He’s a great drummer, and he’s done a lot of stuff for us. But he seems to have let himself go. He’s not the Phil we’ve known from the past.”AC/DC released its latest album, “Rock or Bust,” in December. This month, without Mr. Rudd, the band headlined two nights at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., and will set off on a world tour beginning in May.A version of this article appears in print on 04/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: AC/DC Drummer Enters Guilty Plea.
