Once again, the Rolling Stones will spend the summer in stadiums across America.On Tuesday, the band announced the 15-city “ZIP Code” tour — its name a nod to  the Andy Warhol-designed zipper cover of their 1971 album “Sticky Fingers,” which will be rereleased on May 26.On May 24, the Rolling Stones will get going at Petco Park in San Diego, before hitting cities including Dallas, Atlanta, Nashville, Milwaukee, Detroit and Buffalo. The current crop of dates ends July 15 at the Festival d’Été de Québec. “ZIP Code” marks the first time the Rolling Stones have toured American stadiums since 2007’s “A Bigger Bang Tour.”This time around, the band promises to play the hits plus “special gems from their extraordinary catalog,” according to a tour announcement. There will be video screens, special effects and a stage “that extends deep into the audience, allowing the Stones to interact directly with their fans.”In a promotional video, Mick Jagger said, “People say, ‘How come you’re still doing this?’ But I can’t believe I did this when I was 20.”Tickets go on sale for the United States tour dates on April 13 and for the Canadian show on April 11.
