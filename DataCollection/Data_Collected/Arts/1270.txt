Rem Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture has won an international competition to design the Factory Manchester, a major new arts center in Manchester, England. The project, which the firm won over high-profile shortlisted competitors like Rafael Viñoly, Zaha Hadid and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, will be the first large-scale British building for the Rotterdam-based practice, which this year completed the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow and the Fondazione Prada in Milan.The Factory is named after Factory Records, which started in Manchester in 1978 and signed Joy Division and New Order, among other bands. It will be built on the former Granada Studios site in the city center and is part of a larger 15-acre development that will contain residences, hotels, restaurants, offices and green space. The new arts space is intended to be polyvalent and be able to accommodate theater, music, dance, film, technology, performance and live transmission.“It will be a super-flexible new kind of space, a space for artists to make the work of the future,” Maria Balshaw, the director of culture at the Manchester City Council, said. “It won’t look like a theater or an art gallery; it will straddle forms and be able to cater for several thousand or a few hundred simultaneously. It will make work happen that you won’t see anywhere else in the north, or even in the U.K.”The budget for The Factory is 110 million British pounds (about $166 million), toward which which the British government pledged about $118 million last year as part of an economic development initiative in the north of England. On Wednesday, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in his annual Spending Review that from 2018, the government would provide about $13.6 million more per year for running costs.The Factory will also be the home of the biennial Manchester International Festival, which emphasizes new work and has given the city a huge cultural boost over the last decade. Construction will begin in 2016, with completion projected for summer 2019, in time for that year’s festival.
