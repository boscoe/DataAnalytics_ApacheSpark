Here are some of the new faces and places appearing in Season 5: Read no further if you want to remain unsullied.Sand SnakesThey are three violent, illegitimate daughters of Prince Oberyn Martell — in the north, such children have the surname Snow; in the south, Sand — who live in Dorne, a new location (scenes were shot in Spain). The three sand snakes seek to avenge their father’s death, and each wields a signature weapon; you may have seen one of them bullwhipping a barrel off a buried person’s head in a trailer. That was perhaps enough to turn them into your new favorite “Thrones” characters.Myrcella BaratheonMyrcella, the daughter of Cersei and Jaime Lannister, was seen fleetingly in earlier seasons before Tywin Lannister bethrothed her to Trystane Martell (Toby Sebastian), a Dorne heir, for political reasons. She’s played by a new actress this season (Nell Tiger Free) and, with Tywin’s death last season, will be more prominent in the story. She is currently the ward of Prince Doran Martell (Alexander Siddig), Trystane’s father and Oberyn’s brother, and they live in a palace in Dorne (actually the Alcázar of Seville).House of Black and WhiteThe citadel in Braavos is the somewhat monastic headquarters of the Faceless Men, an order of assassins who change their faces as necessary. Arya Stark is headed there for training after being introduced to the group by Jaqen H’ghar, who did some wetwork for her in Season 2.The SparrowsA group of religious zealots who show up in King’s Landing, they follow the Faith of the Seven, one of the major religions in the “Game of Thrones” universe. They are led by the High Sparrow, played by the British actor Jonathan Pryce.Advertisement
