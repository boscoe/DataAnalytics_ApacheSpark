WARSAW — Roman Polanski has promised to cooperate with the Polish authorities after they received an extradition request from the United States, which the filmmaker fled before final sentencing on a statutory rape charge in 1978.“I know that the extradition request has come and of course I will undergo the procedure and we will see,” Mr. Polanski said in an interview with Polish news channel TVN24 late Monday. “I trust Poland’s judiciary system.” Polish prosecutors said last week that before they bring the case before a judge they planned to question the Polish-born director, 81, who lives in France but now stays in Krakow, where he intends to make his new film on the Dreyfus affair.Last October, Poland refused a United States request to arrest the Oscar-winning director after he attended the opening of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw. The Polish authorities said they were confident the filmmaker would make himself available if required.In 2010, Switzerland rejected a United States warrant to extradite Mr. Polanski, who spent 290 days in jail or under house arrest at his Swiss home while the case was considered.
