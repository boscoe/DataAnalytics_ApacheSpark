CreditInstitut Lumière        PARIS — Back before Instagram and selfies, before home movies and Kodachrome — and long before the obsessive documentation and online sharing of every moment of our waking lives — there were two brothers from Lyon whose innovations opened the door to the future.Timed to the 120th anniversary of the first film screening shown to a paying audience, a new exhibition at the Grand Palais here celebrates the aptly named Lumière brothers, Louis and Auguste, whose last name means light and who helped invent cinema as we know it — as well as color photography and 3-D technology. In grainy black and white, that first film they screened shows workers leaving the Lumière factory, which manufactured photographic equipment.On view through June 14, the exhibition “Lumière! Inventing Cinema” showcases early films by the brothers, restored by the Institut Lumière in Lyon, a film history and restoration center; along with examples of early cinema technology — kinetoscopes, zoetropes — and documentation about the rapid spread of the medium at the turn of the 20th century.The show captures a time of optimism when viewers first had access to footage from around the world, before the carnage of World War I descended on Europe. It also seeks to put the Lumière brothers in context. Many innovators, including Thomas Edison in the United States, were experimenting with recording images. But it was Louis Lumière who in 1894 invented the cinematograph, a compact device that united all the existing technology to capture 17-meter films (each about 50 seconds long) on 35-millimeter strips and to project them. He patented the machine in 1895.Advertisement“He’s the last of the inventors but he’s the first of the filmmakers,” said Thierry Frémaux, director of the Cannes Film Festival and of the Institut Lumière, who is a curator of the exhibition with Jacques Gerber. “Lumière was a great filmmaker,” Mr. Frémaux added. “There’s something extremely cinematographic in the films that Louis Lumière and his cameramen made.”Both brothers were inventors, but Auguste focused more on the science, while Louis enjoyed filmmaking. As soon as the technology took hold, they dispatched a team of novice filmmakers across the globe to document the known world — street scenes in Japan and Budapest, oil drilling in Azerbaijan, opium smokers in Indochina, peasants in Mexico.AdvertisementGabriel Veyre, a young pharmacist, became one of the most industrious and widely traveled of the Lumière cameramen. In 1896, he shot and screened the first projections in Mexico. “Everyone was exclaiming: Muy bonito! How beautiful, how beautiful!” Veyre wrote from Mexico City to his mother in France in a letter quoted in the exhibition. The show also includes letters home by Constant Girel, another cameraman, who shot the first films in Polynesia and Japan, and Marius Chapuis, who left for Russia at age 18 in 1896 and screened the first film in Odessa that year.The Lumière form immediately had early adopters: The Frenchman Georges Méliès tried to buy one of the brothers’ first cinematographs but they refused. He eventually acquired other equipment to make his own movies, including “A Trip to the Moon,” a hugely popular 1902 fantasy film. Already by 1896, Léon Gaumont and Charles Pathé had started in film distribution and production, a legacy that continues to this day in France. By 1914, Hollywood began to take off.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the 1,500 films made by the Lumières and their filmmakers include fiction films as well as reportage, including “Pierrot and the Fly,” filmed by Louis Lumière in 1896. In the exhibition, which is as dim as a movie theater, all 1,500 films are being shown on a huge wall-size screen, like a rose window to cinema.The story of the Lumières is also a story of canny entrepreneurs. The brothers’ father, Antoine, was a sign painter turned portrait photographer in the early days of the form. He married a laundress. Auguste was born in 1862 and Louis in 1864. In 1881, at age 17, Louis discovered a way to capture images on dry plates with gelatin silver bromide. Quick to see the potential, Antoine went into business to manufacture the product.By 1892, Antoine Lumière and Sons was the second-largest photographic company in the world, after Eastman Kodak in the United States. In 1903, Louis Lumière patented a procedure for color photography. Some early examples of the form — happy scenes of Lumière family holidays — are on view here. (The two brothers married two sisters.)The exhibition also has a model of the Salon Indien inside the elegant Hotel Scribe in Paris, where 10 Lumière films, including of the workers leaving the factory, were on the program of the first public screening to a small, rapt paying audience in 1895. “Lumière invented the movie theater,” Mr. Frémaux said. “Of course, you can watch films on watches, on iPhones, great. But the movie theater is incomparable.”An article last Monday about an exhibition in Paris celebrating the film pioneers Louis and Auguste Lumière referred incorrectly to the attempt of another early filmmaker, Georges Méliès, to buy one of the Lumière brothers’ cinematograph machines. The Lumières in fact refused his offer and he eventually purchased filmmaking equipment elsewhere; he did not buy one of their first cinematographs. The article also referred incorrectly to films that Louis Lumière captured on 35-millimeter strips to later project with a cinematograph. They were 17-meter films, lasting about 50 seconds, not 17-minute films.A version of this article appears in print on April 6, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Illuminating the Invention of Cinema.
