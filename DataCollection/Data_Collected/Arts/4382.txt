Buoyed by strong reviews and a fondness for the movie that inspired it, the new musical “An American in Paris” last week brought in more money than any of this season’s other new Broadway shows.The balletic musical had its most lucrative week yet, grossing $1.2 million, and its producers announced on Friday that the show would begin a national tour next year. The musical, based on the film that won the best picture Oscar in 1952, is directed by Christopher Wheeldon, an English choreographer with a long history working in ballet, and starts two classically trained dancers, Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope. The show was closely followed in the grosses by “Finding Neverland,” which has been consistently bringing in more than $1 million a week — last week it was at $1.1 million. That show also plans a national tour next year.Last week was the final week in which productions could open on Broadway and qualify for this year’s Tony Awards, so it brought an end to a flurry of show openings. On Tuesday, the nominees for this year’s Tony Awards will be announced, and that news could have a significant impact on the financial performance of several shows, leading some to close and others to sell more tickets.“Something Rotten!”, a new musical about two brother-playwrights who turn to musical writing while struggling to compete against William Shakespeare, had its best week yet, bringing in $716,593 despite having comped all the tickets to its opening-night performance.  “Fun Home,” a new musical based on the bestselling graphic memoir by Alison Bechdel, also had its best week yet, bringing in $436,173, according to a report on the weekly grosses released Monday by the Broadway League.The weekly grosses suggested that “Living on Love,” a comedy featuring the opera star Renée Fleming, is facing serious trouble. It grossed $155,646 in its first week since opening; that’s less than it had been grossing during previews.
