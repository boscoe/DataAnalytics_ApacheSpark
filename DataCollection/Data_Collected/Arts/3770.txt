On April 1 the organizers of the O, Miami Poetry Festival begin their annual monthlong campaign to put a poem in front of all 2.6 million residents of Miami-Dade County. “Miamians should watch out for poems on buildings, on fences, in the mail, even in the bathroom,” Scott Cunningham, the festival director, said.This year’s edition includes 30 events and 23 projects, some orthodox, others not. “Ode to the Code,” a joint project with WLRN, the local public radio station, asks area residents to write poems based on their ZIP codes: five lines, with the number of words per line matching the numbers in their codes.“Cease and Exist” is the pet project of Quinn Smith, a lawyer and poet. It invites residents to send “cease and exist” letters from the fictional law firm of William, Carlos & Williams to friends, relatives or politicians leading unpoetic lives.Finally, bathroom poetry. Miamians — at least male Miamians — will be pleased to see poetic passages in gold leaf paint applied to urinals all over town by the artist Ian Thomas. Without going into details, let us say that the project is interactive, and the works will be ephemeral.A version of this article appears in print on 03/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Words of the Poets Written on ... Urinals?.
