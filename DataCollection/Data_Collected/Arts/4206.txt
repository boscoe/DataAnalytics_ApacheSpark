LOS ANGELES – Box office analysts have run out of bad car puns — raced laps, zoomed past, revved up, burned rubber, put pedal to the metal – to describe the performance of “Furious 7,” which took in an additional $29.1 million over the weekend in North America, for a three-week global total of $1.15 billion.Interest in “Furious 7” (Universal Pictures) remained so strong that three new releases could only, ahem, eat its dust.Second-place “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” (Sony Pictures Entertainment) sold an estimated $24 million in tickets, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. Sony is happy with that total – the sequel cost a modest $30 million to make – but this series probably  stops here. Sequels are expected to improve on the results of the preceding film, and initial sales for “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2” were 30 percent lower than the three-day opening total for the first installment in 2009, after adjusting for inflation. (The first “Paul Blart” was released on a holiday weekend, Sony noted.)The true achievement for “Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,” starring Kevin James, directed by Andy Fickman and produced by Adam Sandler, may have been receiving a rare zero percent positive score on RottenTomatoes.com, which aggregates reviews.“Unfriended,” a horror movie from Universal and Blumhouse Productions that cost $1 million to make, arrived in third place, with ticket sales of about $16 million. “Unfriended” marks Blumhouse’s 11th microbudgeted film to open to more than $15 million, Universal said  Sunday.The only other new wide-release film in the marketplace, the Disneynature documentary “Monkey Kingdom,” took in about $4.7 million, on par with expectations. Disney spent roughly $10 million to make the documentary, which was narrated by Tina Fey and timed to coincide with Earth Day, which is Wednesday.
