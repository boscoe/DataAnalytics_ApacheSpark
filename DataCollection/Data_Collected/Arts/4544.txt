CreditPinacoteca Comunale Giuseppe De Nittis, Barletta        MILAN — Did the Chinese pavilion at the 1900 international exposition in Paris stimulate new interest in tea and rice, which thousands tasted for the first time? Were the hot dog and ice cream cone really invented, as some claim, to feed the masses at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904?These and other questions at the intersection of food, culture and history are raised by Arts & Foods, an exhibition-cum-pavilion that is part of Expo Milano 2015, the world’s fair that opened here on Friday.The exhibition is in central Milan at the Palazzo dell’Arte, designed in 1933 to host international exhibitions of the era’s contemporary architecture, decorative arts and industrial design. It takes as its context the huge international fairs, beginning with the Great Exhibition in London of 1851, of which Expo Milano is the latest.By their very nature, world’s fairs look forward, showcasing national innovation and ingenuity in any number of fields. Arts & Foods, which was inaugurated in early April, is distinctive for its historiographical approach — tracking what we eat, how we eat, how we preserve and package what we eat, and how artists and designers have presented, and represented, these rituals for the past 164 years.Advertisement“The project aims to present an investigation of art and food, treated as a territory for analysis of the social and cultural factors that have conditioned the arts in relation to food produced all over the world,” the Italian art critic Germano Celant, the curator of the exhibition, writes in his introductory essay for the show’s hefty, 960-page catalogue.AdvertisementThe exhibition also raises the question about the impact that world’s fairs may have had on public tastes and habits.Hosted by La Triennale di Milano, a cultural institution dedicated to promoting contemporary arts and design, the pavilion is quintessentially Milanese: If Rome is best known as an open-air showcase for Italian artistic ingenuity — layered and intertwined through centennial strata — Milan has earned its fame in more recent years as Italy’s fashion and design powerhouse, producing high-end contemporary ware, which is significantly present in the exhibition.“With all our defects, our country has one great merit, the ability to merge creative intuition and the artisanal model,” said Filippo Del Corno, the Milan council member responsible for culture. Milan is where that comes together, he said.The exhibition also astutely chronicles the modern shift in aesthetics, where yesterday’s household ware — be it a Guzzini coffeepot, a Magic Chef stove or a Braun blender — becomes today’s cult object, preserved for what it is, rather than for what it does.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Take the Last Supper, Leonardo’s famed version of which is painted on the walls of the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a short walk away. In this exhibition, the final meal shared by Jesus and his disciples is presented in various interpretations — from the traditional take painted in the mid-16th century by Bonifacio de’ Pitati, assigned in the exhibition to decorate the walls of a recreated 19th-century dining room, to modern interpretations meant to shake those same artistic foundations. Those include Andy Warhol’s “The Last Supper (Camel/57)” from 1986, Andres Serrano “Black Supper (I-V)” from 1990 and Vik Muniz’s 1997 version, made with chocolate sauce.The still life — another artistic theme where food often features prominently — is chronicled as it metamorphoses from traditional canvases to increasingly daring representations by Paul Gauguin, an array of Cubists and Futurists, and modern photographers like Luigi Ghirri, Robert Mapplethorpe, Michiko Kon and Celia A. Shapiro. (Ms. Shapiro’s “Last Supper” series, depicting the last meals requested by prisoners before being executed, is also on view here.)Visitors have a smorgasbord of other tidbits to savor: a short history of picnics and related ware; airplane and astronaut cuisine; cannibalism-related implements, both real and imaginary (in a surrealist guise); an array of menus; and even a parallel exhibition, for children’s eyes only, that features toys.A version of this special report appears in print on May 4, 2015, in The International New York Times.
