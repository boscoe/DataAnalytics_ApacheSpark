Blood Orange is the recording and performing name for Dev Hynes, who grew up in London and became an excellent New Yorker about 10 years ago. He’s become semi-popular for his songs — the curious and elegiac tracks on the albums “Coastal Grooves” and “Cupid Deluxe” — but beyond the recorded evidence, Blood Orange represents a force of motion, aggregation, reclamation and scholarship. In his own work and through his collaborations with female singers — Carly Rae Jepsen, Solange Knowles, FKA twigs, Sky Ferreira — he’s been creatively juxtaposing the sounds of ’80s and ’90s R&B and dance music against changing contemporary aesthetics. He has never fully committed to becoming a touring act, but it’s not a stretch to predict that “Blood Orange and Friends,” at the Apollo on Dec. 12, will be a memorable scene. Guests include the rappers Le1f and Junglepussy; the hip-hop trio Ratking; and a D.J. set by Kindness, a.k.a. the singer Adam Bainbridge.
