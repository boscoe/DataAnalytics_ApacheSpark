The anonymous overseas collector who bought Rembrandt’s “Portrait of Catrina Hooghsaet” through Sotheby’s in London in early June has said that he plans to withdraw the export application and allow it to remain, at least temporarily, in Britain.Officials at Sotheby’s, which arranged the private treaty sale from the Douglas Pennant family in England for £35 million, or about $54 million, said the buyer was considering a long-term loan to a British art institution. These might include a possible loan to Penrhyn Castle in north Wales, where the portrait had been on display from 1949 to 2013, or to the National Museum Cardiff in Wales.“If these intentions materialize, that will mean, of course, that the picture will remain — for some time to come — in the U.K., very possibly on view to the public, and that no funds will need to be raised in order to make that happen,” said Mitzi Mina, a Sotheby’s spokeswoman, in an email.The decision comes a week after the Culture Ministry in Britain announced it would delay an export license for the artwork until mid-February, in the hope of finding an in-country buyer to match the price the foreign buyer had agreed to pay.Alison Millar, a spokeswoman at Arts Council England, which oversees culturally significant art and objects and recommended that the ministry delay the export license, said it was awaiting formal confirmation from the applicant’s agents that the export license had been withdrawn. “When we have this confirmation, we will advise accordingly,” she said by email.
