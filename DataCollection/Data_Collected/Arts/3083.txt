LOS ANGELES – Judge Judith Sheindlin has signed on for five more televised years of sorting out rancorous rent disputes, adjudicating stranger-than-fiction dognapping cases and, as ever, zinging litigants as coming from a long line of idiots.CBS Global Distribution, which syndicates “Judge Judy” around the world, on Monday said  that the daytime program’s no-nonsense star had agreed to extend her contract through 2020, when she will be 77 years old. “Judge Judy,” currently in its 19th season, has been the highest-rated show in first-run syndication for the last five years, CBS said. It has lately been averaging roughly 10 million viewers.No terms were disclosed. Under her last contract, Judge Sheindlin earned an estimated $47 million annually.Judge Sheindlin’s new contract also includes a production deal with her company, Queen Bee Productions, which is behind “Hot Bench,” a court program that arrived in syndication last year. In a statement, Judge Sheindlin, formerly a prosecutor and a judge in New York City, said she was “very excited” with the production deal in particular, as it allows her to create “compelling and smart TV.”
