When the choreographer Paul Taylor reinvented his company as Paul Taylor’s American Modern Dance, his plan called for it to continue to present his work along with other modern dance masterpieces and new dances by contemporary choreographers.  Now, as its inaugural season gets underway at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Mr. Taylor announced Thursday that the first three choreographers commissioned to create new dances are Doug Elkins, Larry Keigwin and Lila York.Each will be given six weeks to work with the dancers of Mr. Taylor’s company at his studios on Grand Street, with a goal of creating works that will be danced in future seasons of American Modern Dance at Lincoln Center.“The public is hungry for new dances, which are the lifeblood of a modern dance company and the reason I make two new dances every year,” Mr. Taylor, 84, said in a statement.This season American Modern Dance is presenting 19 Taylor works and work by Doris Humphrey and Shen Wei.A version of this article appears in print on 03/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Paul Taylor Enlists Three to Create New Works.
