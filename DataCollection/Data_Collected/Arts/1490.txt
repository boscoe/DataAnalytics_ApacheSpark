MEXICO CITY — What do the architect David Chipperfield, the writer Mia Couto, the filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón, the composer Philip Glass, the performance and video artist Joan Jonas, the theater director Robert Lepage and the choreographer Ohad Naharin have in common? Aside from being internationally famous artists in their respective disciplines, they are also the new mentors in the 2016-17 Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative.The mentors were announced on Sunday at the Centro Cultural del Bosque here, in a presentation that celebrated the most recent cycle of the program. The initiative, which pairs major arts figures with up-and-coming talents in the fields of film, literature, dance, visual arts, music, theater and architecture, was established by Rolex in 2002. It now has a high-powered roster of mentor alumni, including Julie Taymor, Robert Wilson, William Forsythe, Youssou N’Dour, David Hockney, William Kentridge, Anish Kapoor, Gilberto Gil, Alexei Ratmansky, Alejandro G. Iñárritu and Olafur Eliasson.Each new mentor will choose a protégé by June from a short-list drawn up by a committee of experts in each discipline, and agrees to spend at least 30 days in the next year working with that mentee. The protégés, who must be professionals in each field, receive a stipend of 25,000 Swiss francs ($25,000), and are eligible for an additional $25,000 at the end of the year to support the creation of new work.“This is a very diverse group of artists who have had a great influence on their art forms, and are at very particular points in their careers,” said Rebecca Irvin, the head of philanthropy at Rolex, between presentations of work by current protégés alongside their mentors. “They are all generous persons who are interested in sharing their knowledge and passion.”A version of this article appears in print on 12/08/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Mentors Are Named for Rolex Program.
