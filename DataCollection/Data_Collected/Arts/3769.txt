MINNEAPOLIS – To celebrate its 75th anniversary as a public institution, the Walker Art Center will embark on a $75 million renovation of its rolling campus, the final stage of an expansion that began more than a decade ago with the addition of a new building by the architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. The new project will restructure the museum’s grounds and add a highly visible entrance pavilion, and it will also tie the Walker more closely to the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden across the street, home to “Spoonbridge and Cherry,” the sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen that has become a Minneapolis landmark.The capital project will increase the Walker’s endowment and will eventually allow the museum, which programs the city-owned sculpture garden, to add more works to the grounds, where some 40 pieces, by artists like Ellsworth Kelly and Jenny Holzer, now sit. “We’re one gateway to downtown Minneapolis, and we think of this as a kind of once-in-a-generation opportunity to shape that entry,” said Olga Viso, the Walker’s executive director.The project – which will be overseen by the Dutch design firm Inside Outside and the Minneapolis architecture firm HGA – will take place along with a complete restructuring of the sculpture garden, paid for with $10 million in public funds and designed by the landscape architect Thomas Oslund. The public money, along with almost $50 million in private contributions to the Walker so far, puts the museum at 80 percent of its fund-raising total for the overall project, which is expected to be completed by spring 2017.Ms. Viso said it was too early to announce the names of the artists who would contribute new works to the sculpture garden but that there would be “eight to 10 new anchoring pieces,” by “the next generation of artists – with a global focus.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Walker Art Center Plans $75 Million Renovation.
