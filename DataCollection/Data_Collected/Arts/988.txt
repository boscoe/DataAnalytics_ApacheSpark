LONDON — The Brontë Society in Haworth in northern England will acquire a previously unknown poem written by a young Charlotte Brontë, the society announced this week.The poem was found along with a sliver of prose, folded into a book that belonged to the author’s mother, Maria. The book had been on a boat carrying her belongings that was shipwrecked off the coast of Devonshire, England, in the early 1800s. It was one of the few artifacts belonging to Maria Brontë that survived.An American family has owned the book since 1916. The Brontë Society, which runs the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, learned about it when a rare books dealer contacted the organization over a year ago. It is unclear whether the family that owned the book knew it contained a poem by the famous author.The prose piece was written when Charlotte (best known as the author of “Jane Eyre”) was 17. The poem was most  likely written around the same time, though its date has not been confirmed.The society plans to formally acquire the book and its contents for about 200,000 pounds, or $300,000, within the next several weeks, Ann Dinsdale, the museum’s collections manager, said in a phone interview.Both the poem and the prose piece deal with characters from Angria, a fictional kingdom that Charlotte created with her brother Branwell, and wrote about in several stories, some of which were originally scrawled in small handmade books. In the prose piece, characters from Angria encounter people from real cities in England. The poem focuses on the character Mary, an Angrian. Both works are about 70 lines long.“It’s quite romantic, quite dramatic language,” Ms. Disdale said of the poem, adding that it was most notable for having been “written by a teenage girl who even at that age had the ambition to be forever known as a poet.”Next year is the 200th anniversary of Charlotte Brontë’s birth.
