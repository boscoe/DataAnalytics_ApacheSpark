Kennedy, had added Chris Cooper and Cherry Jones to its cast. That’s good stuff — Netflix- or Amazon Prime-level stuff.In the meantime, however, Hulu is giving us, as its latest exclusive series, an amateurish “Animal House” knockoff called “Resident Advisors” that is very bad stuff indeed. Produced by Paramount Digital Entertainment, which supplied Hulu with the much better “Burning Love,” its seven episodes will become available to stream on Thursday.Produced by, among others, the actress Elizabeth Banks and the veteran writer and producer Ira Ungerleider (“Friends,” “Mixology”), “Resident Advisors” follows the misadventures of a group of live-in college-dorm counselors — the kooky one, the sincere one, the dumb and oversexed one. The kooky one staples condoms to a board, putting holes in them, and hands them out to students. The dumb one kicks a squatter out of a dorm room only to learn that she is a real student. The sincere one is in his 30s, which is hilarious, and is named Weiner. Played by Ryan Hansen of “Veronica Mars,” he does get the best line of the two episodes available for review: “That guy could have autoerotic-asphyxiated on anybody’s watch.”The crew is led by an earnest achiever who sees the job as a springboard to Silicon Valley success. She’s played by the attractive Korean-American actress Jamie Chung, who within the first two episodes is groped by both white male regular cast members, gives herself a breast exam and steps in dog poop. Ms. Chung demonstrates admirable patience but not a lot of comic ability, which is unfortunate given that much of the comedy is supposed to derive from her reactions to the grossness around her.Advertisement
