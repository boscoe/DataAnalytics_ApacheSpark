He has painted Mao shirtless, Mao with pigtails, Mao as a Quaker (on a cereal container) and Mao with one eye and two mouths. He has even built an unplayable Ping-Pong table with Mao-shaped cutouts.Mr. Zhang’s career of almost half a century, which plays subtly and at times deviously with Chinese traditions and East versus West stereotypes, is the subject of a first-ever American survey at the Queens Museum, opening Sunday, Oct. 18. It brings together more than 50 works, including sketches from his days in China and series like “Soy Sauce Calligraphy” and “Remade Landscapes,” paintings that mash up Western modernist and classical Chinese styles.
