On Thursday night, after a grueling month of competitions, its “Santas in the Barn” will identify the best Santa in the United States.At least, that’s the claim of the series, which began Dec. 2 with 10 competitors, including a fireman Santa and a pirate Santa. The first challenge, a team affair, was to stack a sleigh as high as possible with gifts, then drag it to a pole — the “North” pole, of course.For the finale, three Santas remain. The tests they are put through to determine the winner include remaining jolly while riding a stationary sleigh that is the equivalent of a mechanical bull — it bucks, it bounces. Oh, and they do so while being pummeled by a snow-making machine. Even more difficult: The three have to answer questions from precocious young children. “Why do you use reindeer instead of helicopters and airplanes?” Why indeed.Advertisement
