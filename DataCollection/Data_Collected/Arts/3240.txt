Hilary Mantel, the British author whose best-selling novels “Wolf Hall” and “Bring Up the Bodies” have been adapted for a stage production soon to open on Broadway, hopes that one of her next projects will be writing a play.Ms. Mantel, speaking at the 92nd Street Y on Sunday night, said that the experience of watching her books be transformed for the theater had inspired her to try a different form of writing. She has already written multiple novels and a memoir, and said that, in addition to writing the final book in her trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, she is working on several more novels, a nonfiction book, and a work of historical fiction about Africa.“I would like to write a play,” she said in response to a question from the audience. “The process of working with this team has changed my vision of what I might want to do in the future.”Ms. Mantel has previously suggested, in less definitive language, that she was intrigued by playwriting; on Sunday night she more explicitly added it to her to-do list, but did not specify either a subject or a timeline.Ms. Mantel spoke alongside Jeremy Herrin, the director of “Wolf Hall: Parts 1 & 2,” which is scheduled to open at the Winter Garden Theater on April 9 after several weeks of previews. Adapted by Mike Poulton, the plays have previously run at the Royal Shakespeare Company and in London’s West End.Asked about the novels’ tough depiction of Sir Thomas More — regarded as a saint by the Catholic Church — Ms. Mantel offered no apology. She called the portrayal of More in “A Man for All Seasons,” the play that became a much-loved movie, “deeply unconvincing” and said it had shown him as “a 1960s liberal.”“It needed a rethink,” she said.
