AdvertisementSupported byBy Siobhan BurkeWhen a Broadway show closes, what happens to the choreography? Dance, not as easily documented as music or dialogue, is at a higher risk of eroding as the production sits in storage. Such is the driving concern behind American Dance Machine for the 21st Century, which keeps musical-theater dances alive and untarnished through exacting reconstructions. Founded in 2012 by Nikki Feirt Atkins, the current incarnation picks up where the 1970s original, established by the dancer and director Lee Becker Theodore, left off a few decades ago.During an otherwise quiet time for dance (excluding “The Nutcracker”), Dance Machine returns to the Joyce Theater for a two-week run directed by the Broadway veteran Wayne Cilento. Performed by dancers from Broadway and beyond, the lineup includes choreography by Agnes de Mille (“Oklahoma!”), Jerome Robbins (“West Side Story”) and Bob Fosse (“Pippin”), as well as an Emmy-winning duet from “So You Think You Can Dance.” (Monday, Dec. 21, through Jan. 3, joyce.org.)Advertisement
