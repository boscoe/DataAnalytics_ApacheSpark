A&E Networks announced on Thursday that the landmark mini-series “Roots” would be remade into an event series, scheduled to air in 2016.The series will run simultaneously on three cable networks: History, A&E and Lifetime. (The networks took the same approach in 2013 with the mini-series “Bonnie and Clyde.”) Like the original, “Roots” will be based primarily on Alex Haley’s novel “Roots: The Saga of an American Family,” which is about the life and descendants of the slave Kunta Kinte.When “Roots” was broadcast on ABC in 1977, it brought in enormous ratings, and the series finale ranks as one of the most-watched events in television history. The mini-series earned nine Emmys, a Golden Globe and a Peabody Award.LeVar Burton, who played the young Kunta Kinte in the ABC mini-series, will serve as co-executive producer. A&E did not announce any casting assignments nor how many episodes the series would run.A version of this article appears in print on 05/02/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Roots’ Redux.
