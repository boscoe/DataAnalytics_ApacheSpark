He has established his own lexicon of terms, which includes modestly sized canvases, atmospheric landscapes populated with partial figures and coy maneuvers into the picture’s shape and surface.One of his signature moves is to puncture the canvas or make it look worn away in places. Another is to stretch translucent material over the wooden supports, transforming the surface into barely a surface at all — or to bow the edges of the picture so that it looks warped. Some of this sounds aggressive, but Mr. James is more in love than embattled with his medium.Where many artists and critics lament the recycling of history in contemporary art, Mr. James embraces it. The works here, with their astral flourishes and alternatingly measured and exuberant strokes of color, strongly echo Whistler, Ensor, Bacon or even Bonnard. Some of the compositions are also reminiscent of Giorgio Morandi, an artist about whom Mr. James once wrote an essay for a British exhibition. (More recently, Mr. James was a curator of a show about the little-known Franco-Prussian painter Serge Charchoune (1889-1975), aptly titled “Other Modernisms.”)The title of this show, “Genre Paintings,” also nods to art history and the hierarchy of academic painting in which genre paintings were lower in the pecking order than history paintings. But if he is suggesting a modest role for his own paintings, Mr. James is acutely aware of the medium’s ability to transfix in an epoch notoriously characterized by perceptual distraction. Many of the paintings here have that ability, as if Mr. James alchemically extracted it from art history and injected it into the canvases, setting a trap to snare his viewers.Sikkema Jenkins & Company 530 West 22nd Street, Chelsea Through March 7 Advertisement
