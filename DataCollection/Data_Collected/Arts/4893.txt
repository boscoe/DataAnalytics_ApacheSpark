The Hungarian writer Laszlo Krasznahorkai won the sixth Man Booker International Prize at a ceremony on Tuesday night in London. The prize, which comes with £60,000, about $93,000, is awarded every two years for a body of work published either originally in English or available in English translation.The novels by Mr. Krasznahorkai that have been translated into English include “The Melancholy of Resistance,” “Satantango” and “Seiobo There Below.” (Mr. Krasznahorkai has collaborated on adaptations of his work, and the work of others, with the film director Bela Tarr.) In a profile of Mr. Krasznahorkai in The Times last year, Larry Rohter wrote that “the English-speaking world has been tardy in discovering what European readers already know: If gloom, menace and entropy are your thing, then Laszlo is your man.” Mr. Rohter wrote that Mr. Krasznahorkai, who was raised under Communism, has a penchant for long sentences, a “claustrophobic atmosphere” and rural settings.Previous winners of the Man Booker International Prize are Ismail Kadaré, Chinua Achebe, Alice Munro, Philip Roth and Lydia Davis.A version of this article appears in print on 05/21/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Hungarian Writer Wins Booker International.
