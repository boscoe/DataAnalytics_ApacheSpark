Starting Friday, the Jewish Museum will present 34 new portraits by Ms. Joffe of Jewish women of the 20th century whose contributions to art, literature and politics have interested her. The redoubtable group includes Sontag, as well as Diane Arbus, Gertrude Stein and Claude Cahun, the Surrealist shape-shifter whose photographic self-portraits as a man, amid many other guises, prefigured Cindy Sherman by decades. Ms. Joffe made the portraits after immersing herself not only in pictures of the women but also in what they wrote and made, striving for depictions charged with her own imagining of what her heroes would have looked like at various stages of their lives.
