It’s beginning to seem like the dissenters have squarely conquered the center of mainstream country. Artists who seemed outré and boundary-pushing a few years ago – Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean, Florida Georgia Line, and so on – are now the genre’s biggest stars, much to the chagrin of an earlier generation that still refuses to mix hip-hop into its country.But there are whole hosts of artists who fit neither model – they’re not the reassuring arena-country aspirants of old nor the newfangled bros of today. This week sees the release of new albums by Zac Brown Band (“Jekyll + Hyde”) and Tyler Farr (“Suffer in Peace”), two country acts finding alternate ways of coloring outside the lines. On this week’s Popcast, Joe Coscarelli, a pop music reporter for The Times, talks to Jon Caramanica, a Times pop music critic,  about what, if anything, country’s borders mean anymore.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
