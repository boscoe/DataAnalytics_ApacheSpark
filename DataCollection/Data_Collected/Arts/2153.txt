LONDON — Sundance London, an offshoot of the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, will not return in 2015,  the website ScreenDaily reported Friday. The London edition has been held at the O2 Center, more usually home to large-scale pop concerts, since 2012 when Robert Redford, the chairman of the Sundance Festival, said that he hoped it would help “build a picture of our country that is broadly reflective of the diversity of voices not always seen in our cultural exports.”No reason was given for the decision, and a representative for Sundance Institute told ScreenDaily that the organization continued to explore options for a London festival. “We hope to be able to return very soon,” the representative added.Sundance has a history of brief offshoots. For three years starting in 2006, the festival collaborated with the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Sundance has since denied rumors of returning to New York.Sundance was founded in 1978 as a showcase and competition for American films, and is generally considered the top showcase for independent film in the United States. This year’s edition, which opens Jan. 22, will show 118 feature-length films, picked from over 4,000 submissions. Sundance London took place on a smaller scale, featuring both films and musical events over four days.
