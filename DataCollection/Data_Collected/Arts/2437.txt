Entering this spectacular exhibition by the West Coast video artist Diana Thater, you might think you’ve walked onto the set of a Stanley Kubrick sci-fi movie. The whole show is flooded by an intense blue glow cast by lights beaming from the floor in all corners. In the center of the gallery is a mysterious, room-size box, which appears to hover a few inches off the floor over a band of bright yellow light. A grainy video is projected on the ceiling directly above the box. It shows large beetles — dung beetles — slowly burrowing into the earth and moving about in thicket of brown grass.In the smaller, oblong gallery, also bathed in blue light, are two video works, each consisting of nine rectangular panels. Both show what seems to be some sort of roughly spherical space vehicle against a background of countless slowly moving stars. In fact, the object is a Zeiss star projector in the planetarium of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.A gallery news release explains that scientists have learned that dung beetles navigate at night by the stars of the Milky Way. If the sky is blocked, they wander aimlessly. Ms. Thater is obliquely addressing a global ecological problem: In urban areas where electric lights are always on, the stars are harder to see. Perhaps that affects life on Earth in ways no one has yet imagined. Maybe astrologists have been on the right track all along.David Zwirner 533 West 19th Street, Chelsea Through Feb. 21 A version of this review appears in print on January 30, 2015, on Page C30 of the New York edition.
