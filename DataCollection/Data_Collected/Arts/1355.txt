It makes sense that James Cohan is opening his Lower East Side gallery with a show devoted to Robert Smithson. Titled “Pop,” it features works on paper and sculpture dating from 1963 to 1965, when the artist was in his 20s. Though far better known for his Earthworks of the late 1960s and early 70s, like “Spiral Jetty,” Smithson was prolific on paper.Born in Passaic, N.J., he is largely represented here by material inspired by rambles through Manhattan, from the porn shops of Times Square to the American Museum of Natural History’s dinosaur exhibits. The works are composed like biblical panel paintings and include erotic nudes cast as American icons. Some wear scuba masks or feathered headdresses; others are action figures adorned by wings and thunderbolts. “I am convinced,” Smithson wrote in 1967, “that the future is lost somewhere in the dumps of the nonhistorical past; it is in yesterday’s newspapers, in the jejune advertisements of science-fiction movies, in the false mirror of our rejected dreams.” (Through Jan. 10. jamescohan.com.)A version of this article appears in print on November 29, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Art; Imagery Inhaled From Idle Dreams.
