The morning after the Grammys, Kanye West was still feeling charged. Whereas most artists would be riding high from not one but two standout performances at the Sunday night show — including “Only One,” a minimalist lullaby to his young daughter, and the rollicking “FourFiveSeconds” with Rihanna and Paul McCartney, neither featuring any rapping — Mr. West’s overflowing adrenaline was on behalf of another. “C’mon, man, I love Beck,” Mr. West said in a paparazzi video published on Monday by TMZ. “But he ain’t have the album of the year.”Mr. West’s pick, as it was at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when he famously interrupted Taylor Swift before letting her finish, was Beyoncé, whose self-titled “visual album” was released without warning in 2013 complete with music videos for every song, something akin to music’s Manhattan Project.At the show, Mr. West had nodded to his own past awards show antics by stepping on stage with Beck, the polite folk singer, when the surprise pick for album of the year was announced, only to smile sheepishly and turn back without speaking. But the message was clear. “Y’all knew what it meant when ‘Ye walked on that stage,” Mr. West said of himself at an after party event televised by E! “The Grammys, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us,” he added. “Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats of music — it’s disrespectful to inspiration.”“Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should have given his award to Beyoncé,” Mr. West said.While Beck stopped short of forfeiting the top honor, he seemed to at least agree with the sentiment. “I thought she was going to win,” Beck told Us Weekly at a separate after party, adding that Beyoncé “absolutely” should have prevailed. “Come on, she’s Beyoncé!” he said, not quite as convincingly as Mr. West.
