The best-selling writer Hilary Mantel could add a Tony Award to the pair of Man Booker Prizes she earned for the novels “Wolf Hall” and “Bring Up the Bodies.”Clearing the way for next week’s Tony nominations, a 24-person committee on Friday issued final rulings about which creators, actors and shows will be eligible for what awards.Responding to a request from the producers of “Wolf Hall, Parts One and Two,” the six-hour play based on Ms. Mantel’s two historical novels, the committee decided that she shared writing credit for the adaptation with Mike Poulton.The play, which originated with the Royal Shakespeare Company and is now at the Winter Garden Theater, is a likely nominee in a field dominated by British plays, including “The Audience,” “Constellations” and “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.”At the close of a 2014-15 Broadway season in which 40 percent of the 35 plays and musicals opened in April, the Tony Awards Administration Committee had a busy day on Friday, ruling on the 18 Broadway productions it had not yet considered.Unlike at some previous meetings, there were no major controversies — no roles played by multiple children (“Billy Elliot,” “Matilda the Musical“) or conjoined adults (“Side Show“). But the rulings are significant as they set the stage for the closely watched awards season, which not only matters to the reputations of actors and others in the theater business, but also can have a significant financial effect on shows and careers.For “Fun Home,” a new musical based on the memoir by the cartoonist Alison Bechdel, the committee decided that Beth Malone, who plays her as an adult, would be eligible for a leading actress nomination. Emily Skeggs and 11-year-old Sydney Lucas, who play her at younger ages, are eligible for featured actress nominations, as is Judy Kuhn, who portrays her mother.Michael Cerveris, the actor playing Ms. Bechdel’s tormented father, will be eligible for a leading actor nomination.For “Something Rotten!,” which, like “Fun Home,” is a strong contender for best new musical, the committee decreed that Brian d’Arcy James and John Cariani, who portray hapless playwright-brothers in the shadow of William Shakespeare, will be considered for leading actor nods; Christian Borle, who brings a rock-star strut to his depiction of Shakespeare, will be eligible as a featured actor. (Mr. Borle already has a Tony as featured actor in a play for “Peter and the Starcatcher.”)Among the other  significant determinations: Previous Tony winners Tyne Daly and Harriet Harris have featured roles in the wedding musical “It Shoulda Been You,” clearing the way for Lisa Howard, who plays the  lovelorn-but-plucky sister of the bride, to vie for lead actress; Steven Boyer and Geneva Carr are eligible in leading roles for the dark comedy “Hand to God“; and the dancers Robert Fairchild and Leanne Cope are the leads in the musical “An American in Paris,” another best musical contender.The Tony nominations, decided by a group of fewer than 40 theater professionals, will be announced at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday. About 850 people then vote on the winners, who will be announced in a ceremony which CBS will broadcast live from Radio City Music Hall at 8 p.m. on June 7.A version of this article appears in print on 04/25/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Tony Committee Issues Final Rulings.
