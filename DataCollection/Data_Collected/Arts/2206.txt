Lancelot Thwaytes sued Sotheby’s for £11 million (about $16.7 million) in damages, claiming that the auctioneers had insufficiently researched his painting “The Cardsharps.” The auction house described the work, below, which depicts two hustlers trying to cheat another man in a card game, as a 17th-century copy of the original by the Italian master Caravaggio. The painting was purchased by a friend of the British collector Denis Mahon, who died in 2011 and who, after further analysis, declared it an authentic Caravaggio and valued the painting at £10 million. The Financial Times reported that Judge Vivien Rose dismissed Mr. Thwaytes’s claim, saying in her ruling that the auctioneers had examined the painting thoroughly, and reasonably concluded that the painting was not of high enough quality to be a Caravaggio. The disputed painting is currently on loan to the Museum of the Order of St John in London.Advertisement
