The Drama League, a national organization of theatergoers, has chosen “An American in Paris” for its top musical honor this year.The organization on Friday announced its 81st annual awards, naming not only “Paris” for its distinguished musical award, but also naming “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” as distinguished play, “The King and I” as distinguished musical revival, and “You Can’t Take It With You” as distinguished play revival.Although the Drama League members can consider Off Broadway as well as Broadway shows, all four winners are Tony-nominated Broadway productions. They passed over, in the musical category, “Hamilton,” and in the play category, “Between Riverside and Crazy,” both of which have been dominating other competitions in which Off Broadway works were considered.The Drama League gives one annual award for a distinguished performance: this year it was granted to Chita Rivera, the Broadway veteran now starring in “The Visit.” Ms. Rivera is in a competitive Tony race for best actress in a musical.Special Drama League awards were also given to Joel Grey, who won a Tony award in 1967 for his performance in “Cabaret” and has appeared in many shows since, for distinguished achievement in musical theater; Stephen Daldry, a two-time Tony winner who is directing this year’s Broadway productions of “The Audience” and “Skylight,” for excellence in directing; and WNET (Neal Shapiro and David Horn) for “unique contribution to the theater.”
