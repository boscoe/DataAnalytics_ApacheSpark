In a plot twist fitting of the stage, a Monroeville, Ala., museum that produces a theater adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel “To Kill a Mockingbird,” announced that it has lost licensing rights to the play indefinitely after this year.For 26 years, fans have flocked to Ms. Lee’s rural hometown to watch locals perform her story about racial injustice. Tom Lomenick, the president of the Monroe County Heritage Museum, who informed the board of the news Thursday at its monthly meeting, said he was given no explanation about the decision from the play’s licensing company, Dramatic Publishing Company. The publisher said Christopher T. Sergel, who holds the rights to the stage adaptation created by his father, had no comment on the decision“We haven’t given up on it,” Mr. Lomenick said. “We’re still negotiating with different parties.”The museum has been trying to extend licensing rights beyond this year, for two years. The play runs Fridays and Saturdays in April and May. “With the play in full swing and having the rights before, it’s an uncomfortable feeling,” said Greg Norris, a Monroe County probate judge, who was involved in negotiations to keep the play in town. Mr. Lomenick estimated that the play’s overall economic effect on the town of 6,300 reaches $1 million. “We’re talking a huge, huge loss for the city,” he said.
