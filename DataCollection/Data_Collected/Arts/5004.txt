You’re in big trouble, mister! The coming Netflix reboot of “Full House” will move forward without Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, the twins who took turns playing the cheeky Michelle Tanner on the ’90s sitcom. “Although Ashley and Mary-Kate will not be a part of ‘Fuller House,’ I know how much ‘Full House’ meant to them and they are still very much considered family,” said Robert L. Boyett, the show’s executive producer, in a statement given to The Hollywood Reporter.The Olsen twins started filming in the role of Michelle at 9 months old, and remained on the show for its full eight seasons. They now run Dualstar, a lifestyle and fashion company. The new season will center on other members of the original Tanner clan, including D. J. (Candace Cameron Bure) and Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin).The Olsens’ former co-star John Stamos, who announced the show’s return on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” last month, tweeted that he was “heartbroken” the twins would not be returning. Still, there’s always a chance they’ll change their minds: David Lynch recently returned to the revival of “Twin Peaks” after renouncing his ties to the project.
