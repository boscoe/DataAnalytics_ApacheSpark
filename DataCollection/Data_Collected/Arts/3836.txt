The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater is losing two of its most treasured members this summer. Antonio Douthit-Boyd and Kirven Douthit-Boyd — who were married in 2013 — have been named the co-artistic directors of the Center of Creative Arts, the St. Louis organization where Antonio Douthit-Boyd trained. Before they take up their new jobs, on Aug. 15, they will perform their final New York season with the Ailey company at the David H. Koch Theater in June, followed by an engagement in Paris in July. For years, the couple have taught at the center each January. “I knew that we could do so much more with the kids on a year-round basis,” Antonio, 34, said. They hope, as Kirven, 30, said, to place it “on the map as one of the best training institutions for young kids in the country.” As dancers, both are still in their prime. “I know a lot of people are like, Oh my God, you guys are really going to stop dancing at such a young age?” Antonio said. “But we’ve danced at Ailey for so long. And with the tour schedule we have?” He laughed. “It feels like we have danced into our 50s.” It also means moving to St. Louis, where, Antonio said, he never thought he’d live again. But Kirven talked him into it. “When I thought about transitioning into my next career,” Kirven said, “it wasn’t just about having whatever the next gig was — it was about developing the giant picture of what I want to do in the world of dance. It’s a good career move. It just so happens to be in St. Louis.”
