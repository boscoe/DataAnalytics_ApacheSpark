The Baryshnikov Arts Center announced Monday night that it had raised $1 million to establish a new Cage Cunningham Fellowship, and that the first recipient would be the Russian pianist Alexei Lubimov, who plans to use his award to commission new works.The fellowship is designed to support artists who continue John Cage and Merce Cunningham’s commitment to innovation. Mr. Lubimov — who in the 1960s gave the Soviet premieres of a number of daring Western works — will use his $50,000 award to commission new pieces from five composers. Three are Russian — Anton Batagov, Pavel Karmanov and Sergei Zagny — and two, Bryce Dessner and Julia Wolfe, are American. (Ms. Wolfe won a 2015 Pulitzer Prize for her oratorio “Anthracite Fields.”)Mikhail Baryshnikov, the artistic director of the center, said in a statement that Mr. Lubimov was “an ideal fit” for the first Cage Cunningham Fellowship, calling him “a champion of risk-taking and an advocate for freedom of expression and creativity.” Mr. Lubimov is known for playing an unusually broad repertoire, from Baroque music on early instruments to 20th century and contemporary works. In the 1960s, the center said, he gave the Soviet premieres of works by Cage, Charles Ives, Arnold Schönberg, Anton Webern and Karlheinz Stockhausen.A version of this article appears in print on 12/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Russian Pianist Named Cage Cunningham Fellow.
