After Hurricane Katrina, he took free performances of Creative Time’s production of “Waiting for Godot,” using Classical Theater of Harlem performers, to devastated neighborhoods in New Orleans in 2007. Lately he has devoted his time mainly to a publishing venture and to writing. (An excellent book of his essays recently appeared.)As the 2014 winner of the Hugo Boss Prize, he has a solo show opening on Friday at the Guggenheim Museum. “Nonprojections for New Lovers” involves video projectors beaming off into space, electrified shoes, windblown fabric and a series of new books by emerging erotica writers. Mr. Chan’s work is always surprising and as smart as art gets, which means, among other things, that it’s smart enough not to always give us the art we think we want.
