Two months after the deadly terrorist attack on the Paris office of Charlie Hebdo, a 2008 documentary about that satirical newspaper will be screened at New York’s IFC Center on Monday. Bob Mankoff, cartoon editor of The New Yorker, will introduce the film.The documentary, “Tough Being Loved by Jerks,” recounts a 2007 civil trial in France, when Philippe Val, then the editor of Charlie Hebdo, faced accusations of defamation and incitement of hatred after republishing a series of provocative cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Those cartoons originally appeared in a Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, in 2005, before being republished widely in other media outlets. In many countries, the images were met by outrage and boycotts, leading to deadly violence.The film, directed by Daniel Leconte, has rarely been seen in the United States. It features coverage of the trial as well as behind-the-scenes footage from the magazine and interviews with the four cartoonists who were killed in the January attack — Stéphane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut and Bernard Verlhac. They were among 12 people killed at Charlie Hebdo.A number of French theaters screened the film in January as a show of support for free speech and Charlie Hebdo. The IFC Center screening is being presented by Unifrance Films and Kino Lorber, which acquired the American rights to the film last month. A national release is planned, with over a dozen screenings at theaters across the country scheduled for March and April.A version of this article appears in print on 03/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Charlie Hebdo Film To Show in New York.
