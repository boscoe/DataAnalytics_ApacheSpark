Nearly four years after Simon Callow donned a wig and skirt at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the respected British actor will do so again to play Pauline, formerly Paul, in the New York premiere of “Tuesdays at Tesco’s,” translated and adapted by Matthew Hurt and Sarah Vermande from the French play “Le Mardi à Monoprix,” by Emmanuel Darley.The  solo show  (May 14-June 7), directed by Simon Stokes, is about a man who chooses to live his life as a woman despite many obstacles. The title refers to a weekly shopping trip Pauline regularly takes with her ailing father, who is accepting of the help but not the helper and cannot keep from commenting on Pauline’s razor stubble. It is one of more than a half dozen works in the annual Brits Off Broadway festival at 59E59 Theaters, which will run April 14 through June 28. The full lineup, to be announced Wednesday, also includes “My Perfect Mind” (June 10-28), by Kathryn Hunter, Paul Hunter (no relation) and  Edward Petherbridge. The show centers on Mr. Petherbridge’s experience when, during rehearsals for the title role in a 2007 production of “King Lear,” he suffered a stroke and was barely able to move, but still remembered the entire part. Directed by Ms. Hunter and featuring Mr. Petherbridge and Mr. Hunter, the piece looks at his recovery alongside aspects of the “Lear” story. Other festival highlights include an adaptation of Anthony Burgess’s 1961 novel “One Hand Clapping” (May 5-31), adapted and directed by Lucia Cox, and “The Tailor of Inverness” (April 14-May 3), written and performed by Matthew Zajac, about his father’s hidden past during World War II.
