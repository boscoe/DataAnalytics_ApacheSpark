Shocker: actors consuming food. Or are they? In the premiere of “Dinner at Tiffani’s,” Wednesday night on the Cooking Channel, the running gag is whether the show’s host, Tiffani Thiessen, late of “White Collar,” and her friends Nathan Fillion, Willie Garson and Lindsay Price actually ate the morsels they were shown scarfing down on their hit shows, or even from the catering table off screen. On “Sex and the City,” Mr. Garson reports, cast members had carte blanche at any New York restaurant, with food guaranteed in their trailers in 20 minutes. In “Beverly Hills 90210,” Ms. Price says, no one dared eat. (Bikini bodies, duh.) On the screen in “Castle,” Mr. Fillion prefers to wave his fork around and mime chewing. Whether Ms. Thiessen’s guests applied their sleight of hand to her roasted chicken, brussels sprouts with pancetta and fresh figs drizzled in lavender honey is anyone’s guess. But food isn’t really the point when you’re promising a walk down memory lane with Jason Priestley, Lance Bass, Elizabeth Berkley and Jonathan Silverman.A version of this article appears in print on February 22, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Are You Going to Eat That?.
