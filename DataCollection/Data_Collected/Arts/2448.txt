Bobby Shmurda, the spark-plug Brooklyn rapper, has posted $2 million bail after spending more than six weeks in jail on gun and drug charges related to allegations of a gang conspiracy, his lawyer said on Friday.The city will now have up to 72 hours to review the bail package, which was arranged with the help of Ira Judelson, a bail bondsman known for his high-profile clients, including the rappers Ja Rule and DMX.“If the city is playing fair, there will be no need for a hearing,” Kenneth Montgomery, Mr. Shmurda’s lawyer, said.“Management associates” of Mr. Shmurda’s provided collateral to Mr. Judelson in the form of property, Mr. Montgomery said. Epic Records, which signed Mr. Shmurda on the success of his hit, “Hot Boy,” and released his debut EP in November, was not involved, Mr. Montgomery said. The label did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Shmurda (whose given name is Ackquille Pollard), 20, was arrested on Dec. 17 along with a dozen other people accused of being members of a gang in East Flatbush that calls itself GS9. “There is no question that Ackquille Pollard is the driving force behind the GS9 gang and the organizing figure within this conspiracy,” said Nigel Farina, a prosecutor, at his initial arraignment.In State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Thursday, Mr. Shmurda was arraigned again on a superseding indictment that included 32 additional counts against the group, bringing the total number of counts to 101 from 69.Mr. Montgomery, arguing unsuccessfully for lower bail, said the city prosecutors had no proof of “any hierarchy,” or that Mr. Shmurda was GS9’s “enforcer.”Mr. Shmurda is currently being held at the Manhattan Detention Complex, known as the Tombs, but could be released as soon as Monday, Mr. Montgomery said.
