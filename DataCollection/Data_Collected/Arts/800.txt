The Whitney Museum of American Art’s first biennial exhibition in its new home — which goes on view in Spring 2017 — will be organized by Christopher Y. Lew, an associate curator at the museum, and Mia Locks, until recently an assistant curator at MoMA P.S.1, the Whitney announced Wednesday.“Chris and Mia are relatively young curators to be taking this forward for the Whitney,” said Scott Rothkopf, the Whitney’s deputy director for programs and chief curator. “We decided to let the spirit of it be very fresh. Even though we’re grown up as an institution, we want to keep a sense of risk and adventure about this biennial process.”At the Whitney, Mr. Lew organized the first United States solo exhibitions for Rachel Rose and Jared Madere, and, with fellow curator Jay Sanders, the first American theatrical presentation by the Berlin-based New Theater.At MoMA P.S.1, Ms. Locks organized exhibitions including “Math Bass: Off the Clock” (2015); “IM Heung-soon: Reincarnation” (2015); “Samara Golden: The Flat Side of the Knife” (2014); and “The Little Things Could Be Dearer” (2014). She was also part of the curatorial team for the current Greater New York exhibition.Mr. Rothkopf will also work with a team of advisers to help shape the exhibition, including Negar Azimi, a writer and senior editor at Bidoun, which focuses on the Middle East; Gean Moreno, the artistic director of Cannonball, a Miami–based nonprofit; Aily Nash, a curator of Projections, the New York Film Festival’s artists’ film and video section; and Wendy Yao, a publisher and founder of the exhibition space 356 South Mission Road in Los Angeles.The museum announced earlier this year that the next biennial would take place in 2017 rather than 2016, to allow for curators to adjust to the new building. The Whitney’s series of annual — and, since 1973, biennial — exhibitions was inaugurated in 1932 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.A version of this article appears in print on 11/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Whitney Names Curators for 2017 Biennial.
