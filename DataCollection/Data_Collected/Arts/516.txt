“We are not amused,” Queen Victoria is reputed to have said after an equerry ventured some salacious gossip during a dinner at Windsor Castle. But when it came to a gushing biography of her early years, she was even more caustic.“Not even one word of truth,” Victoria wrote in the margins of a copy of Agnes Strickland’s 1840 biography, “Queen Victoria From Her Birth to Her Bridal,” that is to be sold by Sotheby’s in London in November. The queen, who had commissioned the book from Strickland, a popular historian and biographer, filled more than 100 pages with similarly blunt notes and factual corrections before sending it back to the author.In the annotated copy, which is expected to fetch $15,000 to $23,000, Victoria, then 21, took issue with everything from a description of Princess Sophia Matilda as “beautiful as an angel, and graceful as a nymph” (“absurd,” Victoria declared) to a description of one of her hairstyles (“plaits,” she noted, not a Grecian knot). As for the “tinge of melancholy” in her smile on her wedding day, the queen wrote simply: “No.”Strickland was so distressed by the response that she and her publisher reportedly halted sales and pulped as many copies as they could find, making the book extremely rare today. Not that it was permanently banned in the royal household: In 1932, according to Sotheby’s, George V contacted Strickland’s descendants with a request to read the book that infuriated his grandmother.The annotated book, which was first sold at auction by Strickland’s descendants in 2011, is part of a collection of more than 140 inscribed first editions assemble by an unidentified British bibliophile. The November sale, which was reported by The Guardian, will also include a copy of Winston Churchill’s “The World Crisis” inscribed to Neville Chamberlain; and a copy of Ian Fleming’s “You Only Live Twice,” inscribed to Richard Hughes, the inspiration for the character Dikko Henderson; and a copy of Robert Graves’s “Fairies and Fusiliers” inscribed to Owen M. Roberts, the lieutenant credited with saving his life at the battle of the Somme.
