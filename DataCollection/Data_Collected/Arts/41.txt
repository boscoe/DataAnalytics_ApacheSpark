Jazz at Lincoln Center helps him celebrate the occasion with this one-nighter, featuring some of his longtime associates: the trumpeter Randy Brecker, the guitarist Howard Alden, the pianist Frank Kimbrough, the bassist Jay Leonhart and the drummer Lewis Nash. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Nate Chinen)★ Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah  (Friday and Saturday) “Stretch Music” is the new album by this firebrand trumpeter from New Orleans, who now resides in Harlem. It’s also a set of aesthetic principles — at heart, involving the elasticity of genres, including the one most of us know as jazz — and a rallying cry for Mr. Adjuah’s fierce young band, which includes Elena Pinderhughes on flute and vocals, Warren Wolf on vibraphone and Braxton Cook on saxophones. At 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, 212-281-9240, harlemstage.org. (Chinen)★ Karrin Allyson  (Tuesday through Oct. 10) The title of “Many a New Day: Karrin Allyson Sings Rodgers & Hammerstein” tells you the first thing you need to know about Ms. Allyson’s new album, her first nonholiday release in four years. But you should also know that her sterling accompanists, the bassist John Patitucci and the pianist Kenny Barron, are a useful gold standard for her partners next week, who include Miro Sprague on piano and Ed Howard on bass. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementTheo Bleckmann + Band  (Saturday) A vocalist of inventive instinct and chameleonic effect, Mr. Bleckmann is generally at his best as a member of an ensemble. This one comes packed with regular collaborators: the guitarist Ben Monder, the pianist Shai Maestro, the bassist Chris Tordini and the drummer John Hollenbeck. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor; 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Ravi Coltrane Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) A tenor and soprano saxophonist with a dry tone and a sleek but undemonstrative style, Ravi Coltrane leads a quartet with several sharp-minded partners: the young Cuban pianist David Virelles, the bassist Dezron Douglas and the drummer Johnathan Blake. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Stanley Cowell Quartet  (Friday through Sunday) A pianist of deep authority and resolute purpose — less widely heard now than he was in the 1970s but still a force — Mr. Cowell recently made a much-talked-about club appearance in New York, on the heels of a new solo album, “Juneteenth.” He appears with his quartet, featuring the alto saxophonist Bruce Williams, the bassist Jay Anderson and the drummer Victor Lewis. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com.

At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)John Escreet Quartet  (Friday) Mr. Escreet is an English pianist who has made New York his home base, working in an ambitious range of settings and styles. For this one-nighter he plays the music of John Taylor — an important English pianist from a previous generation, who died this summer at 72 — with the alto saxophonist Dave Binney, the bassist Matt Penman and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor; 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Amina Figarova Sextet  (Tuesday and Wednesday) The pianist Amina Figarova — born in Azerbaijan and now a New Yorker after spending years in the Netherlands — celebrates the release of her new album, “Blue Whisper,” with a working ensemble that features her husband, Bart Platteau, on flute, along with the saxophonist Marc Mommaas and others. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Tom Harrell  (Tuesday through Oct. 18, except Oct. 12) Mr. Harrell, a trumpeter and fluegelhorn player of prominence since the 1970s, has also been a beacon of small-group bandleading in recent years, working with a regular stable of sidemen. A few of them — the saxophonist Wayne Escoffery, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the pianist Danny Grissett — join him for both of his coming weeks at the Village Vanguard, starting with a celebration of his thoughtful new chamber-jazz album, “First Impressions.” At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Gilad Hekselman Trio  (Friday) The guitarist Gilad Hekselman has a vision of modern jazz that’s harmonically fluent but not averse to simple melody or gentle, approachable effect. His fine working trio, with Joe Martin on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums, draws from a rewarding new album, “Homes.” At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementGuillermo Klein Sextet  (Wednesday) The intensely thoughtful pianist and composer Guillermo Klein — originally from Buenos Aires, long stationed in Barcelona and now based in the greater New York area — always brings new information to the bandstand. He performs an 8 p.m. set with a band that includes Chris Cheek on tenor saxophone and Syberen van Munster on guitar; a subsequent set, at 9:30 p.m., will feature Mr. van Munster’s group Plunge. At Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At 2 p.m., St. Peter’s Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, Manhattan, 212-935-2200, saintpeters.org. (Chinen)★ Cécile McLorin Salvant  (Wednesday) Ms. Salvant, 26, is the most widely and fervently acclaimed jazz singer of her generation, and on her new album, “For One to Love,” she deepens her game, delving into original songs. This one-nighter uptown won’t include the pianist Adam Diehl, her astute musical director and partner, but it will feature the august bassist Rufus Reid, along with Adam Birnbaum on piano and Joe Farnsworth on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Ginny’s Supper Club, 310 Lenox Avenue, Harlem, 212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com. (Chinen)Thomas Morgan Trio  (Thursday) Thomas Morgan, a bassist of sharp intuition and faintly enigmatic calm, reconvenes a trio he introduced in Brooklyn last year; it features Pete Rende on analog synthesizers and Dan Weiss on drums, and doesn’t conform to any easy summary. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Adam Nussbaum Leadbelly Project  (Tuesday) Mr. Nussbaum, a drummer of experience and insight, digs into a rough-hewed blues vein with his Leadbelly Project, featuring two guitarists — Steve Cardenas and Nate Radley — and the saxophonist Ohad Talmor. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Nicholas Payton Trio (Through Friday) A post-bop trumpeter who has lately pivoted toward the keyboard, Mr. Payton spends much of his new double album, “Letters” (Paytone), on acoustic and Fender Rhodes piano or Hammond B-3 organ. He revisits the album’s themes here, with a trio featuring Peter Washington on bass and Carl Allen on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ Noah Preminger Group  (Wednesday) On his often ecstatic new album, “Pivot: Live at the 55 Bar,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger leads his new band in a pair of incantatory half-hour extemporizations on classic blues by Bukka White. Returning to the scene of the album, with the same personnel — Jason Palmer on trumpet, Kim Cass on bass, Ian Froman on drums — Mr. Preminger will presumably pursue a similar agenda. At 10 and 11:30 p.m., 55 Christopher Street, 212-929-9883, 55bar.com. (Chinen)Rob Reddy: ‘Bechet: Our Contemporary’  (Saturday) The soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet was one of jazz’s first heroes, and he’s both a lodestar and a springboard for Rob Reddy on a pointedly titled new release, “Bechet — Our Contemporary.” As on the album, Mr. Reddy mixes in originals with Bechet classics, alongside open-minded improvisers like the trumpeter John Carlson, the guitarist Marvin Sewell and the drummer Pheeroan akLaff. At 9 p.m., BAMcafé, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Chinen)★ Antonio Sánchez and Migration  (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Sánchez is the drummer-composer best known, in recent months, for his percussive score to the movie “Birdman.” He draws here from another recent accomplishment: “The Meridian Suite,” a rangy, ambitious album featuring the electroacoustic band he calls Migration. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementJoe Temperley Quintet Featuring Wycliffe Gordon  (Saturday and Sunday) Mr. Temperley, a gallant Scottish baritone saxophonist, has been a stalwart of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and the Duke Ellington Orchestra before that. He leads a nimble small group with Mr. Gordon on trombone, Adam Birnbaum on piano, Yasushi Nakamura on bass and Billy Drummond on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Tenor Madness: The George Coleman Quintet with Eric Alexander  (Through Sunday) A tenor saxophonist of voluble expertise, recently honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, George Coleman works side by side with one of his tenor disciples, Eric Alexander, and a rhythm section that includes the pianist Harold Mabern. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Turtle Island Quartet with Cyrus Chestnut  (Thursday) This string quartet with a breadth of style and some 30 years of history, teams up again with Mr. Chestnut, a soulful jazz pianist. The name of their program, “Jelly, Rags and Monk,” promises a likely repertory of Jelly Roll Morton, Scott Joplin and Thelonious Monk. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org.
