The New York Philharmonic, the nation’s oldest symphony orchestra and the former home of Leonard Bernstein and Gustav Mahler, is preparing for its greatest upheaval in decades.It must raise hundreds of millions of dollars to renovate its aging and maligned Lincoln Center home, and shore up perennially shaky finances. It has to figure out how to survive two seasons without its hall during construction — the orchestral equivalent of couch surfing. And it must find a music director to succeed Alan Gilbert, who steps down in two years, to lead it during these transformative years.Each item on its agenda would pose significant challenges on its own. But the orchestra must do them all nearly simultaneously, adding layers of counterpoint-like complexity to the tasks at hand. Donors may want to know who will be conducting the orchestra before making large contributions. Conductors may want assurances that the money for the renovation will be there before they sign on to lead an orchestra in flux. And the longer it takes to name a successor to Mr. Gilbert, the less input the new music director will have in the design of the hall.If all goes according to plan, in six and a half years the Philharmonic will find itself playing its first concerts in a substantially revamped hall under the baton of a new music director. The Philharmonic’s president, Matthew VanBesien, said that he viewed the confluence of tasks as an opportunity. “They may not be interdependent, but they’re certainly interrelated — and they can’t be worked in isolation from one another,” he said.AdvertisementAs it grapples with its transformation, the Philharmonic is facing many of the same financial stresses and changing audience behavior that have challenged other American performing arts organizations — from the venerable Philadelphia Orchestra, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2011, to the Metropolitan Opera, which is cutting costs after running a $22 million deficit last year. The Philharmonic has had deficits every year for more than a decade; its shortfall dropped to $2.1 million last year from $6.1 million the year before partly because it spent more of its endowment. And, like other institutions, it must learn to adapt as younger generations shun the multiconcert subscriptions that were long the bedrock of sales.AdvertisementTiming is crucial when it comes to finding someone to succeed Mr. Gilbert, who will leave in 2017 after eight seasons as music director. The job is now in the hands of a search committee — made up of four board members, two members of the administration and five musicians — that has met to consider how to weigh candidates.“I wouldn’t call it a sense of urgency, but we certainly know that we need to work efficiently and in as expedited a way as we can,” Mr. VanBesien said.The committee members are doing so amid a flurry of speculation. There was gossip almost immediately when, within days of the announcement that Mr. Gilbert would step down, Mr. VanBesien dined in London with Esa-Pekka Salonen, the former music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, who is coming to the New York Philharmonic next season to begin a stint as composer in residence.
            The New York Philharmonic has run deficits every year for a decade.

While the Philharmonic has been mum on candidates, critics, fans and music-world figures have not been shy about floating the names of possibilities — including Marin Alsop, the music director of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; David Robertson, the music director of the St. Louis Symphony; Jaap van Zweden, the music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra; and, on some days, seemingly anyone who has ever given a downbeat.Mr. VanBesien said that the search committee had been considering what it should look for in a music director.“It has to start, first and foremost, with superb and inspiring musicianship — that’s the bedrock,” he said. “Certainly we want someone who will really engage in not only the renovation of the concert hall but also the period out of the concert hall, and how that period can work to continue our relationship with our existing audiences but also, hopefully, reach out to more New Yorkers. Certainly a compelling and progressive vision for a 21st-century orchestra is something that’s a priority.”AdvertisementSince Mr. Gilbert’s departure was announced, two of the world’s best-known conductors have made it clear that they were uninterested: Gustavo Dudamel extended his contract with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and Simon Rattle said he would become music director of the London Symphony Orchestra after leaving the Berlin Philharmonic.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

New York has been the rejected suitor more than once during past searches, when the ones who got away have included Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti.These days the orchestra must grapple with the steady erosion of the subscription system faced by many ensembles: Only 41 percent of its concertgoers were subscribers last season, down from 53 percent a decade earlier. That means the orchestra must spend more on marketing to sell tickets to one concert at a time.The Philharmonic’s deficit would have been higher last year if the board had not decided to draw 6.75 percent of its endowment, up from the more prudent 5 percent the year before. It plans to reduce the rate of endowment spending by a quarter of a percentage point a year, as it raises money to bolster an endowment, valued at a relatively modest $200 million last season.The announcement that Mr. Gilbert would step down in 2017, with no next job lined up, spurred speculation of the did-he-jump-or-was-he-pushed variety.Mr. Gilbert said he did not want to commit to staying with the Philharmonic through the entire hall renovation project, which is not scheduled to be finished until 2021 at the earliest, and did not want to leave the orchestra leaderless midway through it. But some players in the orchestra have expressed dissatisfaction with him, which is not unheard-of in the history of the Philharmonic. Other players have applauded him, and his efforts to modernize the orchestra’s repertoire and vision, which he recently described in a lecture to the Royal Philharmonic Society in London.Both Mr. Gilbert and Mr. VanBesien said that they had discussed the possibility of a short-term contract extension for Mr. Gilbert but that Mr. Gilbert had decided against it, arguing that the Philharmonic needed time to introduce its next music director to its audiences before leaving Lincoln Center to perform elsewhere in New York during two seasons of renovations.The music directorship is only the most visible change afoot at the orchestra. Modern American orchestras are made up of competing power centers — their boards, administrations, players and music directors — and at the Philharmonic all are in various stages of flux.The board has a new chairman this year: Oscar S. Schafer, a well-liked investor who is known for his love of music and for sponsoring the orchestra’s free parks concerts in recent years with his wife, Didi. The orchestra’s administration has been remade as well: Mr. VanBesien has been in his position since 2012, and this year the orchestra hired Lisa Mantone to oversee the fund-raising project, and overhauled its organizational structure.AdvertisementThere are changes in the ranks of musicians as well. A spate of retirements and departures left it with the most turnover of principal players, or section leaders, in decades. The orchestra, which has an official complement of 106 musicians, has nine vacancies, including principal second violin, principal trumpet and English horn.Removing one headache, orchestra officials recently said they had settled on a new concertmaster, Frank Huang from the Houston Symphony, who was expected to start next season.If the orchestra’s timeline is a challenge, it also reflects a welcome change: After more than a decade of false starts and internecine battles, it looks like the renovation of its home at Avery Fisher Hall is finally moving ahead. It took a significant step forward this year with the announcement that the entertainment mogul David Geffen would donate $100 million toward the renovation, now scheduled to start in 2019. In exchange, the hall will be renamed for him.Mr. VanBesien said that Mr. Geffen’s contribution would also help the orchestra in its music director search. “It shows intent and focus in a way that hasn’t existed before,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on April 23, 2015, on Page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Philharmonic’s Challenges Go Beyond the Music.
