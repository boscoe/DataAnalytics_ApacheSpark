One of the better television series that you probably haven’t made time for is WGN’s “Manhattan,” a show about the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bombs dropped on Japan to end World War II. It returns for its second season on Tuesday, Oct. 13, at 9 p.m., the bomb still a ways from completion but the intrigues and moral dilemmas thick in the air.The series focuses on the scientists cloistered at Los Alamos, N.M., and their families, a perfect laboratory for human drama. There is marital strife, there is spying, there are characters who aren’t what they seem. It’s as well acted and intriguingly plotted as any of TV’s period dramas, and in Season 2 it adds even more talent to the cast: Mamie Gummer turns up playing a member of the Women’s Army Corps, and Griffin Dunne appears as a newspaper reporter who somehow worms his way into Los Alamos.Hanging over all of the little dramas has been the Big Question, which came more sharply into focus as Season 1 progressed: the ethical implications for these characters of working on a project that could let a planet-jeopardizing genie out of its bottle.A version of this article appears in print on October 11, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Television; Before the Bombs Were Dropped.
