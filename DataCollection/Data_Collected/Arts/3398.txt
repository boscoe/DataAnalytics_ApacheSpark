The Pop Group emerged in the post-punk scrum of late-1970s England, where abrasive sounds and political outrage forged an enduring alliance. The Pop Group was pioneering and extreme; Nick Cave has called it “unholy, manic, violent, paranoid, painful music.” Its songs crunched together tight funk, deranged noise, exotic instruments, free-jazz improvisations, electronic manipulations and sonic anarchy, while Mark Stewart yowled, screamed, barked, ranted and occasionally sang about the depredations of money and power. The band lasted from 1977 to ’80 and released only two albums, though Mr. Stewart went on lead his own punk-funk band, Mark Stewart and the Maffia, in the 1980s.Most of the original Pop Group reunited in 2010 and started to play sporadic gigs, but it has taken the band until this year to release a new album, “Citizen Zombie” — produced by, of all people, the Adele collaborator Paul Epworth. The songs are more melodic than the younger Pop Group at its most radical, but they still bristle and snarl, and they still have plenty of targets.
