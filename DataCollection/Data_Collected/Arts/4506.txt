After taking flight very briefly, “Duck Commander Musical,” the Las Vegas musical about the Robertson family of “Duck Dynasty” fame, will close its doors on May 17. The musical, based off the book “Duck Commander Family” by Willie and Korie Robertson, drew much attention and controversy after being announced last November. The show was a gamble considering its unusual source material, the uneven track record of musicals in Las Vegas, and inflammatory comments made by the family’s patriarch, Phil Robertson, on homosexuality. The show opened at the Rio hotel and casino on April 8 and featured footage of the Robertsons as well as original country and blues songs.  However, the show will close a little more than a month after its opening. The producers will “now consider several possibilities for the next stage of life in the show,” according to a statement from Dodger Theatricals. “Like most new musicals out of town, what we learned will be invaluable as the producers evaluate the many possibilities for our next incarnation,” said director Jeff Calhoun in an email.
