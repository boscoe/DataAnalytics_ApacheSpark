Queen Victoria was one of the most notable graphomaniacs of the 19th century, penning an estimated 60 million words of diaries and letters over her lifetime.But scholars and amateur Victoriaphiles alike will soon have a less daunting keyhole into the royal mind to peep through: a whimsical children’s story, written by the future monarch when she was still a child herself. “The Adventures of Alice Laselles, by Alexandrina Victoria, Aged 10 and ¾” will be published in June by the Royal Collection Trust, which oversees roughly a million objects held in some 13 current and former British royal residences. The manuscript — the earliest of Victoria’s works to be published, according to a release  — was written in a red composition notebook bearing the somewhat awkward dedication “To my dear Mamma, this my first attempt at composition is affectionately and dutifully inscribed by her affectionate daughter, Victoria.”The story echoes standard melodramatic children’s plots of the era. After her father remarries,  the 12-year-old Alice is reluctantly shipped off to Mrs. Dunscombe’s school for girls, where she falls in with characters including the clever daughter of a London banker, a motherless girl whose father has gone off to India and a “poor little French orphan” who has lost an eye to smallpox. Things reach a climax when Alice is wrongly accused of smuggling a cat onto the premises, but she ultimately emerges triumphant as “one of the best learners in the school.”Victoria herself had a lonely childhood at Kensington Palace, mixing with few other children. Her education was supervised by her German governess, Louise Lehzen, with whom she made a set of hand-colored paper dolls used to illustrate the book.  “The fact that this is a children’s story written by a real princess as a child makes it absolute gold,” Jacky Collis Harvey, the publisher of the Royal Collection Trust, said in an interview. “Together with the paper dolls, it really brings all aspects of her imaginative life together.”A version of this article appears in print on 04/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Childrenu2019s Story by Queen Victoria.
