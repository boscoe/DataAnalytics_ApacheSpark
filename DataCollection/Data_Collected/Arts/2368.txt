Season 2, Episode 14: “Kali Yuga”Maybe I haven’t been paying close enough attention, but did the rift between Ichabod Crane (Tom Mison) and Abbie Mills (Nicole Beharie) that dominated Monday’s episode of “Sleepy Hollow” kind of come out of nowhere? Sure, they’ve had disagreements, but suddenly they’re talking about and analyzing their problems as if they’re in couples counseling, and Abbie’s sister Jenny (Lyndie Greenwood) is harping on them too. It felt artificial.In any case, we learned two things in the first 15 minutes: Ichabod is not destined for the karaoke hall of fame, and Jenny is not a woman to be stonewalled. The opening scene in a karaoke bar was pretty amusing. It was cut short, though, by that killjoy Nick Hawley (Matt Barr), who got everyone embroiled in a supernatural mess involving his godmother and a vault built by Henry Knox, the 18th-century military officer. It was a remarkably sophisticated vault for the preindustrial era, with secret defenses and walls that moved and so on. This in an age without indoor plumbing.Jenny got to show her toughness by smashing a guy’s head into a display case to get some information out of him. And eventually all of us who dislike Hawley got to enjoy the sight of him being tortured, which was pretty satisfying,Meanwhile, Frank Irving (Orlando Jones) was exonerated in court, but his ex-wife (Jill Marie Jones) was a bit hesitant to welcome him back into her life. What, a guy can’t die and be resurrected without women looking at him crossways?The episode wasn’t the most involving of the season, but it gets an A for makeup – that godmother of Hawley’s was pretty creepy – and an A-plus for the return, near the end, to the karaoke bar, where Ichabod and Abbie did an Ike and Tina Turner imitation. “Proud Mary” has never sounded worse. If we can come up with nine more songs, we’ll have enough for an Abbie/Ichabod “Duets” album.
