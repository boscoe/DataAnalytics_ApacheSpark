A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events.★ American Ballet Theater(through Nov. 1) Ballet Theater’s fall season began with “After You,” a premiere from Mark Morris (returning Friday, Saturday matinee, Tuesday and Thursday), Twyla Tharp’s “The Brahms-Haydn Variations” (receiving an encore Saturday evening) and Frederick Ashton’s haunting masterpiece “Monotones I and II” (Sunday and Tuesday). Later in the week, a pair of war dances reflect different sides of conflict: Kurt Jooss’s 1932 “The Green Table” satires the decision makers; Paul Taylor’s “Company B,” set to songs by the Andrews Sisters, dramatizes the impact on soldiers and civilians. Additional works by Fokine, Balanchine, Ratmansky and the company dancer Marcelo Gomes round out the mixed-bill programs. Fridays and Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-496-0600, abt.org. (Brian Schaefer)★ Ballet Memphis (Tuesday through Nov. 1) Ballet Memphis makes a concerted effort to ensure that the dance it presents is reflective of its hometown. Initiatives like the River Project and the Memphis Project have stocked the company’s repertory with work inspired by the city (the “river” being the Mississippi, which flows right by). Six original works, many hailing from those initiatives, come to New York in the company’s first visit since 2007. Choreographers include Matthew Neenan, Gabrielle Lamb, Julia Adam and several company members. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday through Oct. 31 at 8 p.m., with matinees at 2 p.m. on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Schaefer)BalletNext (through Nov. 7) Michele Wiles, a former dancer with American Ballet Theater and the founder of this adventurous company, continues to challenge ballet in new ways. Last year, she collaborated with Jay Donn, a flex dancer, to find harmony in their disparate styles. They’re back with the premiere of “Don’t Blink,” which builds on that dialogue. Also in Program A, running through Saturday, is Ms. Wiles’s “Ushuaia” and Brian Reeder’s “Strange Flowers.” For Program B, Tuesday through Nov. 7, Ms. Wiles turns to jazz, recruiting the Grammy-winning trumpeter Tom Harrell and his ensemble for “Apogee in 3.” Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m., Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org. (Schaefer)Monica Bill Barnes(Wednesdays through Dec. 16) Karaoke night meets office party in “Happy Hour,” the latest concoction from Ms. Barnes and Anna Bass, best known these days as the dancers — alongside the radio personality Ira Glass — in the touring revue “Three Acts, Two Dancers, One Radio Host.” Their new weekly gig, in a Lower Manhattan dance studio, features the cheeky duo playing two guys playing their everyday selves, as Ms. Barnes continues her love affair with awkwardness, failure and physical comedy. The audience gets drinks, prizes and the chance to sing. At 6:30 p.m., Studio G, Gibney Dance: Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center, 280 Broadway, near Chambers Street, 646-837-6809, monicabillbarnes.com. (Siobhan Burke)Company SBB(through Saturday) The choreographer Stefanie Batten Bland joins forces with the jazz ensemble Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber to honor her father, Ed Bland, a contemporary jazz composer and filmmaker. Their collaboration, “Patient(ce) — a Physical Requiem,” features eight dancers from her Company SBB and a visual installation by Ms. Bland and her lighting designer, Alaric Hahn. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, 212-281-9240, harlemstage.org. (Burke)★ Company XIV(through Nov. 15) This flirtatious company, which combines ballet and contemporary dance with elements of baroque and burlesque, specializes in sexy, spicy, opulent interpretations of fairy-tale classics. This fall, the director and choreographer Austin McCormick introduces his take on “Cinderella,” which comes with a dash of opera and vaudeville. Because of titillating costumes and scenarios, and free-flowing libations, performances are for adults only. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 5 p.m., Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, 800-745-3000, companyxiv.com. (Schaefer)Coyote Dancers(Friday through Sunday) Dudley Williams died in June at the age of 76 after a career that included the Martha Graham Dance Company and decades as a beloved dancer with the Alvin Ailey Dance Company, performing as recently as 2013. In his honor, Coyote Dancers, a troupe started by Maher Benham to preserve the spirit of American modern dance, will premiere “A Song for Dudley.” Also on the program is “Eight for Martha,” a recent tribute to Graham, and additional repertory with guest performers. At 8 p.m., Martha Graham Studio Theater, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, managearts.com/coyote. (Schaefer)★ Jon Kinzel (through Oct. 31) Mr. Kinzel, a maker of gently convoluted dances, unveils a curiously titled new work for an intergenerational cast, “Cowhand Con Man.” A meditation on “physical endurance and psychic restlessness,” according to a news release, the piece draws on his almost 30-year history as a choreographer and improviser. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7:30 p.m., Gibney Dance: Agnes Varis Performing Arts Center, 280 Broadway, near Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org. (Burke)★ José Limón Dance Company(through Sunday) José Limón is a pillar of American modern dance, though perhaps the most unassuming of them. The work of the Mexican-born choreographer is celebrated for its proud nobility, palpable spirituality and high drama. Marking its 70th anniversary, the company that bears his name presents 15 works spanning three decades, from 1942 until Limón’s death in 1972. The works will be performed by companies and academies from around the United States, as well as South America, Europe and Asia. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Schaefer)Mina Nishimura(Thursday through Oct. 31) While reading “Sickened Primadonna,” a biographical novel by Tatsumi Hijikata, the founder of the Japanese performance art butoh, the Tokyo-born artist Mina Nishimura drew hundreds of pictures, including a character she called Princess Cabbage. That character in turn begat a work of the same name in which Ms. Nishimura undergoes what Siobhan Burke described in The New York Times as a “chilling” metamorphosis. “Princess Cabbage” is paired with “Celery of Everything,” a quartet that, according to the venue’s website, attempts to connect “internal landscapes and external forms.” At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Schaefer)★ Okwui Okpokwasili (through Saturday) Ms. Okpokwasili revives “Bronx Gothic,” an arresting solo about coming-of-age in the Bronx, haunted by the voices of her past (and present). Notes are passed and dreams recounted between the artist’s teenage self and her confidante; other messages are held in shuddering dances. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org. (Burke)Lionel Popkin(Thursday through Nov. 1) In Lionel Popkin’s “Ruth Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,” the titular Ruth refers to Ruth St. Denis, a doyenne of early modern dance (Martha Graham was a pupil). St. Denis was known for her “oriental” dances, which Mr. Popkin wrestles with. Valid artistic influence or cultural appropriation? The Los Angeles-based Mr. Popkin, who is half-Jewish and half-Indian, turns the question on his own work with help from three dancers, two musicians and a leaf blower. Thursday through Oct. 31 at 7:30 p.m., Nov. 1 at 3 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, abronsartscenter.org. (Schaefer)★ Silas Riener(Friday, Saturday, Monday and Tuesday) The solo is a special strand of dance DNA, and Silas Riener, a celebrated former member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, knows how to command a big space. His new solo performance, though, takes pace in more intimate environs, offering a welcome opportunity to observe his calm intensity and physical precision up close. The show, called “Blue Name,” is a compilation of short works made over the course of a year and a half. At 8 p.m., Chocolate Factory Theater, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, 718-482-7069, chocolatefactorytheater.org. (Schaefer)★ Sankai Juku(Wednesday through Oct. 31) Nearly a decade since its last visit to New York, the venerable butoh collective Sankai Juku returns with “Umusuna: Memories Before History.” The 2012 work meditates on the geography of birth, both as a specific place and as a broader concept that includes earth and its elements (represented by rich colors). Bald and powdered white, crawling across the stage or floating in skirts, the performers evoke newborns and ghosts. Sand, cascading throughout, renders the stage a giant hourglass. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Schaefer)Chris Schlichting (through Saturday) Visiting from Minnesota, Mr. Schlichting offers the New York premiere of “Stripe Tease.” Created with the guitarist Jeremy Ylvisaker, his band Alpha Consumer and the visual artist Jennifer Davis, the work experiments with scale, teasing out tensions between the spectacular and the delicate. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Burke)60x60 Dance (Friday) In 2000, Robert Voisey started Vox Novus to promote contemporary music. In 2003, he created 60x60, an event in which 60 composers get 60 seconds to make a musical statement, and dance was added in 2007. With a clock ticking in the background to mark time, 60 dance artists have one minute each to make magic with a snippet of original contemporary music. At 12:30 and 8 p.m., Brookfield Place Winter Garden, 230 Vesey Street, at West Street, Lower Manhattan, 212-417-2414, artsbrookfield.com/60x60; free. (Schaefer)★ Spectrum Dance Theater(Wednesday through next Friday) In 1991 Donald Byrd created “The Minstrel Show” to critique the convention of blackface and to give historical context to the racially motivated murder of 16-year-old Yusef Hawkins. In the more than two decades since, Mr. Byrd has updated the work to reflect on contemporary race relations and recent killings, like those of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown. In “The Minstrel Show Revisited,” Mr. Byrd’s Seattle dance troupe presents a provocative fusion of entertainment and social indictment. Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., next Friday at 8 p.m., Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, 866-811-4111, nyuskirball.org. (Schaefer)Colleen Thomas(Friday through Sunday) The confluence of recent national conversations on police shootings and sexual assault on university campuses made Ms. Thomas think a lot about social inequality and what her obligation as an artist is in addressing it. Those considerations inform “Her(e) Repetitive Blueprint,” in which her dancers become a canvas for exploring race and gender. Though she has been linking dance with a sense of humanity for years, this performance marks her first evening-length work. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500, 92y.org. (Schaefer)‘Where Sculpture and Dance Meet: Minimalism from 1961 to 1979’(through Oct. 31) This exhibition at Loretta Howard Gallery examines the interchange of ideas among choreographers and sculptors in the 1960s and ′70s. Sculptures by Ronald Bladen, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Andy Warhol and Sol LeWitt share the space with videos of performances by Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Merce Cunningham, Simone Forti and Yvonne Rainer. Tuesdays through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., 525-531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-695-0164, lorettahoward.com. (Burke)Zullo/RawMovement(Wednesday through Nov. 1) In the collection of essays “Space & Psyche,” contributors consider the psychological impact of architecture. That book, and that idea, inspired “The Architecture of Proximity,” a new work by John J. Zullo for his company. Drawing from elements of post-modern dance and vogueing, Mr. Zullo explores the relationship of bodies to space – a shared feature of dance and architecture – in particular the space between dancer and audience. Wednesday through Oct. 31 at 8 p.m., Nov. 1 at 3 p.m., 14th Street Y LABA Theater, 344 East 14th Street, East Village, 646-395-4322, 14streety.org. (Schaefer)Advertisement
