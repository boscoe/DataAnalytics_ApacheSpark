LONDON — Balletomane alert: The casting for the Royal Ballet’s much-anticipated visit to Lincoln Center in June has been announced. The Joyce Theater, which is presenting the Royal Ballet season, will honor the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon at the opening-night gala at the David H. Koch Theater, featuring Frederick Ashton’s “The Dream” starring the principals Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae. Mr. Wheeldon trained at the Royal Ballet School and danced with the company before establishing his choreographic career at the New York City Ballet. (He has most recently directed and choreographed “An American in Paris” on Broadway, and will create a new work for the Royal Ballet in February.)The Russian ballerina Natalia Osipova, who joined the Royal Ballet in 2013 (she will also appear with American Ballet Theater during its coming Metropolitan Opera House season) will appear in subsequent performances of “The Dream, paired with Kenneth MacMillan’s “The Song of the Earth,”  which features Marianela Nuñez, Nehemiah Kish and Carlos Acosta in its opening-night cast.The second program, which offers Liam Scarlett’s recent “Age of Anxiety,” a program of divertissements and Wayne McGregor’s “Infra,” will allow audiences to see a broader range of the company’s up-and-coming dancers, as well as its leading lights. Some names to look out for: the principal dancer Vadim Muntagirov, who has been receiving rapturous reviews since joining the company last year; and from the soloist and corps ranks, Yuhui Choe, Francesca Hayward, Melissa Hamilton, Yasmine Naghdi and Marcelino Sambé.A version of this article appears in print on 04/24/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Royal Ballet Casting For Lincoln Center.
