The National World War II Museum is to announce on Tuesday a $20 million gift that will be used to add a “Canopy of Peace” to the New Orleans campus as part of the museum’s expansion.The donation was made by Donald T. Bollinger Jr., known as Boysie, a longtime supporter of the museum who served as its board chairman and made his fortune in shipbuilding.“Teaching future generations about the experiences that were learned in World War II is extremely important,” Mr. Bollinger said in a telephone interview.Dedicated in 2000 as the National D-Day Museum and designated by Congress as the country’s National World War II museum in 2004, the institution is in the midst of a $325 million capital campaign that will quadruple the museum’s size, to be completed in 2017.The canopy, a 150-foot-tall structure, is meant to symbolize the hope and promise that emerged after World War II.Four million dollars of Mr. Bollinger’s gift will go toward the museum’s endowment. The museum’s existing 1940s-style entertainment space that serves as an exhibition for war era music will now be called the B.B. Stage Door Canteen after Mr. Bollinger.“Hopefully this gift will inspire others to contribute,” said Gordon H. Mueller, the museum’s president and chief executive.In December 2015, the Museum will open “Road to Tokyo: Pacific Theater Galleries,” tracing the path from Pearl Harbor to Tokyo Bay, and complete the museum’s new Campaigns of Courage pavilion.
