Old Master works by artists including Durer, Raphael, Rembrandt, Rubens and François Boucher will be coming to New York in 2017, some for the first time, in an exhibition of paintings and drawings from Sweden’s Nationalmuseum, the Morgan Library & Museum announced.While it is closed for renovation the Nationalmuseum, in Stockholm, is lending 76 works – 14 paintings and 62 drawings — to the Morgan for a show scheduled to run Feb. 5-May 14, 2017. Colin B. Bailey, the Morgan’s new director, said he saw an opportunity to bring the masterpieces to New York. It will be the first exhibition that Mr. Bailey is overseeing since he took over at the Morgan in August. (Mr. Bailey was formerly director of the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco and for many years before that the chief curator at the Frick Collection.) He said some of the works had probably been seen in the United States but never in such depth and as part of such a group.As well as New York, some of the works will also be lent to the Louvre, he said.The paintings and drawings originate from the collection of Count Carl Gustav Tessin, a diplomat and voracious art collector. One painting, one of Mr. Bailey’s favorites, “The Triumph of Venus,” an oil on canvas from 1740 by Boucher, has not left Stockholm since the 18th century, he said. The Morgan said the collaboration was the first between the institutions in nearly 50 years.Separately, the Morgan announced two new acquisitions. A drawing, “The Foundation of Cosmopoli,” by the 16th-century artist Jacopo Zucchi, was bought through a dealer, and a copy of Ariosto’s “Orlando Furioso” was bought at Sotheby’s on Dec. 2.A version of this article appears in print on 12/24/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Old Masters to the Morgan.
