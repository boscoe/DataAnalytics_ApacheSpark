INDIO, Calif. — The number is 16. The 16th edition of the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival will start shortly today. The Times has covered it many years (for me, the number is eight) but not every year. At the beginning, when an enormous field festival built around indie-ish discernment seemed novel, we were probably underestimating it, and then as its lineup started to look like the others that grew up around it — or vice versa — I started to wonder if we were overestimating it. I still do.But Coachella is the first big festival of the summer and bands use it in various ways. The cameras are all here: It is visually documented up, down and sideways. That is partly due to the strength of the bands (this year: Drake! Jack White! AC/DC! Chet Faker, the Australian electro-soul man! Gaslamp Killer, the Los Angeles weirdo-hiphop producer and D.J., playing with a 13-piece live band! The second reunion of the San Diego band Drive Like Jehu!); partly due to the fact that famous actors like to come here to party; and partly due to the fact that after the winter months, people like to see pictures of ecstatic youths with pocket money dancing in a tent with weekend-pass wristbands. It’s the annual big reveal for American pop-music culture. The question of who Drake will bring onstage as guests becomes extremely important for a weekend.Also, the number is 35: the water-use reduction percentage for the city of Indio, as proposed by California’s State Water Resources Control Board. That’s serious, and that’s real. But this is a festival built on collective fantasies so sturdy that they become real too: about taste and discernment and cultural importance and leisure and entitlement.
