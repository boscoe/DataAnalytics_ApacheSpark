Now Deadheads have no excuse for missing the end.“Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of Grateful Dead,” the summer concerts billed as the jam band’s final performances, will be broadcast live via pay-per-view from Soldier Field in Chicago, July 3 through July 5, the broadcasting company Live Alliance announced Wednesday.In addition to that three-day, 15-hour special (the band will play two sets each night), the group’s preceding shows — scheduled for June 27 and 28 in Santa Clara, Calif. — will be streamed live online. (The Santa Clara concerts were added after tickets for the Chicago farewell shows sold out instantly, angering many longtime fans. “We will not be adding any more ‘Fare Thee Well’ shows,” the four surviving members of Grateful Dead said in a statement. “This is it.”)A webcast of all five concerts will be available for $79.95 starting May 1.
