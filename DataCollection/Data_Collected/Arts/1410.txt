The Dance on Camera Festival — an eclectic celebration of ballet, jazz and contemporary trends — will return in February with appearances by the ballerinas Natalia Makarova and Merrill Ashley.Dance Films Association and the Film Society of Lincoln Center will co-present the 44th edition of the festival, which runs Feb. 12 to 16 and includes a lineup of 20 feature films and 36 shorts, as well as retrospectives and free panel discussions.In 1970, Ms. Makarova defected from the Soviet Union while on tour with the Kirov (now Mariinsky) Ballet in London. In the late 1980s she conceived and wrote a BBC show about famous ballerinas including Maya Plisetskaya and Margot Fonteyn. The first episode, “Body and Soul,” will be screened at the festival, along with a 20-minute sample of performances in her personal archive. An appearance by Ms. Makarova, now 75, is to follow.Ms. Ashley will take part in a Q. and A. after the screening of Ron Steinman’s new documentary, “The Dance Goodbye.” The film tells the story of Ms. Ashley’s career: 30 years with New York City Ballet, some of which were spent dancing for George Balanchine. But the crux of the documentary is how lifelong dancers cope with aging and saying farewell to performance.Other highlights of the festival include a tribute to the jazz dancer and choreographer Eugene Louis Faccuito, a screening of Vincente Minnelli’s 1953 movie musical, “The Band Wagon,” and movie-theater treatment of a performance by Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater — including its signature work, “Revelations,” of course.Tickets are scheduled to go on sale Jan. 12. More information, including the full lineup, will be available on Film Society’s website.A version of this article appears in print on 12/05/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Dance on Camera.
