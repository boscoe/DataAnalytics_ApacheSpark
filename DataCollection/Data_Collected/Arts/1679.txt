Fox is to broadcast a live musical in March about Jesus Christ, titled “The Passion,” the latest live music special to appear on network television. “The Passion” will be hosted and narrated by Tyler Perry, and broadcast live from New Orleans on Palm Sunday. Earlier this month, NBC broadcast “The Wiz Live!,” the third annual musical special it has aired in December, and Fox will stage “Grease: Live” on Jan. 31. Network executives have been hopeful that these specials will draw big numbers at a time when ratings are down and viewers are increasingly watching programs days, weeks or months after they originally air. “The Wiz Live!” delivered very solid ratings for NBC: 11.5 million people tuned in, more than two million better than last year’s “Peter Pan Live!”Fox made no announcements about cast assignments for “The Passion,” but music will be arranged by the  producer Adam Anders, who also worked on Fox’s “Glee.” The special will be shot throughout New Orleans, including a scene in which hundreds of people will carry a cross from just outside the Superdome to a stage next to the Mississippi River, the network said.
