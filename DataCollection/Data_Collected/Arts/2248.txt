A new chapel based on the art nouveau architect Antoní Gaudí’s designs will be built in Chile, about 90 years after his death. When complete, the chapel — a modest building with a spire rendered in his signature neo-Baroque  style  — will be the only Gaudí-designed building outside of his native Spain.Michelle Bachelet, the president of Chile, said at a news conference last month that the chapel would be built as part of a “spiritual and cultural center” dedicated to the architect in Rancagua in central Chile. News reports said it was set to be complete in 2017.The designs first surfaced when a Chilean friar, Angélico Aranda, wrote to Gaudí in 1922 requesting a building based on the Portiuncula, the small chapel where St. Francis of Assisi worked. A representative for the architect responded, sharing some of Gaudí’s existing sketches for a chapel. The planned building in Rancagua is based on those designs.Gaudí spent most of his life working in Barcelona, where he created several buildings in a unique style that echoed Spanish iconography, from jagged mountains to the work of the painter El Greco. The capstone of his career was the Sagrada Família, a large and hugely ornate church in Barcelona. Gaudí was killed by a streetcar before the building was finished.The new center in Chile will include  the chapel, an exhibition space dedicated to Gaudí, and several recreational spaces. The president announced the center alongside a broader plan to construct more than 30 parks nationwide.
