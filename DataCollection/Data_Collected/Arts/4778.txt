Joey Alexander is an extraordinarily gifted jazz pianist; he is Balinese-born, Indonesia-raised and currently living in New Jersey.   His first album, “My Favorite Things,” came out this week from Motema, and quickly became the No. 1 jazz record on iTunes. He is 11.He may be an extremely young case, he’s not the only one: in the past decade we’ve seen the rise of the pianists Tigran Hamasyan, Beka Gochiashvili, Gadi Lehavi, and the guitarist Julian Lage, all pre-voting age when they first broke through to an audience. (Of course there are examples from the past as well, like the drummer Tony Williams, who joined the Miles Davis quintet at 17.) Sometimes they develop under the mentorship of a great bandleader; sometimes they’re front-and-center from the start.  In any case, young prodigies have become increasingly important to the engines of the jazz business—not only education, outreach, and fundraising, but record sales.Nate Chinen, who wrote about Joey Alexander in a story for The Times this week, is our guest on this week’s jazz-prodigy edition of Popcast; we talk about ways in which the promotion of young excellence might not be a sideshow to jazz, but a tradition at the root of the whole endeavor.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
