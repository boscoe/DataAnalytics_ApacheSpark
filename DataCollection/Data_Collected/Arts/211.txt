But their curving and undulating arms are active, too; Mr. Curran’s stream of gestures — flickering hands, bent elbows framing the face or a palm pushed forward as the other hand swirls around it — are nothing if not insistent. Yet he plays it safe with movement that prides itself too much on precision. Where is the poetry?As the dancers continue on their journey, swaying their arms, swinging their hips and wearing costumes that look as though they’ve been raided from a bazaar, Mr. Curran’s choreography becomes increasingly cramped.It’s the music that gives this dance its atmosphere.Led by Nurlanbek Nyshanov, who suggested the Whitman poem to Mr. Curran, the six-member ensemble guides us through waves of sound with beats that stir the air with a refreshing simplicity of emotion. If the best part of this collaboration is being introduced to Ustatshakirt Plus — well, that’s good enough.­Performances of “Dream’d in a Dream” continue through Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Harvey Theater; 718-636-4100, bam.org.Advertisement
