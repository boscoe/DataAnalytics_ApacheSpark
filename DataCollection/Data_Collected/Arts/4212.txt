(Haven’t we all?) But what “this moment” is, exactly, remained a mystery when the network released a second excruciatingly brief teaser on Thursday for “Bruce Jenner — The Interview,” a two-hour “20/20” special on Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern time. The physical transformation of Mr. Jenner, the 1976 Olympic gold-medal decathlete and a former husband of the Kardashian matriarch, Kris Jenner, has been a source of intense scrutiny for months, leading to speculation that he is transitioning from male to female. But aside from showing Mr. Jenner, 65, in silhouette with a ponytail and from behind in what appears to be a shoulder-length bob, the clips reveal almost nothing. What we do know: Ms. Sawyer interviewed Mr. Jenner in Malibu, Calif.; New York City; and Tarrytown, N.Y., his hometown, and spoke with several of his family members as well. As for anything else, ABC is leaving it up to Mr. Jenner to speak for himself.Advertisement
