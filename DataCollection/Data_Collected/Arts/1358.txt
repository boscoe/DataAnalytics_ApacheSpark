Shake, pour and — faster than you can say “Scrooged” — it’s “A Very Murray Christmas,” streaming Friday, Dec. 4, on Netflix and starring Bill Murray as a singer whose Christmas Eve cabaret act at the Carlyle Hotel goes bust when New York is shut down by the blizzard of the century.

Now that’s a gift that keeps on giving.Advertisement
