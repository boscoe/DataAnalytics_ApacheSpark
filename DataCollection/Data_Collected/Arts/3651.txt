Oleg Bryjak and Maria Radner were among the 150 passengers and crew killed in Tuesday’s plane crash in the French Alps. They were returning from performing in Wagner’s “Siegfried” in Barcelona, Spain.Two opera singers were among the victims of the Germanwings crash on Tuesday: the contralto Maria Radner and the baritone Oleg Bryjak. Both had been performing in “Siegfried,” the third opera in Wagner’s “Ring” cycle, at the Liceu opera house in Barcelona, Ms. Radner as the earth goddess Erda and Mr. Bryjak as the scheming dwarf Alberich.Mr. Bryjak, 54, joined the Deutsche Oper am Rhein in 1996. He was known as a warm and generous colleague, well liked by the company and equally skilled at playing comic heroes and tragic villains, said Stephen Harrison, the opera’s artistic administrator. Ms. Radner, 33, made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in January 2012 in “Götterdämmerung.” She had been expected to sing for the first time at the prestigious Bayreuth Festival this summer in “Das Rheingold” and “Götterdämmerung.”These videos come from the March 13 performance of “Siegfried” in Barcelona. In an excerpt from Act 2, Alberich (Mr. Bryjak) confronts the Wanderer (Greer Grimsley), whom Erda (Ms. Radner) is helpless to advise in a scene from Act 3.
