The dynamic conductor Yannick Nézet-Séguin has had quite the fall — conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra before a visiting Pope Francis, opening the Metropolitan Opera season leading Verdi’s “Otello,” even throwing out the first pitch at a Phillies game.  Now he can add another feather to his cap: On Thursday he will be named artist of the year by Musical America, the venerable classical music publication.Mr. Nézet-Séguin, 40, is being lauded by the publication for the “brilliance and virtuosity” of the performances he leads. He is currently the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra and of the Orchestre Métropolitain in his native Montreal, and he has been mentioned as a possible successor to James Levine as the next music director of the Met. Musical America named Tod Machover, the musical visionary at the M.I.T. Media Lab, composer of the year. The violinist Jennifer Koh, who is performing a “Bridge to Beethoven” series this season at the 92nd Street Y, was named instrumentalist of the year. And the tenor Mark Padmore, who is currently singing the three Schubert song cycles to open Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival, was named vocalist of the year.
