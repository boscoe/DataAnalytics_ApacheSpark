A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.John Abercrombie Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) The guitarist John Abercrombie takes a measured, self-possessed approach to improvisation, so much so that it’s easy to underestimate the considerable chance-taking in his playing. He appears here with the same sterling rhythm team as on “39 Steps,” his fine album from 2013: Marc Copland on piano, Drew Gress on bass and Joey Baron on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Nate Chinen)The Gabriel Alegría Afro-Peruvian Sextet  (Monday) The polyrhythmic-triplet pulse common to the folkloric music of Peru — in dance rhythms like festejo, tondero and landó — meshes well with a jazz cadence, and this band, led by the trumpeter Gabriel Alegría, has made a mission out of underscoring those affinities. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org.

(Chinen)Carl Allen: ‘The Art of Elvin’  (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Allen, a steadfast drummer within the jazz mainstream, presents a tribute to Art Blakey and Elvin Jones, the two main pillars in his pantheon.

At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Michael Blake Quartet  (Wednesday) The tenor and soprano saxophonist Michael Blake has an appealing recent album — “Tiddy Boom,” inspired by the jaunty ease and fathomless style of Lester Young — made with two longtime partners, the pianist Frank Kimbrough and the bassist Ben Allison. They rejoin him here, in a quartet with the insightful and effervescent Rudy Royston on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Henry Butler  (Thursday, and April 9 and 16) Mr. Butler, a New Orleans pianist with a knack for percussive prestidigitation, recently teamed up with the trumpeter-arranger Steven Bernstein on “Viper’s Drag,” an ebullient jaunt released on the revived Impulse! label. For the first two dates in this three-week residency, he’ll play solo piano. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com.

(Chinen)★ Paquito D’Rivera: Around The Americas  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. D’Rivera, the irrepressible Cuban clarinetist and alto saxophonist, is a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master and a lifelong proponent of pan-Latin musical expression. For this concert, which reflects Jazz at Lincoln Center’s current emphasis on music of the Americas, he’ll lead his band, with the trumpeter and trombonist Diego Urcola, the pianist Alex Brown, the bassist Oscar Stagnaro, the drummer Mark Walker and the percussionist Pernell Saturnino. They’ll be joined by the string ensemble Quinteto Cimarrón to perform Mr. D’Rivera’s “Aires Tropicales,” which had its premiere (as a piece for woodwind quintet) in 1994.

Two of them, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Johnathan Blake, join him in this engagement — alongside a sharp young trumpeter, Ambrose Akinmusire, and a guitarist, Charles Altura. There’s new music for the band, and some high expectations. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)KEVIN HAYS DUOS (Friday through Sunday) The pianist Kevin Hays has a direct and unabashed relationship to melody, though he’s also a pocket rhapsodist. This weekend he settles in to play duos with a series of excellent bassists: Matt Brewer (Friday), Larry Grenadier (Saturday) and Scott Colley (Sunday). At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com.

(Chinen)★ Sheila Jordan with the Steve Kuhn Trio  (Tuesday through April 4) Ms. Jordan, 86, is an eminent and exploratory singer — she was recently anointed a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts — whose approach to jazz skews nearly kaleidoscopic.

(Chinen)Christian McBride Big Band  (Tuesday through April 5) This spit-and-polish outfit, which won a recent Grammy for best large-jazz-ensemble album, thrives on the robust energies of the bassist-bandleader for which it is named. It also relies on the diligence of a lineup that includes stalwarts like the saxophonist Ron Blake, the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix and the trombonist Steve Davis. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org.

On Saturday she’ll lead Snowy Egret — another chamber group, with the cornetist Ron Miles and others — which just released a strong self-titled album. And she’ll close on Sunday with an early set in duo with the multi-reedist Marty Ehrlich, and a late set with a trio featuring Lindsey Horner on bass and Reggie Nicholson on drums. At Avenue C and Second Street, East Village; thestonenyc.com. (Chinen)★ Michele Rosewoman’s New Yor-Uba  (Friday through Sunday) Ms. Rosewoman is a pianist and composer whose great guiding purpose, over the last few decades, has been a synthesis of modern jazz and ancient Afro-Cuban folklore. This weekend she presents “Alabanza,” a piece that had its recent premiere in Havana, with her group New Yor-Uba, which includes the percussionists Román Díaz and Mauricio Herrera, the saxophonist Roman Filiu, the trumpeter Ingrid Jensen and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey.

(Chinen)Nicholas Payton Trio  (Wednesday and Thursday) A trumpeter of incisive prowess — and, in recent seasons, dauntless provocation — Nicholas Payton has often sounded best in the sparest settings, which bodes well for this two-nighter. Working with no pianist, he’ll lead a trio with two rhythm section gurus, the bassist Buster Williams and the drummer Lenny White. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net.

(Chinen)★ Trio 3  (Friday through Sunday) The alto saxophonist Oliver Lake, the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Andrew Cyrille are esteemed veterans of the avant-garde, and as the collective Trio 3, they share an agenda of rugged epiphany. They have released recent albums featuring an array of impressive pianists, but this run at the Village Vanguard has no billed guests, which isn’t at all a problem. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village; 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.

At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7000, kitano.com. (Chinen)Advertisement
