The baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky is interviewed backstage during the Metropolitan Opera’s production of Verdi’s “Il Trovatore.”Fans of the Russian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky have been understandably concerned since he revealed in late June that he was undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. But Mr. Hvorostovsky rallied recently to sing the first three of six scheduled performances as Count di Luna in the Metropolitan Opera’s production of Verdi’s “Il Trovatore.” And in a rare public statement, he has promised to recover.On opening night, Friday, Sept. 25, he looked and sounded terrific, singing with his trademark velvety legato, dusky vocal colorings and consummate Verdian style. And he sang splendidly again for the Saturday matinee, an HD broadcast seen by some 200,000 people around the world. Going onstage has been how this charismatic artist, who turns 53 next week, has chosen to cope. At the Saturday performance he took a minute to speak with the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, who was hosting the live intermission feature. While in New York, Mr. Hvorostovsky had been respectfully declining all interviews. On Tuesday the Met released a video of the brief exchange with Ms. Graham. He showed up in costume, with the side of his face bloodied, after the count’s cheek was slashed with a knife by his rival, Manrico. “Want to kiss me?” Mr. Hvorostovsky jokingly asked Ms. Graham, who replied, “Oh my God, you’re a mess,” and went on to say that he looked fantastic and sounded like “a million trillion bucks.” Asked whether he wanted to say anything to his fans, Mr. Hvorostovsky replied, “Thank you so much, thank you for loving me, thank you for sending me the good vibes for my difficult time.” He added: “You see that I’m getting better, and soon, I’m going to be recovered.” As of now, he is scheduled to sing additional Met performances in “Il Trovatore,” as well as a Carnegie Hall recital in February.
