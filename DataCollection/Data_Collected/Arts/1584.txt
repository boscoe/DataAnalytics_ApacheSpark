But Mr. Casey’s excellent lyrics go bigger and more abstract: They’re also about Detroit as a pile of symbols and emotions. Asked recently by Stereogum what the themes of the record were, Mr. Casey listed 18 possibilities; the first four were ‘evil,’ ‘false pride,’ ‘lawyer billboards’ and ‘dust.’ That is a powerful index.”In this interview, we talk only about words, not music. I asked Mr. Casey to choose one song he didn’t write whose lyrics he admired, and could talk about with specificity; he chose “Still Sleep,” by the Detroit band Tyvek, with lyrics written by that band’s singer, Kevin Boyer. Then I chose a new Protomartyr song, “Uncle Mother’s,” and asked him to carry out the tricky job of dissecting his own writing. We talked about the corruption and recontextualizing of common or arcane phrases, television, form meeting content, wrong-number calls and other overheard language, adult parties, mapmaking, and, inevitably, Detroit.Advertisement
