(8 p.m. Wednesday and 7 p.m. Thursday, 646-435-9465, collegiatechorale.org.) The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center’s series New Music in the Kaplan Penthouse is a highlight of the group’s programming. Thursday’s lineup includes the American premiere of David Philip Hefti’s “Monumentum” for string sextet and Andy Akiho’s “LIgNEouS 1” for string quartet and marimba. (7:30 p.m., 212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org.) Sometimes the pairings in the Miller Theater’s Bach, Revisited series at Columbia University are unpersuasive, but not this Friday’s. Sofia Gubaidulina’s music is strongly influenced by the great Baroque master, and she will be represented by her 1993 “Meditation” on his chorale “Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit” and a 1965 “Chaconne” in a program that also includes three works of Bach’s. Brad Lubman conducts the fine players of Ensemble Signal. (8 p.m., 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com.)Advertisement
