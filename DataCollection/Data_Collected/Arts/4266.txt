ROME – One of Italy’s lesser-known lakes (without American movie stars to stalk) is likely to become considerably more famous after the wrap artist Christo has his way with it. For just over two weeks, in June 2016, floating walkways lined with bright yellow fabric will create a walkway around Lake Iseo, in the Lombardy region, joining the mainland to the lake islands. The fabric will continue on pedestrian streets in two mainland towns.Visitors will be able to walk on the work, atop some 200,000 fabric-lined floatable cubes stretching for almost two miles, but it was also designed to be seen from the mountains above.Titled “The Floating Piers,” the project was presented by Christo and the Italian art critic and curator Germano Celant in Rome on Wednesday.Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, who died in 2009, created several projects in Italy, including the “Wrapped Fountain and ‎Wrapped Medieval Tower” in Spoleto, 1968; several “Wrapped Monuments” in Milan, 1970; and a wrapped Roman wall, 1974.Christo said that he unsuccessfully tried to pursue the project in Argentina and Japan. But Mr. Celant had better luck getting permits from local authorities. Christo raised 10 million euros (about $11 million) to fund the project, he said, but that he didn’t know what the final costs would be. “It’s like a child, you can’t set out a budget to see him grow,” he told reporters at Maxxi, Italy’s national contemporary art museum, according to the news agency ANSA. He added that crossing the walkways “will be a very sexy experience, for the fabric follows the movement of the waves.”
