Opting for a more subdued choice outside the galaxy of starchitects, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has selected David Chipperfield to design its new wing for modern and contemporary art, Thomas P. Campbell, the museum’s director and chief executive, announced on Wednesday.In a project likely to involve demolishing the existing Lila Acheson Wallace Wing in the museum’s southwest corner — though there are no firm design plans yet — the renovation will increase gallery space, double the size of the Roof Garden and possibly create an entrance from Central Park.The redesign will also create accessible on-site storage and may include new designs for the adjacent galleries for the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, along with operational spaces.“It’s a very exciting juncture for us,” Mr. Campbell said in a telephone interview.The Met chose Mr. Chipperfield after a year-long search for “an architectural practice with a design vision and sensibility that would help deliver beautiful galleries that are thoughtfully integrated with the rest of this complex museum,” Mr. Campbell said, “a building that would be a significant addition for the Met and worthy of its location in New York.”Mr. Chipperfield has previously designed the restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin, an expansion of the Saint Louis Art Museum and the Hepworth Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England.Work on the wing will coincide with the Met’s programming in the Whitney Museum of American Art’s former home on Madison Avenue, designed by Marcel Breuer. Programming there will start in spring 2016.A version of this article appears in print on 03/12/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Architect Chosen for Metu2019s New Wing.
