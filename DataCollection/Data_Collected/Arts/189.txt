 Beyer Blinder Belle Architects & Planners has been selected to design the new Schwarzman Center at Yale University,  a cultural hub to which the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman donated $150 million in May.The firm, best known for its renovation of historic buildings including Grand Central Terminal, will be charged with transforming Commons and Memorial Hall — designed by Carrère and Hastings in 1901 — into Yale’s first university-wide student center.“They have a wonderful sense of enhancing the historical aspects of a space, whether its Grand Central or Ellis Island or the Morgan Library,” Peter Salovey, the university’s president, said in a telephone interview.  “While at the same time developing new elements that seem complimentary and only enhance the experience.”The renovation will turn the large space beneath Commons — which will remain a freshman dining hall — and on the building’s upper floors into new spaces  for theater, music, lectures and readings.“They’re very sensitive from a preservation perspective, however they are imaginative,” Mr. Schwarzman said of Beyer Blinder Belle. “We would never have hired them to just update a building.”The firm recently completed master planning for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a building plan for the Kennedy Center and a renovation of New York city hall.“The real challenge is going to be taking these wonderful buildings from the turn of the century,” said Elizabeth Leber, Partner-in-Charge for Beyer Blinder Belle, but filling them with “forward-thinking programming.”Michael M. Kaiser, the former Kennedy Center president and founding chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management, is working as a consultant on the center, which is to open in 2020.A portion of Mr. Schwarzman’s gift — $20 million — will be used for the center’s presentations and operations. Yale will contribute an additional $2 million a year for 10 years, starting in 2019, for programming and staff.A version of this article appears in print on 10/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Yale Chooses Architect for Schwarzman Center.
