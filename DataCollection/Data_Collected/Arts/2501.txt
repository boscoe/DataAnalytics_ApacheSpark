The Rosa Parks Collection at the Library of Congress is set to open to researchers on Wednesday, coinciding with what would have been Ms. Parks’s 102nd birthday.The collection includes roughly 7,500 manuscripts and 2,500 photographs, as well as artifacts like her Presidential Medal of Freedom, letters from various presidents and drawings sent to her by schoolchildren. It is at the library on a 10-year loan from the philanthropist Howard G. Buffett, who purchased the collection through his foundation in August for $4.5 million after a legal dispute between Ms. Parks’s heirs and the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development.A sampling of some two dozen items from the collection will be on view at the library from March 2 to March 30. Some items will also be added to “The Civil Rights Act of 1964: Long Struggle for Freedom,” an exhibition that runs through Sept. 12.Ms. Parks came to prominence on Dec. 1, 1955, when she was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., an incident that led to the Montgomery bus boycott. The library’s other civil rights holdings include the papers of Thurgood Marshall, Bayard Rustin, the N.A.A.C.P. and the Urban League.
