Since Janet Jackson’s last record, eight years ago, there have been major changes in her life: Her brother Michael died in 2009 and, more recently, she married a Qatari fashion magnate.So it’s a new time. And it’s usually a new time with a Janet Jackson record: time for a new persona, with stated or implied ideas about sexuality or power or social justice.But “Unbreakable,” made with the help of her longtime producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, is a settled, reassuring record — an interesting choice when the timbre of her voice and the style of her provocations seem especially in vogue through the work of singers like Tinashe and FKA twigs.Recently Jon Pareles reviewed the beginning of her current tour, in Vancouver; this week he reviews the album, and explains its strengths and weaknesses on the Popcast.“It’s the kind of album you make when you’re grown up and you’re trying to figure out how to age gracefully,” he explains. “It’s a hard thing to do.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
