Happening again. #TwinPeaks returns on @SHO_Network— David Lynch (@DAVID_LYNCH) May 16, 2015“Twin Peaks” originally aired for two seasons starting in 1990, and plans for a reboot were revealed by co-creator Mark Frost in October. However, Mr. Lynch announced he was leaving the project in April, writing on Twitter: “After 1 year and 4 months of negotiations, I left because not enough money was offered to do the script the way I felt it needed to be done …I  love the world of Twin Peaks and wish things could have worked out differently.” A little more than a month later, and following a viral video of the show’s cast trying to imagine the show without Mr. Lynch, he is back on board to direct more than nine hours worth of episodes, according to a statement by David Nevins, the president of Showtime.  The 2016 TV landscape is now filled with familiar faces from 1990s, as “The X-Files” and “Full House” are also slated for revivals.
