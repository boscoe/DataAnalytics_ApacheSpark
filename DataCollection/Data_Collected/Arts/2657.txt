The award recognizes a rising American choreographer with financial and administrative support for presenting a commissioned work. Mr. Reker said in a statement that the award, which includes a $10,000 commission, would allow him to create “a piece I have wanted to make for years but could only imagine making since my resources are somewhat limited in NYC.” Mr. Reker was selected by the institute’s artistic advisory board — which includes the choreographers Brian Brooks, David Dorfman and Doug Elkins — after a closed nomination process. The award is named for Solange MacArthur, a former member of American Ballet Theater and supporter of the institute, who died in 2012. The first recipient was Chris Schlichting of Minnesota.Advertisement
