The Tony Award-winning director Harold Prince, best known for his work on “The Phantom of the Opera” and other hugely successful Broadway musicals, will travel off Broadway to direct “The Band’s Visit,” a new musical by the composer David Yazbek (music and lyrics) and the playwright Itamar Moses (book) for the Atlantic Theater Company’s 2015-16 season, the theater  announced on Friday.Based on the 2007 film by the Israeli director Eran Kolirin, the musical is about a traveling police band from Egypt that finds itself in a remote Israeli desert town. The show, set to run at the Linda Gross Theater in the spring of 2016, will be the 87-year-old Mr. Prince’s first major New York directing gig since “LoveMusik,” which had a brief Broadway run in 2007. Most recently he has been trying, without success, to launch a retrospective revue on Broadway featuring material from shows he’s produced or directed in an unparalleled career that includes 21 Tonys.The Atlantic’s 2015-2016 season will begin this fall with a revival of the Caryl Churchill play “Cloud Nine,” directed by James Macdonald, who oversaw the acclaimed 2014 production of the writer’s “Love and Information.” In November the season will continue with the New York premiere of “These Paper Bullets!,” a Shakespeare-inspired musical with songs by the Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong and a book by the writer Rolin Jones. Based on “Much Ado About Nothing” and set in mod-era London, the show had its premiere at Yale Rep last year. The Atlantic mounting will be a coproduction with the Geffen Playhouse.January will bring the premiere of the drama “Skeleton Crew,” the final installment of Dominique Morisseau’s Detroit trilogy that includes the plays “Detroit ’67,” seen at the Public Theater in 2013, and “Paradise Blue,” which is set to have its premiere this summer at the Williamstown Theater Festival. In May 2016 the theater will feature the New York premiere of “The Purple Lights of Joppa Illinois,” a new play, written and directed by Adam Rapp (“Red Light Winter”), about an encounter between a man and two teenage girls at a Kentucky apartment. The show was produced last year at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, Calif.An additional production is to be announced, as are casting and run dates for the entire season.A version of this article appears in print on 03/28/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Harold Prince Heading to an Off Broadway Stage.
