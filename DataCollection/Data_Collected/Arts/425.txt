“I’m not throwing away my shot,” a young, scrappy and hungry Alexander Hamilton sings in the Broadway musical when, like so many other immigrants, he arrives in America from St. Croix as a teenager and seeks to make it not just anywhere, but in New York. But 32 years later, on a bluff in Hoboken, did he literally throw his shot away? In their deadly duel, did Aaron Burr shoot to kill, as Hamilton groupies argue, and did Hamilton deliberately miss? We’ll probably never know, but now there’s a rare opportunity to see the actual walnut and brass Wogdon of London pistols they used in their fatal encounter.Last publicly exhibited in 2011, they are on loan from JPMorgan Chase & Company and are on display until Nov. 29 at the New-York Historical Society, which is honoring Ron Chernow, the author of the biography “Hamilton,” and Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the musical, at a fund-raising dinner on Nov. 9. JPMorgan Chase’s earliest predecessor, the Manhattan Company, was chartered in 1799 to provide the city with water.  The pistols are usually kept at the company’s Park Avenue headquarters.
