LONDON — It was the Mystery of the Historical Costume: to promote a a coming season of “Sherlock,” the BBC last year released an image of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in Victorian clothing. Then the two stars were recently seen in similar outfits while filming the new “Sherlock” series. Speculation — never in short order where “Sherlock” (or Sherlock) is concerned — abounded.The denouement has arrived. Steven Moffat, the co-creator of “Sherlock,” with Mark Gatiss, told Entertainment Weekly that the crew had been filming a special episode set in the Victorian era, which will be separate from the new series.“The special is its own thing,” Mr. Moffat said before taking part in a panel at a South by Southwest conference on Monday. “We wouldn’t have done the story we’re doing, and the way we’re doing it, if we didn’t have this special. It’s not part of the run of three episodes.”Mr. Moffat, who has had extensive experience of time-travel as a writer on the television show “Doctor Who,” told Entertainment Weekly that filming of the special was complete and that he was very pleased with the result. No date has been set by the BBC for the broadcast, but it is widely expected to air during the Christmas period.A version of this article appears in print on 03/18/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Case Closed on u2018Sherlocku2019 Costume Mystery.
