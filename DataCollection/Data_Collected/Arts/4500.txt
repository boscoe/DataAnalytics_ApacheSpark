Jointly organized by the broad-minded jazz pianists (and Harlem residents) Jason Moran and Marc Cary, it’s a look at the connections between African-American musical communities in Harlem and in Washington — a story that goes back even further than Duke Ellington, though he’s sure to be a part of it. Among the other musicians involved are the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, the drummer Jimmy Cobb, the pianists Bertha Hope and Gerald Clayton, and a spate of singers including Queen Esther and Brianna Thomas. After a performance on Saturday at the Apollo Theater, as part of the Harlem Jazz Shrines Festival, the program will repeat on Sunday at the Kennedy Center, where Mr. Moran is the artistic director for jazz.
