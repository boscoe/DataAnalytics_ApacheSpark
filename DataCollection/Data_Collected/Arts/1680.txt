LONDON — A two-ton bronze. Four, seven-foot fiberglass bulls. A 300-foot metal tube. A spiky, rusted metal pineapple-shaped fountain. These are some of the unlikely artworks that have disappeared from public places since 1945, says Historic England, a government service that protects English heritage. On Tuesday Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, issued “a call to arms” to the public to help search for some 40 missing works of public art, some by major figures like Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth.“We may have lost more than we know and we feel now is the time to do something about it,” he said in a statement in The Guardian. “A lot of these pieces were commissioned against a background of optimism, good intentions, civic values and a lot of them were of very fine quality.”Historic England published a list of the missing works on its website. They include Hepworth’s “Two Forms (Divided Circle)” (1969), Moore’s “Reclining Figure” (1969), Peter Laszlo’s concrete “The Sunbathers” (1951), Lynn Chadwick’s “The Watchers” (1960), and Frank Dobson’s massive “Woman With Fish” (1959). Improbably, given their weight and size, these have all been stolen or lost during renovations or after being moved into storage. Some may have been melted down for scrap metal.Historic England has appealed to the public to send photographs and memories about works of outdoor art created between 1945 and 1985 that are thought to be missing, ahead of its exhibition, “Out There: Our Post-War Public Art,” at Somerset House in February.“I can’t believe that everything that is missing was melted down,” Sarah Gaventa, the curator of the exhibition, said in an interview in The Independent. “Some of what we are looking for was sold rather than lost but we don’t know where it ended up. It would be great if we could find one or two pieces.”A version of this article appears in print on 12/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Search for Missing Art.
