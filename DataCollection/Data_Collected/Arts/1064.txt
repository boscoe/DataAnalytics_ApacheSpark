A German Expressionist painting by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner at the Museum of Modern Art will be returned to the heirs of the German art collector Max Fischer, the museum announced Monday.The painting, “Sand Hills (Bei Gruenau)” was inherited by Fischer from his parents, Ludwig and Rosy Fischer, in 1926, and has been known in MoMA’s collection as “Sand Hills in Engadine” (1917-18). In response to inquiries by the family through their lawyer, David Rowland, the museum conducted a multiyear research effort into the history of the painting, which was complicated by the fact that the painting’s name had been changed twice.“There’s no sense of loss,” Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA’s director, said in a telephone interview. “It feels like we’re doing the right thing.”The Ludwig and Rosy Fischer collection – inherited by Max and his brother, Ernst, who were Jewish — was one of the most important collections of expressionist art assembled in pre-Nazi Germany. Max Fischer lost a good part of this inheritance when he fled Germany in 1935.“The heirs of Max Fischer are grateful to the MoMA for their return of this important artwork,” Mr. Rowland said in a statement.
