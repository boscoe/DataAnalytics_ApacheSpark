B.B. King, the esteemed bluesman, who at 89 is currently in hospice care at his home in Las Vegas, will for now remain under the guardianship of his longtime manager, Laverne Toney, despite claims of abuse by three of Mr. King’s children, The Associated Press reported.A Las Vegas judge ruled on Thursday, after two investigations, that there was no evidence of medical neglect or theft. “Mr. King has counsel,” said Jon Norheim, a hearing master at Clark County Family Court, in his ruling. “I don’t have anything here that says he lacks capacity. He has some serious health issues. But he has counsel. If he feels like he’s being taken advantage of, he has remedies.”Three of Mr. King’s 11 living children — Karen Williams, Rita Washington and Patty King — have said Ms. Toney was taking advantage of him and petitioned to take over his affairs. “We lost the battle, but we haven’t lost the war,” Ms. Williams said. Mr. King’s children may potentially return to court after legally informing the rest of Mr. King’s family.Brent Bryson, a lawyer for Mr. King, said, “It’s all about money.” He added: “Mr. King is no longer out able to tour at this particular time so there’s no money coming in. The only way they can get money now is by filing a frivolous type of action.”Mr. King had been performing live until October, when he was forced to cancel a tour, citing dehydration and exhaustion stemming from diabetes. He was hospitalized last week, but returned home last Friday, according to his website.
