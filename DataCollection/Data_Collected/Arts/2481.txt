In a reminder that labor negotiations in the world of classical music are not always marked by disharmony, the San Francisco Symphony announced Monday that it had ratified a new contract that would keep its players among the best-paid in the world.The new contract, which will run through November 2018, provides for a new base minimum salary in the first year of $2,892 a week — the third highest in the United States, behind musicians at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Los Angeles. That salary is set to increase to $3,200 a week by the final year of the contract, which could set a new high for American ensembles, depending on what agreements other orchestras reach in the coming years.The amicable agreement stood in marked contrast to the strife that has marked recent labor negotiations with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra and even the San Francisco Symphony itself, which had a brief strike in 2013. David Gaudry, the chairman of the musicians’ negotiating committee, praised the “respectful and collaborative tone” of the bargaining sessions in a statement.“We would like to express our appreciation to the board and administration for their willingness to take the necessary steps to support our musicians to continue to live and thrive as artists in this beautiful but very expensive city,” Mr. Gaudry said in a statement.The symphony’s president, Sakurako Fisher, said in a statement that the deal “allows the San Francisco Symphony to pursue its most vital mission, to make music of the highest level and reach a broad and diverse audience, and do so from a position of strength.”
