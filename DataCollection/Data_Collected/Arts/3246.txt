The Brookings Institution was founded in 1916 with the mission of becoming “the first private organization devoted to analyzing public policy issues at the national level.” Now, the think tank known for its work on economics, governance and foreign policy (and a steady drip of news releases with titles like “Innovation and manufacturing labor: a value-chain perspective”) will be adding the humanities to its portfolio.Leon Wieseltier, the former longtime literary editor of The New Republic, is joining Brookings as the Isaiah Berlin Senior Fellow in Culture and Policy, where he will focus on “the influence of culture and the humanities on various realms of American life, society and international affairs,” according to a news release.Mr. Wieseltier, the author of the books “Kaddish” and “Nuclear War, Nuclear Peace” (and more than a few broadsides against what he has called “the bacchanal” of digital disruption), left The New Republic in December along with its editor, Franklin Foer, over differences with the magazine’s publisher and new chief executive. Last month he joined The Atlantic as a contributing editor and critic.At Brookings, he said in an email, “the plan is to continue to pursue my various interests and causes in American policy and in American culture, and to straddle the silos, so that perhaps I may play a role in mediating the clash of civilizations between the humanities and the social sciences.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Wieseltier Joins Brookings Institution.
