CreditGuia Besana for The New York Times        PARIS —  A crucial test for the Philharmonie de Paris, the new 2,400-seat concert hall that is now home to the Orchestre de Paris, came last Wednesday with the long-awaited and much-delayed official opening concert. But for the future of this ambitious project and, in a way, the future of classical music, the more revealing tryout came on Saturday. The Philharmonie presented a full day of free concerts, classes and workshops geared toward families in this gleaming and modern, if still unfinished complex, as well as the existing halls in what has become a de facto arts center near the northeast border of Paris.Placing this elaborate new hall on the edge of the Parc de la Villette in the 19th Arrondissement, adjacent to the ring road that separates this enchanting city from its working-class, poorer suburbs, or banlieues, was a bold, some say risky move. The Orchestre de Paris has left the Salle Pleyel, its longtime home in central Paris, to relocate in a hall that the institution hopes will become a magnet for touring ensembles and music-loving audiences.Central to the project is the belief that because of its location this hall will draw new audiences to classical music, including younger people and suburban families. At least on Saturday, a crisp but beautifully clear winter day here, the goal of outreach was definitely realized.Thousands of people, including parents pushing baby strollers, showed up for the concerts and classes. Sadly, given the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, security measures had to be strict. Attendees, including many impressively patient children, stood in long lines waiting to pass through metal detectors. And there were lines not just for extravaganzas, like “101 Pianists With Lang Lang,” a program at the new hall featuring that superstar Chinese pianist and 100 young conservatory pianists, but for formidable programs like the exciting performance by the chorus and children’s chorus of the Orchestre de Paris of Carl Orff’s “Carmina Burana.” That event took place next to the Philharmonie at Cité de la Musique, the inviting, modern 1,000-seat hall that has been operating since the 1990s, now being called Philharmonie 2.AdvertisementHundreds of people eager to hear the Orff performance had to be turned away, though there were many alternative options happening at the same time. During a propulsive episode of this forceful piece, one girl who appeared to be about 3 became so involved that she started clapping and singing along. Her mother had to take her outside to settle her down, though the child’s reaction was encouraging proof of classical music’s allure.AdvertisementAnd there was almost no dumbing down to family audiences. One late-morning concert at Philharmonie 2 presented three brilliant percussionists (Gilles Durot, Samuel Favre and Victor Hanna) from Ensemble Intercontemporain, the acclaimed new-music group in Paris. In a fanciful scenario, the performers were made up to look like eccentric scientists in lab coats who were inventorying strange instruments that seemed to be from an earlier era. As they removed sheets covering various sets of drums, chimes, bells, marimbas and such, they figured out what these things were suited for by playing them. But the works performed included bracing contemporary pieces by Dante Agostini, Toru Takemitsu, Gérard Grisey, Yan Maresz and others.The Philharmonie 1, as the new hall is also known, has a large educational wing with studios and small classrooms, which were the sites of popular interactive programs on Saturday. Many of these were part of the Préparation au Concert, a series that prepares listeners for programs by getting them directly involved with the music to be performed. I dropped in on one focused on various takes on “Roméo et Juliette,” ranging from Prokofiev’s ballet score to Bernstein’s “West Side Story.” The participants were taught to sing tunes from opera and ballet versions. The best part, and not just for the children, was when Latin American instruments were passed out for a mambo jam session right out of “West Side Story.”Of course, these events were free. The family weekend activities that the Philharmonie will continue this season, though not free, look very affordable. For example, that “Roméo et Juliette” family concert, to be repeated in February in the Grand Salle, the main hall of Philharmonie 1, will cost 10 euros (about $11.50) for adults, eight euros (about $9.25) for children. Also, there was understandable curiosity about seeing the complex for this first free weekend.

After Wednesday night’s substantive opening concert by the Orchestre de Paris, under its music director, Paavo Jarvi, for which I sat in the floor-level parterre section, I experienced the hall on Friday night from a center seat in one of the floating balconies. The program featured French Baroque music performed by Les Arts Florissants, the acclaimed early-music ensemble, conducted by its founding director, William Christie. The ensemble intends to be a significant presence at the complex. Mr. Christie has high expectations that this main hall, a modular space that can be shaped to order for the programs, including semi-staged operas, will have ideal acoustics for Baroque music.For this occasion, the ensemble played Marc-Antoine Charpentier’s rousing and elegant “Te Deum”; Jean-Joseph Cassanéa de Mondonville’s “In exitu Israel,” a seldom-heard, strikingly inventive motet; and “Les Sauvages,” the extraordinary final act from Rameau’s charming, musically ravishing opera-ballet “Indes galantes,” music that Mr. Christie and his ensemble perform with unrivaled insight and vitality, as they did on this night.The architect Jean Nouvel, who snubbed the opening night, saying that his hall was just not ready, has worked with Marshall Day Acoustics and Ducks Scéno consultants, to create a space in which the sound would envelop, not overwhelm the audience. That was my reaction on both nights from both seats. The sound of the solo singers, the chorus and instrumental ensemble of Les Arts Florissants came through on Friday with clarity, presence and bloom. The balances were not quite right, though. During the Charpentier, outbursts from three eager Baroque percussionists tended to cover the strings. The hall can be tweaked acoustically by shifting panels and platforms. (For rock, jazz and other nonclassical music, the hall has a built-in electronic system.) So, in time, the Philharmonie may get the balances and other acoustical matters right.Attempting to draw new audiences to classical music is a primary goal of the Philharmonie. Nothing is more essential to a field in the midst of longstanding challenges. But the institution also hopes older patrons and those who found the traditional Salle Pleyel inviting and convenient, will make their way to this arts center, in a park that includes the Paris Conservatoire, a music museum and an established theater. The Metro here sets a standard for urban subway systems: It’s easy to use and remarkably quiet; trains come frequently and go everywhere. There is a stop right near the Parc de la Villette.Still, it is a considerable walk across a big, mostly cobblestone plaza from the Metro stop to the new hall. And in the balconies of the Grand Salle, where I sat, there are no handrails on the stairs, which suggests that the needs of the over-60s set were not taken fully into account.But you can only salute the Philharmonie for branching out by building this potentially important hall on the edge of the city. If this risky venture thrives, it could establish a new template for outreach in classical music. To succeed, the traditional audience base has to be willing to travel a little and newcomers to classical music have to give the art form a chance.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Paris, a New Music Hub Hums.
