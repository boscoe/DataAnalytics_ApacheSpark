WARSAW – A Polish judge said Friday that he had asked American officials for more documents to back up their request to extradite the filmmaker Roman Polanski to the United States.Mr. Polanski, 81, who lives in France, did not appear in the regional court in Krakow, a city where this month he was given one of Poland’s top film awards. The Polish-born director, wanted by the American authorities over a 1977 child sex conviction, was represented by his lawyers.On Friday, Judge Dariusz Mazur, who presides over the case, watched a 2008 documentary by Marina Zenovich, “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” that examines the trial that started in 1977 and led Mr. Polanski to flee the United States one year later, starting his 37-year-long battle to avoid extradition.“This documentary shows how people involved in that trial remember it,” Jerzy Stachowicz, one of Mr. Polanski’s lawyers, said. “This film proves that the extradition request is groundless as, back in 1977, the plea bargain was already struck and Mr. Polanski served his sentence.”United States officials have until Aug. 8 to reply to the request for more documentation. Mr. Stachowicz said that the next hearing would probably be set for early September.Then, he added, it was possible — though not very likely — that the judge might call Mr. Polanski’s victim, Samantha Geimer, for questioning as she and her attorney have said they would be willing to come to Krakow to testify.The Oscar-winning filmmaker, who previously said that he expected Poland to refuse to extradite him, is currently in Poland preparing to start production of a new film about the Dreyfus Affair.
