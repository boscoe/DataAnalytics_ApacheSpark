Last Wednesday the tenor Michael Fabiano stepped in for an indisposed Joseph Calleja as Edgardo in “Lucia di Lammermoor” at the Metropolitan Opera, a whirlwind substitution that began at 1 p.m. when he got the call while running errands in Philadelphia. On Saturday night at the Met the baritone Luca Salsi pulled off a similarly impressive feat — subbing for Placido Domingo in the “Ernani” matinee and then singing Enrico in the evening performance of “Lucia di Lammermoor,” becoming one of only a few artists to sing two leading roles in one day. (Marcello Giordani was among the handful of artists to do a doubleheader recently: performing Pinkerton in “Madame Butterfly” and the title role in Berlioz’s “Damnation de Faust.”) It was a day of last-minute substitutions on Saturday. Mr. Calleja’s understudy, Salvatore Cordella, wasn’t called during the cancellation on Wednesday, but he had a chance to go on Saturday after Act 1, during which the usually luminous Mr. Calleja sounded raspy. (It was announced after the first intermission that Mr. Calleja was still recovering from the effects of his cold and medications.) But wait, there’s more: After an unusually long second intermission Gary Dietrich, the stage manager, announced that the young tenor Ben Bliss had stepped in during Act II for Matthew Plenk, initially scheduled to sing the role of Arturo. Mr. Plenk was stuck in traffic on the West Side Highway because of two car accidents.
