Players in the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, from London, are pioneers, considering themselves less an early music group than a chamber orchestra that just happens to play with historical instruments. At their most ambitious, they have explored Wagner’s operas and French Impressionism. Led by Adam Fischer, their formidable concert at Alice Tully Hall on Saturday focused on canonical works that, to them, are effectively new music: Smetana’s fizzy overture to “The Bartered Bride,” Brahms’s Violin Concerto and Dvorak’s Ninth Symphony.The differences between today’s symphony orchestras and those of Dvorak’s vintage are slight. The strings used by the ensemble are not metal but gut, which has significant implications for how the players shape notes and sketch phrases. The woodwinds are mellower, the brass less reliable, but therefore more striking at their best.Instruments mean only as much as what an orchestra does with them, though, and the orchestra was in strong, sophisticated form. The Dvorak was flexible and often fiery, notable for how the historical flutes of Lisa Beznosiuk and Neil McLaren pointed anew to the folk origins of the composer’s material. In the Brahms, the soloist Viktoria Mullova’s work was nuanced but tentative, as if she were still thinking through period performance’s implications. Still, the orchestra’s strings achieved an unusually broad palette by treating vibrato neither as the default nor something to avoid, but as an expressive tool like any other. Advertisement
