PARIS – A court in the town of Grasse in southern France on Friday found a retired electrician and his wife guilty of possessing 271 stolen works by Pablo Picasso, rejecting the couple’s claims that the trove of art was a gift from the artist’s wife.Pierre Le Guennec, 75, who was employed by Picasso in his home in nearby Mougins, and Le Guennec’s wife, Danielle, 72, were handed a suspended two-year jail sentence on a count of possessing stolen goods.The court also stipulated that the works be returned to the artist’s heirs. But it did not establish who had stolen the collection of sketches, watercolors and collages that have been dated to a period ranging from 1900 to 1932.While the collection has not been officially valued, reports in the French and international press have estimated that it could be worth as much as 120 million euros, or about $130 million.Jean-Jacques Neuer, the lawyer for Claude Ruiz-Picasso, one of the artist’s sons and the administrator of the Picasso estate, said that the six Picasso heirs represented in the suit were satisfied with the ruling.Evelyne Rees, a  lawyer for the Le Guennecs, could not be reached to comment on whether her clients intended to appeal the conviction.They have always maintained that the art was a gift from Jacqueline Picasso, with her husband’s consent, in the early 1970s, when Mr. Le Guennec worked at Picasso’s home.Mr. and Mrs. Le Guennec, both of whom took the stand at the trial, said that the works then sat untouched in a box in the garage of their home in the small town of Mouans-Sartoux for nearly 40 years. They say they decided to have them authenticated after Mr. Le Guennec was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2008 and started worrying about his children’s inheritance.They took the collection to Paris in 2010 for examination by Mr. Ruiz-Picasso, who quickly recognized its authenticity and, suspecting theft, brought a suit against them that led to a formal investigation.
