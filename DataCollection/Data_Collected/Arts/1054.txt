They were the central couple backed up by a rousing ensemble: Jean Butler, a poised redhead, and Michael Flatley, a flamboyant blond in a shiny teal blouse who would later become the self-proclaimed Lord of the Dance. Together, they created and starred in “Riverdance,” the international megahit spawned by that TV appearance.Two decades later, both are in New York, albeit on very different stages. Mr. Flatley recently arrived on Broadway with the extravagant “Lord of the Dance: Dangerous Games,” part of his farewell tour (through Jan. 3). Starting Tuesday, Ms. Butler appears downtown in “This Is an Irish Dance,” a duet with the cellist Neil Martin. For the past decade Ms. Butler has been skillfully stripping away at the spectacle that Irish dance has become, revealing wit and quiet drama. Fittingly, her show’s title is humble and direct — and it’s performed in a church, as if atoning for the excesses of the Lord uptown. (Through Saturday, at 8 p.m., St. Mark’s Church, danspaceproject.org.)Advertisement
