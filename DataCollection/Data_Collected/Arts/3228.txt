“The Plains Indians: Artists of the Earth and Sky,” one of the greatest exhibitions of American Indian art you may ever see, opens Monday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The show was originated by the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (where I saw it) in Kansas City, Mo., and organized by the inestimable Gaylord Torrence, the Nelson-Atkins’s curator in the field and also the orchestrator of its acclaimed permanent collection galleries.With rarely seen loans from Europe and much new research, it casts light on the native arts from the American midcontinent like that already lavished on those of the Northwest and Southwest. Its 154 objects range from ancient times to now. Among the most ravishing are carved-wood figures and pipe bowls and especially all things involving painted, beaded or otherwise decorated animal hide: tobacco bags, parfleche envelopes, cradle boards, headdresses, shields and most breathtaking of all, the painted bison robes. (Through May 10, metmuseum.org.)A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2015, on Page AR10 of the New York edition with the headline: Art: Ravishing Works Too Rarely Seen.
