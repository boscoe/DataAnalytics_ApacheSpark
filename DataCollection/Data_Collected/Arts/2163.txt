Snowden asked to help make public classified information about domestic surveillance that he downloaded in his job as an analyst for the National Security Agency. “Citizenfour,” her film about him, was released last fall. Along with three shorter pieces, this exhibition presents two absorbing feature-length documentaries that she made before she became involved with Mr. Snowden. Each portrays an individual at the intersection of historical events in the Middle East.The subject of “My Country, My Country” (2006) is Riyadh al-Adhadh, a Sunni doctor who is running for a seat on the Baghdad Provincial Council in the months preceding Iraq’s first post-9/11 elections in 2005. At a leisurely pace, the camera follows the doctor, a reserved, benevolent, middle-aged man, as he sees patients, campaigns for office and relaxes with his remarkably congenial wife and six children in their comfortable home. In interspersed scenes, United States and United Nations officials and private security contractors prepare for the elections.“The Oath” (2010) focuses on a very different sort of character — a handsome, possibly unreliable charmer who adopted the name Abu Jandal. He was one of Osama bin Laden’s bodyguards in the 1990s. Arrested in Yemen in February 2001, he divulged much useful information, including the name of his brother-in-law, Salim Hamdan, who had been a driver for Bin Laden and, after his arrest in November 2001, spent six years in the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Abu Jandal was driving a taxi in Yemen when Ms. Poitras found him.Neither of these films strongly asserts a particular political agenda. They’re richly complicated. Both are beautifully wrought examples of the art of documentary portraiture.Artists Space 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, SoHoThrough Feb. 15 Advertisement
