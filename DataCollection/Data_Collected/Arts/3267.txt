Hamilton Jr., the school’s chairman, said in a statement that Ms. Campbell had been “instrumental” in the organization’s turnaround.“Yvette has not only restored the philanthropic community’s faith in our school, she has increased our enrollment and expanded access to the highest quality arts training in New York City,” he said. The board is currently conducting a national search to replace Ms. Campbell.The school annually serves nearly 4,000 young people from across the greater New York metropolitan area at its center in Harlem, and through its arts education programs in the city’s public and charter schools and community centers.A version of this article appears in print on 03/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: President Is Leaving Harlem School of the Arts.
