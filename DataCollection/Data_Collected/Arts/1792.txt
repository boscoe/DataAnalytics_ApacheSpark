A busy summer and fall on Broadway appear to have produced three new musical hits, a hopeful sign for a glamorous but failure-rich industry often dominated by long-running war horses.According to figures released by the Broadway League for the week ending Dec. 20, “School of Rock,” an adaptation of the Jack Black film, looks to be riding strong reviews and nostalgic fondness for the story to box office success. The show, which opened earlier this month, grossed $1,023,108 last week, up $66,290 from the week before.It joins the hip-hop history lesson “Hamilton,” which grossed $1,658,598 last week and is the season’s obvious smash, and “On Your Feet!,”  a jukebox show featuring the music of Gloria and Emilio Estefan, which has consistently drawn large audiences at healthy ticket prices. That musical grossed $1,225,820 last week. The three shows are among five new musicals to have opened thus far this season. “Amazing Grace” flopped at the box office and closed;  “Allegiance” is struggling, bringing in only $342,171 last week, its lowest showing since opening.With all of the fall season’s shows now open (the last, a revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” opened Sunday night), Broadway is running slightly behind last year’s record performance, as measured both in grosses and in audience. That is despite an increase in the number of productions: overall, 22 musicals, plays, and special events have opened in Broadway theaters since the start of the season in May; by comparison, just 17 productions opened during the same period last year.Among new plays, two star vehicles — “China Doll,” with Al Pacino, and “Misery,” with Bruce Willis —  continue to  outperform financially the much-better-reviewed “King Charles III” and “A View From the Bridge.”Last week’s top-grossing shows were “The Lion King,” “Wicked” and “Aladdin,” all  family-friendly musicals that are likely to do especially well over the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, benefiting from school vacations and heavy tourism in New York.A version of this article appears in print on 12/23/2015, on page C6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018School of Rocku2019 Rocks at Box Office.
