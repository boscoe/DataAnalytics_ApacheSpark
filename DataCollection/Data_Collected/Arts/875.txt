Looking for something fun? You’re in luck. We can help.This weekend is lousy with options.There are so many good choices, in fact, that our editors’ best efforts could only narrow things down.So here’s a range of things to check out, “Choose Your Own Adventure”-style.A) A charming indie film?See “Brooklyn,” which our critic A. O. Scott says is “both sharply observed and gently nostalgic.”B) A surefire award contender?Head for “Spotlight,” which Mr. Scott describes as “a gripping detective story and a superlative newsroom drama.”AdvertisementC) Some simple fun?You already bought tickets to “Spectre,” didn’t you? Enjoy. And check out Manohla Dargis’s review.AdvertisementA) Trump?That candidate will host “Saturday Night Live,” but not without protest. Teaser videos are here.B) Non-Trump?According to our critic James Poniewozik, the candidate does not appear in Aziz Ansari’s new Netflix series, “Master of None.” (A not-safe-for-work trailer is here.)A) Un-Dead?Ellie Goulding looks to the non-E.D.M. future on her new album, “Delirium,” coming Friday.B) Dead?Get on up to the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, N.Y., for three nights of Phil Lesh & Friends.A) A newly opened show?Hit the Torres-García show at MoMA. “Few artists can claim to have captured a revolution in thinking in a single image, but Joaquín Torres-García did,” our critic Holland Cotter wrote.B) A soon-to-close show?Our critic Roberta Smith called the Met’s exhibition of George Stubbs paintings a “rare and thrilling treat.” See for yourself before it closes on Sunday.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
