The culture of Tunisia will be on display once again at the French Institute Alliance Française’s World Nomads festival, coming to New York from May 8 to 10. The biennial festival, which in 2011 presented artists inspired by the Arab Spring, will feature the singer Sonia M’Barek, the musician Bassam Saba, and the filmmaker Nejib Belkadhi. Mr. Belkadhi’s “7 ½,” a documentary on Tunisia’s transition from the fall of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali’s regime through the country’s first democratic elections, will receive its United States premiere on May 9. On the same day, a panel will celebrate the work of the France-based Tunisian poet Abdelwahab Meddeb.Ms. M’Barek will perform with Mr. Saba and the qanun player Slim Jaziri on May 8. Covering the festival for The Times in 2013, Jon Pareles praised Ms. M’Barek for her “delicacy and strength, with mourning and determination, with intricate ornament and open passion.” Additional information can be found at fiaf.org.
