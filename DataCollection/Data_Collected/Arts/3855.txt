Shakespeare in the Parking Lot has found a new home. The 20-year-old troupe, which was displaced from its Lower East Side locale at the intersection of Ludlow and Broome Streets last year, is moving three blocks away to a parking lot behind the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center.The troupe will inaugurate the new Norfolk Street lot this summer with two shows: “As You Like It,” from July 9 to 26, and “Macbeth,” from July 30 to August 15.The parking-lot productions, presented by The Drilling Company, which also stages shows indoors, have drawn a considerable and diverse audience over the past two decades.After the old lot was closed for redevelopment last year, the Drilling Company conducted a nine-month search for a new venue.“Is there a parking lot left in Manhattan? It seemed improbable,” Hamilton Clancy, the company’s artistic director, said in a phone interview. The new location was found by chance as Mr. Clancy and a colleague walked around the neighborhood.“We’re committed to the Lower East Side, because that’s where the heart of our audience was,” Mr. Clancy said.
