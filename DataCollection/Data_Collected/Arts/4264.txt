The itinerary includes a return to New York, for a conversation with Samantha Bee, the comedian and “Daily Show” correspondent; a stop in Doylestown, Pa., where the novelist Meg Wolitzer will interview her; and one in San Francisco, where she will take the stage with Molly Ringwald.Ms. Blume, who spent five years working on “In the Unlikely Event,” said she was eager to talk to readers about the book, which chronicles events that Ms. Blume, 77, lived through as a girl growing up in Elizabeth.
