A camp musical inspired by 1970s disaster films may not give “Hamilton” a run for its money at the Tony Awards next year. But like Shelley Winters plunging in the waters to save Gene Hackman in “The Poseidon Adventure,” it’s sure going to try.After two productions in New York, “Disaster!,” with a book by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick, announced on Thursday that it would start performances at the Nederlander Theater on Feb. 9 and officially open on March 8. Featuring a collection of hit songs from the 1970’s, including “Hot Stuff” and “Knock on Wood,” the parody-with-bell-bottoms is set aboard a doomed floating casino-nightclub that’s hit by an earthquake, a tidal wave and a swarm of bees. The starry cast will include the Tony Award winners Roger Bart and Faith Prince and the Tony nominees Kerry Butler, Kevin Chamberlin and Adam Pascal. Rounding out the cast — disaster films had lots of characters in peril — are Rachel York, Lacretta Nicole, Jennifer Simard, Max Crumm and Mr. Rudetsky. Mr. Plotnick will return as director.“Disaster!” had its premiere in a three-month Off Off Broadway run at the Triad Theater in 2012. In the fall of 2013 it moved to Off Broadway at the St. Luke’s Theater, where it played for six months. In his review of that production, Charles Isherwood called it a “self-consciously ditsy show” that “really earns that exclamation point.”A version of this article appears in print on 11/06/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Disaster!u2019 Musical Coming to Broadway.
