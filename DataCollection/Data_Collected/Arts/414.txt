Top dog, underdog: Jay-Z knows a thing or two about juggling those identities, which might help explain the evolving image of Tidal, his music-streaming service. Having recently passed a million users, the company makes a putative show of its strength with “Tidal X: 1020,” a concert at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Tuesday, Oct. 20. By and large, it’s a hip-hop bill, with appearances by Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Meek Mill, T.I., Fabolous, Lil Wayne and Travis Scott. But there’s also room for stars rooted in pop (Nick Jonas), R&B (Usher), country (Thomas Rhett) and reggae (Damian Marley) — and for breakout voices like Alessia Cara. Also scheduled to perform is Beyoncé, Jay-Z’s partner by marriage as well as corporate ownership. The concert, at 8 p.m., is sold out, with all proceeds going toward nonprofits that focus on social justice. It will be broadcast live at tidal.com — giving anyone the chance to decide whether the show feels more like a victory lap, a bid for respect or a full-on spectacle.A version of this article appears in print on October 18, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Pop; Plenty of Company for Tidal Concert  .
