With Calder mobiles selling for three times their estimates and a Warhol “Flowers” painting left unsold, Tuesday night’s auction of postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s New York only deepened uncertainty about the art market.“It was a strange sale,” said the Los Angeles collector Eli Broad. “Very mixed.”Tuesday’s auction came on the heels of Christie’s $491.4 million “Artist’s Muse” sale of cherry-picked works from the last 100 years. The total for Tuesday was $331.8 million from 66 lots, of which 13 went unsold and 14 were guaranteed by the auction house or a third party.The company’s equivalent sale in May did significantly better, netting $658.5 million from 82 lots, 49 of which were guaranteed.It was bound to be tough to match the excitement generated Monday by Christie’s $170.4 million sale of the sultry Modigliani nude, “Nu Couché,” to the Chinese billionaire collector Liu Yiqian.AdvertisementBut some pieces Tuesday exceeded expectations, like a Louise Bourgeois 1997 bronze spider, stretching almost 13 feet high, which sold for $28.2 million, a new high price for the artist at auction.AdvertisementA yellow Lucio Fontana “Concetto Spaziale, La Fine di Dio” canvas sold for $29.2 million with fees, exemplifying why certain wealthy individuals continue to take contemporary art seriously as an “asset class.”These punctured, egg-shaped canvases are deemed by collectors the most desirable of the Italian conceptual artist’s works and this example sold to a telephone bidder, against a minimum estimate of $25 million.The seller of the Fontana is the billionaire hedge fund manager, Steven A. Cohen, who acquired the work privately in 2012 for about $16 million.Given that presale guarantees are based on price with fees, Mr. Cohen would have made about $10 million on the painting in three years. The price was a new auction high for the artist.While Tuesday night showed that big-ticket items continue to garner the biggest prices, it also showed that the material comprising the bulk of auction sales is proving increasingly unpredictable. Four of six Warhols failed to sell, as did a Jean Dubuffet owned in part by Christie’s estimated at $9 million to $12 million. And a Jeff Koons “Balloon Swan” fell short of the low estimate of $15 million (at $14.7 million with fees).“There’s plenty of money around at the very top of the market, and these people all want the same things,” said Heinrich zu Hohenlohe, director of the Berlin branch of the art dealership, Dickinson. “The middle range is softer — if you can call $10 million the middle range. The market is a bit more nervous than it was. You can’t overestimate things that aren’t top quality.”Andy Warhol’s 1962 silk-screen “Four Marilyns” was re-offered with an estimate of $40 million to $60 million, having been sold at auction just two years earlier. After minimal competition, it went to an Asian bidder for $36 million with fees.AdvertisementAs the seller would have been guaranteed a premium-inclusive sum in the region of $44 million to $45 million, the auction house took a loss of about $8 million.The Warhol came to Christie’s from the Turkish collector Kemal Has Cingillioglu, who bought it for $44 million some eight months ago from the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Mr. Fridman had in turn acquired the work at Phillips in 2013 for $38.2 million.
                Art auctions can be unpredictable. See how you match up in this interactive quiz.            “It was a fantastic buy tonight for the buyer,” Brett Gorvy, Christie’s worldwide chairman of postwar and contemporary art, said of the “Marilyns,” admitting that the Warhols generally did not perform “as well as we’d hoped.”Christie’s had reason to be concerned about how certain lots would sell Tuesday night, given some unpleasant surprises in its sale the night before. Would Lucian Freud’s “Brigadier” — a portrait of Camilla Parker Bowles’s ex-husband, Andrew Parker Bowles — make its $30 million estimate, given that the artist’s portrait of his naked grown daughter — estimated at $20 million to $30 million — failed to sell on Monday? (It went for $34.9 million with fees Tuesday.)Would de Kooning’s 1977 “Porch in a Landscape” sell when his “Woman” had not on Monday? (It did not.)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

All seven sculptures sold for well above the estimate. The total for the nine lots in the Kahn collection was $47 million with fees.“Calder was the big winner tonight,” said the dealer Helly Nahmad, whose family bought the sculptor’s “Bullfight” mobile for $4.6 million, with the buyer’s premium.Because of an editing error, an article in some editions on Wednesday about an auction at Christie’s in New York misidentified the subject of a Lucian Freud painting that was sold, “Brigadier.” He is the former husband of Camilla Parker Bowles, Andrew Parker Bowles, not her father.A version of this article appears in print on November 11, 2015, on Page A26 of the New York edition with the headline: Mixed Night at Christie’s Brings In $331.8 Million .
