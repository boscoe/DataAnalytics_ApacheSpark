Jazz & Colors, which has twice presented a bounty of jazz ensembles at picturesque locations all over Central Park, will return this year. But the festival is moving indoors — to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, according to an announcement scheduled to be made today. “Jazz & Colors: The Masterworks Edition,” as it’s being called, will be held on Friday, Jan. 30, with sets at 6 and 7:30 p.m. It will be free with museum admission.Established by Peter Shapiro, the owner of Brooklyn Bowl and the Capitol Theater, Jazz & Colors had its inaugural edition in 2012, running into a few logistical hurdles but earning enough goodwill to repeat the whole production the following year.As in those previous editions, Mr. Shapiro has solicited the programming savvy of Brice Rosenbloom, who books Le Poisson Rouge and the Winter Jazzfest. This time around, Mr. Rosenbloom worked with Limor Tomer, who as general manager of concerts and lectures at the Met has been responsible for some innovative programming, including a marathon museum takeover by the composer and saxophonist John Zorn, in 2013.The new Jazz & Colors lineup will be smaller — a dozen groups instead of 30 — and the experience will surely be a little less freeform. But there are opportunities presented by the museum’s celebrated collection, and the assigned set lists, to be played simultaneously by all 12 ensembles, will probably bear some relationship to the setting.While the roster is still being finalized, confirmed artists include the clarinetist Don Byron, the trumpeter Amir ElSaffar, the saxophonists Lakecia Benjamin and Avram Fefer, the bassists Ben Williams and Linda Oh, and the percussionists Mino Cinelu and Allison Miller. The Cellar and Point, a contemporary chamber-jazz ensemble, will also perform.
