A Pittsburgh woman has sued Bill Cosby contending that he and his representatives branded her a liar after she accused the entertainer in November of sexual misconduct.In the suit filed Wednesday in Pennsylvania, Renita Hill accuses Mr. Cosby of abusing her, beginning in the early 1980s when she was a minor, and says he later defamed her when he and his representatives, including his wife, denied the accusations of other women who had come forward.  Mr. Cosby, who has been accused by dozens of women of sexual assault, is facing two other defamation suits filed by women, in Massachusetts and California. In her suit Ms. Hill says she met Mr. Cosby in about 1983, when she was 16, and that he portrayed himself as a mentor after they worked together on “Picture Pages,” a children’s television program. She claims in the suit that Mr. Cosby flew her around the country to meet him and then plied her with alcoholic drinks. “On the majority of these occasions,” according to the suit, “upon imbibing the drinks, Renita would lose consciousness and wake up in her room the next day, oftentimes nude, disheveled, confused and disoriented.”Fresh accusations against Mr. Cosby have been surfacing since July, when parts of a deposition he gave in a separate 2005 case showed him acknowledging that he had pursued women for sex and obtained powerful sedatives to give them as a party drug. “The circumstances surrounding the conduct are by now all too familiar,” Ms. Hill’s lawyer, George M. Kontos, said in an interview Thursday.Mr. Cosby has denied all wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. Andrew Wyatt, Mr. Cosby’s spokesman, declined to comment.In addition to the defamation cases, Mr. Cosby is facing two other lawsuits accusing him of misconduct, both filed in California by women who say Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted them.
