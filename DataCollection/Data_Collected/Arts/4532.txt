CreditNicole Fara Silver for The New York Times        For about six years, the GHE20G0TH1K party has been one of New York’s most essential and least predictable night-life institutions. These semiregular shows have captured and disseminated a fantastical world where dance floor-based musical subcultures from underrepresented communities — juke, ballroom house, dark hip-hop, and much more — could coexist, making for a coalition of the overlooked.The parties were founded by, among others, the D.J. and producer Venus X, one of the city’s great cultural forces. In an interview with Complex magazine last month, she described GHE20G0TH1K as a place where she could “not necessarily feel emotional, but angry” — in other words, as a safe space for the body and the heart.But in the age of the Internet, it’s hard to keep things intimate, and to maintain possession of them. At one point a couple of years ago, Rihanna began using the term “ghetto goth,” leading to a small dust-up and conversations about who, if anyone, can own an idea once it has been released into the world.Maybe that’s why the GHE20G0TH1K party on Saturday night was advertised as the final one. It was part of a monthlong series of shows by the Red Bull Music Academy that market the energy drink under the auspices of injecting genuine vitality and intelligence into New York night life.AdvertisementThis year, especially, the Red Bull Music Academy has made the city’s night-life margins central to its mission. The party on Saturday took place at the Brooklyn Night Bazaar, a cavernous space in Williamsburg that provides a reasonable facsimile of the warehouse parties of old. It was highlighted by Venus X’s D.J. set with Asma of Nguzunguzu; a set of ballroom house spun by the D.J. and producer MikeQ, in part a soundtrack to a vogue battle; and what was billed as the first New York performance by Sissy Nobby, the feisty gay bounce rapper from New Orleans.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Asma and Venus X’s set included, among other things, raunchy female hip-hop, some juke, a flicker of calypso, and a Jersey club mix of Fetty Wap’s “Trap Queen,” the unlikely hip-hop crossover song of the year. Sissy Nobby’s set was vintage New Orleans bounce music: bawdy chants aimed at gyrating dancers over tinny syncopations. In this context, the relentless optimism of bounce music was a bit of an outlier, but it was an effective bridge to MikeQ’s ecstatic ballroom house: limber, pulsing music designed as a soundtrack for limber, pulsing dancers.On one hand, this night resulted from the seemingly inevitable collision of spectacular subculture and corporate sponsorship — it was a touch odd seeing vogue dancers battle it out under the Red Bull logo of two bulls squaring off against each other. But the crowd was a familiar GHE20G0TH1K mix. And politics, which are often implicit in this scene, were sometimes explicit: Early in the night, Total Freedom wove into his D.J. set audio of Marilyn Mosby, the Maryland state’s attorney for Baltimore City, announcing charges against six police officers in the arrest and fatal injury of Freddie Gray.AdvertisementThere was at least one compromise made, though: GHE20G0TH1K was not the sort of party to end early, but this edition had boundaries. Just after 2 a.m., the lights came on. The voguers scattered out into the crowd, and the crowd scattered out onto the street, no one quite sure if it was really the end.A version of this review appears in print on May 4, 2015, on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: A Corporate Yet Subversive Party Says It’s Flicking on the Lights.
