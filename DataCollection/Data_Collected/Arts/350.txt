Thelma Golden, the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem, has been selected the winner of the 2016 Audrey Irmas Award for Curatorial Excellence.“Thelma today may be thought of as part of the system but she still is a gritty, independent voice raising many issues broader in society from the art world,” said Tom Eccles, the executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College who polled more than 100 colleagues and former students for nominees and oversaw a panel of 12 making the final deliberation. “Many of my students in the graduate program are thinking about the work of Thelma Golden and asking to look at the 1993 Whitney Biennial and ‘Black Male’ and the kinds of issues she’s brought up at the Studio Museum.”Ms. Golden started her career at the Studio Museum in 1987, spent a decade at the Whitney Museum, and returned to the Harlem institution in 2000 as deputy director. She has led the Studio Museum since 2005. Earlier this year she announced plans for a new building designed by David Adjaye. “Maintaining a vision and a commitment over a long time to an institution that’s not glamorous or wealthy,” Mr. Eccles said, was also a consideration of the panel.Previous winners of the 19-year-old award include Marcia Tucker (1999), Kynaston McShine (2003) and Lucy Lippard (2010). The award comes with a no-strings-attached $25,000 prize. A version of this article appears in print on 10/17/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Studio Museum Curator Wins Irmas Award.
