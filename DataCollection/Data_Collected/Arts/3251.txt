The musician Jack White portrayed Elvis Presley in “Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” in 2007. Now, he’s bringing Elvis back to life in another way: by releasing Elvis’s first-ever recording on Third Man Records, Mr. White’s label, after paying $300,000 for the acetate disc. Billboard reported that Mr. White was the anonymous bidder who bought the 1953 recording at a Graceland auction this January. The record features two covers of ballads, “My Happiness” and “That’s Where Your Heartaches Begin,” and was recorded by an 18-year-old Presley in Memphis three years before his breakout single, “Heartbreak Hotel.” Third Man Records will release the recording on April 18, Record Store Day, as a 10-inch, 78-r.p.m. facsimile. Mr. White has broken a few vinyl-related records recently. On Record Store Day last year, he set the world’s fastest time (3 hours, 55 minutes and 21 seconds) for recording, pressing and releasing a vinyl disc, and his 2014 album, “Lazaretto,” is the biggest-selling vinyl album since 1994.A version of this brief appears in print on March 9, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Jack White to Release Elvis’s First Recording.
