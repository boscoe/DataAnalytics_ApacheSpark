Four hundred years after his death Shakespeare is getting a national book tour. The Folger Shakespeare Library throughout 2016 will be sending copies of the First Folio to libraries, museums and other places in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as part of its yearlong “Wonder of Will” initiative.The places, which range from the Alaska State Libraries, Archives and Museums in Juneau to the Portland Public Library in Maine, were chosen from many applicants based on their ideas for public programming and ability to provide the necessary security during the four-week display period. At each site the book will be opened to the page from “Hamlet” that includes the soliloquy beginning “To be or not to be.” The exhibition was organized with the American Library Association and the Cincinnati Museum Center.The First Folio, printed in 1623 in what scholars estimate was an edition of 750 copies, was the first published collection of Shakespeare’s plays, for which no manuscripts survive. Last year a previously unknown copy was discovered in a small library in northern France, bringing the tally of surviving copies to 233. The Folger owns 82 copies, of which 18 will travel as part of the exhibition.
