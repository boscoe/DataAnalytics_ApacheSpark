Matthew Morrison, the star of “Finding Neverland,” is leaving the Broadway musical next month.Mr. Morrison, who plays J.M. Barrie, the British playwright who wrote “Peter Pan,” has been with the show since it began previews in March. His contract is expiring; the show has not yet announced a replacement.Best known for his portrayal of the teacher Will Schuester on “Glee,” Mr. Morrison got his break on Broadway, earning a 2005 Tony Award nomination for his work in “The Light in the Piazza.” He is departing “Finding Neverland” on Jan. 24, just five days after Kelsey Grammer, an actor famed for his role in “Cheers,” returns to the cast in a dual role, as Captain Hook and the theater producer Charles Frohman.“Finding Neverland,” based on a 2004 film of the same name, is about how Mr. Barrie was inspired to write “Peter Pan.” The musical features a book by James Graham and music and lyrics by Gary Barlow and Eliot Kennedy. The show started strong at the box office, grossing more than $1 million a week through much of the spring and summer, but dipped during the fall, ​to a low of $652,542 during the week that ended Nov. 1 — a bad week for most shows on Broadway. It has since rebounded somewhat; the show topped $1 million again during Thanksgiving week, and grossed $867,467 last week.A version of this article appears in print on 12/10/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Finding a New Star: Morrison Is Leaving u2018Neverlandu2019.
