LONDON — The four known extant copies of the original Magna Carta – often cited as England’s first cautious step toward  individual rights — will unite at the British Library in London this week for the first time in their 800-year history.England’s King John signed Magna Carta in 1215 after rebellious barons seized the Tower of London, threatening his power. Under siege at home and abroad, John put his name to a document which handed over significant powers to the barons. A number of copies stamped with the official royal seal were then drawn up and distributed across England.John largely ignored the document’s tenets after writing, fighting mightily with his barons until a bout of dysentery knocked him dead in 1216. Still, the document is regarded as one of modern England’s most important political manifestos, in particular for a section that declares the king a subject to English law like any other citizen.After a private celebration at the British Library on Monday, 1,215 lottery winners will have the chance to view the documents on Tuesday. On Wednesday, academics from across the world will descend on London to analyze the copies side by side, and on Thursday the four versions will make an appearance at the House of Lords in Westminster.Two of the existing copies belong to the British Library and are permanently held in London. The others traveled from Lincoln Cathedral, in the country’s midlands, and Salisbury Cathedral, two hours southwest of London, for the occasion. Each institution is hosting a major exhibition when the documents return.
