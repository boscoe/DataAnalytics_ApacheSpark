Globalfest has announced the lineup for its 13th annual concert, which will feature performers from Mexico, Ethiopia and Haiti and be held at Webster Hall on Jan. 17. Last year, Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that the festival was “full of fusions both geographical and temporal: local and far-flung, old and new.” He continued, “What fortified nearly every performance was the sense that the music still comes from some place like home.”Next year’s edition will likewise showcase an intriguing mix of artists devoted to cultural exchange and preservation. The singer Astrid Hadad brings vibrant cabaret and subversive performance art from Mexico City. Fendika, an ensemble led by the exuberant dancer Melaku Belay, mixes traditional music and dance from Ethiopia. And Debauche reroutes Russian punk through New Orleans. Lakou Mizik from Haiti, Mariana Sadovska, from Ukraine, and Tribu Baharú, from Colombia, will also perform, as well as Ginkgoa (France), Ironing Board Sam (United States), Somi (United States), Stelios Petrakis Quartet (Greece) and the Dhol Foundation (Britain).More information is on Globalfest’s website. Update: November 2, 2015
Music Maker Blues Revue and Simon Shaheen’s Zafir have been added to the lineup. Ironing Board Sam can no longer perform due to health concerns. A version of this article appears in print on 10/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Globalfest Lineup Is Announced.
