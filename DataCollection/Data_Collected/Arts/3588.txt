New Yiddish Rep will bring an updated Yiddish production of Arthur Miller’s “Death of a Salesman” to New York this October. The production play at the Castillo Theater for seven weeks and aims to uncover the play’s cultural foundations.The Jewish cultural influences on “Death of a Salesman” have been widely discussed and analyzed. An earlier version of Mr. Miller’s story centered on a salesman named not Loman, but Schoenzeit. An actor, Joseph Buloff, translated the play into Yiddish and put on a small production of his translation in Brooklyn in 1951, titled “Toyt fun a Salesman.”This new production hopes to draw and expand on Mr. Buloff’s. “The language of the play reveals its roots,” said David Mandelbaum, the artistic director of New Yiddish Rep. “I hope people will become more aware of that when they hear the intonations and rhythms of Yiddish as applied to the play.”Although the play will be entirely in Yiddish, it is aimed at a general audience; supertitles will accompany the production.Previously, New Yiddish Rep produced a well-received translation of “Waiting for Godot,” which premiered at the Castillo Theater in 2013 before traveling to Northern Ireland.A version of this article appears in print on 03/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Yiddish Production Of ‘Death of a Salesman’.
