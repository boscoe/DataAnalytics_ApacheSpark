Clint Eastwood’s “American Sniper” turned out another massive audience at North American theaters over the weekend, providing cover for another bomb elsewhere at the multiplex.With a power base in the Southeast, Midwest and South — and an attention-generating debate over its political message or lack thereof — “American Sniper” (Warner Bros.) took in an estimated $64.4 million, for a two-week total of about $200.1 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. Contributing to the strength of “American Sniper” were premium-priced showings on extra-large screens operated by theater chains like Cinemark, which is based in Plano, Tex.In sharp contrast, “Mortdecai,” a $60 million action comedy starring Johnny Depp, flopped badly with ticket sales of $4.1 million — the second time in two weeks that an amply budgeted film has been flatly rejected by the marketplace. (Last weekend it was “Blackhat,” which cost $70 million to make and took in $3.9 million over its first three days.) “Mortdecai,” which extends a losing streak for Mr. Depp, was co-financed by Lionsgate and OddLot Entertainment.Terrible reviews, a problematic title, viewer fatigue with Mr. Depp’s oddball characters and plain disinterest in the goofy art-dealer-caper premise were cited by box-office analysts on Sunday as possible explanations. Lionsgate had no comment.Among new releases, “The Boy Next Door” (Universal Pictures) did the best, selling about $15 million in tickets. A thriller starring Jennifer Lopez, “The Boy Next Door” cost just $4 million to make. The third new release of the weekend, the animated “Strange Magic,” a pet project of George Lucas released on Disney’s Touchstone label, took in a sad $5.5 million.A version of this article appears in print on 01/26/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Sniper’ Going Strong as Depp Film Flops.
