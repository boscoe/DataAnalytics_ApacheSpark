He’ll draw partly from that album in this engagement, with a 20-piece band that includes ace contributors like the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix, the trombonist Luis Bonilla and the saxophonist and clarinetist Scott Robinson. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set on Feb. 28, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Nate Chinen)Rob Brown Trio (Saturday) An alto saxophonist with an exploratory compass and a bright, beseeching tone, Rob Brown connects here with two trusted associates, both longtime fixtures of the jazz avant-garde in New York: the bassist William Parker and the drummer Gerald Cleaver. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)★ Aaron Burnett and the Big Machine (Tuesday) Mr. Burnett is an ambitious young saxophonist whose flagship band, the Big Machine, includes some of the vanguardist figures on the current circuit: the trumpeter Peter Evans, the pianist Craig Taborn, the bassist and cellist Nick Jozwiak and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. Among the original pieces in this concert, presented by Roulette in partnership with the Jerome Foundation, are “Ace of Swords,” “Dance of the Supernals” and “Juxtaposition.” At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)★ George Cables Trio (Friday and Saturday) The pianist George Cables has an elegant and gracious recent album, “Icons and Influences,” that pays homage to an array of former colleagues or associates, like the saxophonist Joe Henderson and the pianist Mulgrew Miller. He’ll engage with the same loose framework during this two-nighter, with Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com. (Chinen)Billy Childs All-Star Jazz Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) The pianist Billy Childs has found inspiration both in classical music and the pop repertory; his most recent album is “Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro.” He appears with Steve Wilson on saxophones, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Ari Hoenig on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Theo Croker’s DVRK Funk  (Saturday) “AfroPhysicist” is the confident and far-ranging album released last year by Mr. Croker, a trumpeter with pedigree (he’s the grandson of Doc Cheatham) and a recent history that includes seven years in Shanghai. He’ll draw from it during this one-nighter, featuring DVRK Funk, his band. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)★ Robert Glasper Trio (Tuesday through March 1) In recent years Robert Glasper has been chiefly focused on the Experiment, his next-level groove unit, which just won its second Grammy in the R&B field. His acoustic piano trio predates that, though, and hasn’t lost its agile footing — as Mr. Glasper will set out to show with this run in the room where he made his debut nearly a decade ago, with the same rhythm team of Vicente Archer on bass and Damion Reid on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)The Dexter Gordon Legacy Ensemble (Thursday through March 1) Dexter Gordon was a tenor saxophonist of deep composure and ineffable cool, one of the few avatars of bebop who rarely seemed to break a sweat. This tribute, led by a former associate, the pianist George Cables, features Abraham Burton and Craig Handy on saxophones; Joe Locke on vibraphone; Gerald Cannon on bass; and Lewis Nash on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Jimmy Greene Quartet (Monday) Last fall the tenor saxophonist Jimmy Greene released a poignant and deeply personal album, “Beautiful Life,” dedicated to the memory of his daughter, who was among the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012. The album features a number of vocalists, including Kurt Elling and Javier Colon — but for this engagement Mr. Greene seems likely to focus more on the instrumental side, with a rhythm section consisting of the pianist David Bryant, the bassist Luke Sellick and the drummer Jimmy MacBride. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Jon Irabagon Trio (Saturday) Jon Irabagon is an accomplished young saxophonist who has successfully ducked in and out of the avant-garde. He has worked often in recent years with the drummer Barry Altschul, whose career has largely been defined by that tradition. Here they welcome Bob Stewart, a tuba stalwart who has a lot of history with Mr. Altschul, notably in groups led by the saxophonist Arthur Blythe. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Sherman Irby’s Journey Through Swing (Friday and Saturday) The concert’s title makes it sound a bit like a PBS documentary, but Mr. Irby, an alto saxophonist in the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, is unlikely to settle for dry edification. He has chosen the loosest of frameworks, and some able partners, including the trumpeter Bruce Harris, the saxophonist and clarinetist Victor Goines and the trombonist Vincent Gardner. Friday at 7 p.m., Saturday at 9:30 p.m., the Appel Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org. (Chinen)★ Joe Lovano Nonet  (through Sunday) Joe Lovano, a tenor saxophonist with broad experience in large ensembles, has led this bop-flavored nonet — stocked with peers like the trumpeter Tim Hagans and the saxophonist Steve Slagle — on and off for more than a decade. As ever, it’s a band meant to be heard in this room. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Amina Claudine Myers Trio/Thurman Barker’s Strike Force Plus  (Thursday) As part of a 50th anniversary celebration for the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, this concert pairs two prominent members of that organization. The pianist and composer Amina Claudine Myers leads a trio with Jerome Harris on bass guitar and Reggie Nicholson on drums. And the drummer Thurman Barker presents “Chicago Suite,” a new piece for his percussion ensemble, Strike Force Plus. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)The New Drum Battle: Joe Farnsworth vs. Carl Allen (Friday through Sunday) In an exercise reminiscent of “Rich vs. Roach” and other manos a manos in the percussive field, Mr. Farnsworth and Mr. Allen, two prominent utility players, go head-to-head in some fine company: with the pianist Harold Mabern, the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonist Seamus Blake and the bassist John Webber. On Sunday, Eric MacPherson steps in for Mr. Allen. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)New Orleans Songbook (Friday and Saturday) The music of New Orleans forms an irresistible hook in this concert program, organized by the pianist Aaron Diehl and featuring, among others, the singers Cyrille Aimée and Milton Suggs. Also on the bill is the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, with the first performance of “New Orleans Jazz Market,” a piece by its artistic director, the trumpeter Irvin Mayfield. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org. (Chinen)Gretchen Parlato and Lionel Loueke (Friday and Saturday) Ms. Parlato, a vocalist, and Mr. Loueke, a guitarist, have a collaborative history that goes back more than a decade, to their time together at the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz. They share an intuitive commitment to cosmopolitanism; they also share a connection to the Jazz Gallery, which is presenting them as part of its 20th anniversary festivities. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Primavera (Thursday) Sara Serpa, a vocalist, and André Matos, a guitarist, recently made a calmly stunning duo album, “Primavera,” that capitalizes on their many affinities: as limber improvisers, as thoughtful composers, as selfless ensemble players, and as internationalists hailing originally from Portugal (by way of Boston and New York). On the album they welcome just a few brief interlopers — one of whom, the pianist Pete Rende, will take on a more substantial role here, with Thomas Morgan on bass. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Kermit Ruffins and the Barbecue Swingers  (through Sunday) The tradition of New Orleans-bred trumpeter-entertainers has a robust representative in Mr. Ruffins, who is spending Mardi Gras week here, with his working band. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Steps Ahead 35th Anniversary Celebration  (Tuesday through Feb. 28) Steps Ahead, a leading fusion outfit of the 1980s, has always stood for advanced interplay, following the lead of its members. This anniversary run features the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the pianist Eliane Elias and the drummer Peter Erskine — all heard on the album “Steps Ahead,” from 1983 — as well as Marc Johnson on bass and George Garzone on saxophones. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Tierney Sutton Band  (through Sunday) A jazz singer of cool poise and effervescent style, Tierney Sutton draws from her romantically inclined new album, “Paris Sessions,” in this engagement. She has a strong and unforced bond with her band, featuring Christian Jacob on piano, Kevin Axt on bass and Ray Brinker on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Elio Villafranca’s Music of the Caribbean  (Friday and Saturday) Elio Villafranca, a Cuban pianist and composer, presents the premiere of “Cinqué: Music of the Caribbean,” inspired by the ties between Cuba and Congo, and named after the African slave who led a revolt aboard the Amistad. Along with his band, the Jass Syncopators, he features Leyla McCalla on cello, banjo and vocals, and Jon Faddis on trumpet. Friday at 9:30 p.m., Saturday at 7 p.m., the Appel Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org. (Chinen)Advertisement
