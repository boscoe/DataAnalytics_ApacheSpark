He was only half joking, using what Rachel Maddow called “a sense of humor that he wields like a wrecking ball.”“Compared to What? The Improbable Journey of Barney Frank” (Friday at 9 p.m. Eastern on Showtime) chronicles this blustery Massachusetts Democrat’s 32 years in Congress, where he chaired the Financial Services Committee as Wall Street was imploding and co-sponsored the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping reform of the financial industry. Still, loneliness prevailed until 1987, when he “came out of the room,” as the House Speaker Tip O’Neill put it — a giant step for a man who, because he was gay and Jewish, never expected to be a candidate in the first place. In 2012, he became the first sitting member of Congress to marry a same-sex partner when he and Jim Ready promised to love each other “for better or for worse, on MSNBC or on Fox.”Advertisement
