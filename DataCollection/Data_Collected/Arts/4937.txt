The weekly summer dance parties known as Warm Up, held in the courtyard at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens, will run every Saturday from June 27 to September 5, featuring live performances and D.J. sets from experimental musicians including Boys Noize, A.G. Cook of PC Music, Baauer (remember “Harlem Shake”?) and the English grime rapper Skepta.The series, which leans heavily toward electronic music, with dashes of esoteric pop and hip-hop, will also host appearances this summer by Sicko Mobb, the Chicago bop duo; Lotic, the Houston-by-way-of-Berlin producer; the singer Dawn Richard; and Atom™, from Germany.Now in its 18th year, Warm Up places music alongside MoMA PS1’s modern art and design, including a new courtyard installation, “Cosmo,” from the architecture firm Andrés Jaque, winner of the annual Young Architects Program.Klaus Biesenbach, the director of MoMA PS1 and chief curator at large for MoMA, said, “Working closely with world-class music curators, Warm Up is completely analogous to other contemporary exhibitions in the museum.”Tickets for each show are $18 in advance or $20 the day of, with residents of Long Island City admitted free as per tradition, pending availability.
