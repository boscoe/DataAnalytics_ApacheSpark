CreditAndrew Cullen for The New York Times        Arthur, N.D. — In November, just off State Highway 18 in the pancake-flat heart of eastern North Dakota, Brian Johnson was sipping red wine from a Mason jar as he watched 500 people swing-dance in the hayloft of his barn.The band was playing a sturdy cover of “Take a Little Ride,” Jason Aldean’s ode to driving a Chevy truck down a back road after a long day of hauling hay. The men were decked out in deer hunting camouflage shirts and snapbacks bearing logos for state universities and farm equipment, while women in low-slung bedazzled jeans let their hoop earrings dangle beneath black cowboy hats pinned with miniature ears of corn.The older couples danced close and slow, but the younger ones moved like country gymnasts — bodies flew in the air and torsos angled over hips, boots kicked and stomped on the hayloft’s scuffed maple floor planks. By the time the band, the Fargo-based Silverado, started into another Aldean hit, “Hicktown,” the scene looked more like a circus tryout than a Friday night dance.“Farming is cyclical, all ups and downs,” said Mr. Johnson, 63, who’s been hosting barn dances amid his 2,500 acres of wheat and soybeans for nearly three decades (and happens to be my cousin). “The ’80s were dry. The ’90s were wet. You never know. The dances, though, are stable. And a whole lot of fun.”AdvertisementLast Friday, Mr. Johnson was planning to hold his last dance. In 2012, he discovered that he has Parkinson’s disease, and he’s decided to put the farmstead, including Johnson’s Barn, up for sale.Advertisement“There’s been a Johnson farming this land for almost a century,” he said. “I was born the same day they moved this barn here. Mom used to put me to sleep in a cardboard box beneath the lunch counter.”Mr. Johnson did the same with his son, Eric.“This is all I know,” said Eric, 30, who’s been collecting cash, stamping hands and organizing morning-after cleanups for as long as he can remember. “Same with sleeping behind Dad in the tractor out in the fields when I was real little. This place is who I am.”It has played a role in my own story as well. My grandmother was the sister of Mr. Johnson’s father, Herb. After she met my grandfather, who grew up in Dodge, N.D., they headed west, eventually settling for good in Los Angeles, where I was raised. North Dakota, though, was never far from our minds. We made regular trips back to the farm, returning home with memories of feeding pigs, jumping motorcycles over ditches and getting lost in rows of giant sunflowers. The barn was a featured attraction: home to family reunions, weddings and after-hours roller-skating. Back then, I had little sense of its importance. It wasn’t just a family haunt, but a building that over the years had become something of a CBGB for the farm set. So I set out to research this slice of my family history before the dances were a thing of the past.In this rural pocket of the upper Midwest, Mr. Johnson’s barn dance is the only one left on a working family farm. The barn is the only place for miles that has enough room for a hundreds-strong line-dance to Steve Earle’s “Copperhead Road.” There’s no bar, so you bring your own coolers full of whiskey, beer, pop or apple juice (depending on what kind of identification you show the Cass County sheriff’s deputies hired for the night) and for $3, Brian Johnson’s wife, Becky, or their daughter, Adra, will throw a burger on an electric grill for you.“By the time we shut it all down, people are usually back in their cars and heading home,” Mr. Johnson said. “But I wouldn’t say it’s never happened that we’ve woken up the next morning to find people asleep in the fields.”The athletic handbook of the local junior high school even includes a paragraph banning visits to barn dances the night before games.“You just can’t compare this place to any other,” said Charles Woodard, known as Woody, who is the drummer for Silverado, which plays the barn nearly every month. “It’s an authentic barn dance. When this place is hopping really good, it feels like an arena show.”AdvertisementThe barn’s remote location — between two small grain-elevator towns, Hunter and Arthur, with fewer than 600 people between them — is no deterrent for farmers and their children for whom a 30-mile drive to the grocery store is like a walk next door. Bigger university towns like Fargo and Grand Forks have bars and theaters, but all-ages clubs and old-fashioned dancehalls are hard to find nowadays, so throngs of college students will pile in a car or rent a party bus and drive on a two-lane highway past sugar beet mounds and ethanol plants to spend a Friday night in a hayloft.Brittany Schneider, 24, a student at North Dakota State University in Fargo, is a Johnson’s Barn regular. “I grew up in a town of 1,800 people where you had bonfires out in the field,” she said. “This just feels like home to me.”Dustin Hollermann, now in his 30s, has been attending dances since his college days in Crookston, Minn., 70 miles away. “We’d come here to dance and drink, go to Grand Forks for breakfast, then drive home.”Jordan Neuschwander’s visits to the barn since 2008 have been more strategic. “If you’re single and a country kid, where else are you going to meet someone?” she said. “I met my last boyfriend here but we split up. So I’m back.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Riley Plum, 19, still slightly out of breath from a spin around the room to Silverado’s take on Jake Owen’s “Eight Second Ride,” heard about the dances from her grandparents, who met here 40 years ago.“I come here because they did,” she said. “I love knowing that they danced here, too. Which is why I’m so sad this is all ending.”In 1988, when Brian and Becky Johnson put on their first dance — they advertised via handwritten posters they plastered around Fargo — they were continuing a Johnson family tradition that was already over 30 years old. Brian’s father, Herb, moved the barn to the family farm in 1952 and, as custom dictated, held a dance to christen it. He charged 98 cents, with his cows still living on the barn’s bottom floor. It was so popular he did another a week later. Before long, the dances at Herb Johnson’s barn were a Friday night institution.AdvertisementIn the early years, Herb, a fan of big-band jazz, mostly worked with booking agents like the National Orchestra Service in Omaha or the Thomas Booking Agency in Luverne, Minn., to hire swing orchestras and the occasional polka band. His favorite act was the Omaha jazz saxophonist Preston Love, an alumnus of the Count Basie Orchestra. He played the barn three times, when an all-black big band was not a common sight in 1950s rural North Dakota.By the ’60s, the barn was a must-stop for touring Midwestern rock bands. Its sloping walls are still papered with faded, stained publicity headshots: the Continental Co-ets from Fulda, Minn.; Marlys Roe and the Talismen from Brookings, S.D.; Dee Jay and the Runaways from Spirit Lake, Iowa.; and Fargo’s own the Furys. Its renown even caught the ear of Roy Orbison, who dropped by a dance on his way to a gig in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and jumped onstage to sing.“The barn was legendary,” said Debra Marquart, an Iowa State University writing professor and North Dakota native whose band Jessica performed at the barn in 1978. “Everybody wanted to play there,” she said. “Music needs big resonant spaces, and we don’t usually get those spaces in small rural communities in the Midwest. There weren’t as many ballrooms in North Dakota as there were in Iowa and Illinois, so a place like Johnson’s Barn really became important.”Yet Ms. Marquart, author of “The Horizontal World: Growing Up Wild in the Middle of Nowhere,” said that the barn’s real value lies in the communion it can provide for young people growing up in rural towns.“There’s nothing more delicious in life,” she said, “than being outside at night on a farm with all that space around you, all those friends, with music coming out of a lighted space in the dark. It’s exactly all the best things in life coming together.”In the months since announcing the barn’s final season, dances have been over capacity and loaded with emotion. Mr. Johnson quietly holds court from his spot at a long back counter, surrounded by barn disciples old and new who deluge him with memories. The Johnson’s Barn Facebook page has gotten busy, too.“My favorite Crazy Place back in 1967,” went a recent post by Ken Martin. “Had my wheels stolen off my car while it was setting on the north side one night. Beep Beep Road Runner Plymouths and Corvettes cruising around. High speed runs to get the girls back to the dorm on time. What a time. Lucky to be alive.”The decision to sell the farm has not been easy, but it will help Brian and Becky move to Fargo for a scaled-down life and prepare them for a health-care-heavy future. They know it could mean the end of an entire chapter of their family’s history.Brian insists he won’t let himself dwell on any of that.“There’s no room for sentimentality in farming,” he said. “I want somebody to buy it and continue to have dances. It’s not so important for me but for the kids who come here. Memories when you’re young are so important. It’s the only time in your life that you’re not busy working. I’d hate to see that go for them.”An article last Sunday about a long-running barn dance outside Arthur, N.D., referred incorrectly to the 1960s Midwestern rock band Dee Jay and the Runaways, which used to play Johnson’s Barn. The band was from Spirit Lake, Iowa — not Spirit Lake, Minn.A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2015, on Page AR16 of the New York edition with the headline: A Night Out in the Barn.
