“Shlomo’s back!” was the triumphant slogan when “Soul Doctor,” the Broadway musical about the guitar-strumming rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, reopened Off Broadway in December. But the show, which lasted not quite three months on Broadway in 2013, won’t make it to the two-month mark at the Actors Temple Theater, where its last performance is Sunday.Jeremy Chess, the retina surgeon who conceived the musical and is its sole producer Off Broadway, said the future of the show is uncertain, though there are “a few possibilities” for taking it on the road, including to Florida and Israel.“Soul Doctor” began Off Broadway  in 2008, where it returned in 2012 before being moved to the Circle in the Square theater on Broadway. Shortened after that run and retooled to work with fewer actors in a smaller space, the new production was meant in part to entice presenters into touring it. To be running during the Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference earlier this month was “one of our main goals,” Dr. Chess said.The other goal, to keep the production going at the Actors Temple, proved too expensive, he said, though he declined to say how much the show had cost. “We came in way higher than we might have,” he said. “You really have to have a big hit to sustain that.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/24/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Doctor in the House?
