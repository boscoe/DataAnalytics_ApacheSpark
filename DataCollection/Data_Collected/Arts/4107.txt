The film “Furious 7” has dominated the box office for the last two weeks, and now its screeching victory lap has extended to the music charts as well.The soundtrack, released four weeks ago by Atlantic Records, rises to No. 1 this week, helped by a huge push of popularity for the song “See You Again,” a tribute to Paul Walker, the actor in the film who died in a car crash in late 2013. In its latest week the soundtrack sold a modest 45,000 copies, according to Nielsen Music. But songs from it were listened to 11.6 million times on streaming services in the United States, helping send the album to the top in Billboard’s new chart math, which counts streams as well as sales.“See You Again,” by Wiz Khalifa and featuring Charlie Puth, becomes the new No. 1 single, ending a 14-week run by Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk.” (Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men, your 16-week record for 1995’s “One Sweet Day” is safe.) “See You Again” — which Wiz Khalifa performed on NBC’s “The Voice” last week — sold 464,000 downloads and had 25 million streams, according to Nielsen.The song has also broken records on Spotify, where it is the top-ranked track in 26 countries, from Sweden to Singapore. Spotify announced that “See You Again” garnered 21.9 million streams around the world last week, and on Monday it set a new record on the service for the most streams in a day, with 4.2 million.“Uptown Funk” slipped to No. 2 on Billboard’s singles chart with 145,000 sales and 14.6 million streams. Since it came out in November, the song has been downloaded almost 5.4 million times in the United States, according to Nielsen.Also on the album chart this week, the pop-punk band All Time Low reaches an all-time high of No. 2 with its latest release, “Future Hearts” (Hopeless), which had 75,000 sales and 2.6 million streams. The soundtrack to “Fifty Shades of Grey” (Republic) rose six spots to No. 3 and Maroon 5’s “V” (222/Interscope) jumped seven rungs to No. 4. But the next two spots on the chart are unmoved from last week: Taylor Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine) is in fifth place, and Sam Smith’s “In the Lonely Hour” (Capitol) holds at No. 6.A version of this article appears in print on 04/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Furious 7’ Rules the Music Charts, Too.
