They also made lavishly embellished documents called fraktur, 200 outstanding examples of which are in “Drawn With Spirit: Pennsylvania German Fraktur From the Joan and Victor Johnson Collection” opening on Sunday at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Most fraktur were birth and baptism certificates festooned with scrolling vines, flowers and birds, as well as ornate abstract patterns. Others were marriage or house blessings, bookplates or rewards of merit that teachers made for their students. Still others illustrated biblical scenes or depicted secular subjects including portraits and still lifes.This exhibition will trace the form’s variety with fraktur from a promised gift culled over decades by the Johnsons, discriminating folk-art collectors. Their largess will raise the museum’s representation of fraktur holdings to a level commensurate with its exemplary holdings in Pennsylvania German furniture and ceramics.
