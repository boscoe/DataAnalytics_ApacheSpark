The actress Carrie Fisher, who reprised her role as Leia Organa, the intergalactic revolutionary princess turned general in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” is taking on Internet trolls who criticized her appearance.   “Please stop debating whether or not I aged well,” the actress, 59, wrote on Tuesday via Twitter. “Unfortunately it hurts all three of my feelings.”  Ms. Fisher, whose public battles with addiction, weight gain and mental illness formed the basis of her 2009 stage show, “Wishful Drinking,” has long pushed back against expectations that she physically remain frozen in time as Princess Leia from the original “Star Wars,” in which she starred when she was 19.  In advance of the release of “The Force Awakens,” Ms. Fisher told  “Good Morning America”  that while she did lose weight for the franchise’s new film, “I think it’s a stupid conversation.”  And on the red carpet at the film’s premiere,  she joked on camera that to research  the role, she talked to the younger version of herself, who “was very busy partying and making sure that I look” terrible later. After reposting a few harsh tweets directed at her this week on Twitter, Ms. Fisher wrote, “Youth and beauty are not accomplishments,” and added that they’re the temporary  byproducts of time and DNA.A version of this article appears in print on 12/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Carrie Fisher Strikes Back on Aging Issue.
