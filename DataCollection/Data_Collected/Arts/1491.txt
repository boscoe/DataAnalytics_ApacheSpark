LOS ANGELES — Call it the deep breath before the onslaught: A dozen major movies are lined up for release over the next three weeks, including “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” but Hollywood mostly served Thanksgiving leftovers this post-holiday weekend, historically a dead spot on the box-office calendar.The No. 1 cinematic draw in North America was again “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2” (Lionsgate), which took in about $18.6 million, for a three-week domestic total of $227 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data. Second place went to “Krampus,” a rare Christmas-themed horror movie, which arrived to about $16 million in ticket sales, a bit more than analysts expected. “Krampus” (Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures) cost an estimated $15 million to make. “Creed,” from Warner’s New Line and Metro-Goldwyn Mayer, was a close third, taking in about $15.5 million, for a two-week domestic total of $65 million.With Hollywood’s awards season in full swing, two Oscar hopefuls, “Spotlight” and “Brooklyn,” continued to deliver solid results. “Spotlight” (Open Road) collected $2.9 million, for a five-week total of $16.6 million. “Brooklyn” (Fox Searchlight) was hot on its tail, with $2.4 million in weekend sales, for a five-week total of $11.2 million.In extra-limited release — four theaters apiece — “Carol,” the Weinstein Company’s 1950s-era lesbian love story, continued to attract stronger interest than “The Danish Girl” (Focus Features), which stars Eddie Redmayne in the title role. “Carol” had weekend ticket sales of $147,241, for a three-week total of about $817,000; “The Danish Girl” came up with $106,000 for the weekend, for a two-week total of $352,000.Also of note: Spike Lee’s “Chi-Raq” (Roadside Attractions) arrived to $1.3 million in ticket sales at 305 theaters. The satire cost a reported $15 million to make.
