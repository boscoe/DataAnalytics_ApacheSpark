The hit Off Broadway musical “Hamilton” closed its Thursday night performance with an unusual number: “What I Did For Love” from “A Chorus Line.” The young actors of “Hamilton” celebrated the 40th anniversary of that earlier show by inviting the members of its original cast to watch “Hamilton” from the audience at the Public Theater, and then to join them onstage after a curtain call in which the “Hamilton” cast held up head shots, in a nod to a well-known “Chorus Line” image.And then, acknowledging the way “A Chorus Line” called attention to the struggles of aspiring musical theater singers and dancers, the “Hamilton” cast chose its ensemble members, rather than its stars, to sing the tribute number on the Newman Theater stage at the Public, where both shows had their premieres.Lin-Manuel Miranda, the writer and star of “Hamilton,” said in an interview that he has been a fan of “A Chorus Line” since assistant directing a production during his junior year at Hunter College High School.“I know every note of that show, because the shows you work on in high school stay in your DNA forever — I could do ‘Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love’ right now, because it’s just in there,” he said. “We wore out that original cast recording. So it means the world to me that we get to honor them — I can’t tell you what goes through your head when you’re a performer onstage and you know that some of the people who inspired you to be onstage are watching you. That’s a very heady feeling.”Priscilla Lopez, who was nominated for a Tony for her work in “A Chorus Line”  said the reunion brought back many memories.“Whenever I hear ‘What I Did for Love,’ whether I’m singing it or anybody else is singing it, I just break down and cry,” she said, “because it just represents such a time in my life, a time that I would gladly live over and over and over again.” Ms. Lopez went on to win a Tony for “A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine,” and later costarred with Mr. Miranda in his musical “In the Heights.”“A Chorus Line” transferred from the Public to Broadway in 1975; “Hamilton” is scheduled to transfer from the Public to Broadway this summer.A version of this article appears in print on 04/18/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Cast of u2018Hamiltonu2019 Pays Tribute to u2018A Chorus Lineu2019.
