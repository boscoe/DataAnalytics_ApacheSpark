The Cleveland Foundation on Wednesday announced the winners of its 2015 Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards, which are given to books that deal with issues of race and diversity.Marlon James was honored for his novel “A Brief History of Seven Killings,” which describes decades of Jamaican history through the perspectives of many narrators. In her review of Mr. James’s novel in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: “It’s epic in every sense of that word: sweeping, mythic, over-the-top, colossal and dizzyingly complex. It’s also raw, dense, violent, scalding, darkly comic, exhilarating and exhausting — a testament to Mr. James’s vaulting ambition and prodigious talent.”The historian David Brion Davis was given a lifetime achievement award. Mr. Davis’s most recent book, “The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Emancipation,” the third in a trilogy about the subject of slavery, won a National Book Critics Circle award last month. In The New York Times Book Review, Brenda Wineapple called it a “richly textured” book that was “essential reading for anyone wishing to understand our complex and contradictory past.” The first volume in that series, “The Problem of Slavery in Western Culture,” won an Anisfield-Wolf Award and a Pulitzer Prize in 1967.In nonfiction, Richard S. Dunn received the award for “A Tale of Two Plantations,” a deeply researched account of life on plantations in Jamaica and Virginia.Two poets won awards for recent collections: Jericho Brown for “The New Testament” and Marilyn Chin for “Hard Love Province.”Henry Louis Gates Jr. was chairman of the jury that awarded the prizes.A version of this article appears in print on 04/02/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Awards for Books On Race and Diversity.
