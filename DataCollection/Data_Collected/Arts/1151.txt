OestreichThe sun rose twice on Monday evening during Juilliard415’s concert at Alice Tully Hall: first in Haydn’s Symphony No. 6 (“Morning,” 1761), then in Telemann’s cantata “Die Tageszeiten” (“The Times of Day,” 1757). This was a fascinating juxtaposition of works finished only four years apart and similar in means and expression, by composers generally taken to represent distinct eras (Haydn the Classical, Telemann the Baroque).The Haydn symphony — like its mates Nos. 7 (“Noon”) and 8 (“Evening”) — receives occasional performances. But Telemann’s huge output is represented these days mainly by his instrumental works, so “Die Tageszeiten” was a welcome departure, even if not as strong a work as the oratorio “Der Tag des Gerichts” (“The Day of Judgment”), which the American Classical Orchestra resurrected last month.“Die Tageszeiten,” to a text by Friedrich Wilhelm Zachariae, is in four parts: “Morning,” “Midday,” “Evening” and “Night.” Each consists of two arias and a recitative, and each is sung by a different soloist, in descending order from soprano to bass. The four singers join in a chorus at the end of each part, to texts evidently added by Telemann.The young singers here — Elizabeth Sutphen, soprano; Kara Sainz, mezzo-soprano; Yujoong Kim, tenor; and Leo Radosavljevic, bass — were excellent. Ms. Sainz’s rich tone blended beautifully with that of Arnie Tanimoto’s viola da gamba in a nice cameo turn in “Midday.”The early-music specialist Nicholas McGegan conducted Juilliard415, the school’s superb period-instrument ensemble, consisting here of some dozen strings, paired flutes, oboes and horns, bassoon and harpsichord. Three players were worked especially hard and rose to the challenges beautifully: Augusta McKay Lodge, the concertmaster and main violin soloist; Joseph Monticello, a flutist; and Kamila Marcinkowska-Prasad, the bassoonist.Advertisement
