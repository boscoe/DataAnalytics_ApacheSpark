LOS ANGELES – With her big-screen debut stalled, Fancy Nancy will instead try her luck on a small one.Disney Junior, the preschool division of Disney Channels Worldwide, said Friday that it would turn the best-selling children’s book series into an animated television movie and weekly show. Disney also plans to license a line of related consumer products, and Disney and HarperCollins aim to publish books based on the on-screen storytelling.The “Fancy Nancy” books, written by Jane O’Connor and illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser, have sold more than 28 million copies since their introduction in 2005. Disney Junior is a daily programming block on Disney Channel; Disney also operates 34 standalone Disney Junior cable networks around the world.“Fancy Nancy,” about a young girl with a showy wardrobe and vocabulary to match, comes to Disney after a bit of hard luck in Hollywood. For years 20th Century Fox controlled the movie rights, at one point exploring a live-action film produced by Shawn Levy and Tina Fey. But Fox recently decided to move on.
