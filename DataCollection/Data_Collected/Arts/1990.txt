 This ❤️#rebelheart had a dream!A photo posted by Madonna (@madonna) on Jan 1, 2015 at 8:05am PSTA hiatus from media headlines apparently was not one of Madonna’s resolutions for 2015.  The singer began the New Year defending images posted on her Instagram account depicting Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and other luminaries with their faces altered to resemble the cover of her upcoming album, “Rebel Heart.” The cover art is a close-up of Madonna’s face crisscrossed by black strings. She began posting similar pictures on social media two weeks ago with the altered faces of various figures — including her mother, Homer Simpson, Marilyn Monroe and a statue of Jesus — with the hashtag #rebelheart. But pictures of King and Mandela posted on Friday drew the most ire. Some followers on Facebook and Instagram condemned the posts and called the pictures “disgusting,” “tacky,” “racist” and “offensive.”  In various social media posts over the weekend, Madonna clarified that the images were made by fans, and said she was not comparing herself to those in the pictures, only acknowledging them as freedom fighters and as people she admires. Under a picture of John Lennon, Madonna wrote in part:  “When I repost these images, I am saying YES! These people are all Rebel Hearts in one way or another from Martin Luther King to Jesus to Nelson Mandela to John Lennon. YES! Lets celebrate them! The world needs more people like them.”“Rebel Heart” is due out in March, but last month at least 28 new songs were made public — all but a few of which the singer called “unfinished demos” that were leaked online in two incidents.
