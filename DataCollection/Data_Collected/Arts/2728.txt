In The New York Times Book Review, Seth Mnookin reviews Johann Hari’s “Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs.” Mr. Mnookin writes:“Chasing the Scream” begins with mini-­profiles of three Americans Hari views as archetypes for the modern-day war on drugs: Harry Anslinger, the commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930 to 1962; Arnold Rothstein, a Jewish gangster in New York City in the 1920s; and Billie Holiday, the transcendent jazz singer who died in 1959 in a hospital room that had recently been raided by Anslinger’s agents. The conclusions Hari draws from these sections often feel forced: In the pages to come, law enforcement officers are invariably described as Anslinger’s descendants, and murderous drug dealers are time and again compared to Rothstein. Still, Anslinger, Rothstein and Holiday serve as potent examples supporting Hari’s central theses: that the racism exhibited in the war on drugs was a primary factor in its founding; that the world’s default approach to drug use and abuse was put in place without regard for evidence or logic; and that the people who profit most from drug criminalization are criminals.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Mnookin discusses “Chasing the Scream”; John Williams has news from the publishing world; Ben Yagoda talks about “The B Side”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
