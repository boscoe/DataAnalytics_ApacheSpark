The annual pre-Oscar ribbing known as the Razzies had sharp elbows this year for actors with Cameron in their name. On Saturday, the Golden Raspberry Award Foundation awarded four Razzies to “Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas”: worst picture, worst screenplay, worst actor (Mr. Cameron) and worst screen combo (for Mr. Cameron and “His Ego”). The film was also nominated for worst supporting actress (Mr. Cameron’s sister, Bridgette Ridenour) and worst director (Darren Doane). It was also a rough year for Cameron Diaz, who received nominations for work in four films. Ms. Diaz won worst actress for “Sex Tape” and “The Other Woman.”   She was nominated for  worst supporting actress in “Annie,” which won worst remake. She lost that title to Megan Fox (“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”).  Ms. Diaz was also nominated for worst screen combo with Jason Segel in “Sex Tape.”Other Razzie recipients were Kelsey Grammer,  who was named worst supporting actor (“The Expendables 3,” “Legends of Oz,” “Think Like a Man Too” and “Transformers 4: Age of Extinction”); and Michael Bay, worst director (Transformers 4).The Razzies also gave out its first Redeemer Award, which honors someone who has previously won or been nominated for a Razzie but has since made a more commendable project. That award went to Ben Affleck for “Argo” and “Gone Girl.” Kristen  Stewart was nominated for that award but won another instead. On Friday, she became the first American actress to win a César Award, the national film award of France. She received the award for best supporting actress in Olivier Assayas’s drama “Clouds of Sils Maria.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Razzies Bestow Their Own Awards.
