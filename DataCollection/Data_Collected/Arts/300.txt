Chamber music is getting a moment in the spotlight: the University of Michigan announced Wednesday that it is creating a new chamber music competition with a grand prize of $100,000 to focus attention on the rapidly evolving field.The prize, which is being called the M-Prize, is the idea of Aaron P. Dworkin, who became dean of the University’s School of Music, Theater and Dance in July, after stepping down from the Sphinx Organization, the nonprofit group that he founded to increase diversity in the classical music world. Mr. Dworkin said in a statement that he sees chamber music as providing a vibrant career path for conservatory­-trained musicians.“The vast possibilities inherent in chamber music empower it with the unique ability to serve as a catalyst for interdisciplinary exploration and, ultimately, transformational artistic experiences,” Mr. Dworkin added in the statement.The field of chamber music has changed in recent years, with many ensembles performing across genres, and the new competition is not limited to traditional classical ensembles. It will be open to those having between three and eight members, with a junior division for musicians under 18 and a senior division for ensembles whose average age is under 35. Besides awarding prizes to string and wind ensembles, it has a category that recognizes “open” ensembles, which can feature percussion, singers, turntables, laptops and styles including jazz, bluegrass and other genres that incorporate improvisation.The grand prize winner will be selected from three senior-division finalists, who will perform at a gala concert at the university on May 20 that will be broadcast on Detroit Public Television and made available to other public television stations around the country. In addition to the $100,000 prize, the winner will be presented the next season by the University Musical Society of Ann Arbor.A version of this article appears in print on 10/16/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: $100,000 Prize for Chamber Music.
