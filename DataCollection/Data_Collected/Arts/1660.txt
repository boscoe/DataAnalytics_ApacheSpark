The council runs the annual River to River Festival and is planning to begin construction next year on an expanded Arts Center at Governors Island. It said that it had already raised 60 percent of its $3 million fund-raising campaign for the project.Since 2012 Mr. Hamingson has been the executive director at St. Ann’s, which he joined after a truncated stint as executive director at the Public Theater.
