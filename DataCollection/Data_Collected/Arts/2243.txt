The Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway (“Les Misérables”) and the Tony Award winner Julie Taymor (“The Lion King”) will team up this spring at the Public Theater on the prize-winning drama “Grounded,” a 70-minute monologue about a fighter pilot who is reassigned to operate drone strikes when she becomes pregnant, the Public announced on Wednesday.The play, by George Brant, won the 2012 Smith Prize for works about American politics and has already been mounted Off Broadway by Page 73 Productions, in a run last year at Walkerspace that earned solid reviews. But with a box office draw like Ms. Hathaway and a renowned director like Ms. Taymor involved, it’s no surprise that the play is quickly getting a second life in New York. Ms. Hathaway is also a board member at the Public Theater, while Ms. Taymor worked at the Public early in her career before going on to direct on Broadway, most recently with the headline-generating musical “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.”“‘Grounded’ is brilliant and important play, a meditation on the human and moral costs of our astonishing military technology,” said the Public’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis, in a statement. “This promises to be an unforgettable theatrical event, and an important addition to our national conversation.” Ms. Hathaway, through a publicist, declined an interview request.Performances will begin at the Public on April 7 and run through May 17.A version of this article appears in print on 01/22/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Hathaway to Star in One-Woman Play.
