A composer doesn’t necessarily mean a songwriter, especially in jazz. Guillermo Klein, originally from Argentina, who has written brilliantly for his jazz groups in New York and Barcelona since the mid-’90s, never made a distinction. He creates pieces full of tricky counterpoint and canon, but he also writes emotionally direct, harmonically complex, circular songs to be sung by himself and others, including Liliana Herrero and Luciana Souza.Not long ago, Mr. Klein moved back to the New York area and started collaborating with the singer Rebecca Martin and the bassist Larry Grenadier, who are husband and wife. The idea was to put lyrics to Mr. Klein’s compositions, but the repertory expanded to include other composers’ work, too. Along with the drummer Jeff Ballard, they will record the songs in the summer, and they’re now strengthening them in clubs, including at Rockwood Music Hall on Wednesdays in February: so far, the 4th, the 11th and the 18th.
