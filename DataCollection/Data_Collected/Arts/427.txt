The Philadelphia Orchestra has found labor peace, at least temporarily.The orchestra’s musicians have officially ratified an unusual one-year contract, which is shorter than the more typical three-year pacts most orchestras work under, the orchestra announced on Monday. The  contract, which runs through Sept. 11, 2016, will keep the music going as the organization, which emerged from bankruptcy protection three years ago, charts its future.Under the new deal musicians’ salaries will rise by 3 percent, but will still not reach the levels that had been promised them by a contract that was canceled during bankruptcy. Musicians also accepted changes to their health plans that the Philadelphia Orchestra Association expects will lead to savings. And the orchestra, which instituted a hiring freeze in 2010 that reduced its size by 10 positions, agreed to begin holding auditions to fill one of the empty positions.During the talks the orchestra decided to hire Michael M. Kaiser, the former Kennedy Center president and founding chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management, to study and report on the challenges facing the orchestra, which has been enjoying critical acclaim under the baton of its charismatic music director, Yannick Nézet-Séguin. When it played at Carnegie Hall last week David Allen wrote in The New York Times that “it might be that no American orchestra sounds more alive.”A version of this article appears in print on 10/20/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Philadelphia Musicians Ratify Contract.
