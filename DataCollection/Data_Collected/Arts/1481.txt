Blige, David Alan Grier, Ne-Yo, Uzo Aduba and Common. A newcomer, Shanice Williams, played Dorothy.The 11.5 million viewers represents the most-viewed Thursday night program, excluding sports, since February. The 18- to 49-year-old viewing figure was the highest Thursday-night tally in that demographic since ABC notched that total in September 2014 for the season premieres of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal,” and the debut of “How to Get Away With Murder.” It was also NBC’s strongest effort on a Thursday night since “The Sound of Music Live!”Advertisement
