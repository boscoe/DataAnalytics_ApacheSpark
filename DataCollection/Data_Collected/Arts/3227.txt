During this time, the privilege and burden of maintaining the celebrated Cunningham repertory fell to Robert Swinston, a veteran of the company for three decades. He joined as a dancer in 1980, became Cunningham’s assistant in 1992 and was named director of choreography after Cunningham’s death. In 2013, Mr. Swinston became the artistic director of Centre National de Danse Contemporaine in Angers, France, which makes its United States debut this week at the Joyce Theater with a program saluting Cunningham. “Event,” created by Mr. Swinston, is a movement montage of nearly a dozen Cunningham works created between 1965 and 1990. It’s a dance album of sorts: both nostalgic and inventive, a eulogy and a second life. (Tuesday through next Sunday, 175 Eighth Avenue, 212-242-0800, joyce.org.) Advertisement
