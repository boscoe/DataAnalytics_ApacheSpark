Suddenly, Seymour is a Hollywood heartthrob: Jake Gyllenhaal will make his musical theater debut as the nerdy florist in the Encores! Off-Center production of “Little Shop of Horrors” at City Center this summer, theater representatives announced on Tuesday.Mr. Gyllenhaal will play Seymour, who tries to woo his co-worker Audrey with a carnivorous plant, in a concert production of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken’s long-running Off-Broadway comedy. Taran Killam, the “Saturday Night Live” star, will also make his musical debut, as the psychotic dentist and romantic rival, Orin Scrivello. (In the 1986 film version, the dentist was memorably played by Steve Martin, opposite Rick Moranis’s Seymour.)The veteran stage actor Chuck Cooper will voice the blood-thirsty plant, and Ellen Greene will play Audrey, the ditzy love interest, as she did in the original stage production and film.Dick Scanlan will direct the Encores! production, which while originally  announced for one night, will now play three performances on July 1-2.Mr. Gyllenhaal has lately included the stage in his acting diet; this season he starred opposite Ruth Wilson in the well-received Broadway play “Constellations.”
