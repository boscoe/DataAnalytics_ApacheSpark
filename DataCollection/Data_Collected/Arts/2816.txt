A warm sound is invariably an appealing attribute of solo or ensemble playing — and as temperatures plummeted on Sunday afternoon, it felt particularly welcome to bask in the Auryn Quartet’s glowing timbres in the snug acoustical cocoon of the Frick Collection’s intimate Music Room.Most string quartets undergo several personnel changes during a lengthy tenure, sometimes leading to a change of temperament or aesthetic. The Auryn Quartet (named after the talisman in the book “The Neverending Story”) is unusual in that it has maintained the same roster of players since its founding in 1981: the violinists Matthias Lingenfelder and Jens Oppermann; the violist Stewart Eaton and the cellist Andreas Arndt.There was a brief delay after Mr. Arndt realized he forgot his music and went backstage to retrieve it, eliciting giggles from the audience. The ensemble opened the program with Mozart’s Quartet in B-flat (“The Hunt”), one of six dedicated to Haydn, performing with vigor and expressive phrasing. The rich tone and bold gestures of Mr. Lingenfelder, the first violinist, were aptly mirrored by his colleagues.Here and throughout the playing was congenial and polished, if lacking the edge-of-seat excitement often conveyed by newer ensembles.The first half of the program also included a sensually rendered interpretation of Ravel’s Quartet in F, whose finale unfolded with a balance of fiery declamation and sultry poise.The event concluded on a brooding note with Brahms’s sorrowful Quartet in C minor. The ensemble performed with full-bodied sound in the orchestral outer movements and with a lovely burnished tone in its soulful rendition of the slow movement.A version of this review appears in print on February 17, 2015, on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: The Cozy Radiance That Old Hands Can Forge.
