On Sunday at Carnegie Hall, she is joined by her acclaimed Vocal Ensemble — which champions her distinctive technique — and a host of musicians from the classical, jazz and D.J. worlds. Those colleagues will include the Bang on a Can All-Stars, Lukas Ligeti, John Zorn, Missy Mazzoli, Jessye Norman and DJ Spooky, performing an all-Monk program. (3 p.m., Zankel Hall, carnegiehall.org.) On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Alan Gilbert conducts the New York Philharmonic in the premiere of John Adams’s “Scheherazade.2,” with the dynamic violinist Leila Josefowicz  as soloist. The work is inspired by Rimsky-Korsakov’s piece of the same name and depicts a modern Scheherazade confronted with male hegemony amid religious and political conservatism in countries worldwide. The program also features Stravinsky’s “Petrushka” and “The Enchanted Lake” by Anatoly Lyadov. (7:30 p.m. Thursday, 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, nyphil.org.)Advertisement
