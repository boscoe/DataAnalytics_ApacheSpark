It is something of a given that the best conservatories, dance academies and drama schools can teach their students the craft, and sometimes the art, they need to master their fields. But teaching them how to make a living in those fields can be another matter.To that end, the Juilliard School announced Thursday that it had received a $5 million gift to help its students prepare for their professional careers by creating the Alan D. Marks Center for Career Services and Entrepreneurship.The gift, from Michael E. Marks, a member of the school’s board of trustees, and his wife, Carole, aims to make career services and entrepreneurial strategies more integral to a Juilliard education. It will incorporate business skills into the Juilliard Colloquium course; offer intensive sessions on business, marketing and arts management; provide career advancement grants to some graduating students; and give students help with public speaking and networking.“Michael and Carole’s gift will reinforce and expand our current programs, allowing us to better equip our students to succeed as young professionals in a rapidly changing world,” the president of Juilliard, Joseph W. Polisi, said in a statement.The center is named for one of Mr. Marks’s brothers, Alan D. Marks, a pianist who graduated from Juilliard in 1971 and who died in 1995.A version of this article appears in print on 01/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: $5 Million to Aid Juilliard Students.
