Kenya Barris, the show runner of ABC’s “black-ish,” which returns for its second season on Wednesday, is taking questions from Times readers.“Black-ish,” debuted last fall with a unique premise: a successful African American advertising executive, played by Anthony Anderson, worries that his children are losing touch with their heritage, thanks to their suburban California upbringing.But from there the show expanded into an inventive family sitcom that played with structure and form — the season finale was set during the Harlem Renaissance and presented partially in black-and-white — as it continued to find comedy in the occasional awkwardness of cultural assimilation. The blend worked — “black-ish” was the highest-rated new comedy among adults 18-49, the key demo for advertisers.“Black-ish” shows no signs of softening its approach this season. The premiere revolves around one of the kids’ use of a racial slur during a school talent show.Mr. Barris has said he based “black-ish” loosely on his own experiences. Prior to “black-ish,” Mr. Barris developed “America’s Next Top Model” with Tyra Banks and was a writer for “The Game,” among other shows.Please leave questions for Mr. Barris in the comments. We will post his responses to some of them soon.Advertisement
