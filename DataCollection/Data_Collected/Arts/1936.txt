The economist Thomas Piketty, the author of the surprise best-seller “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” has turned down the Legion of Honor, the highest decoration offered by the French government. “I do not think it is the government’s role to decide who is honorable,” Mr. Piketty told Agence France-Presse, adding, “They would do better to concentrate on reviving growth in France and Europe.”Mr. Piketty, who teaches at the Paris School of Economics, had previously advised candidates from France’s Socialist Party and in 2012 signed a letter in support of François Hollande, now the president, but has since been critical of some of the government’s economic policies.In the nearly 700-page “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” which has sold more than a half-million copies and turned its author into a global intellectual sensation, Mr. Piketty drew on more than a century of data on wealth accumulation across multiple countries to argue that capitalism naturally tends toward inequality because of the tendency of return on capital to outstrip economic growth.The book, which included a call for a wealth tax as high as 80 percent, has prompted widespread debate among economists, as well as a memorable riff from a temporarily goateed Stephen Colbert, who denounced Mr. Piketty as a “French Fried Fraud” pushing “Pepé-Le-Punitive tax rates.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/02/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Piketty Says ‘Non’ To Legion of Honor.
