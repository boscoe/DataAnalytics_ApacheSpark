Wendy Whelan, who retired from New York City Ballet a year ago, is taking her skills to the studios at Barnard College as the school’s first Lida A. Orzeck ’68 Distinguished Artist in Residence.Through May 2016, Ms. Whelan will hold six master classes, as well as coaching and choreography sessions with students. She will also take part in two public events, such as panel discussions. Barnard’s president, Debora Spar, said the residency was modeled after a similar one held by Twyla Tharp during the past academic year.Ms. Whelan said in an interview that this appointment fits in with her post-retirement life, which has hardly been quiet. Next month she is to star in “Hagoromo,” an evening-length work choreographed by David Neumann at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; in the spring, she is to dance the New York premiere of “Whelan/Watson: Other Stories” at City Center.But, she said, she also wants to find her strengths beyond dancing. That includes standing in front of a room to lead a group of students, and even trying choreography. “I want to sort of test my wings,” she said. “I want to find a little piece of myself that I’ve never owned before.”Her first public event will be a panel discussion on Nov. 10 with the “Hagoromo” creative team, including her co-star, Jock Soto, another former City Ballet dancer.The artist-in-residence endowment — a gift of $2.5 million from Ms. Orzeck, a co-founder and chief executive of the lingerie company Hanky Panky — was announced in May. In the future, the position will be open to artists in the fields of dance, music, visual arts, theater and architecture.A version of this article appears in print on 10/15/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Wendy Whelan Named to Post at Barnard.
