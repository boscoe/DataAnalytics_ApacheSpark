Saturday’s lineup, part of the American Composers Orchestra’s Sonic festival and directed by Brad Wells, fully exploited the ability of these versatile singers, who have studied Inuit throat singing, yodeling, belting and traditions from countries including Georgia, Korea and India. A polyphonic Sardinian folk style based on overtone singing (when one person sings two notes at the same time) inspired Missy Mazzoli’s joyous, raucous “Vesper Sparrow.” During one section, the soprano voices soared in a long line over the clipped notes that swelled and ebbed in the lower voices.The other works (some featured on the ensemble’s recent CD) were also notable for their textural complexity and imaginative scoring. In Ted Hearne’s “Coloring Book,” set to texts by African-American writers and given its premiere here, layered harmonies created a dense soundscape as the ensemble sang lines from Zora Neale Hurston’s essay “How it Feels to Be Colored Me.” Parts of “You are not the guy” (from Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen”) evoked a barbershop quartet. In “Letter to my father” (set to a text by Hurston) the pronoun “he” was tossed between the men and women like a tennis ball. A series of gasping sounds permeated “Your People,” set to words by James Baldwin.In his somber, richly scored “Suonare/to sound,” Eric Dudley (a tenor in the group) used timbre and language to intriguing effect, the sopranos singing the Italian text over a dense tapestry of English text. There was a hint of yodeling in William Brittelle’s exuberant “High Done No Why To,” the title repeated in various guises to create a colorful polyphony.In Caleb Burhans’s beguiling “Beneath” (whose title is taken from an episode of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer”), the singers created otherworldly textures with eerie harmonies and contrasting timbres.Best of all was the premiere of Anna Clyne’s gorgeous “Pocket Book VIII,” in which the text of Shakespeare’s Eighth Sonnet, which begins “Music to hear,” was whispered to magical effect over lush, drawn-out harmonies.The Sonic Festival continues through Friday in Brooklyn and Manhattan; 212-977-8495, sonicfestival­.org.Advertisement
