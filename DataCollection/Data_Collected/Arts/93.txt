To his and hers, “The Affair” adds theirs.Last season, this Showtime series wobbled around an intriguing device: An affair, and a murder, told from the differing perspectives of adulterous lovers — Noah Solloway (Dominic West), a striving writer and father of four, and Alison Bailey (Ruth Wilson), a waitress wrecked by the death of her son. The result was a “Rashomon”-like narrative as unreliable as the Atlantic lapping at their destructive passion, but satisfyingly acted.This season, their former spouses — Helen Solloway (Maura Tierney), a rich novelist’s daughter, and Cole Lockhart (Joshua Jackson), a scion of a Montauk ranching family — bring their voices to the fray as the mystery of who killed Cole’s brother coalesces. It’s not for nothing that Sunday’s episode invokes “Of Mice and Men.” “The murder at the end of that book felt surprising while it was happening and completely inevitable in retrospect,” Noah’s publisher says, “like all great endings in literature.” A great ending may be too much to hope for, but “The Affair” still keeps us on our toes.A version of this article appears in print on October 4, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Television; New Perspectives Advance ‘Affair’.
