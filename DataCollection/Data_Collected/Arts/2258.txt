The National Ballet of China will perform “The Peony Pavilion” and “The Red Detachment of Women” at the David H. Koch Theater, and Franz Welser-Möst will conduct the Cleveland Orchestra in concert performances of Richard Strauss’s opera “Daphne” at Avery Fisher Hall. “Ubu Roi,” by Alfred Jarry, will be performed in French with English supertitles in a Cheek by Jowl production by the director Declan Donnellan and designer Nick Ormerod. An adaptation of Strindberg’s “Miss Julie” by Moscow’s Theater of Nations will be performed in Russian with English supertitles, starring Chulpan Khamatova and Evgeny Mironov.Mr. Ninagawa, who is celebrating his 80th birthday, will present the American premiere of his staging of “Kafka on the Shore,” based on the Haruki Murakami novel. And the Druid Theater Company will perform Garry Hynes’s production of “DruidShakespeare: The History Plays,” a pared-down adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Richard II,” “Henry IV (Parts 1 and 2),” and “Henry V.” The plays will be performed in two parts — or back-to-back in several six-and-a-half-hour marathon performances.
