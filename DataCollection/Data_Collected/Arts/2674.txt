Let them read Houellebecq! In a push to enhance the profile of French writers and French literary culture, the cultural services of the French Embassy in New York has been signing up independent bookstores across the United States to create special sections, called French Corners, to display French works in the original and in translation.Politics and Prose in Washington, Powell’s Books in Portland and the Book Cellar in Chicago, to name three, have ordered books from two lists drawn up by Albertine, the embassy’s  bookstore on Fifth Avenue, and promoted them through special displays and promotional events. One list is a mix of 75 classics and contemporary works in French; the other is 60 books in English translation and 15 in French. The goal, a spokeswoman for the embassy said, is to plant the French flag in one bookstore in every major city in the United States, other than New York.“It’s long overdue,” said Vivienne Evans, a manager at Books and Books in Miami Beach, whose three branches in the Miami area have set up French Corners. “It’s a great relief to point our huge number of French tourists toward this section. We should do Portuguese too.”Brazos Bookstore in Houston gave an opening-night party in late January to kick off its new French section. Keaton Patterson, the store’s buyer, said that about a hundred people turned up, rather than the 30 or 40 expected, and bought somewhere between a third and a half of the 70 titles on hand, all in French. “It’s expats plus Francophiles,” he said, describing the customer base. Other bookstores taking part in the program are Brookline Booksmith in Boston and Nunu Arts and Culture Collective in Arnaudville, La.
