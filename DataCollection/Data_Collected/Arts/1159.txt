The Brooklyn-based architecture firm, REX has been selected to reconceive the Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center, which was originally designed by Frank Gehry.The decision, announced Friday, is a significant step forward for a building that has been problematic since it was first introduced as part of Daniel Libeskind’s master plan for the site formerly known as ground zero.REX, led by Joshua Prince-Ramus, was one of three finalists considered for the center, along with Henning Larsen of Denmark and UNStudio of  The Netherlands. Davis Brody Bond will be the executive architect.Mr. Prince-Ramus was formerly a partner of Rem Koolhaas, running the American operations for the Office for Metropolitan Architecture from its New York office, where he was the partner in charge of the Seattle Central Library.His firm’s projects include the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre in Dallas and the Vakko Fashion Center in Istanbul.“We wanted to create something that is simple, elegant and timeless,” Mr. Prince-Ramus said of the performing arts center in a telephone interview. “We’ve been able to reduce the project to the essence of what it needs to be.”Indeed, the project had to be reduced, since the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which oversees the former World Trade Center site, in July insisted that the project come in at no more than $200 million — about half the original estimated cost.While this forced him to revise his proposal, Mr. Prince-Ramus said he was undeterred. “It’s a chance to purge things that didn’t work and you now know how to fix them,” he said, “and to have the opportunity to rethink.”Last week the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation released the first $10 million of the $99 million designated for the project; the balance of the cost – still to be determined – will be raised privately.The 80,000 square-foot center, to be completed in 2019, will produce works of theater, dance, music, opera and film. The building will also be home to the annual Tribeca Film Festival.“A performing arts center was always part of the overall master plan for the rebuilt World Trade Center site,” John Zuccotti, chairman of the Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center, said in a statement. “We can now move forward with vigor.”
