It’s always a hot night in Havana wherever and whenever Lizt Alfonso Dance Cuba performs. In her “Cuba Vibra!,” Ms. Alfonso’s Havana-based company, in only 95 minutes, will celebrate the development of Cuban music and dance from the 1950s to the present with the aid of 18 dancers and an onstage big band. The troupe, founded by Ms. Alfonso in 1991 as an all-female group, now includes men.What hasn’t changed is Ms. Alfonso’s desire to present a kaleidoscopic fusion of ballet, flamenco, cha-cha, rumba, bolero and salsa dance in a theatrical manner that emphasizes ensemble unity: The feelings may be boisterous, but all steps interlock in perfect synchronization. This is dancing with precise abandon. The New Victory Theater, which specializes in family entertainments, recommends Dance Cuba for audiences over the age of 6 — in other words, almost everyone.
