Bono, the lead singer of U2, has announced on the band’s website that he may never play the guitar again because of injuries sustained in a cycling accident in New York.In “Little Book of a Big Year: Bono’s A to Z of 2014,” a personal roundup of the year that the singer posted online on Thursday, he wrote (under “I is for Irish Pride”): “Recovery has been more difficult than I thought… As I write this, it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again. The band have reminded me that neither they nor Western civilization are depending on this.” (Bono does not play the guitar much in live performance, but mentions in his account that he plays for pleasure and when composing songs.)The cycling accident, in Central Park in mid-November, resulted in fractures on the left side of the singer’s face, and multiple fractures in his left shoulder, arm and hand. He had surgery twice and now has what he refers to as “a titanium elbow.”“I blanked out on impact and have no memory of how I ended up in New York Presbyterian with my humerus bone sticking through my leather jacket,” Bono wrote on the New Year’s Day posting, referring to the hospital where he was treated. “Very punk rock as injuries go.”In his look back at 2014, Bono wrote about his family, his fellow band members, and his thoughts on religion, capitalism, music and world affairs.He opened the post with a warning: “This is too long. You should not have time to read this. If you do get to the end of it, then you are probably on the same painkillers as me.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/03/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Bono Fears He May Never Play the Guitar Again.
