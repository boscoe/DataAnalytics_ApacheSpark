It turns out 2014 wasn’t a Kanye-less year after all. Before midnight on Wednesday, Mr. West released a new single titled “Only One,” featuring Paul McCartney, on his website and iTunes.The song is a marked shift from Mr. West’s last project, 2013’s seething, metallic and political “Yeezus.” Mr. West sings uplifting lyrics from the perspective of his late mother over autotuned gospel harmonies and Mr. McCartney’s sparse keyboard chords. He also mentions his daughter: “Tell Nori about me,” he implores at the end. Handwritten lyrics can be found in full on Mr. West’s website.He has rapped extensively about his mother, Donda West, on songs like “Hey Mama” and “Never Let Me Down.” As on those songs, she appears on “Only One” as an inspirational presence whose past struggles are intertwined with Mr. West’s current successes. “I think the storm ran out of rain / The clouds are moving,” he sings.Mr. West and Mr. McCartney have reportedly been involved in a more extended collaboration. Interestingly enough, Mr. West owes one of his early successes in part to Mr. McCartney: The sample on Jay Z’s “Encore,” which Mr. West produced in 2003, was pulled from John Holt’s cover of Mr. McCartney’s composition “I Will.”And don’t be surprised if 2015 brings much more Kanye: He has yet to release an album that already had a listening party last year.A version of this article appears in print on 01/02/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: West-McCartney Single Drops Before the Ball.
