The actor and singer Darren Criss, best known as one of the stars of the FOX series “Glee,” will be the next star performer in the title role of the musical “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” on Broadway, the producers announced on Tuesday. He will begin a 12-week engagement on April 29, replacing John Cameron Mitchell.Mr. Criss was a brief box-office sensation on Broadway in January 2012 when he did a three-week stint playing the company man J. Pierrepont Finch in “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” replacing Daniel Radcliffe. “How to Succeed” grossed a total of $4 million during those weeks, a reflection of Mr. Criss’s appeal to, among others, fans of his gay heartthrob character on “Glee,” which is now in its final season. By only doing three weeks of performances, however, Mr. Criss also created a tight ticket; whether he is enough of a draw to fill seats for 12 weeks as Hedwig, especially as “Glee” has faded in popularity, remains to be seen.“Hedwig” has become a critical and commercial hit on Broadway since the run began last March. The musical won the Tony Award for best musical revival in June – as well as a best actor Tony for its original star, Neil Patrick Harris – and recouped its $5 million capitalization in a relatively swift 15 weeks. The show was created in the 1990s by Mr. Mitchell, who wrote the book and played Hedwig in the original Off Broadway run, and Stephen Trask, who wrote the music and lyrics. Mr. Mitchell’s final performance as Hedwig on Broadway is scheduled for April 26.
