Ms. Davis will be named an officer, and Mr. Jones a chevalier, of the Order of Arts and Letters on Thursday at the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in Manhattan.Ms. Davis was made a chevalier in 1999 for her many translations. Since then, in addition to Proust and Flaubert, she has translated the autobiography of the French writer and anthropologist Michel Leiris, “Scratches: Rules of the Game, Volume One.” All three were awarded the French-American Foundation’s Annual Translation Prize. Her short stories have been published in several collections, most recently “Can’t and Won’t.” In 2013 she won the Man Booker International Prize for her body of work.Mr. Jones, who became the film festival’s director in 2012, served for many years as the associate director of programming for the Film Society of Lincoln Center and as the artistic director of the World Cinema Foundation. He has organized many retrospectives of French filmmakers, including Alain Resnais, Benoît Jacquot, Jean Eustache and Jean-Luc Godard, and has written widely on French cinema for Cahiers du Cinéma and other publications.Antonin Baudry, the cultural counselor of the French Embassy, will present the awards. In a statement he said, “Because of the piercing eye, intense curiosity, and undeniable talent of both Kent Jones and Lydia Davis, the two most important artistic media of French culture are represented in New York with great intelligence and style.”
