Turns out the French know how to peel an onion too.The brand of mystery that is inevitably described with some sort of peeling metaphor has been enjoying a moment lately, with the British “Broadchurch” leading the way.If you like the format — the mystery grows more complex with each episode as connections and back stories are revealed — then try “Witnesses,” a tasty six-episode example from France that recently became available (with subtitles) on streaming platforms including iTunes, Netflix and Amazon.There are strange goings-on in coastal Le Tréport in northwest France. Someone is digging up recently buried bodies and posing them in show houses, ghoulishly recreating a family scene.Marie Dompnier plays the smart but skittish Sandra, a detective who investigates along with a sidekick, Justin (Jan Hammenecker). But her real partner ends up being Paul, a renowned cop who retired after the death of his wife and a debilitating car wreck.AdvertisementPaul is expertly played by Thierry Lhermitte, known in France for comic roles but who here is a taciturn enigma. Paul is drawn into the case because personal effects of his appear at the crime scenes, which leads to the assumption that a criminal he put away is trying to send him a message.AdvertisementIt’s eerie with a hint of the supernatural — several witnesses report seeing a wolf at pivotal moments — and paced just right: Those layers are pulled back patiently, so viewers and actors have time to absorb them.Ms. Dompnier has an especially rich role. Not only is there tension between her and Paul, who was one of her instructors when she was training to become a police officer, but she is also worried about her marriage.The series also makes fine cinematic use of Le Tréport, especially in a scene shot on the Funiculaire, a railway that takes riders from the town upward through a tunnel and to the overlooking cliffs. It is by all accounts a delightful tourist excursion, but after watching this show you may board it with a wee bit of trepidation.A version of this article appears in print on May 12, 2015, on Page C4 of the New York edition with the headline: An Eerie Mystery, This Time in France.
