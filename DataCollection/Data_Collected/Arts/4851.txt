AdvertisementSupported byThe Week AheadBy Ken JohnsonAmong the artists who fled Berlin in the 1930s were two avant-garde photographers who met at the Bauhaus, Grete Stern (1904-1999) and Horacio Coppola (1906-2012). Stern had made her mark when she formed the studio Ringl & Pit with the photographer Ellen Auerbach (then Rosenberg). Coppola had started out in Argentina, where his interest in new modes of photography prompted a pilgrimage to the Bauhaus. After escaping Germany in 1933, they stayed briefly in Britain, where they married, then moved to Buenos Aires. There Coppola produced a celebrated series of images of the city; Stern made portraits of writers and artists including Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda. In the late ’40s and early ’50s, she created Surrealistic, protofeminist and often comical montages for the women’s magazine Idilio. Opening Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, “From Bauhaus to Buenos Aires: Grete Stern and Horacio Coppola” presents more than 300 works, including vintage photos and photomontages, typographical designs, advertising and experimental films.
