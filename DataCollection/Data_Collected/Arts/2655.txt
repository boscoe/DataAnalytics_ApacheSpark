The Times covered the 57th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday night, with photos from the red carpet, live commentary during the telecast and more.Dave ItzkoffTake me to church. Is this like a pre-emptive subtweet of the Academy Awards?Jon CaramanicaThere must have been actual Grammy magic floating around tonight because the show managed to make John Legend better than Beyoncé, for at least a few minutes. I felt like she was a little lost inside her song, “Take My Hand, Precious Lord.”Dave Itzkoff I take your point, but I thought the Beyoncé performance was pretty stellar. How strange that the show closed with an artist (Beyoncé) and a movie (“Selma”) that were overshadowed or otherwise ignored.Jon CaramanicaMaybe because after a night full of soporific performances, this was the only one with a palpable pulse? The Grammys was like a UCB folk-music sketch this year.Dave ItzkoffYes, those were their aces up their sleeves. Someone knew Beck would win.Jon CaramanicaIs it even worth being dispirited by that? I’m far more vexed by Beck’s win than any of Sam Smith’s, for what it’s worth.Dave ItzkoffMaybe I’m just restating your question, but can I say that I genuinely enjoyed this show, while being disappointed by so many of the wins?Jon Caramanica You can say that. I don’t know if you’d be right, but you can say that. The speed of this show was so slow, the energy so low, that it’s hard to feel warmly even about the high points.Dave ItzkoffReally! The Kanye solo performance? The Rihanna/Kanye/Paul performance? Dwight Yoakam and Brandy Clark? These mean nothing to you?!Jon CaramanicaThose were wondrous! I submit! But so much space between them. I like that the Grammys were willing to let Kanye do two new songs and that he repaid them by letting them know just how little he respected their statuettes.Dave ItzkoffHe was my big winner tonight, even over Sam Smith. And he patched things up with Taylor Swift!Jon CaramanicaI like to think that photo is really of the two of us, live-bloggers brought together by destiny.Dave ItzkoffNo matter what Kanye said, smiling makes me smile.Jon CaramanicaEnjoy your vacation, Dave – will miss you at the Oscars!Dave ItzkoffThanks man. Will try to check ’em out when I’m not changing diapers.Dave ItzkoffTime for silence and sadness. R.I.P. A$AP YAMS. Did I miss Dave Brockie?Dave ItzkoffAll right, Sam Smith, you have 10 seconds to accept your award.Jon CaramanicaSam took Taylor’s award and also her narrative. Pretty sneaky, bruh.Dave Itzkoff They’re friends, though, so it’s O.K.Jon Caramanica Sam Smith winning Grammys is the new Sam Smith winning Grammys.Dave Itzkoff Taylor didn’t leap out of her seat with quite the same pep this time.Jon CaramanicaIt’s hard to wear heels for so many hours, Dave.Dave ItzkoffI think we found the perfect position for Chris Martin: backup singer for Beck.Jon CaramanicaEven actual folk singers are out here like, you guys are too chill.Dave ItzkoffJust the right amount of Chill. People need their blood calmed after that Beck win/Beyoncé loss.Jon CaramanicaIt’s as if the Grammys are taunting me – upset that Beck won album of the year? Now listen to him!Dave ItzkoffOnce again, Taylor Swift first out of her seat to congratulate the winner.
“I’m having a really, really, really good night.” – Sam Smith.Jon CaramanicaI’m beginning to think she’s just preemptively jumping up, like a linebacker anticipating the snap.Dave ItzkoffShe would have gotten called offsides a few times tonight. Also, they played off Sam Smith in his moment of triumph.Jon CaramanicaThey’re being ruthless tonight with the play-off music, which is strange given that there have only been like seven awards handed out.Dave ItzkoffIt’s also called thinking, Jon.Jon CaramanicaI wouldn’t know!Dave ItzkoffDid i just hear, “Ladies and gentlemen, Shia LaBeouf”?Jon CaramanicaStrictly legends tonight. Wait is this actually Kristen Wiig?Dave ItzkoffUm it sure looks like it? Paul Feig, help us out?Jon Caramanica Insert “Frances Ha” joke?Dave ItzkoffWe’ve seen this done in a few settings already (including the Saturday Night Live stage) but I like that this can fit in the Grammys, too.Dave ItzkoffThat was actually tremendous. Kanye wouldn’t have broken that up.+@sia, #KristenWiig & @maddieziegler performing #chandelier live on @CBS! #GRAMMYs— The GRAMMYs (@TheGRAMMYs) February 9, 2015Dave ItzkoffThis particular Juanes performance did not exactly knock my socks off. And now I have to deal with Prince.Jon CaramanicaWhat were we saying about quoting Kanye all night?Dave ItzkoffKanye the God.Jon CaramanicaThat was about as gesturally perfect as an award-show moment can getDave ItzkoffIn 1,000 years we will only remember that Kanye stepped on and off the stage, not that Prince was there or that the award went to Beck.Jon CaramanicaMary J. Blige being exceedingly polite not blowing Sam Smith off the stage right now. That’s his real prize tonight.Dave ItzkoffI thought it was a genuinely good duet. Each enhancing the other. You?Jon Caramanica I think Mary was being polite! She didn’t want to take Sam’s Grammys and go home. When I saw them do that at the Apollo she absolutely eviscerated him.Dave ItzkoffKANYE. RIHANNA. SIR PAUL.Jon CaramanicaSTOP EVERYTHING. Seriously STOP.Dave ItzkoffNot even blinking. [Several blink-less minutes later…] Well, that was the best performance of the night. Period. Even if Paul appeared to have mic problems.Jon CaramanicaPaul had the least effective microphone and also the least effective blazer.Dave Itzkoff I liked Paul still strumming away at his guitar even after the song was over and the crowd was applauding.Jon CaramanicaThat could have been a mess but it was instead something of a miracle, and even made sense as part of the country segment. Plus, Rihanna actually deigned to sing! The most rare gift of all.Dave ItzkoffShe was appropriately intense.Jon CaramanicaPaul doesn’t know a single word to that song — the definition of just-happy-to-be-here.Jon Caramanica I have very mixed feelings about Eric Church, but not about this song, which is beautiful.Dave ItzkoffWhat is the anti-argument?Jon Caramanica I just wish he would admit that he’s as shameless as everyone else.Dave Itzkoff Was this always designed as a song as about worldwide strife?Jon Caramanica I mean, maybe it was on an episode of M.A.S.H. one time? Let us not mistake Eric Church for an Ideas Bro. Dwight Yoakam on the other hand …Dave ItzkoffReally showing how these different genres all represent the music industry by giving each one its own ghetto during the broadcast.Jon CaramanicaAlso showing how each genre has its own way to be ponderous – very helpful!
