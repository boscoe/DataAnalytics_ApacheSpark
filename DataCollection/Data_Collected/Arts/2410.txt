It’s the action of a hostess, though Ms. Evans isn’t cordial. As a cold abstraction of a social gesture, and as an indication of Ms. Evans’s close control over every part of her work, this is an apt introduction to what follows.The setting, at Issue Project Room in Downtown Brooklyn, is also coldly formal: a ballroom made for an Elks Lodge, with a high, vaulted ceiling and lots of marble. At first, the choreography is precise, minimalist and repetitive. And much of it continues in that mode, as the five dancers work out patterns and permutations, shifting among orientations and speeds, coming and going like changings of the guard.Yet they also hold hands, as in folk dance, and move together in circles and lines. Occasionally, they include a seated viewer in their circle, connecting by hand clasp; the gesture is at once sweet and cultishly creepy. The costumes, by Alan Calpe and Christopher Crawford, are austerely black, yet also sparkling with sequins and fringed for twirling. The minimalist vocabulary admits shimmying shoulders, rippling torsos, rolling hips. These are moves associated with getting down on a different kind of dance floor. At Issue Project Room, accompanied by David Watson’s score of low drones and long violin lines that have been partly erased, the moves are abstracted. The performers maintain eye contact with one another and even smile — Maggie Cloud appears to be having a ball — but much of “Social Dance” can feel like social dance drained of pleasure, of life. That is, until the middle of the work, when a repressed energy seems to break out. To the sound of wolf whistles, Ms. Cloud and Sarah Beth Percival, facing each other, shuttle across the length of the space in a kind of chase. To the sound of a vibraphone, one dancer after another spins off from the marching group and returns to it, and the work’s equation of order and disorder turns electrically dynamic. A series of duets plays excitingly with the paradoxical ratios of intimacy and proximity in contemporary social dance. In this hot core, all the work’s elements, including Madeline Best’s careful lighting, loosen up and activate. Once relaxed, however, the dance loses coherence, and Ms. Evans re-establishes order by reverting to the dutiful patterning of the beginning. There’s a late charge of freedom in a final solo for the captivating Ms. Cloud, a person escaping the system, but it is not quite a climax. Choreography has stifled dancing, which may be Ms. Evans’s point. Advertisement
