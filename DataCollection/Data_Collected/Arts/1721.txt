Among those who did not make the cut this year are Chic, which has now been turned down for a record 10th time; the alternative rock heroes Nine Inch Nails and the Smiths; and Janet Jackson, whose first-time nomination had its own Facebook support group.The other rejected nominees this year are Chaka Khan; the Cars; the J.B.’s, one of James Brown’s classic backing bands; Los Lobos; the Spinners; and Yes, the progressive-rock stars whose absence from the hall has long rankled fans.The music world has been closely watching the results of the secretive Rock Hall process, after the organization this year dismissed a large contingent of its influential nominating committee and, according to reports, made an effort to expand its membership with younger voters and more women. But that process has yet to yield any radical changes.N.W.A, the pioneering gangsta rap group, is only the fifth hip-hop act to join the Rock Hall, after Grandmaster Flash, Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy. The group had been on the ballot three times before; this year they were the subject of a hit biopic, “Straight Outta Compton,” which has grossed over $161 million at the box office and is considered a contender in the film awards season.The inducted members of Deep Purple — the British band that helped define the sludgy musical language of heavy metal — include most of those from its classic period of the late 1960s to mid-70s: Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Rod Evans, Glenn Hughes and David Coverdale. But it does not include Nick Simper, the band’s founding bassist, or Tommy Bolin, who played guitar on only one studio album (“Come Taste the Band,” 1975).Performers become eligible for nomination 25 years after the release of their first record, and nominees are voted on by a pool of more than 800 critics, executives, music experts and past winners. As it has for the last several years, the Rock Hall counted one “fans’ ballot” among the others, with artists chosen by members of the general public.The ceremony in Brooklyn, where the awards were last held in 2014, will be taped by HBO and broadcast later in the spring.Advertisement
