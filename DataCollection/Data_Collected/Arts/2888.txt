CreditEmon Hassan for The New York Times        Hard to believe but true: An exhibition that includes three major works from Florence, Italy, by the early Renaissance sculptor Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi, a.k.a. Donatello (1386-1466), has come to New York, and it’s not at the Metropolitan Museum of Art or the Frick Collection. It’s at the Museum of Biblical Art, a 10-year-old institution not noted for producing once-in-a-lifetime shows, and it’s a beautiful, soul-stirring exhibition. It’s also a terrific valedictory show, as the museum will be leaving its current location at the end of June because of the building’s recent sale by the American Bible Society. Where it may reopen is yet to be determined.Although he’s the star, Donatello is not the only subject of “Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces From Florence Cathedral,” which opens on Friday. Along with his three masterpieces, including one that’s widely regarded as his greatest work, and another half-dozen or so works attributed to him wholly or in part, are pieces by or attributed to Nanni di Banco (circa 1386-1421), Donatello’s main competitor. With the addition of a series of octagonal marble reliefs (1437-39) by Luca della Robbia and wooden models of the cathedral’s enormous dome and its lantern attributed to the dome’s designer, Filippo Brunelleschi, the exhibition amounts to a tightly cropped snapshot of the birth of the Renaissance, a Janus-headed time that looked back to the art of ancient Rome, away from medieval dogmatism and forward to the modern world’s faith in the primacy of human thought and creativity.All the exhibition’s 23 pieces are from the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo (Florence Cathedral’s museum), which houses works that once were part of the fabric of the church but were removed at different times to make way for changes in its design. Organized by Timothy Verdon, the museum’s director, and Daniel M. Zolli, a Donatello scholar, the exhibition came to the Museum of Biblical Art, its only stop, because no other museum could accommodate a schedule that would have it return home in time for the Duomo museum’s reopening in November after renovations.The Museum of Biblical Art’s single-gallery installation has white scrims behind groups of works, creating an ethereal background. Designed by Cooper Joseph Studio (now Studio Joseph) of New York, the exhibition leads viewers past sculptures that are just emerging from the late-medieval Gothic period. A pair of slightly smaller-than-life standing figures represent the angel of the Annunciation, Gabriel, and the Virgin Mary, who stares wide-eyed with a look of concern and raises one hand in a gesture of alarm. Made in the late 14th century and attributed to Giovanni d’Ambrogio, they are adorable.AdvertisementAnother beguiling twosome is a pair of boys in biblical robes called profetinos (little prophets), one dated between 1406 and 1409 attributed to Donatello and the other, from 1406, to Nanni. Donatello’s has the more complicated garb and a funny detail: As he walks forward he’s stepping on the hem of his robe with his right foot.AdvertisementAt the gallery’s far end comes a giant leap into the Renaissance with a spectacular display of two bigger-than-life marble sculptures: Donatello’s “St. John the Evangelist” (1408-1415) and Nanni’s “St. Luke the Evangelist” (1408-1413). They originally stood guard at the right and left sides of the cathedral’s main entrance, stern greeters for churchgoers. It’s fascinating to compare them.The “St. John” was the first large-scale effort by Donatello, who began his career as an apprentice to Lorenzo Ghiberti,  creator of two celebrated sets of gilded bronze doors for the cathedral’s baptistery, the first made between 1403 and 1424, and the second, “The Gates of Paradise,” produced between 1425 and 1452. St. John sits upright in a robe that drapes in deep folds from his knees and pools on the floor around his feet. Seven feet high when seated, he appears in his mid-60s with thick, curly hair; a long, wavy beard; and a deeply furrowed brow. A heavy tome rests on his left thigh under one dangling hand; the other hand, which might once have held a writing implement, lies on his other knee. He turns his head slightly and looks up to his right as if listening to something no one else can hear, something that he might write in his book. Michelangelo’s “Moses” (1513-15) comes to mind, and with good reason: Growing up in Florence, Michelangelo would have been intimately acquainted with Donatello’s “St. John.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He, too, sits in extravagantly draped robes, with a book on one thigh. But his hair and beard are more neatly groomed, and he has a haughty, imperious expression. He looks down to his left through half-closed eyes as if judging the worth of people passing through the cathedral doors. While St. Luke seems complacently authoritative, St. John seems spiritually galvanized. Together these sculptures vividly illustrate the difference between the excellent and the great.If the proportions of “St. John” and “St. Luke” seem a bit off, it’s because they were made to occupy 10-foot-high niches. As Mr. Zolli explains in the exhibition catalog, Donatello and Nanni both made calculated adjustments so that their figures would appear natural to viewers from below. Here they are raised on nearly chest-high pedestals, diminishing the effect, but the distortions are noteworthy nevertheless because they are signs of the artists’ postmedieval modernity. Like painters of the time who were following the new science of perspective, these sculptors were thinking of how things would look not to God but to individual human beings.Donatello and another sculptor, Nanni di Bartolo, were commissioned to collaborate on another of the exhibition’s largest works, “Abraham and Isaac (the Sacrifice of Isaac)” (1421), though scholars believe Nanni’s contribution was relatively minor. Standing about six feet tall with one foot resting on a pile of kindling the long-bearded father, has grasped his naked, kneeling son’s hair, baring his neck for the fatal stroke of the knife that he, Abraham, holds in his veined right hand. He has rolled the sleeve of his right arm to the elbow in preparation. But he has stopped, resting his blade on Isaac’s shoulder. He’s turned his head and looked up to his left having just heard God reverse his initial commandment. Carved from a single block of marble, the sculpture’s realism is most impressive in the silky folds of cloth covering Abraham’s torso. But it’s also in the psychological aspect. Like St. John, Donatello’s Abraham is seen in an instant of sudden, divinely inspired awareness.The show’s most realistic sculpture and the work widely considered to be Donatello’s greatest is “Prophet” (1435-36), which is popularly known as “Lo Zuccone,” or “Pumpkin Head,” because of his bald, high-domed pate. Scholars think he is the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk. Standing just over six feet in robes that fall in deeply carved folds, he has one powerful arm and shoulder bared, and he looks downward from deep-set eyes, his wide mouth half open, giving him an expression possibly of profound thought or of exhaustion. (You have to imagine him looking down from on high, as he was originally installed in a third-story niche outside the cathedral’s bell tower.) Turning his head one way and pulling his shoulder back the other way, he has a gaunt, rangy muscularity. In different outfits he could be an ancient Roman gladiator or a basketball player during a timeout in the fourth quarter of a tight game.Unlike Donatello’s St. John and Abraham, who are more generic, old-man types, “Lo Zuccone” seems a portrait of a particular individual. Mr. Zolli notes that some Florentines in the late 15th century thought he was the politician Giovanni Cherichini. The 16th-century art historian Vasari circulated the legend that Donatello ordered his sculpture to speak to him while he was working on it. It does speak — you just have to listen with your eyes.“Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces From Florence Cathedral” runs through June 14 at the Museum of Biblical Art, 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street; 212-408-1500, mobia.org.
