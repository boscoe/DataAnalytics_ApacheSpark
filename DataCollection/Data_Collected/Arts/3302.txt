The curator of the 56th Venice Biennale, which opens May 9 – and which celebrates the 120th anniversary of the international art exhibition – announced his lineup of artists on Thursday, a highly diverse global group whose work often focuses on the tangled aftermath of colonialism and the effects of late capitalism.The heart of the exhibition, in an area that the 2015 biennale’s visual director Okwui Enwezor calls the “arena,” will be an auditorium where “an epic live reading” of all three volumes of Marx’s “Das Kapital” will be conducted by actors daily during the show’s seven-month run. Mr. Enwezor, a highly regarded globe-trotting curator who is director of the Haus der Kunst in Munich, said he thought of the daily reading as the equivalent of a Sikh tradition in which scripture is read constantly by a relay of readers, and he added that hoped the performance would communicate the “concept of the song and the potential of the human voice to be an instrument that carries forward the pace of a narrative.”The show’s roster, 136 artists in all, includes many art-world veterans – like Adrian Piper, Hans Haacke, Bruce Nauman, Marlene Dumas and Thomas Hirschhorn – whose work addresses political issues in direct and sometimes ferocious ways. But the work of many younger and lesser known artists from 90 countries – Tania Bruguera, Mika Rottenberg, Ayoung Kim, Jeremy Deller and Abounaddara, the anonymous Syrian collective – will also sprawl throughout the show’s main sites and outdoor spaces.In a news conference at the Italian Cultural Institute on Thursday, Mr. Enwezor cited as his inspiration for the show a celebrated passage from an essay by the philosopher Walter Benjamin about the “angel of history,” which “would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed.”“But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings,” the essay continues, ending: “This storm is what we call progress.”   A version of this article appears in print on 03/14/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Venice Biennale Announces Artists.
