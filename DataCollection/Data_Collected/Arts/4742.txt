The band Mumford & Sons scored its second No. 1 on the Billboard album chart this week, with “Wilder Mind,” its latest release, selling 231,000 copies, according to Nielsen.“Wilder Mind” (Glassnote) ditches the banjos that characterized Mumford & Sons’ first two albums and spurred a folk-rock mini-revival; the group’s last LP, “Babel,” released in September 2012, won the Grammy for album of the year and eventually sold 2.7 million copies. Instead, the new record’s electric guitars have drawn comparisons to U2.Yet while “Wilder Mind” easily beat its competition, it was not quite the opening-week blockbuster that “Babel” was. That album started with 600,000 sales, and in its first week songs from the album were streamed eight  million times on Spotify in the United States, a record at the time. (Billboard began counting streams on its chart six months ago.)Reflecting the rapid growth of streaming, “Wilder Mind” registered 15.4 million streams in the United States in its opening week, Nielsen said, with 12 million of them on Spotify alone, according to that company — impressive numbers, but far from record-setting. In February, for example, Drake notched 48 million streams in a single week, and the next month Kendrick Lamar had nearly 39 million.Also this week, Josh Groban’s “Stages” (Reprise) holds at No. 2 for a second week and the latest edition of the compilation franchise “Now That’s What I Call Music!” — this one is Vol. 54, with songs by Taylor Swift, Maroon 5 and Walk the Moon — opens at No. 3.Tech N9ne, a rapper from Kansas City, Mo., opens at No. 4 with “Special Effects” (Strange), and last week’s chart topper, Zac Brown Band’s “Jekyll + Hyde” (Varvatos/Republic/Big Machine), fell four spots to No. 5. In the next-highest-charting debut, My Morning Jacket opened at No. 11 with “The Waterfall” (ATO/Capitol).A version of this article appears in print on 05/14/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Mumford & Sons Is No. 1.
