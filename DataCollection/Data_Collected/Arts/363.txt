A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events Battles  (Tuesday) These righteous avant-garde rockers from New York conjure a spectral parade; the stage show for their cameo-heavy 2011 album, “Gloss Drop,” projects the disembodied heads of their guest vocalists behind live instrumentation. It proved truly eerie how well the bawdy, floating face of Gary Numan complemented their abstract funk swagger. The group released an equally solid new record, “La Di Da Di,” last month. At 9 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Stacey Anderson)Chris Cornell  (Sunday and Monday) The raspy, trenchant singer of Soundgarden — and former raspy, caterwauling singer of Audioslave — performed acoustically when he last hit the Beacon Theater, the Upper West Side’s most regal stage, and reminded many rock devotees of his operatically stunning range. He recently released a folk-inflected fourth solo studio album, “Higher Truth.” At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)Frankie Cosmos and Dent May  (Friday) Greta Kline, the leader of the group Frankie Cosmos, constructs preternaturally poised lo-fi folk-pop with thoughtful verses and echoing vocals. She released its debut, “Zentropy,” last spring; the art set has already sought to claim her, as evidenced by a high-profile set at the Museum of Modern Art last summer. Dent May, a ukulele-wielding old soul, updates saccharine lounge swing with rampant pop-friendly hooks and tongue-in-cheek lyrics. His CMJ Music Marathon sets reliably deliver a fey antidote to the trendy hysteria of the week. At 6:30 p.m., the Wick, 260 Meserole Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, thewicknyc.com. (Anderson)Ex Hex  (Friday) This rock trio fronted by Mary Timony — a veteran of Wild Flag and Helium — is rich with jangling guitars and Ms. Timony’s echoing, stoic vocals. The band’s debut single, “Hot and Cold,” was chipper, with inflections of grunge and punk, and had a kitschy, food-obsessed music video; the boisterous debut album “Rips” came out last year. With Titus Andronicus and Spider Bags; part of CMJ Marathon. At 6:30 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 866-777-8932, warsawconcerts.com. (Anderson)Thomas Gold  (Saturday) Mr. Gold, a Berlin-based D.J. with an international following, often brings brass players and drummers onstage, a welcome addition in the mostly prerecorded dance world. Since releasing his first tracks in 2006, he has steadily encroached on the pop sphere with his dance remixes, including reworkings of Lady Gaga and Adele singles. At 10 p.m., Baroque, 19-44 Steinway Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-274-2777, baroquenyc.com. (Anderson)Hanson  (Friday and Saturday) The blond teen pop idols turned Billy Joel-nicking contemporary rockers started selling their own beer, Mmmhops, two years ago, a decade and a half after their earworm single of a similar name. They released their sixth studio album, “Anthem,” in 2013 as they toasted their 21st anniversary as a band. In related news, it is high time for all original tween fans of the sibling trio to contribute to their 401(k)’s. At 6 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800, irvingplaza.com. (Anderson)The Hum (Mondays through Oct. 26) This inventive weekly residency brings together female musicians across genres for collaboration. The successful first installment in April included Shilpa Ray and Teen; this time around, they’ve booked musicians from Wilsen, Balancer and Salt Cathedral, among others. At 9 p.m., Manhattan Inn, 632 Manhattan Avenue, hypnocraftpresents.com. (Andrew R. Chow)‘TIDAL X: 1020 Amplified with Jay Z’  (Tuesday) Approximately six months after its beleaguered kickoff, and the sort of disparaging press that could run dry any well, the music streaming service Tidal has reached one million users and raised its cache with exclusive releases by Madonna and Prince. Its first charity concert includes sets by its most prominent patron, Jay Z, as well as Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and Usher. At 8 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com. (Anderson)Billy Joel  (Wednesday) The piano man has achieved what the Knicks can only fantasize about: a yearlong winning streak at Madison Square Garden. His open-ended monthly residency, which began in January 2014, has been billed by the arena as its fourth franchise. So far, it has included hearty appearances by Sting, John Mellencamp and Brian Johnson of AC/DC, as well as many euphoric singalongs to “New York State of Mind.” At 8 p.m., 800-745-3000, billyjoelmsg.com. (Anderson)★ Mark Knopfler  (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Dire Straits frontman and Bob Dylan tourmate is both an elegant fingerstyle guitarist and an affecting, unpretentious pop vocalist and composer. The Scotsman’s scores to the cult-hit films “Local Hero” and “The Princess Bride” have introduced his easy grace to a new generation; he released a solo album, “Tracker,” in March. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)★ ‘Power 105.1 Powerhouse with Kendrick Lamar and Future’  (Thursday) This famed hip-hop and R&B radio station brings some of its most-played acts to the Barclays Center. The sure-footed rapper Kendrick Lamar was robbed of a MTV Video of the Year trophy this year for “Alright,” his bracing credo of faith and prosperity among modern racial friction. The rapper and singer Future also continues to set a high bar for innovative wordplay and slick, self-possessed showmanship. With Big Sean, Fetty Wap, Meek Mill and more. At 7 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com. (Anderson)Bettye LaVette  (Friday) Her 2005 comeback album, “I’ve Got My Own Hell to Raise,” a collection of songs by women, was a soulful highlight of that year. A performer since the early ’60s who toured with James Brown and Otis Redding, Ms. LaVette has the steamroller charisma to invigorate the night. “Thankful N’ Thoughtful,” released in 2012, celebrated her 50th anniversary in the business. At 9:45 p.m., City Winery, 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, 212-608-0555, citywinery.com. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret The fall’s splashiest event is the return of the New York Cabaret Convention — now in its 26th year — to the Town Hall, the place it all began. Maureen McGovern is the biggest name in the Oct. 16 double-barreled finale, “What I Did For/Take a Chance on /Love: The Music of Vernon Duke and Marvin Hamlisch.” (At 6 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, thetownhall.org.) Other notable October engagements include the jazz singer Kurt Elling swinging Sinatra standards at Café Carlyle (Oct. 13 through 17), followed by Alexa Ray Joel, Billy’s singing and songwriting daughter, on Oct. 20 through 24 and Oct. 27 through 31. (At 8:45 p.m., with an additional performance on Oct. 17 at 10:45 p.m.; 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com.) Jarrod Spector and Kelli Barrett’s show, “This Is Dedicated: Music’s Greatest Marriages,” at Feinstein’s/54 Below, salutes married show business couples from Sonny and Cher, to Beyoncé and Jay-Z (Oct. 20 through 23). Also at that venue, on Oct. 28 through 31, Barb Jungr and John McDaniel eviscerate the songs of the Fab Four in “Come Together: The Music of the Beatles.” (At 7 p.m., 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, 646-476-3551, 54below.com.) In more dangerous avant-garde mode, Tammy Faye Starlite’s “Cabaret Marianne” pays tribute to the equally nervy Marianne Faithfull (Thursdays in October at 7:30 p.m., 178 Second Avenue, between East 11th and 12th Streets, East Village, 212-995-0900, pangeanyc.com.) And that’s just skimming the surface. (Stephen Holden)Kate Nash  (Saturday) Once a blunt pop-tart singer in the Lily Allen mold, Ms. Nash has taken up riot grrrl angst and more mature confessionals on her third album, “Girl Talk.” A smart new pinup fashion style matches incisive words. With Balthazar; part of the CMJ Music Marathon. At 7:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, boweryballroom.com. (Anderson)New York Night Train’s CMJ Soul Clap & Dance-Off With DJ Jonathan Toubin  (Saturday) Mr. Toubin, one of the most popular spinners in Williamsburg and the founder of the New York Night Train dance parties, is an appreciative font of American pop and soul music history. He reprises his popular party, which recently migrated uptown for a lively night at Lincoln Center’s Midsummer Night Swing. At 11:59 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com. (Anderson)Old 97’s  (Tuesday and Wednesday) An alternative-country torchbearer since the early 1990s, this Dallas band once shared a major label with Third Eye Blind and the Prodigy. Its debut for the imprint, “Too Far to Care,” catered to outlaw-rock fans instead of MTV viewers and helped the group earn the cult favor it still enjoys. It released the raucous album “Most Messed Up” last year. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com. (Anderson)★ Opeth  (Thursday) The best in garrulous Swedish death metal roosts on the Upper West Side this week. Opeth, which charted expectedly dark waters on its 11th studio album, “Pale Communion,” released last year, now mark 25 years together; the group will attempt a loud retrospective in this two-set performance. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)★ Protomartyr  (Friday) The Detroit post-punks grapple with portentously heavy topics on their new studio effort, “The Agent Intellect” — parental death, depression, urban isolation. However, the singer Joe Casey delivers his narratives with such clear, dazzling honesty that the experience takes a subtly optimistic sheen. It’s a remarkable, haunting album throughout. With Omni, Lemon Twigs and more; part of the CMJ Marathon. At 7:30 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, roughtradenyc.com. (Anderson)Steely Dan  (Friday and Saturday) The most triumphant intellectual jazz-rockers of the 1970s, Steely Dan amassed a fervid cult following for their obsessively conceptual albums and unpredictable muses (Charlemagne, for one). Now the front men, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, return for a retrospective residency that began earlier this week. It features sets devoted to the performance of a record in its entirety, including the much-adored “Aja” and “Gaucho.” At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)★ Gwen Stefani  (Saturday) The timelessly chic Ms. Stefani — patron saint to all California girls, blond or otherwise — has tilted heavily toward solo projects since the release of her band No Doubt’s last album, the pop-and-dance-hall-leaning “Push and Shove” of 2012. She’s brought a rallying warmth to the judges’ roster of “The Voice,” paired with Eminem for a brash rap-rock anthem (“Kings Never Die” on the “Southpaw” film soundtrack) and laid down prep for another solo album. At 8 p.m., Manhattan Center Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Anderson)Tove Lo  (Wednesday) This young electropop singer has been called the Swedish Kesha for her party-hearty, debauched lyrics. Her debut album, “Queen of the Clouds,” is broken into three groups of tracks — “The Sex,” “The Love” and “The Pain” — and has some sharp hook writing, similar to her contributions to works by Icona Pop and Lea Michele. With Erik Hassle. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Yuna  (Wednesday) Nirvana’s “Come as You Are” is in good hands with this jazzy pop chanteuse from Malaysia; her cover of the grunge hit writhes with tempestuous keys and her gorgeous falsetto lilt. Her second album released stateside, “Nocturnal,” had flashes of Ronettes retroism and folksy harmonies, but veered more soul-pop with collaborations with members of Quadron and the Neptunes. With Abhi/Dijon. At 9 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, roughtradenyc.com. (Anderson)Advertisement
