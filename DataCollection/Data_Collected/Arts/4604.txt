Dance will be on the program of the official opening of the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday at the Palais des Festivals. Benjamin Millepied, the director of the Paris Opera Ballet, will present a five-minute piece, set to a section of Bernard Hermann’s music for Alfred Hitchcock’s “Vertigo.”“It’s the best film score,” Mr. Millepied wrote in an email. “Hermann’s music lends itself to dance and is very beautiful.”The piece centers on the moment when the leading character (played by James Stewart) in the movie rediscovers the woman (Kim Novak) he thought had died. The work will feature 17 dancers, many from Mr. Millepied’s L.A. Dance Project, including Morgan Lugo, who will dance one of the central roles alongside the former New York City Ballet principal Janie Taylor and the Paris Opera Ballet soloist Leonore Baulac. Mr. Millepied will also be playing a supportive role at Cannes. His wife, Natalie Portman, has directed a film, “A Tale of Love and Darkness,” which she will present out of competition at the festival.A version of this article appears in print on 05/09/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Millepied to Take On ‘Vertigo’ at Cannes.
