Gabriel Byrne and Jessica Lange will play James and Mary Tyrone on Broadway in Eugene O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey into Night,” the Roundabout Theater Company announced on Tuesday.The production, which will also star John Gallagher Jr. as the couple’s son Edmund,  will begin previews on March 31 and open on April 19 at the American Airlines Theater. Jonathan Kent will direct.The revival is being produced by the Roundabout in association with Ryan Murphy, the co-creator of the FX television series “American Horror Story,” which gave Ms. Lange an enormous career lift, including two Emmy awards.  Mr. Murphy, who holds the stage rights to “Long Day’s Journey,” approached Todd Haimes, the theater’s artistic director, with the idea of a production with Ms. Lange, a spokesman for the theater said.Ms. Lange appeared as Mary, the drug-addicted matriarch of a fractured family, in London’s West End in 2000. She was nominated for an Olivier award for her performance. She was last seen on Broadway in “The Glass Menagerie” in 2005, and played Blanche DuBois in “A Streetcar Named Desire” in 1992. Mr. Byrne is no stranger to O’Neill, either. He appeared at the Roundabout in the lead role in “A Touch of the Poet” in 2005 and received a Tony nomination  for his performance in “A Moon for the Misbegotten” in 2000.
