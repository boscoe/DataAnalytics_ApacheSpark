Jean-Luc Godard’s 3-D film “Goodbye to Language” took top honors from the National Society of Film Critics on Saturday, edging out Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” by just one vote for best picture.In voting held at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, Mr. Godard’s film received 25 of 69 votes for best picture. “Boyhood,” which the New York Film Critics Circle named best picture last month, followed with 24 votes. “Birdman” and “Mr. Turner” tied for third with 10 votes each. The society, made up of critics from major newspapers and outlets across the country, seemed in line with the New York critics’ views.  Winners from the two groups were identical in seven of the society’s nine categories: Mr. Linklater, best director;  “Citizenfour,” best nonfiction film; “Grand Budapest Hotel,” for best screenplay;  Timothy Spall of “Mr. Turner,” best actor; Marion Cotillard of “Two Days, One Night” and “The Immigrant,” best actress; J.K. Simmons of “Whiplash,” best supporting actor; Patricia Arquette of “Boyhood,” best supporting actress.Best picture aside, the only other category the two groups split on was cinematography — the society chose “Mr. Turner”  whereas the critics circle selected “The Immigrant.”  A version of this article appears in print on 01/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: In a Squeaker, a 3-D Film Tops u2018Boyhoodu2019 for Honor.
