Two Broadway shows that opened last week posted modest box office gains, according to data released on Monday by the Broadway League. Devilishly positive reviews for the new play “Hand to God,” Robert Askins’s dark comedy about a possibly demonic hand puppet, translated into a small bump. The show, which opened on Tuesday at the Booth Theater, grossed $282,901, an increase of $69,599 from the previous week. Tickets are still being heavily discounted to the show, which aims to appeal to a younger audience; last week nearly 87 percent of the seats were filled. The revival of the musical “Gigi” that opened the following night at the Neil Simon Theater grossed $635,256, up $49,808 from the week before, playing to 77 percent capacity.  Among other new shows this season, “The Audience” and “Fish in the Dark” stayed strong, earning more than $1 million for the week, as did the musical “Finding Neverland,” which officially opens on Wednesday.  The long-running musicals “The Lion King” and “Wicked” each grossed more than $2 million. The week’s biggest box office spike came for “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,” which took in $1,057,902, an increase of $221,945 from the week before.
