Could a Broadway revival of the acclaimed musical “Kiss of the Spider Woman” be on the horizon? A multiday reading of the show, the 1993 Tony Award winner for best musical, was held last week with three big theater names playing the major roles: Audra McDonald as the title character, Alan Cumming as the gay prisoner Molina, and Steven Pasquale as the Marxist revolutionary Valentin. The Tony-winning director John Tiffany (“Once”) oversaw the reading, which was organized by the producer Tom Kirdahy (“It’s Only a Play”). Mr. Kirdahy is married to the show’s book writer, Terrence McNally, and is working with the “Spider Woman” composer, John Kander, on this spring’s Broadway revival of “The Visit.” (“Spider Woman” has lyrics by Fred Ebb.)Mr. Kirdahy, in a telephone interview on Tuesday, said that he was “thrilled” with the reading and that the actors and Mr. Tiffany were pleased as well. “I think everyone is interested in having further conversations, but there is no game plan for a production at this point,” Mr. Kirdahy said.Based on the 1976 novel by Manuel Puig, “Spider Woman” centers on the relationship between two prisoners in a Latin American country and the fixation of one of them on movies and a diva known for many roles, including a deadly spider woman. The show ran on Broadway for two years and won Tonys for its three main actors as well as best book and best score, among others.An email message to a representative for Ms. McDonald, a six-time Tony winner, was not answered on Tuesday. Mr. Cumming, also a Tony winner, is currently starring on Broadway in the Kander and Ebb musical “Cabaret,” while Mr. Pasquale starred last spring in the new musical “The Bridges of Madison County.”
