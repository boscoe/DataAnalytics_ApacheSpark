Chicano Batman, from Los Angeles, plays an expanded version of 1960s Latin rock, with wah-wah pedals and organ — the kind of music a lot of non-Latin North Americans seldom heard before the age of scholarly CD reissues uncovering long-ago scenes in Peru, Chile, Brazil and Southern California. What it does is jammy, fuzzed-out and discursive, full of soul vocals and twin-guitar arrangements; it brings together elements of cumbia, bolero, vallenato and the Brazilian pop experimentalists of the late ’60s and early ’70s. The band members play in ruffled, powder-blue tuxedo shirts and deliver party music from top to bottom, with stylish attention to tube amps and analog warmth. But their sets are serious business: You can climb into one of them and follow it a long way. They’re rarely in New York but will perform three times this week: Sunday at the Loisaida Festival, in the East Village (loisaidafest.org); that evening at Brooklyn Bowl, in Williamsburg (brooklynbowl.com); and on Wednesday at Subrosa, in the West Village (subrosanyc.com).A version of this article appears in print on May 24, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Latin Rock Served With ’60s Spice.
