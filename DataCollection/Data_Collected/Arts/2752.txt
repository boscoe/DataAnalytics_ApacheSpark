As her personal interests shifted increasingly toward painting, she packed the photographs away. They recently resurfaced in storage and Southfirst has been smart enough to make a beautiful show of them.As is often true in venturesome, learning-as-you-go art, precise methods and ingredients are hard to reconstruct and identify. Much of this work takes the form of photograms, pictures made by placing objects on photosensitive paper and exposing the paper to light. With X-ray-like ensembles of scissors, twine and tape dispensers, the works in this case are recognizably studio arrangements, but complicated ones. Ms. Bee placed ordinary objects on top of existing photographs of people (the Vienna Boys Choir, herself) and, more often, of flowers and other plants. A tulip blossom shoots into a tabletop still life like a mini-meteor; a length of twine seems to merge with the stem and root system of a crocus.In a series involving images projected from slides, the work is all but abstracts. We seem to be moving through layered, subaqueous landscapes, an effect enhanced by Ms. Bee’s inventive, brushed-on application of developing fluid, with which she paints sinuous amoebic and molecular shapes. So as the photographer worked away, the painter came to light.Southfirst 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Through Feb. 22Advertisement
