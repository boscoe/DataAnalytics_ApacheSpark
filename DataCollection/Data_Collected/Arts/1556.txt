Ballet Hispanico, which was founded 45 years ago to explore Latino dance, is rechoreographing its management structure. The company announced Wednesday that Eduardo Vilaro, its artistic director since 2009, would become its chief executive officer as well.As the troupe consolidates its artistic and managerial responsibilities in Mr. Vilaro’s hands, it said it was eliminating the position of executive director, which has been held since early 2014 by Lee Koonce, who is leaving the company.“We are setting a new, more nimble course that will allow us to excel in today’s changing arts and culture climate,” Kate Lear, the chairwoman of its board, said in a statement. In an interview she said that Mr. Vilaro would still have opportunities to choreograph new works.Mr. Vilaro, who began with Ballet Hispanico in 1985 as a principal dancer and educator, has experience running both the artistic and managerial sides of a company: he served in both roles for the Luna Negra Dance Theater in Chicago, which he founded in 1999.His appointment comes as the company continues its transition to a new generation of leaders after being run for decades by its founders. Tina Ramirez, who started the company in 1970, stepped down as its artistic director in 2008. A year later its longtime executive director, Verdery Roosevelt, left the company after three decades. Ballet Hispanico has already had an eventful fall: last month it opened its newly renovated home on the Upper West Side, the Arnhold Center, with a lobby named for the Ford Foundation. And it was one of four dance companies whose performances were streamed to cinemas around the nation as part of the Lincoln Center at the Movies: Great American Dance series.
