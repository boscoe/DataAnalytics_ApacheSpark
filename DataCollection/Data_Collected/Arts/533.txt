This concert series, presented by the association’s New York chapter, continues on Friday with a concert featuring “Impromptus,” a piece by the trombonist George Lewis with several percussionists, including Tyshawn Sorey (who will also play piano and trombone); and the husband-and-wife team of Adegoke Steve Colson on piano and Iqua Colson on vocals, with the violinist Marlene Rice, the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Andrew Cyrille.

For this concert, Peter Apfelbaum will be a featured soloist. At 8 p.m., the Firehouse Space, 246 Frost Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, thefirehousespace.org. (Chinen)Peter Bernstein Quartet(Tuesday and Wednesday) The astute hard-bop guitarist Peter Bernstein can always be trusted in a quartet setting, and his partners here are more than capable: the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Billy Drummond. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net.

The rhythm section, sturdy but slippery, consists of Mr. Carney, the drummer Tom Rainey and the bassist John Hébert.

(Chinen)Al Di Meola(Wednesday and Thursday) “Elegant Gypsy,” released in 1977, was the second album by the guitarist Al Di Meola, and a touchstone for guitar-driven, Spanish-inflected jazz fusion. This two-night stand comes as part of Mr. Di Meola’s “Elegant Gypsy & More Electric Tour,” featuring the keyboardist Philippe Saisse, the percussionist Gumbi Ortiz and others. (Along with the repertory tribute, Mr. Di Meola will draw from his new solo album, “Elysium.”) At 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, bbkingblues.com. (Chinen)Dizzy Gillespie All-Stars(through Sunday) Roughly two decades since his death at 75, the irrepressible bebop ambassador Dizzy Gillespie lives on through several generations of inheritors, including Freddie Hendrix, Terell Stafford and Claudio Roditi, members of the trumpet section in this repertory band. Also on the roster are the bassist John Lee, a Gillespie alumnus, and estimable talent like alto saxophonist Sharel Cassity and the drummer Lewis Nash. On Sunday, the tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath joins in for a celebration of his 89th birthday. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ Erik Friedlander’s Oscalypso(Wednesday) As an improvising cellist, Mr. Friedlander has long celebrated the legacy of Oscar Pettiford, one of the instrument’s few great figures in jazz history. “Oscalypso” consists entirely of Pettiford’s compositions, played with feeling by Mr. Friedlander and the spry quartet appearing here, with Michael Blake on saxophones, Trevor Dunn on bass and Michael Sarin on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Rockwood Music Hall Stage 3, 196 Allen Street, between Stanton and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, 212-477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.com. (Chinen)Don Friedman-Ken Peplowski Trio: ‘Remembering Jimmy Giuffre’(Friday and Saturday) Jimmy Giuffre, a pioneering clarinetist, tenor saxophonist and composer who died in 2008, has made a posthumous return to the mainstream; a previously unissued archival album, “New York Concerts: The Jimmy Giuffre 3 & 4,” was recently hailed as a major event. Now Don Friedman, a pianist who appears on part of that release, spearheads this tribute, in partnership with the Giuffre-literate multireedist Ken Peplowski and the versatile bassist Phil Palombi. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Jacob Garchik’s Ye Olde(Tuesday) Mr. Garchik is a trombonist, composer and arranger brimming with bright ideas, and on his new album, “Ye Olde,” he imagines a heavy-metal soundtrack to a pseudo-medieval tale set in Flatbush, Brooklyn. The music, which works better than that description might suggest, features the drummer Vinnie Sperrazza and three texture-mad guitarists: Jonathan Goldberger, Mary Halvorson and Brandon Seabrook. (Among the opening bands are Mossenek and WindHorse.) At 7 p.m., Bowery Electric, 327 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, 212-228-0228, theboweryelectric.com.

This rare appearance in New York has been organized as a 50th-anniversary nod to his appearance at the Monterey Jazz Festival, which yielded a celebrated album on Columbia Records. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)AdvertisementThe Heath Brothers(Tuesday through Nov. 1) The saxophonist-composer Jimmy Heath and the drummer Albert Heath, better known as Tootie, have been staples of the postbop landscape from the beginning. This group used to include another brother, the great bassist Percy Heath, who died a decade ago; its lineup, still sturdy, now includes Jeb Patton on piano and David Wong on bass. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.

(Chinen)Israeli Jazz Festival(Wednesday and Thursday) Though it’s less a true festival than a successive pair of club bookings, the Israeli Jazz Festival at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola holds to a respectable standard of quality. Appearing on Wednesday is the guitarist Yotam Silberstein; on Thursday, the young pianist Gadi Lehavi leads a trio with a featured guest, the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)★ Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis Plays Monk(Friday and Saturday) Thelonious Monk has been the subject of more than one repertory tribute by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra over the years, but this program — one of the organization’s few marquee events this season, because of a scheduled renovation of Frederick P. Rose Hall — holds special promise. Partly it’s because Mr. Marsalis, Jazz at Lincoln Center’s artistic director, will present new arrangements by members of the ensemble. Partly it’s because of a pair of featured guests at the piano: Brad Mehldau, an influential talent; and Joey Alexander, a preteen phenom. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, the-townhall-nyc.org. (Chinen)Charles McPherson Quintet(through Sunday) A bebop veteran who has stayed true to form, the alto saxophonist Charles McPherson appears at the helm of a first-rate band, with Brian Lynch on trumpet, Jeb Patton on piano, and the rhythm team of Ray Drummond on bass and Billy Drummond (no relation) on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)Alfredo Rodríguez Trio/Harold Lopez-Nussa Trio(Monday through Wednesday) A double bill of two resourceful young Cuban pianists, each appearing with bass and drums. Mr. Rodríguez, whose two albums feature production by Quincy Jones, now has a home base in the United States; Mr. Lopez-Nussa still lives in Havana, though he has toured widely. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Mary Stallings and the Bruce Barth Trio(Friday through Sunday) A jazz singer of soulful instinct and deep experience, Ms. Stallings has a fine new album, “Feelin’ Good,” that frames her voice against seasoned partners like the pianist Bruce Barth. He rejoins her here, leading a trio. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Tierney Sutton Band(Friday and Saturday) A jazz singer of cool poise and effervescent style, Tierney Sutton draws from her romantically inclined new album, “Paris Sessions,” in this engagement, featuring her longtime band. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ Nate Wooley at the Stone(Through Sunday) Mr. Wooley is a trumpeter forever interested in texture and contrast, and drawn to abstraction. He concludes his week at the Stone in fine form, starting on Friday in duos with the pianist Matthew Shipp (at 8 p.m.) and the drummer Gerald Cleaver (at 10 p.m.). On Saturday, he performs two sets with the important English free-jazz drummer Paul Lytton. And on Sunday, after an 8 p.m. set devoted to a collective improvisation (led by John Zorn, the Stone’s founder), Mr. Wooley will conclude with a 10 p.m. celebration of “(Dance to) the Early Music,” his forthcoming quintet album, which slyly reinterprets the music of Wynton Marsalis. At Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com.
