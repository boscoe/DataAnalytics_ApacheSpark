“The End of the Tour,” about a Rolling Stone writer’s encounter with David Foster Wallace, and “Queen of Earth,” the second pairing of indie filmmaker Alex Ross Perry and star Elisabeth Moss, are among the highlights of the seventh annual BAMcinemaFest, organizers announced Wednesday.The festival, held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, opens June 17 with the New York premiere of “The End of the Tour,” directed by James Ponsoldt. It stars Jason Segel as the novelist, who’s traveling to promote “Infinite Jest” in the company of the reporter David Lipsky (played by Jesse Eisenberg). Last year, when production was initially announced, Wallace’s estate registered its objections, but the filmmakers have noted that their account is based on Mr. Lipsky’s memoir.The BAMcinemaFest centerpiece will be the North American premiere of “Queen of Earth,” which features Ms. Moss (who appeared in Mr. Perry’s “Listen Up Philip“) and Katherine Waterston (“Inherent Vice”) as friends staying at a lakeside cabin and dealing with their pasts.Other highlights include the documentaries “Best of Enemies,” about William F. Buckley and Gore Vidal in 1968, and “Call Me Lucky,” Bobcat Goldthwait’s look at the stand-up comic Barry Crimmins; and features like the sci-fi “Advantageous,” a special jury award winner at Sundance, and “Cop Car,” starring Kevin Bacon as a corrupt sheriff.Some selections overlap with those of another returning summertime staple, Rooftop Films. Both events will show “Tangerine” (the film, shot entirely on a modified iPhone, closes the Brooklyn event) and “Krisha” (a drama from the director Trey Shults featuring members of his family playing alternate versions of themselves).Rooftop specializes in screenings in unusual sites, and its 19th edition will kick off May 29 with a program of shorts at Industry City in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, followed the next night by the comedy “7 Chinese Brothers,” directed by Bob Byington and starring Jason Schwartzman.The lineup, announced earlier this week, will include “Finders Keepers,” a documentary that had Sundance talking about what happened to a mummified leg that went missing; “Goodnight Mommy,” which the critic Manohla Dargis has described as a “creepy Austrian art-film shocker“; and “Field Niggas,” Khalik Allah’s documentary about the denizens of a street corner in Harlem.For more information on the series, go to rooftopfilms.com.
