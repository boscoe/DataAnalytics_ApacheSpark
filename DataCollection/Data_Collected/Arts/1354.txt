In 2013 Kelela released “Cut 4 Me,” her debut mixtape full of narcotic R&B, and one of the jumping-off points for a new wave of genre reimagination.Earlier this year, she returned with an expanded edition of that mixtape. And, in October, she released a new EP, “Hallucinogen” (Cherry Coffee), that continues her preoccupation with the swagger of late 1990s R&B — she nails the liquidity of Aaliyah on “A Message” — and the experimental urges of the contemporary dance music underground, like on the title track.The high point is “Rewind,” a fleet and buoyant song that winks slyly at the bass music classic “My Boo” by Ghost Town DJ’s. She plays the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Tuesday, Dec. 1, and Wednesday, Dec. 2.
