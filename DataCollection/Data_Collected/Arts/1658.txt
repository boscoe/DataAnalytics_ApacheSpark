Immigration may be polarizing as a political issue, but on Broadway several immigrant stories are doing quite well.“On Your Feet!”, the new musical about Gloria and Emilio Estefan’s journey from anonymity in Cuba to stardom in the United States, had its strongest showing yet last week, grossing $1,331,812. That production is now consistently among the top-grossing shows on Broadway, behind only “Hamilton” among works that opened this season.A revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” the much-loved musical about a Jewish family driven out of Russia’s Pale of Settlement, is looking strong in its early days: Last week, for the third week in a row, it grossed more than $1 million. The show, which is in previews and opens on Sunday, grossed $1,047,622, according to figures released by the Broadway League for the week that ended Sunday.But “Allegiance,” a new musical about how internment by the American government during World War II divided a Japanese-American family, is having a tougher time, despite efforts to emphasize its contemporary relevance. George Takei, an actor in the musical whose own life story inspired it, has publicly invited the Republican presidential candidate Donald  J. Trump to see the show. While the move got some attention, it did not affect the show’s grosses, which were relatively flat last week at $398,204.A Manhattan Theater Club production of the Sam Shepard play “Fool for Love” closed on Sunday as scheduled; its run was characterized by positive reviews but soft grosses, and it brought in $250,127 in its final, seven-performance week. “The Color Purple,” a musical revival, opened to rave reviews on Thursday; it has been performing moderately well at the box office, grossing $696,030 in a week when many tickets were free for theater journalists and opening-night celebrants.“China Doll,” a poorly reviewed new David Mamet play starring Al Pacino, continues to do well at the box office, grossing $922,936 in six performances last week. And “School of Rock,” a well-received new musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber, grossed $956,818.A version of this article appears in print on 12/15/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Broadwayu2019s Immigrants.
