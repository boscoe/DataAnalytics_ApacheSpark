AdvertisementSupported byBy Ben RatliffThe saxophonist and bandleader Steve Coleman is fascinated by tradition but doesn’t seem to believe that any tradition is self-contained. Starting from his early training in the Chicago and New York jazz scenes during the late ’70s and early ’80s, he eventually created a music that could encompass everything he learned: Charlie Parker and James Brown; rhythmic practices from Africa and India and Brazil; ancient or esoteric theories about numbers, form, symmetry and multiplicity. He’s played and taught all over the world but never led a band at the Village Vanguard. That soon changes. On the first two nights of his engagement, he’ll play with a new chamber-like group, Natal Eclipse: horns, bass, piano (Craig Taborn), voice (Jen Shyu) and no drums. Then he’ll present the standard version of his long-running band, Five Elements — a great evolving machine — and through the weekend he’ll add a second drummer, the great Marcus Gilmore, to that group. Don’t miss it. (8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Tuesday, Nov. 10, through Sunday, Nov. 15, villagevanguard.com.)Advertisement
