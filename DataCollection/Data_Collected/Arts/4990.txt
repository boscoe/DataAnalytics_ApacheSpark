CreditNicole Bengiveno/The New York Times        THE first Frida moment occurs right off the bat in “Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life” at the New York Botanical Garden.Close by the entrance, a cluster of sunflowers stand guard, radiating a force field of hot yellow. Native to northern Mexico, they make appropriate greeters in an exhibition devoted to the artist’s intense relationship with Mexico’s indigenous culture, both natural and human. But they also refer to a specific work on display in the botanical garden’s art gallery along with nine other paintings and four works on paper by the artist.“Self-Portrait Inside a Sunflower,” painted in 1954, shows Kahlo, her thick eyebrows exaggerated to Groucho Marx proportions, standing in front of a lava-stone wall and wearing a traditional Zapotec dress. Her face is surrounded by a lionlike mane of sunflower petals, as though she were merging with the plant life around her.Kahlo and her plants — indivisible, in life and in art. This is the grand theme of the exhibition, which opened last weekend and runs through Nov. 1. The centerpiece, in the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, is a reinterpretation of the courtyard garden of the house in Coyoacán in Mexico City known as Casa Azul, or Blue House, now the Frida Kahlo Museum. It was there that Kahlo was born in 1907 and lived with Diego Rivera, after marrying him in 1929. Together the two created a garden that celebrated the plant life of Mexico and the artistic expression of its native peoples.AdvertisementFor Kahlo fans, the narrow plant-lined path at the conservatory is like a concordance to the life and work, with allusions scattered right and left. Those giant heart-shaped philodendron leaves? They feature prominently in the 1931 painting “Portrait of Luther Burbank,” also on view. The blood-red zinnias? Visitors to Casa Azul often saw them decorating the dining-room table. The dahlias are easy to place; Kahlo often wore them in her hair.AdvertisementScott Pask, who designed the sets for “The Book of Mormon” and the botanical garden’s Monet exhibition in 2012, has incorporated elements from Casa Azul into the array of flowers, fruits and vegetables. There are sections of cobalt-blue wall, one with the hand-painted inscription “Frida y Diego vivieron en esta casa, 1929-1954” (“Frida and Diego lived in this house, 1929-1954”), and a downsized version of Casa Azul’s tile fountain, its frog motif inspired by Kahlo’s nickname for Rivera, sapo-rana, or toad-frog.The path leads past Swiss-cheese plants, so called for the distinctive holes in the lobes of their enormous leaves; showy bougainvillea; calla lilies; and the bright yellow flowers of the Jerusalem thorn tree. Then, the big payoff: a facsimile of the tiered pyramid that Kahlo and Rivera installed at Casa Azul to display Rivera’s collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts and the work of the folk artist Mardonio Magaña.Francisca Coelho, the principal horticulturalist for the botanical garden’s exhibitions, has stocked the pyramid’s shelflike tiers with dozens of varieties of cactuses and succulent plants in terra-cotta pots. There are winsome little fellows no bigger than a Ping-Pong ball, and statuesque columnar cactuses and pumpkin-size cactuses bristling with nail-like spines. In this crowd, some familiar faces turn up. Cephalocereus senilis, known as old-man cactus for its long, downy white spines, can be seen in a photograph of Kahlo in her garden taken in 1951 by the French photojournalist Gisèle Freund. (It is part of an exhibition of Kahlo photographs that opened on Thursday at Throckmorton Fine Art on the Upper East Side and runs through Sept. 12.)“We have a cactus collection, and we display them naturalistically,” Ms. Coelho said, inspecting the pyramid. “I have to say, though, in a pot you really get a sense of what a cactus is. It’s very appealing.”More cactuses await. In the courtyard around the botanical garden’s large lily pond, Ms. Coelho recreated the long “fence” of organ-pipe cactuses that Kahlo and Rivera planted outside their second home, a modern residence and art studio built in the 1930s in the San Ángel neighborhood of Mexico City.Adriana Zavala, an associate professor of modern and contemporary Latin American art history and the director of Latino studies at Tufts University, served as the guest curator for the botanical garden’s exhibition. The invitation required a fair bit of explaining, she recalled.“It was a little unusual,” Ms. Zavala said. “I thought, ‘Do they know how sought after Kahlo’s work is for exhibitions?’ But I trained in a very interdisciplinary way, so the idea intrigued me.”AdvertisementThe unusual focus of the show turned out to be the strongest selling point for Ms. Zavala. She is impatient with the standard approaches to Kahlo, which tend to see the art, especially the self-portraits, as emblems in a now almost mythic life story. “I am not interested in the biographical march through the paintings,” she said. “My effort has always been to contextualize her.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Kahlo took a mystical view of the relationship between humans and the cosmos, and she absorbed powerful oppositions — sun and moon, life and death, male and female — into the complex swirl of symbolic forms in her art.The natural world supplied Kahlo with visual metaphors for Mexico’s complicated blend of peoples and cultures, echoed in her own hybrid identity as the daughter of a German immigrant father and a Mexican mother and in her ambiguous sexuality. Ms. Zavala unwraps their meanings in her catalog essay. The botanical garden wrote the footnotes, so to speak, in living form. “With all due respect to the Museum of Modern Art or the Metropolitan Museum, they couldn’t do this show,” Ms. Zavala said.The garden in the exhibition is a composite, what Ms. Zavala calls “an evocation, not a re-creation.” When she and a team from the botanical garden paid their first visit to Casa Azul, a couple of awkward facts came to light. The garden as it now exists, they discovered, bears only a faint resemblance to the one that Kahlo and Rivera knew. Mexico City gets much more rainfall then it did in the 1930s and ’40s. Also, as the trees in the garden matured, they shaded out sun, requiring different plant species to be introduced. Since there was no master list of plants in the garden — another obstacle — the Frida Kahlo Museum’s archival photographs had to be scrutinized.The team also had to abandon the pleasing mental picture of Kahlo laboring with Rivera in the garden as it expanded to three times its original size and acquired native species like prickly pear, yucca, columnar cactus, canna lily and agave.“We thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to find Frida’s gardening gloves, or her trowel,’ ” Ms. Zavala said. “But they do not exist. That’s not what people of her social class did. They had servants.”In the end, Ms. Zavala and Ms. Coelho drew up a plant list based on the artworks, archival photos, biographies and the written testimony of visitors. From the unpublished memoir of Emmy Lou Packard, a young American artist who lived at Casa Azul for a time, they knew that Kahlo’s dining-room table was decorated with bouquets of marigolds, blue and white irises, red zinnias, dahlias, calla lilies, blood-red coxcomb, blue bachelor buttons and violets.The show is the latest installment in a series of exhibitions at the botanical garden in recent years that use plants to explore the creative lives of notable figures. The approach has been applied to Charles Darwin, Emily Dickinson and Claude Monet. Now it’s Kahlo’s turn.“We’re going much more deeply into plants and their significance in people’s lives,” Ms. Coelho said. “It’s one thing to walk by a cactus in our display and say, ‘Nice plant, native to Mexico.’ It’s very different to see the same cactus and say: ‘Wow! Frida Kahlo had that in her house?’ ”“Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life” runs through Nov. 1 at the New York Botanical Garden, Bronx River Parkway (Exit 7W) and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, the Bronx; 718-817-8700, nybg.org.
