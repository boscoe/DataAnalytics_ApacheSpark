Soon, she was cavorting onstage with an assortment of phalluses in different shapes and sizes. It wasn’t what you might think.For six years and counting, Ms. Rossellini, the actress and filmmaker, has quite literally been explaining the birds and the bees, transforming herself into a multitude of species — snails, deer, ducks, spiders, whales — to help audiences better understand how they reproduce. “Green Porno Live!,” Sunday night on Ovation, follows Ms. Rossellini as she dons anatomically correct costumes and pseudopenetrates her way across 35 cities to demonstrate the variety of sexual behavior in the animal kingdom. Her antics are based in science. (She is pursuing a master’s degree in animal behavior at Hunter College.) But in the end, “Green Porno” has been mostly about putting on a show. “I am an entertainer,” she said recently in a telephone interview on her way to the train from her Long Island farm, stopping midconversation to rescue a dog in the street. “I find that animals make me laugh.”Advertisement
