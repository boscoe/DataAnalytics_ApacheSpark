Madonna’s new record, “Rebel Heart,” is the full version of the album that was partly leaked in work-tape form last December.  It’s a résumé of power and influence: a flex-rospective. In songs like “Veni Vidi Vici” she’s essentially reminding you who she is. (Literally so, in the case of “Bitch I’m Madonna.”)The New York Times music critics talk each week about the latest pop music news. Subscribe in iTunes.
“It’s funny how reactive, how defensive this album is,” says Jon Pareles in this week’s Popcast. “All these songs are saying, ‘Look at what I’ve done.’ It’s saying, ‘I’m still here’ — and the thing is, she is still here. Years after most dance-floor dollies have had their one hit and are playing on cruise ships, she’s playing arenas.”The record does a few other things: It uses sex an arena of pleasure and challenge, just as she was doing in her mid-30s; it reminds you that her ballad voice was one of the ubiquitous pleasures in American pop 25 years ago. It goes into EDM, trap and reggae, pulling on the songwriting and production contributions of Avicii, Diplo and Kanye West. And from its title on it has, as Mr. Pareles explains, not a thematic unity but a duality. Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
