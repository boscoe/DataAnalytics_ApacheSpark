Pratt Institute’s Architecture School this fall plans to start a master’s program in “Urban Placemaking and Management,” led by David Burney, the city’s former commissioner in the department of design and construction.The 40-credit, four-semester master of science degree program — which purports to be the first of its kind in the United States focused on creating successful public spaces based on community planning — is part of Pratt’s Programs for Sustainable Planning and Development.During his 10-year tenure as the city’s “chief architect,” Mr. Burney implemented a Design and Construction Excellence program to improve the quality of public projects like streets, plazas, libraries, museums, and firehouses. The faculty is to include Signe Nielsen, a landscape architect and the president of the New York City Public Design Commission; Meg Walker, the vice president and director of design at Project for Public Spaces; and Jonathan Marvel, an architect.“In the past 10 to 12 years there has been a paradigm shift in thinking about planning and urbanism, from a primary focus on buildings to a focus on the spaces between buildings — public space,” Mr. Burney said in a statement. “Rather than allowing these spaces to be formed as an afterthought of building design, placemaking sees the creation of successful public spaces as the starting point, which in turn dictates the siting and design of other components of the urban fabric.” A version of this article appears in print on 03/30/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Pratt to Offer a Degree Focusing on Public Space.
