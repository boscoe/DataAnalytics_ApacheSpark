Jonathan Boulware, who since November 2011 has served as the South Street Seaport Museum’s waterfront director and interim president, has been appointed executive director, the museum is to announce next week. Still unclear is what shape the museum will take or whether it will remain in its current main location on Fulton Street. The museum had been struggling to come back from financial precariousness when Hurricane Sandy damaged its building, forcing the galleries to close.Before joining the museum Mr. Boulware served as captain of numerous tall ships, sailing with students on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. His appointment is to be announced  April 25, when the museum starts a new season of programming; it has continued running some activities on its historic ships and its 19th-century print shop has remained open.“I won’t suggest the task we have ahead of us here is an easy one, but I see it as an important one,” Mr. Boulware said in an interview. During Mr. Boulware’s tenure as interim president, the museum has reduced its fleet to eight from 11 and made repairs on ships, including the lightship Ambrose and the schooner Lettie G. Howard.
After Sandy, the Museum of the City of New York decided to pull out of running the troubled institution after two years of trying to stabilize it.Its operating budget is now about $2 million, down from $5.2 million in 2008.“There is going to be an institution — the question is what kind of institution it’s going to be,” said Tom Finkelpearl, the Commissioner of the City’s Cultural Affairs Department, which has been helping with the museum’s recovery efforts, in an interview. “But if you don’t have a director who has a vision of possibilities you can’t go forward.” A version of this article appears in print on 04/17/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A New Director for Seaport Museum.
