When the choreographer Pam Tanowitz contemplated her commission for Works & Process at the Guggenheim, her first idea was a story ballet. One hitch. She had decided to use music by four composers: David Lang, Ted Hearne, Hannah Lash and Caroline Shaw. And during her research for the piece, “Broken Story (wherein there is no ecstasy),” she came across J. D. Salinger’s “The Heart of a Broken Story,” a love story about two people who never meet.In the dance, which begins with a prelude for Lindsey Jones and features Maggie Cloud, Dylan Crossman, Stuart Singer and Melissa Toogood, the choreographer asks: How do you put two people together onstage? While she has choreographed memorable duets for Mr. Crossman and Ms. Toogood, she’s keeping them separate. They do, however, have solos. That must be the Salinger talking.
