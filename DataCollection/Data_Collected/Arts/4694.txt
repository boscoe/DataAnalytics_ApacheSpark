She was 83.She had been in hospice care, Ed Rada, the executor of her estate, said.Born Joanne Copeland in Los Angeles on Oct. 20, 1931, she married Carson in 1963, a year after he began hosting “The Tonight Show.”She had appeared as the co-host of an early 1960s game show, “Video Village,” and later had her own syndicated health-and-fitness talk show, “Joanne Carson’s V.I.P.’s.” She went on to earn a master’s degree in psychology and a Ph.D. in nutritional biochemistry and physiology.In an interview with The New York Times in 2007, Ms. Carson said her husband had misgivings about taking over “The Tonight Show.”“He said, ‘It frightens me to take it, because I think I might lose you,’ ” she recalled. “I said: ‘Are you crazy? You couldn’t lose me if you tried.’ ”After their divorce in 1972, she became close to the writer Truman Capote. He kept a writing room at her house, where he died in 1984. Ms. Carson will be interred next to Capote at Westwood Cemetery in Los Angeles, Mr. Rada said.Joanne Carson had a second marriage late in her life to Richard Rever that also ended in divorce. Survivors include two half sisters, Barbara Abernathy and Shirlee Alpers.Carson, who died in 2005 at 79, remarried two more times after his divorce from Joanne Carson.When Ms. Carson released on DVD episodes of a short-lived 1950s weekly variety show called “The Johnny Carson Show,” she said, “The American public saw Johnny as a good and decent man, a little boy from the Midwest who never completely grew up, and I want them to know they were right.”Advertisement
