The Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot Díaz has come under fire from the Dominican Republic’s consul in New York for criticizing the government’s immigration policies. Eduardo Selman, the Consul general, called Mr. Díaz “anti-Dominican” and stripped him of an Order of Merit medal. Mr. Díaz, who was born in the Dominican Republic, has had a long history of protesting that country’s removal of undocumented Haitian migrants. “The expulsions are violations of the workers’ human rights and of the country’s own laws,” he wrote in a joint opinion article with the Haitian-American writer Edwidge Danticat in The Times in 1999.In June of this year, Mr. Díaz and Ms. Danticat led an event in Miami protesting the Dominican Republic’s efforts to deport hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrant workers. Mr. Díaz called the situation a “state of terror.” Last week, Mr. Díaz and Ms. Danticat reportedly met with Congress to push for a resolution condemning the Dominican Republic’s policies. Mr. Selman revoked the Order of Merit award given to Mr. Díaz in 2009. “We declare emphatically that the Dominican Republic has acted with transparency to the world in the implementation of the migratory measures and there has been no case of violation of human rights,” Mr. Selman said in a statement in Spanish late last week. Mr. Díaz did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publishing.
