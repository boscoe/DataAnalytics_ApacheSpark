As expected, “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” (Warner Bros.) continued to lead the North American box office, taking in an estimated $21.9 million, for a three-week total of $220.8 million. But the two films hot on its tail – Rob Marshall’s “Into the Woods” and Angelina Jolie’s “Unbroken” – were the reason Hollywood started the year smiling: Each release is a prime example of a type of film that supposedly can no longer succeed in theaters. A mid-budget musical with squishy critical support, “Into The Woods” (Disney) took in about $19.1 million over the weekend, for a stellar two-week total of $91.2 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. A mid-budget adult drama with no on-screen stars that left many critics cold, “Unbroken” (Universal) had weekend ticket sales of $18.4 million, for an unexpectedly stratospheric two-week total of $87.1 million. How did these two films break through? One answer involves meticulous marketing. Disney hid the musical elements of “Into the Woods” early in its campaign, and Universal quietly rallied a faith-based audience behind “Unbroken.” For the weekend, the only new movie in wide release, “The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death” (Relativity) took in an estimated $15.1 million, a sturdy total albeit one that fell 27 percent behind opening-weekend ticket sales for “The Woman in Black” in 2012. Relativity acquired rights to the horror sequel for just $1 million.A version of this article appears in print on 01/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘The Hobbit’ Reigns at the Box Office.
