A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.★ Tim Berne’s Snakeoil  (Tuesday) Mr. Berne, an alto saxophonist and composer of granite conviction, has had a superb recent outlet in Snakeoil, a chamber-improv quartet with the clarinetist Oscar Noriega, the pianist Matt Mitchell and the drummer Ches Smith. The band’s third album, “You’ve Been Watching Me,” is notable not only for its expressive authority but also the presence of another member, the electric guitarist Ryan Ferriera, who rejoins the group here. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Nate Chinen)Michel Camilo Three + Three  (Tuesday through April 26) Mr. Camilo, a fastidiously percussive Dominican pianist, has ample history with the bassist Lincoln Goines and the drummer Cliff Almond, who make up his working trio. As the title of this engagement suggests, he’s augmenting that rhythm section with several guests: the trumpeter Michael Philip Mossman, the trombonist Conrad Herwig and the saxophonist Ralph Bowen. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)James Carter Organ Trio  (Friday and Saturday) As he does on “At the Crossroads,” his most recent album, the irrepressible saxophonist James Carter spearheads this purposefully gritty soul-jazz trio, with Gerard Gibbs on Hammond B-3 organ and Leonard King Jr. on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Marc Cary PResents ‘Rhodes Ahead Vol. 2’ (Friday and Saturday) There isn’t much in the modern-jazz-musician tool kit that Marc Cary hasn’t mastered, but he has a particular subspecialty in the area of groove. He has a strong new album — “Rhodes Ahead Vol. 2,” a continuation of a project he started more than a dozen years ago — and he’ll celebrate its release with this weekend run. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Ginny’s Supper Club, 310 Lenox Avenue, near 125th Street, Harlem, 212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com. (Chinen)Advertisement★ ‘Celebrating Joe Temperley: From Duke to the JLCO’  (Friday and Saturday) Joe Temperley is a gallant Scottish baritone saxophonist who, as the title of this concert implies, has been a member of both the Duke Ellington Orchestra and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. At 85, he still works for the second of those institutions, which is paying him homage with a three-part concerto composed by its artistic director, Wynton Marsalis. (The program will also feature some choice Ellingtonia, in brand-new arrangements.) At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org.

(Chinen)Kris Davis’s Capricorn Climber (Friday and Saturday) The pianist Kris Davis has a newish band, Capricorn Climber, that seeks out the unexpected corners within established musical relationships.

At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Tomas Fujiwara and the Hook Up  (Saturday) A drummer working along jazz’s experimental fringe, Mr. Fujiwara favors a mode of playing that’s forward-leaning but rarely blunt or aggressive, and never random. Celebrating the release of his new album, “After All Is Said,” he convenes a working band with Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Brian Settles on tenor saxophone and flute, Mary Halvorson on guitar and Michael Formanek on bass. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)ROY HARGROVE QUINTET (through Sunday) Hard bop has few more charismatic torchbearers than the trumpeter Roy Hargrove, who inhabits the style without rigidity or stifling nostalgia.

At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ Barry Harris Trio  (Tuesday through April 26) The pianist Barry Harris belongs to a generation that carried bebop’s torch into an uncertain future. He’s a figure of twinkly erudition, a natural pedagogue as well as an artist, and he has deep history with his trio mates, Ray Drummond on bass and Leroy Williams on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)J.C. Hopkins Biggish Band  (Saturday) Led by its namesake bandleader, songwriter and producer, the J.C.

At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)★ Charles Lloyd: Wild Man Dance Suite  (Saturday) The tenor saxophonist and flutist Charles Lloyd has been a notable solo artist in jazz for some 50 years (with one notable interruption), and he’ll soon become a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master (see the separate listing).

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500.

(Chinen)★ Danilo Pérez Trio  (Saturday and Sunday) The tirelessly inquisitive pianist Danilo Pérez has been most visible over the last decade as a member of the Wayne Shorter Quartet, jazz’s most brilliantly discursive working band. Mr. Pérez brings a similar slipperiness — but a more direct connection with his Panamanian roots — to his own longstanding trio, featuring Ben Street on bass and Adam Cruz on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set on Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net.

At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Respect Sextet  (Friday) The Respect Sextet stamps ambitious music with a smart-alecky affect, ranging broadly from the antic to the deadpan.

At 7:30 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org.
