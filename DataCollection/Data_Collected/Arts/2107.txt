Let the cycle be unbroken: The Minnesota Orchestra and Osmo Vanska, whose efforts to record a complete cycle of the seven Sibelius symphonies for BIS Records were interrupted in 2013 by their 16-month labor lockout, plan to finish the job later this year.Mr. Vanska and the orchestra, who have won acclaim for their recordings of four of the Sibelius symphonies, winning a Grammy for one recording and a Grammy nomination for another, plan to finish the cycle and record Sibelius’ Third, Sixth and Seventh symphonies this May and June at Orchestra Hall, the orchestra announced on Monday.“This is meaningful repertoire to us, and it will be very gratifying for us to complete the circle on this project,” Mr. Vanska, the orchestra’s music director, said in a statement.The cost of the recording sessions will be underwritten by an individual donor, the orchestra said. Kevin Smith, who took over as the orchestra’s president and chief executive after the bitter lockout ended, said in a statement that “creating recordings will continue to be part of our strategy to maintain high visibility for the orchestra and to preserve its sound, and we are happy to resume the activity with this project.”A release date for this final album in the cycle is yet to be announced.A version of this article appears in print on 01/13/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Sibelius Project To Be Completed.
