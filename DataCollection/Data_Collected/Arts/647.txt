Some serious downsizing is in view for Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, who will sell more than 200 works from their  art collection at Christie’s auction house in February. The sale, announced by Christie’s, will include paintings, photographs, furniture and ceramics, as well as Sting’s Steinway piano.The collection, which the couple built up over 20 years, includes Henri Matisse’s 1947 print series, “Jazz Portfolio”; a 1949 Picasso lithograph, “Le Corsage à Carreaux”; prints by Georges Braque and René Magritte; and a Gustav Klimt series, “Study of a Young Woman in Stockings.”The couple also collected more contemporary work, including Yves Klein’s “Table Rose” and “Table Bleue”; prints by Mimmo Paladino and Carsten Höller; photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe; and paintings by Keith Haring, Zeng Chuanxing and the British abstract painter Ben Nicholson, whose 1955 “March 55 (amethyst)” holds the top estimate for the auction, at 300,000-500,000 pounds (about $460,000-$765,000). Furniture by Jacques Adnet and George Nakashima, Piero Fornasetti mirrors and Jean Besnard ceramics are also being sold.In August, Sting and Ms. Styler sold their four-story house near St. James’s Park in central London, and bought an apartment in a new development in the former Battersea power station overlooking the Thames in South London. Their home and collection had “effortlessly combined luxury, rarity and color,” Andy Waters, Christie’s head of private collection sales, said on the auction house’s website. A Christie’s representative told the BBC that the couple felt it was “time for a change.”A version of this article appears in print on 10/30/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Sting and Styler Declutter Via Christieu2019s.
