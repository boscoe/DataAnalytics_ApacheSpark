Jim Parsons is God – and not just to fans of his character, Sheldon Cooper, on the hit CBS series “The Big Bang Theory,” for which he has won four best actor Emmy Awards. No, Mr. Parsons is actually going to play the Almighty on Broadway beginning May 5 in the new comedy “An Act of God” by David Javerbaum, a former head writer and executive producer of “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,” the play’s producer announced on Thursday.The 90-minute production is based on Mr. Javerbaum’s 2011 book “The Last Testament: A Memoir By God,” a swirl of satirical riffs on Biblical passages, jokey anecdotes and comic pronouncements.Mr. Parsons was last on Broadway in 2012 starring as Elwood P. Dowd in a revival of “Harvey,” which was a hit with critics and at the box office. He will be performing “An Act of God” at the same theater as “Harvey,” Roundabout Theater Company’s Studio 54, although the new play is not a Roundabout production; the nonprofit is renting out the space to Jeffrey Finn, a producer, for a limited engagement of “An Act of God.”The play will be directed by Tony Award winner Joe Mantello (“Wicked”), who starred with Mr. Parsons in the 2011 Broadway revival of “The Normal Heart” and the subsequent film adaptation shown on HBO last year. Mr. Mantello’s directing credits on Broadway include the recent musical “The Last Ship” and the play “I’ll Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers,” a one-woman show starring Bette Midler. “An Act of God” is a star vehicle for Mr. Parsons but there are two minor characters as well, angels lending a hand to God. (Casting for those roles will be announced soon.)
