Two adventurous smaller events, both on Tuesday, look especially intriguing this week. One explores the context of Beethoven’s “Diabelli” Variations, which he composed after the publisher Anton Diabelli sent a little waltz he had written to the leading composers of the Austrian empire, asking them each to write a variation, with the idea of publishing the entire set. Beethoven turned out a stand-alone colossus of a piece.Some pianists from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University present a “Diabelli Variations Extravaganza,” playing all of the seldom-heard variations by other composers, among them Schubert, Czerny, the young Liszt, some 50 in all, with a few of Beethoven’s mixed in. (7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, carnegiehall.org.) Also, the highly praised Russian pianist Konstantin Soukhovetski, now 34, who has been adopting rock star trappings, plays a program of his own transcriptions of music from operas by Puccini, Strauss and Massenet at Le Poisson Rouge. (7:30 p.m., lepoissonrouge.com.)A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Classical: Variety in Variations.
