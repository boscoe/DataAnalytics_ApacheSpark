PARIS — The Swiss publisher Kein & Aber has picked up Martin Amis’s concentration-camp satire, “The Zone of Interest,” months after the author’s longtime German and French publishers rejected it. Kein & Aber, which is based in Zurich, will release the book in September in a translation by Werner Schmitz. The house’s founder and publisher, Peter Haag, said he had followed the controversy last year after Carl Hanser Verlag in Germany and Gallimard in France rejected the book, and was eager to pick up the author.“I esteem Martin Amis very much,” Mr. Haag said in a telephone interview. “I think he’s a great writer. He’s really one of the stars in English literature.”Mr. Haag said that the publisher, which was founded in 1997 and specializes in literary fiction, was also committed to publishing Mr. Amis’s future books in German translation, and would reissue German-language paperback editions of two of his earlier novels, “The Rachel Papers” and “Money.”“The Zone of Interest” got favorable reviews in Britain and the United States when it first appeared last fall. In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote that it had “a rolling, cumulative power.”But Mr. Amis’s books haven’t been big sellers in Germany. In September, Piero Salabè, Mr. Amis’s editor at Carl Hanser Verlag, said the publisher had turned down the book for marketing and literary reasons. In France, Marie-Pierre Gracedieu, Mr. Amis’s editor at Gallimard, said the house passed on the book because “it wasn’t very convincing.” Calmann-Lévy picked it up for publication in France later this year.Mr. Haag said he had no reservations about the new book. “His novel is very special because it brings together what normally doesn’t go together: love, sex and Auschwitz, sometimes in an ironic view,” he said. “The Germans are not used to having an ironic view of the Holocaust.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/06/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Publisher for Amis.
