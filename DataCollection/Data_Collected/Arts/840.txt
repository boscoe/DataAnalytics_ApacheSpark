But not in entirely positive ways.Ms. Swift incorporated a regular feature into her “1989” tour in which famous friends — from Lorde to Julia Roberts— would emerge to share the stage with her. Her reach grew so wide that she became the subject of parodies online and on “Saturday Night Live.” And in July, one of Drake’s allies, the rapper Meek Mill, turned on him on Twitter, accusing him of using a ghostwriter.“Hip-hop, more than any genre, relies on an unspoken good-faith network of collaboration,” as Jon Caramanica put it in an essay this week. “With a handful of tweets, Meek Mill tore that playbook up.”The increasing interconnectivity within pop culture and mass media — and of course we are talking about Twitter and Instagram, but it doesn’t end there — has made it important for pop stars to enlist lots of other pop stars as secondary players in their brands and enterprises.And often all goes well, until it doesn’t. This week we talk about how Drake and Ms. Swift each use their friendships and alliances, and to what degree their work naturally relies on or needs collaboration.Jon Caramanica on Taylor Swift’s and Drake’s FriendshipsSaturday Night Live’s Sketch About Taylor Swift’s SquadAdvertisement
