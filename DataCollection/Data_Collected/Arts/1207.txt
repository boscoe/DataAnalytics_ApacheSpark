LOS ANGELES – It was one of those weekends when a movie opened to massive ticket sales and still disappointed: “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2,” the finale of one of the decade’s biggest film franchises, took in about $101 million at North American theaters, a 17 percent decline from initial sales for “Part 1.”Franchise fatigue probably played a role, and some box office analysts wondered on Sunday if terror attacks overseas were making some Americans less likely to visit theaters.Lionsgate, which spent roughly $160 million to make “Part 2,” had no comment about the film’s domestic results. A spokeswoman noted that “Part 2” collected an additional $146 million, a hefty total, from 87 international markets.The new “Hunger Games” movie is well positioned to draw crowds over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. “Part 2,” again starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, received stronger reviews than “Part 1.” (And to put the opening for “Part 2” in perspective: Katniss came in 43 percent higher than James Bond; “Spectre” recently arrived to $70.4 million in initial domestic sales.)Among other new wide releases, “The Night Before” (Sony Pictures), an R-rated Christmas comedy that cost roughly $25 million to make, took in $10.1 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. “The Secret in Their Eyes” (STX Entertainment), a thriller starring Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nicole Kidman, arrived to a soft $6.6 million; it was financed by IM Global for about $20 million.At art houses, “Brooklyn” (Fox Searchlight) continued to perform well and the new release “Carol” (the Weinstein Company), starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, posted strong results in extremely limited release.
