Decades of speculation about the meaning behind of one of the 20th century’s most renowned and enigmatic songs could finally end when the notes and manuscripts of Don McLean’s “American Pie” go up for sale this spring — that is, of course, if the highest bidder chooses to publicly share what insights they may hold. The auction house Christie’s announced last week that the original working manuscript and typed drafts to the song — 16 pages total — would be auctioned on April 7 in New York. Mr. McLean, 69, told Reuters he decided to sell the documents on a whim. Other than admitting that a line in the song, “the day the music died,” refers to the Feb. 3, 1959, deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J. P. Richardson, known as the Big Bopper, Mr. McLean has been mostly vague about the meaning of other parts of the song. He told Reuters that the “writing and lyrics will divulge everything there is to divulge.” “American Pie” was released in 1971. The manuscript is estimated to fetch between $1 million and $1.5 million.A version of this brief appears in print on February 16, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Auction May Reveal Secrets of ‘American Pie’.
