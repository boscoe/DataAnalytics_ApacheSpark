The Mexican writer Fernando del Paso, 80, won the 2015 Miguel de Cervantes Prize on Thursday, the highest literary award in the Spanish-speaking world. The annual prize is awarded for an author’s entire body of work.Del Paso won for his contribution to the development of the novel and for work that combines tradition and modernity and recreates key moments in the history of Mexico, according to a news release from the Spanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport.Del Paso’s most well-known works include “News from the Empire,” “José Trigo” and “Palinuro of Mexico,” which touches on the student movement of 1968 and the massacre at Tlatelolco, Mexico City.“He’s very encyclopedic,” said Ilan Stavans, a Professor of Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College “in his view a novel is a huge container where everything fits as long as you know how to arrange it.”The 125,000 euro (about $134,000) prize named after the author of “Don Quixote,” is awarded on April 23, the anniversary of the writer’s death.Generally, the prize alternates between Spanish and Latin American writers. Last year’s award was given to the Spanish author Juan Goytisolo.
