There was a silver lining to Wednesday’s otherwise disappointing Sotheby’s auction of American art from the Alfred A. Taubman collection: The sale led to a reunion of siblings.“The Great Florida Sunset,” an 1887 landscape by Martin Johnson Heade, sold for $5.9 million — more than double the previous record for him, though less than the expected $7 million to $10 million. It was acquired by the Minnesota Marine Art Museum, where it will be reunited with its pendant painting, “View From Fern-Tree Walk, Jamaica.”“They were intended to complement each other,” said John Driscoll, who advises the museum on its collection. “You have the kind of the yin and the yang of Heade’s career in these two paintings. They were the biggest paintings of his life.”Located a little more than 100 miles southeast of Minneapolis — in the 27,000-person town of Winona, Minn. — the museum prides itself on its growing collection from the Hudson River School, a movement sometimes attached to Heade’s work.The two paintings, which were commissioned by the Standard Oil founder Henry Morrison Flagler for his Hotel Ponce de León in Florida, have been separated for decades. They were on display together in the upper rotunda of the hotel (later Flagler College) until the 1950s, when “View From Fern-Tree Walk, Jamaica” was moved to a private collection in California. Mr. Taubman bought “The Great Florida Sunset” in 1988.The Minnesota museum acquired “View From Fern-Tree Walk, Jamaica” in 2013. Mr. Driscoll said he never expected to buy its partner. “I knew that Mr. Taubman owned it, and I knew he was not disposed to sell it,” he said. The chance to buy “The Great Florida Sunset,” he added, “was very exciting. These pictures belong together.”
