But in her latest, “Portrait Study,” she cedes control. Created for the Live Ideas Festival at New York Live Arts, organized this year by the multimedia innovator Laurie Anderson, the work brings together nine superb, inquisitive dancers to improvise within an open-ended score. “The project is really about the people in it,” Ms. Gill said. They include Jodi Melnick, Omagbitse Omagbemi, Stuart Singer and David Thomson, along with the lighting designer Thomas Dunn and the composers Eliot Krimsky and Ryan Seaton. “Portrait Study” shares the opening-night program with a work in progress by Ms. Anderson and the choreographer Deborah Hay. New Yorkers get an early glimpse of their “Figure A Sea,” a piece for Cullberg Ballet to be unveiled in Stockholm this fall. (Wednesday, 219 West 19th Street, 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org.)
