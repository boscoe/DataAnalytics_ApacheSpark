The marathon concert of all five Prokofiev piano concertos that Valery Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra are bringing to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in February will include some youthful star power: Daniil Trifonov and George Li will join the lineup of soloists, the academy announced on Wednesday.Mr. Li, an up-and-coming American pianist who made a splash earlier this year when he won the silver medal at the Tchaikovsky Competition, will play the First Concerto, and Mr. Trifonov, the dazzling virtuoso who anchored the New York Philharmonic’s acclaimed Rachmaninoff festival this fall, the Third. The rest of the lineup — which includes Mr. Trifonov’s teacher, Sergei Babayan, along with Alexander Toradze and Sergey Redkin, was previously announced.The Prokofievapalooza of a concert on Feb. 24, part of a Mariinsky at BAM festival that will continue with four nights of ballet, is expected to run about three and a quarter hours, with two intermissions. When Mr. Gergiev led the London Symphony Orchestra in a marathon of the Prokofiev concertos this summer at the BBC Proms (with Mr. Trifonov, Mr. Babyan and Alexei Volodin divvying up the five), David Allen wrote in The New York Times that it was “a triumph.”
