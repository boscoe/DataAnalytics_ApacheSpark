KahnThe Metropolitan Museum of Art has brought hundreds of donated antiques out of storage to offer at Manhattan auctions this fall.In the last few weeks, the museum has sold paintings and sculptures at Doyle New York auction house, including a portrait of Thomas Sully’s daughter Ellen Wheeler that Sully painted in 1844, which went for $17,500. More information related to that family has surfaced in recent years: Mrs. Wheeler and her husband, John H. Wheeler, a North Carolina politician, owned a slave, Hannah Bond, who escaped and became a novelist. In 2013 she was identified as the author of “The Bondwoman’s Narrative,” written under the pseudonym Hannah Crafts. (The book became a best seller after it was published in 2002.)On Oct. 27 Christie’s will offer British silver, furniture, porcelain and architectural salvage from the Met; many pieces had belonged to aristocrats and celebrities, including William Randolph Hearst and J. P. Morgan. The Met is keeping some related material. A mahogany armchair ($50,000 to $80,000) carved with eagles, probably made in Ireland in the 1740s, has an armless cousin from the same set that remains at the museum.The Met is preparing to redo its galleries for British decorative arts. Luke Syson, the chairman of the museum’s European sculpture and decorative arts department, said the sale would help finance acquisitions of 19th-century works to fill gaps in the collection.More British antiques with elite provenances will be for sale in New York at the annual International Fine Art and Antiques Show at the Park Avenue Armory, which opens on Oct. 23, and at a new two-week show that opens on Wednesday at the Academy Mansion, with 300 wares from the European dealers Galerie Brimo de Laroussilhe, Antichita’ Alessandra Di Castro and Galerie Kugel.Advertisement
