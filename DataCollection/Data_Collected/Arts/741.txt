JoJo’s career arc could be the stuff of 1960s record-business chicanery. Signed to a record deal at the age of 12 in the early 2000s, she had a handful of early hits before label problems put her in an extended purgatory, resulting in five or so years in which she could barely officially release any new music.It was only last year that JoJo, who will turn 25 next month, was released from that contract and was able to sign a new deal. But during that limbo period, self-released singles and mixtapes helped keep her afloat, as did a fervent Internet fan base that consumed them.She’ll soon release her first post-emancipation album, and in the meantime, she’s touring — on Tuesday, Nov. 3, she plays the Marlin Room at Webster Hall — performing new material and cover songs and hits from a decade ago, hopefully placeholders for ones still to come.
