Atticus Lish has won the 2015 PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for his first novel, “Preparation for the Next Life.” The book, which takes place mostly in the outer reaches of Queens, is about the relationship between Zou Lei, an undocumented Chinese Muslim immigrant, and Skinner, a traumatized veteran of three tours in Iraq. The novel was published in November by the small independent press Tyrant Books to widespread critical praise. In his review in The New York Times, Dwight Garner wrote that the novel is “unlike any American fiction I’ve read recently in its intricate comprehension of, and deep feeling for, life at the margins.” He continued: “At its knotty core, amazingly, is perhaps the finest and most unsentimental love story of the new decade.”Mr. Lish, the son of Gordon Lish, a famed magazine and book editor, said in an email interview that winning prizes was not on his mind while writing the novel. “I didn’t really know that books win awards,” he said. “Yes, I’d seen the gold emblems on some of my favorite books, but it just wasn’t on my radar.”Asked what critics admired in his book, Mr. Lish said, “I don’t feel that’s for me to say.” He said he doesn’t read much new fiction, and takes inspiration from music, television and movies as well as books. “In training to write, I was drawn to Hemingway, Dos Passos, Flaubert, Tolstoy and the Bible,” he said. “Maybe there’s a throwback thing that people are getting into. It’s like hemlines probably. They were short for a while, and now people are ready for them to be long again. Could that be it? It’s really nice to see, though. I can’t believe it.”Mr. Lish’s honor comes with $15,000. The four other finalists, who each receive $5,000, are Jeffery Renard Allen for “Song of the Shank” (Graywolf Press); Jennifer Clement for “Prayers for the Stolen” (Hogarth); Emily St. John Mandel for “Station Eleven” (Alfred A. Knopf); and Jenny Offill for “Dept. of Speculation” (Alfred A. Knopf).
