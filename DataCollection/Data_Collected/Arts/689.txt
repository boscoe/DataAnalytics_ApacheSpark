(Chinen)★ Ben Monder and Andrew Cyrille(Wednesday) Mr. Monder is a guitarist whose cerebral cool manifests in his music as a form of ethereality, full of color and dimension but not much density. “Amorphae,” his debut as a leader on the ECM label, is a collection of beautifully atmospheric compositions played with partners including the master drummer Andrew Cyrille, who joins him here. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org.

At 9 p.m., National Sawdust, 80 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn , 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org. (Chinen)Sam Sadigursky: ‘Follow the Stick’(Wednesday) The stick in question is a clarinet, by means of some outmoded slang, and the person wielding it will be Mr. Sadigursky, whose recent albums have been gracefully high-minded explorations of poetic form. Here he pays a more straightforward homage to the clarinet’s legacy in 1930s and ’40s small-group jazz, with the vibraphonist Chris Dingman, the pianist Bobby Avey and the drummer Jordan Perlson. At 8 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.

From 7:30 to 10:30 p.m., Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, near Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. (Chinen)★ John Zorn at the Vanguard(Tuesday through Nov. 8) One of the least expected new staples at the Village Vanguard has been John Zorn, the avant-garde composer, alto saxophonist and provocateur.
