In The New York Times Book Review, Rachel Cusk reviews Alexandra Fuller’s new memoir, “Leaving Before the Rains Come,” an account of the collapse of the author’s marriage. Ms. Cusk writes:Divorce is both ordinary and extreme. For many people it represents their most intense experience of unreality, yet it occurs at the most intimately humdrum level of life. Moreover, divorce is a kind of anti-story: It is the spectacle of narrative breaking down, both personally and publicly. Narrative works by agreement, and the whole point about divorce is that it represents the end of agreement. In divorce the story of life is deemed unfit to continue because the participants cannot agree on a common truth. The truth has to be broken in two; there now have to be two truths, two stories, two versions. The end of marriage is in a sense the end of universality and the beginning of point of view. Onlookers are often forced to take sides, for the reason that it is impossible to believe in two stories at once. And thus a problem arises, which is that before we’ve even begun to read the memoir of divorce we are convinced that what we are reading is only half the truth.On this week’s podcast, Ms. Fuller discusses her new book; John Williams has news from the publishing world; Lauren Groff talks about Miranda July’s “The First Bad Man”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
