Pictures taken by a collaborator show him posing with Paloma Picasso, Henry Kissinger and others who may have taken him for a visiting dignitary rather than an interloper from the downtown art scene. Around the same time, Mr. Tseng was producing his best-known works, images of himself in his Mao suit and sunglasses in front of monuments like the Eiffel Tower. Examples from those series as well as portraits of his artist friends Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat and others will be included in “Tseng Kwong Chi: Performing for the Camera,” a show of more than 80 works at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University opening Tuesday.
