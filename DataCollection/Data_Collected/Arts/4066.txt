Patti Smith, the rock poet and National Book Award winner for 2010’s “Just Kids,” will release a follow-up memoir, titled “M Train,” on Oct. 6, the publisher Knopf announced on Monday.While “Just Kids” centered on Ms. Smith’s formative years in New York City and her almost cosmic relationship with the artist Robert Mapplethorpe, “M Train” is “a coffee-saturated odyssey into the mind of a legendary artist, told through the prism of the cafes and haunts she has worked in around the world,” Knopf said in a statement.Ms. Smith called the new book “a roadmap to my life.” Her publisher said the memoir will take readers through 18 “stations” that proved influential in Ms. Smith’s work and personal development, “from Frida Kahlo’s Casa Azul in Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer’s society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York’s Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud and Mishima.”“M Train” will also cover Ms. Smith’s marriage to the MC5 guitarist Fred Smith, who died in 1994 at the age of 44. Teasing the sequel in 2012, Ms. Smith told Billboard that the book is “in more of the ‘Just Kids’ vein and even in the similar time period, but shifts more to family, Fred, music.”“I don’t have a big rock ’n’ roll lifestyle, a sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll story to tell,” she added. “I think I have maybe a better story.”A version of this article appears in print on 04/14/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Another Memoir From Patti Smith.
