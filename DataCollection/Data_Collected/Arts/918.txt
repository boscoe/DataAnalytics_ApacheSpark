Never say that television time doesn’t sell records.After the Nashville singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton was the upset winner at the Country Music Association Awards last Wednesday — taking the male vocalist and new artist prizes, and album of the year — his debut record, “Traveller,” shot to No. 1 on the latest Billboard album chart. It had five million streams and sold 153,000 copies in the week that ended Thursday, with its sales figure up more than 6,000 percent from the week before, when it moved just more than 2,000 copies.Back in May, when “Traveller” was released, it reached a peak of No. 14 on the chart, and by September it had fallen off the Billboard 200 altogether. Mercury Nashville, Mr. Stapleton’s record label, reported that after his honors at the C.M.A.’s last week, all of his remaining tour dates “sold out within hours.”Country albums make up the next two spots of the album chart as well. Carrie Underwood’s “Storyteller” (19/Arista Nashville) holds at No. 2 in its second week out, and Eric Church’s new “Mr. Misunderstood” (EMI Nashville) opened at No. 3.Vol. 56 of the pop compilation series “Now That’s What I Call Music!” bowed at No. 4, and the Weeknd’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” (XO/Republic) fell two spots to No. 5 in its 10th week on sale. Taylor Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine), which stayed in the Top 10 for its entire first year of release, fell this week to No. 11, in its 53rd week on the chart.Also this week, Adele had another strong showing for her new single, “Hello.” The song sold 635,000 downloads in its second week out — just slightly less than the 636,000 copies that Flo Rida’s “Right Round” sold in February 2009, which had stood for more than six years as the biggest week of downloads for any song. That record was shattered by “Hello,” which in its first week out sold more than 1.1 million.A version of this article appears in print on 11/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Stapleton Album No. 1 After an Awards Boost.
