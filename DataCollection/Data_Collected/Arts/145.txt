Every spring for decades, a similar scene played out at colleges across the United States: Students picked up their degrees — and Bill Cosby stood alongside them.Schools wanted Mr. Cosby, the popular, education-embracing comedian, to give their commencement address and he routinely showed up, often in a school sweatshirt, offering high fives, hugs and homespun advice. In exchange, universities and colleges gave him honorary degrees in categories like education, public service and law.Few people in American history have been recognized by universities as often as Mr. Cosby, whose publicist once estimated that the entertainer had collected more than 100 honorary degrees. The New York Times, in a quick search, found nearly 60.But now, as dozens of women have come forward to accuse Mr. Cosby of sexual assault, colleges across the country are confronting the question of what to do when someone who has been honored falls from grace.AdvertisementSome are sticking with longstanding policies that prohibit the revocation of such awards. Some are still debating what to do. And some are rescinding Mr. Cosby’s degrees.AdvertisementFordham, Marquette, Brown and the University of San Francisco all announced in the last two weeks that they were revoking the honor they bestowed on Mr. Cosby.“It has become clear,” Christina Paxson, the president of Brown, said in her statement that “by his own admission in legal depositions that became public this summer, that Mr. Cosby has engaged in conduct with women that is contrary to the values of Brown and the qualities for which he was honored by the university in 1985.”But Yale is among the schools that have taken a completely different approach — no action, even in the face of an online petition to strike the award given in 2003.“Revoking Cosby’s doctorate is about more than achieving justice for his victims,” Marissa Medansky, a recent graduate who started the petition, wrote in The Yale Daily News last month. “It is a gesture, however small, against sexual violence wherever these heinous crimes occur — including at Yale and other college campuses.”Yale said in a statement that it has never rescinded an honorary degree, without elaborating on its reasoning.Some schools say they do not want to condemn in the court of public opinion a man who has never been found guilty in a court of law, or even charged with a crime. Mr. Cosby has denied all wrongdoing.“We give out honorary degrees based on what we know at the time,” said Kimberly Alexander, vice president for institutional advancement at Talladega College in Alabama where Mr. Cosby was honored in 1992, “and at the time he was everybody’s favorite dad.”AdvertisementStill others are still grappling with what to do, like Ohio State University, which bestowed its award on Mr. Cosby in 2001; the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City (1995); the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2003); and the Fashion Institute of Technology (2000).Jeremy Travis, the president of John Jay, said a proposal to rescind Mr. Cosby’s degree was “under very active consideration at the moment.”“What makes the case compelling” he said in a phone interview, “is the very serious pattern of misconduct that’s been revealed both in journalistic accounts and by a large number of women who have now bravely come forward and has been validated by Mr. Cosby’s own testimony in deposition about his pattern of conduct.”For schools, honorary degrees are a way to reward well-respected individuals, draw attendance by celebrities and perhaps generate a financial gift. Revoking them is an administrative formality and public rebuke.Mr. Cosby is clearly in a top tier of people whose tally of such awards is impressive, but he is not the record-holder. According to the Guinness World Records, the person who collected the most honorary degrees is King Bhumipol of Thailand with 136. But the University of Notre Dame said its former president, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, had received 150. (Notre Dame awarded Mr. Cosby an honorary degree in 1990 and also has a policy of not rescinding such awards.)Mr. Cosby has taken in at least 57 such degrees since 1985. He received them from every kind of school from the very big, like the University of Southern California, to smaller schools like Berklee College of Music in Boston. Several of Mr. Cosby’s honorary degrees came from historically black colleges, including Delaware State University, Fisk University in Nashville and Dillard University in New Orleans, which bestowed its honor in 2006, during its first commencement after Hurricane Katrina.Typically the schools honored Mr. Cosby for his success as an entertainer, as well as his pronounced support for education and his espousal of the sort of bootstraps perseverance that would serve young graduates well.“As an actor, a humorist, and a citizen, Bill Cosby has been one of America’s most eloquent advocates for education and the value of developing every individual mind,” Carnegie Mellon’s president, Jared L. Cohon, said in 2007 when Mr. Cosby received his degree.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Other than at church or a wedding you don’t see people like this. It’s a getting for me, but it’s also a giving. It’s a spiritual experience.” A spokesman for Mr. Cosby, David Brokaw, declined to discuss the issue of his honorary degrees.AdvertisementSchools began distancing themselves from Mr. Cosby months ago, including his alma mater, Temple University, which accepted his resignation from the board in December and Spelman College, a historically black women’s college in Atlanta that in July terminated a professorship endowed by Mr. Cosby.The recent wave of schools rescinding Mr. Cosby’s honorary degrees has only resurrected the issue, particularly at schools where administration policies have fallen under scrutiny in recent years for their handling of sexual assault.Mr. Cosby is far from the first honorary degree recipient who has held onto his award despite subsequent intense criticism. DePauw University in Indiana, for example, has not rescinded the honorary degree it awarded Richard M. Nixon in 1957, years before his role in Watergate. Morehouse College in Atlanta has similarly not rescinded a 1983 honorary degree it gave Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe who has a much criticized record on human rights.But as many schools point out, honorary degrees are not Nobel Prizes. And many students on college campuses today are often barely familiar with past honorees. That is certainly true of Mr. Cosby, who received some of his awards decades ago, before some current students were even born.“We’re not even thinking about Bill Cosby,” said Edwina Harris Hamby, vice president for institutional advancement at Fisk. “Most of the students now don’t even know who Bill Cosby is unless they look at Netflix or something like that.”American colleges and universities have routinely awarded honorary degrees to Bill Cosby, as evident in this partial list of nearly 60. Some of these schools are grappling with whether to rescind the honor. Others already have. And many say they have never rescinded an honorary degree and would not change the policy in Mr. Cosby’s case.Baylor UniversityBerklee College of MusicBoston CollegeBoston UniversityBrown UniversityBryant CollegeCarnegie Mellon UniversityColby CollegeColgate UniversityCollege of William and MaryCooper UnionDelaware State UniversityAdvertisementDillard UniversityDrew UniversityDrexel UniversityFashion Institute of TechnologyFisk UniversityFordham UniversityGeorge Washington UniversityHampton UniversityHaverford CollegeHoward UniversityJohn Jay College of Criminal JusticeJohns Hopkins UniversityMarquette UniversityNew York UniversityNorth Carolina A&T State UniversityNorthwestern UniversityOberlin CollegeOhio State UniversityOld Dominion UniversityPaine CollegePepperdine UniversityRensselaer Polytechnic InstituteRust CollegeSpelman CollegeSpringfield CollegeSwarthmore CollegeTalladega CollegeTemple UniversityTufts UniversityUniversity of CincinnatiUniversity of ConnecticutUniversity of MarylandUniversity of Massachusetts, AmherstUniversity of Notre DameUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel HillUniversity of PennsylvaniaUniversity of PittsburghUniversity of San FranciscoUniversity of South CarolinaUniversity of Southern CaliforniaVirginia Commonwealth UniversityWesleyan UniversityWest Chester UniversityWilkes UniversityYale UniversityBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the awarding of honorary degrees to Bill Cosby by colleges and universities, some of which have now rescinded them, misstated the year the University of Notre Dame gave him one.
