But he soon realizes that it was the pursuit that kept him going all that time, so he reanimates Bart, with unintended consequences.That’s just part of this bizarre episode, the 26th “Treehouse of Horror.” As is customary, it’s divided into three main parts. (One of the others is titled “Homerzilla,” and yes, doughnuts are involved.) If you need to catch up on this goofy tradition, FXX begins a “Treehouse of Horror” marathon that same day.Advertisement
