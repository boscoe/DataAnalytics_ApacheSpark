The Library of Congress  will showcase the power and punch of the political cartoon in the exhibition “Pointing Their Pens: Herblock and Fellow Cartoonists Confront the Issues,” which opens March 21. Herbert L. Block, who died in 2001, was the chief editorial cartoonist for The Washington Post for more than half a century. His work forms the core of the exhibition, which focuses on six subjects that inspired some of his most memorable cartoons: World War II, the McCarthy era, the Cold War, the Vietnam War, Richard M. Nixon and the Middle East. Each will have two cartoons by Herblock and three by his contemporaries.The library has more than 14,000 Herblock drawings, donated by the Herb Block Foundation in 2002. The exhibition, in the library’s Graphic Arts Galleries, will also draw heavily on the Art Wood Collection of Cartoon and Caricature, which comprises more than 17,000 original editorial cartoons, donated to the Library in 2001. An online version of the exhibition will be available at www.loc.gov/exhibits/.
