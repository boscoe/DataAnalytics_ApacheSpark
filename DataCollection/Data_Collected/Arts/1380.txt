Lin-Manuel Miranda is still performing on Broadway, but he also has a gig in a galaxy far, far away. J.J. Abrams, the director of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” revealed on the “Tonight” show that Mr. Miranda helped write the music for the movie’s cantina scene.Mr. Abrams told the host, Jimmy Fallon, that he met Mr. Miranda during intermission of the hit musical “Hamilton” and that the Broadway star told him, “If you need music for the cantina, I’ll write it.”The original cantina scene in “A New Hope” (1977) featured a couple of barfights and the introduction of Han Solo, as well as a jazzy instrumental composed by John Williams. Mr. Williams scored most of the new movie but decided not to write the updated cantina music, so Mr. Abrams approached Mr. Miranda, and a collaboration developed over several months. Mr. Miranda later posted on Twitter:We did.
Worked on it between 6pm & 7:30 on 2 show days for the past 2 months.
JJ is the best.
Can’t wait to see.
