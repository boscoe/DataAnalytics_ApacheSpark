An empty suburban street seen from above, a slowly sweeping sprinkler, a young boy’s back, the melancholy plink-plunk of a piano on the soundtrack. The opening moments of “The Guilty,” a three-part British mini-series beginning Sunday night on PBS, don’t tell us a thing, and yet we immediately know that a child has gone missing.We know it because we’ve seen “Five Days,” “The Killing,” “The Missing” and all the other where-is-he-or-she series, especially “Broadchurch,” the example of which is present in every frame of “The Guilty.” (Both were first shown on the British network ITV.)All the elements of the genre are here — the parents who have lied about key facts, the police who have focused on the wrong suspect, the suspiciously withdrawn older brother, the shady boyfriend, the spurious confession, the trip to another country to track down a witness.That familiarity is a problem, but the bigger problems are the dreary tastefulness of Edward Bazalgette’s direction and the thin, inconsequential nature of the mystery, which limps to a particularly unsatisfying conclusion.The story of a missing boy named Callum is seen in flashbacks to the time of his disappearance and in the present, five years later, when the case is reopened. Tamsin Greig of “Episodes” is fine as the no-nonsense detective who takes over the case, while Darren Boyd, so funny in the sitcom “Spy,” is a bland dramatic lead as the boy’s father.A subplot involving the detective’s son sets up a parallel between her guilt as a working mother and the more profound version felt by Callum’s mom, but it’s perfunctory. That’s also true of the station-house scenes, which feature the drabbest, least interesting collection of cops imaginable. “The Guilty” may have “Broadchurch” in its DNA, but the resemblance is purely cosmetic.A version of this review appears in print on October 24, 2015, on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Chasing a Missing Child  Down a Familiar Path.
