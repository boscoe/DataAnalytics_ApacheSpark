The critically acclaimed musical “Hamilton,” which is preparing to transfer to Broadway after a sold-out, celebrity-packed run at the Public Theater, was named the best new American theater work at the 60th annual Obie Awards on Monday night.The award singled out the musical’s writer and star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, as well as its director, Thomas Kail; music director, Alex Lacamoire; and choreographer, Andy Blankenbuehler.In addition, James Houghton, the founding artistic director of the Signature Theater, was given an Obie for sustained achievement. Mr. Houghton has been diagnosed with stomach cancer, and has announced that he will leave his post at Signature next spring.The Obies, which recognize work Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway, were created by the Village Voice. The newspaper this year for the first time partnered with the American Theater Wing, which created the Tony Awards, in administering the contest. The award categories vary each year, and are determined at the discretion of the contest judges.This year the Obies recognized three playwrights: Suzan-Lori Parks, for the Civil War-era “Father Comes Home From the Wars (Parts 1, 2 & 3),” which was presented at the Public; Ayad Akhtar, for the terrorism-themed “The Invisible Hand,” from New York Theater Workshop; and Clare Barron, for the comic drama “You Got Older,” from Page 73.Among many other award recipients were April Matthis, for sustained excellence in performance; Anne Kauffman, for sustained excellence in directing; Christine Jones, for sustained excellence in set design; and Ben Stanton and Japhy Weideman, for sustained excellence in lighting design.The Obies also gave special citations to the creative teams involved in the plays “Bootycandy” and “A Beautiful Day in November on the Banks of the Greatest of the Great Lakes,” as well as to the cabaret artist Bridget Everett for her Joe’s Pub show “Rock Bottom.”A version of this article appears in print on 05/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Hamilton’ Wins Obie.
