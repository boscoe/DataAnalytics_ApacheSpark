Will Smith and Margot Robbie in a scene from a film.Will Smith will have to wait for another movie to vanquish concerns about his popularity among moviegoers. Terrible weather across the United States contributed to weak multiplex turnout over the weekend, with ticket sales down 14 percent compared with the same period last year, according to Rentrak, which compiles box-office data. In his first major role since the 2013 bomb “After Earth,” Mr. Smith helped “Focus” collect roughly $19.1 million in North American ticket sales, easily enough for first place but a bit less than most analysts had expected. The blandly titled “Focus,” an R-rated crime dramedy co-starring the fast-rising actress Margot Robbie, ranks as one of Mr. Smith’s smallest opening-weekend performances, on par with dramas like “Seven Pounds” and “Ali,” after accounting for inflation. “Focus” (Warner Bros.) cost $50 million to make, after taking tax rebates into consideration. Critics held their noses at the weekend’s only other new wide-release movie, “The Lazarus Effect,” which took in about $10.6 million, and audiences seemed to agree, giving it a C-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls. Still, “The Lazarus Effect” is a win for Relativity Media, which acquired the horror film for distribution from Blumhouse Productions for just $3.3 million. Also of note over the weekend: “American Sniper” generated an additional $7.7 million in tickets, for a 10-week domestic total of $331.1 million — a sum that surpasses the domestic performance of seven of the eight “Harry Potter” blockbusters.
