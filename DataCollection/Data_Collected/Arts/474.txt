Updated, 11:38 a.m. | In a musing on aging posted to social media, Adele has announced that her long-awaited new album will be titled “25,” following the tradition of her first two releases, “19” and “21.”Named for the age she was while writing it, “25” will be released on Nov. 20 via Columbia in the United States. The 11-track album comes close to five years after “21,” which sold some 30 million copies worldwide and won seven Grammys. The album’s debut single, “Hello,” will be available to purchase and stream on Oct. 23; a video for “Hello,” directed by Xavier Dolan and shot near Montreal, will also be released that day.“My last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one I would call it a make-up record,” Adele, 27, wrote on Wednesday. “I’m making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did.”The singer added: “Turning 25 was a turning point for me, slap bang in the middle of my twenties. Teetering on the edge of being an old adolescent and a fully-fledged adult, I made the decision to go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a removal van full of my old junk.”The music was first teased on Sunday, in a commercial during “X Factor UK” that provided a preview but few details. “Hello, it’s me,” she sang in the clip. “I was wondering if after all these years you’d like to meet/To go over everything/They say that time’s supposed to heal you/But I ain’t done much healing.”In her open letter, Adele concluded, “25 is about getting to know who I’ve become without realizing.”“And I’m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened,” she wrote.A version of this article appears in print on 10/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Adeleu2019s New Album: u201825,u2019 and a Likely No. 1.
