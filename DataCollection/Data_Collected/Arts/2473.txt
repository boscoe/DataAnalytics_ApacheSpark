AdvertisementSupported byThe Week Ahead | DanceBy Jack AndersonSince its founding in 1959, Nederlands Dans Theater has been remarkably venturesome, assembling an impressive contemporary repertory. In 1978, it established Nederlands Dans Theater 2 (NDT2, for short) for dancers between 17 and 22 years old. More than a training ground, NDT2 has a distinct repertory, several pieces from which will be shown in its first season here in five years, including some unusual examples of collaborative choreography. Paul Lightfoot, NDT2’s director, and Sol León, its artistic adviser, teamed up for the highly emotional “Subject to Change” and the eccentric “Shutters Shut,” which unites choreographic play with wordplay as dancers interpret a poem by Gertrude Stein. Working together, the Israeli choreographers Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar created “Sara,” an exploration of memories and dreams. (7:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 8 p.m. Thursday and Friday, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday, and 2 p.m. next Sunday, Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea; 212-242-0800, joyce.org.)Advertisement
