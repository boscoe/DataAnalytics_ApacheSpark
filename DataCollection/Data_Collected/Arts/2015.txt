CreditThe Andy Warhol Foundation/ARS        Get ready for a Warhol wave in 2015, and not just at auction. About 40 exhibitions of that artist’s work — much of it previously unseen by the public — will be flooding university art museums and institutions.The force behind the wave is the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, which is just ending its third and final round of a record-breaking program of donations, and entering a new, mature phase, focused solely on grant-making.In this latest round, the foundation gave away more than 14,000 works, mostly photographic material and prints, with the stipulation that museums exhibit the work within five years. In all, the foundation has distributed 52,786 Warhol works to 322 institutions since 1999.Christine J. Vincent, who directed the Aspen Institute’s National Study of Artist-Endowed Institutions, said that the Warhol donations were “unmatched among artist-endowed foundations in terms of the number of donated works and the number of recipient institutions.” (To give an idea of the Warhol Foundation’s reach, it also helped fund the study itself.)AdvertisementIn the next six weeks alone, Warhol exhibitions are opening at the Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts, part of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (including a screen print of Richard M. Nixon’s face titled “Vote McGovern”); the Middlebury College Museum of Art in Vermont (featuring a screen print of Mao Zedong); and the University of Arizona Museum of Art in Tucson (Polaroids and gelatin-silver prints of the downtown New York scene in the ’70s and ’80s).AdvertisementAmong the vintage Warhol prints destined for 10 international institutions and the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University are “unstitched-stitched” photographs — single images that Warhol hired a woman to stitch together in grids of four, six or eight. (They include male mannequins, cows, Pac-Man graffiti and a Picasso-esque shot of the author Tama Janowitz.) At the time of Warhol’s death, a stack of the photos was found next to a sewing machine, waiting to be stitched. Recently, the Warhol Foundation’s board decided that the best disposition was to have them stitched as Warhol intended, by the Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia.The foundation has a cash endowment of more than $280 million and assets north of $350 million, and in 2015 it will give away nearly $14 million in cash grants, mostly to institutions in the United States.“Andy said, ‘Support the visual arts,’ and that was it,” Joel Wachs, the foundation’s president, said of the charter. He added that one of its most significant new projects was a two-year grant of $300,000 to establish Common Field, a national grass-roots network of artist-run spaces and projects.“When I say that Andy is going to be as well known for his philanthropy as he is for his art, it’s really true,” Mr. Wachs said.Since 2008, the foundation has focused on giving works to college and university art galleries, where it has found an appreciative audience hungry for Warhol material to show and use.And there is a lot to choose from because of Warhol’s prolific approach to art and life, which involved toting a camera everywhere and logging what he called a “visual diary.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He noted that Warhol routinely would take hundreds of Polaroids of a single subject as source material for working on a portrait painting.The College of Wooster Art Museum in Ohio has received 150 works since 2008, most of them Polaroids, screen prints and gelatin black-and-white photographic prints. The museum will show much of these in an exhibition this fall exploring Warhol’s pioneering use of the selfie.Advertisement“It’s a huge deal for us on several levels,” said Kitty Zurko, the museum’s director. “We’re a teaching museum, and we actively use this material on a day-to-day basis. But we’re also a liberal arts school. Not everyone is an art student, but everyone knows who Warhol is — even a chemistry student.”The Cantor Arts Center received the largest of the recent Warhol gifts, including 4,115 sheets of negatives — covering the entire collection of his black-and-white photography — and 3,624 contact sheets.“Stanford can do something other institutions couldn’t, which is take a truly interdisciplinary and multilayered approach to Warhol, which is appropriate,” said Connie Wolf, the Cantor’s director.Although no exhibitions of the Warhol material at Stanford are scheduled until 2017, the contact sheets will be used this spring, along with images by the 19th-century English photography pioneer Eadweard Muybridge, in a class at the Stanford University School of Medicine aimed at enhancing the clinical skills of medical students through analysis of art. Larger museums were not forgotten in the latest round of giving. Warhol assembled six “family albums,” comprising varying numbers of Polaroids, and the foundation gave one album each to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Whitney Museum of American Art; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art; the George Eastman House and the Portland Art Museum in Oregon.But is everything Warhol touched really a work of art? “A lot of these were things he did for his personal use,” said Peter Barberie, a curator of photographs at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, adding that many of the 467 images in the album the museum received were of “famous people, dogs and naked men.” Some were exhibited at the museum last year.He added that the museum was happy to have them because the museum owned no Warhol Polaroids and the images afford a window on the artistic process. “This isn’t like his cookie jars that were sold at auction,” Mr. Barberie said. “Photography was at the core of his art.”The mere fact that Warhol never sold or gave away the images adds value, Mr. Barberie said. “These were the ones he really liked and kept for himself.”A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: For Warhol, ’15 Brings More Fame.
