CreditJessica Kourkounis for The New York Times        PHILADELPHIA —  Cody, a coltish 4-year-old camel with a double hump, stood placidly during rehearsal in the center circus ring at Wells Fargo Center here. That is, until he turned toward the show’s ringmaster and placidly began to munch on the shiny brim of his rhinestone-embellished top hat.“He is eating my hat!” said David Shipman, the ringmaster. Mr. Shipman edged away. Cody followed. And kept munching.Looking on, and collapsing in laughter, were the Desert Goddesses, who are all too familiar with camels’ antic ways. The Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders is a new attraction of the 145th edition of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which opens on Thursday at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.In the new edition, titled “Circus Xtreme,” six camels wheel about in formation as the riders perform their own synchronized stunts. The six women, all skilled in Cossack-style riding, assume stately poses that echo the camels’ haughty, chin-up demeanor. The Goddesses drape themselves across the trotting camels’ necks, hang backward from their pommels and even grasp their saddles to twist upside down with legs in the air.AdvertisementTheir mounts are two-hump Bactrian camels — Camelus bactrianus — that have origins in the Asian steppes, including Mongolia. These camels are rarer than one-hump dromedaries; Bactrians are Seussian creatures that almost look like Rube Goldberg contraptions.Advertisement“Camels — invariably one-hump dromedaries — have been used to dress up spectacles in American circuses,” said William B. Hall, an 81-year-old independent circus producer in Churchville, Pa., who has seen every year’s Ringling show since his parents took him to his first, in 1934. “But Mongolian horsewomen riding Bactrian camels, and doing stunts — well, it’s a first. I can’t recall anything like this.”“The camels all have such different personalities,” said Enkhgerel Otgonchimeg, 19, winner of a horseback archery award from the Mongolian government.“And their two humps make for a more comfortable ride,” said Tuul Gantumur, 22, who has been a Cossack horsewoman for a decade. She rides Chester, a 10-year-old, 8-foot-tall camel weighing 1,500 pounds.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They are part of the troupe of 24 Mongolian performers in the show, including acrobats, weight lifters and a throat singer. “It was an off-the-wall idea, to take six camels that hadn’t been ridden before and match them with six horsewomen,” said Nicole Feld, who with her sister Alana produces the Ringling show. “It took us a year to work it all out.”Robert Stipka, the troupe’s 30-year-old animal trainer, said that “camels are a bit easier to train than horses, and they are very intelligent.”Though camels have a reputation for orneriness, “they are very friendly and not aggressive or mean, though sometimes they have a bad day,” said Mr. Stipka, the seventh-generation scion of a Czech circus family. “Camels bite — but no more than horses do.” However, he noted, camels tend to spit when agitated.It took Mr. Stipka six months to school the camels. “We use only positive reinforcement, treats and rewards, and that’s why it takes so much time,” he said. “If you’re mean to them, they get scared and they won’t perform.”Mr. Stipka has trained the camels to move by voice command (in French, a cavalry tradition) as well as by his and the riders’ body movements. They perform in columns of twos and threes, in interweaving cutbacks and, yes, waltzes. The camels perform with the show’s 110 humans, 20 dogs, 18 tigers, five elephants, three horses, two snakes and a miniature donkey. Mr. Stipka said the Bactrians travel together in a custom-designed camel trailer.The camel presentation is a work in progress, and the Goddesses are eager to refine their maneuvers. “We’d like to shoot arrows while riding,” Ms. Otgonchimeg said, “or stand on the moving camels.”The Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus heads to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Thursday and runs through March 1; ringling.com.
