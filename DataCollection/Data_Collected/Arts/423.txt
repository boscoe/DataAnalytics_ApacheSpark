Theater J, a prominent Jewish theater in Washington, has found a new artistic director. After a year of turmoil, Adam Immerwahr will assume the position left by Ari Roth, who was fired last December after 18 years with the organization.Mr. Immerwahr is the associate artistic director at the McCarter Theater Center in Princeton, N.J. He was on the original producing team of Christopher Durang’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike,” which won the 2013 Tony Award for Best Play, and was on the team of the McCarter theater revival of Stephen Sondheim’s “Into the Woods.” Mr. Immerwahr will begin programming for the 2016-17 season. “There are few theaters in the country that have developed an audience this engaged, this hungry, for provocative, delightful work,” he said. Mr. Roth was dismissed last year following what he claims was a “growing artistic impasse” regarding his effort to showcase controversial works on the Middle East. He claims that the theater was under pressure from donors to shy away from works that explored critical views of Israel. Theater J denies those accusations.When asked if he would be willing to tackle similarly controversial material related to the Middle East, Mr. Immerwahr said: “Absolutely. If the play is excellent, I would absolutely be willing to explore it. And I know the staff of Theater J and the leadership of the D.C.” Jewish Community Center “is ready and willing to go there.“A version of this article appears in print on 10/20/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Jewish Theater Hires New Artistic Director.
