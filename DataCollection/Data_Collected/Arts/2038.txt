Rising young singers, a mix of old and new works, star directors and a new, intimate theater will all be features of the San Francisco Opera’s 2015-16 season, the last under its transformative general director, David Gockley, the company announced Wednesday.Mr. Gockley, who plans to retire after the season after a decade with the company, said in a statement that he had “stacked my final season at the helm of this great company with some of my most cherished works.” In early 2016 the company plans to present a season of “intimate and innovative operatic works” in its new Diane B. Wilsey Center for Opera’s 299-seat Atrium Theater, in a building adjacent to its main stage, the War Memorial Opera House.The season will open on Sept. 11 with Verdi’s “Luisa Miller,” starring Michael Fabiano, an in-demand young tenor, Leah Crocetto and Thomas Hampson, conducted by Nicola Luisotti, the company’s music director. The season’s 10 large-scale works will include Stephen Sondheim’s “Sweeney Todd,” starring the bass-baritone Gerald Finley and the mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe; the soprano Diana Damrau as Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor”; Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” in a production by David McVicar, and Bizet’s “Carmen” staged by the provocative Catalan theater and opera director Calixto Bieito.The San Francisco Opera will also be presenting the American premiere of a double bill based on Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher,” which includes Gordon Getty’s opera “Usher House” and a reconstruction of Claude Debussy’s “La Chute de la Maison Usher,” whose score was left unfinished.A version of this article appears in print on 01/09/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Adventurous Offerings At San Francisco Opera.
