The partial demolition of the Orange County Government Center, a building designed by Paul Rudolph in Goshen, N.Y., that preservationists would like to save, will not begin before July, according to a judge’s ruling Friday.Though Rudolph’s Brutalist style has been acclaimed, the county determined that the building, which has leaks and other problems, was too expensive to repair and that it would tear down a portion of the building and alter other sections to make way for a new government center.But several local residents challenged that decision in court, citing the architectural importance of the building and arguing that the county’s plan was wasteful when compared to a competing plan that would have saved the government center.After hearing arguments from lawyers for the county and the residents during a proceeding Friday at State Supreme Court in Goshen, Judge Christopher Cahill ruled that no demolition should take place until he has had a chance to hear arguments on a preliminary injunction. He told both sides to submit their documents to him by May 15.The county said in its presentation that it had not intended to begin demolition before July anyway.“We’re delighted with the result,” said Michael Sussman, the lawyer seeking the injunction, adding that he looked forward to the matter being “further resolved at trial.”
