A photograph by Robert Mapplethorpe, once denounced in the United States Congress, sold at auction at Sotheby’s in New York on Wednesday for $478,000, including fees.“Man in Polyester Suit,” a black-and-white image from 1980 depicting a black man wearing a three-piece suit, with his penis exposed, was estimated at $250,000 to $350,000.The image helped touch off a cultural conflagration in 1989 when Senator Jesse Helms cited it among examples of “filthy art” which had received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts.“Man in Polyester Suit” was also part of a show of Mapplethorpe works that led to criminal obscenity charges against the director of Cincinnati’s Contemporary Arts Center. (He was acquitted in 1990.) The decidedly not-safe-for-work image, which cannot be reproduced here, can be easily found through a search engine.In subsequent years the image has come to be seen as a key Mapplethorpe work, touching on issues of race, class and sexual stereotypes. The last time this print was sold at auction, in 1992, it traded hands for $9,900 (about $17,000 when adjusted for inflation). Mapplethorpe will also be the subject of a retrospective exhibition next year in Los Angeles at the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.A version of this article appears in print on 10/09/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Mapplethorpe Photo Is Sold at Auction.
