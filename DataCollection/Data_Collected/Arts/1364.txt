The record-crushing sales for Adele’s “25” accounted for 41 percent of all album purchases in the United States last week — and 48 percent of all digital album sales, according to Nielsen Music. But there were, in fact, many other releases available.While “25” (XL/Columbia) was not truly challenged for the No. 1 spot on the Billboard chart, the previous week’s top album, “Purpose,” by Justin Bieber, sold respectably in its second week out, falling to No. 2 with 290,000 album equivalent units sold, including streams and track downloads. One Direction’s “Made in the A.M.” (Syco/Columbia) sits at No. 3 with 108,000 units, followed by Jadakiss’s “Top 5 Dead or Alive” (Def Jam), which debuted at No. 4 with 66,000 units sold, and the Weeknd’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” (XO/Republic) at No. 5.But everyone else exists only in Adele’s shadow. Dethroning ’N Sync’s “No Strings Attached,” from 2000, “25” sold more albums in a single week than any release since Nielsen (formerly SoundScan) started tallying point-of-sale purchases in 1991. In addition to moving 3.38 million copies in pure album sales, “25” sold 960,000 digital song downloads and racked up 12.1 million on-demand streams for a grand total of 3.48 million album equivalent units. (Billboard reported that all of the streams were of the single “Hello,” as Adele opted not to make the full album available on Spotify and similar services.)In another out-of-time twist, 51 percent of sales for “25” were physical copies, mostly from retailers like Target and Barnes & Noble, while 49 percent of sales were digital.Adele’s rising tide also happens to lift all of her boats: The singer’s 2011 album, “21,” jumped back into the Top 10 with 46,000 units sold (good enough for No. 9), and her debut, “19,” rose 35 spots on the chart to No. 20, selling another 27,000 units.A version of this article appears in print on 12/01/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Albums Adele Left in the Dust With u201825u2019.
