Jean Dubuffet believed that art by self-taught and so-called outsider artists possessed an authenticity and creative imagination that was missing from professional art and from modern life in general. He called the work he favored “Art Brut,” collected it in great quantities and donated his accumulation of 4,000 examples to the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1971.“Art Brut in America: The Incursion of Jean Dubuffet,” which opens Tuesday, Oct. 13, at the American Folk Art Museum, will present nearly 200 drawings, paintings, carvings, manuscripts and other forms from that collection, including pieces by autodidacts like Adolf Wölfli, Madge Gill and Augustin Lesage as well as works by artists who are less well known. The show is conceptually anchored by two events: a speech that Dubuffet gave in Chicago in 1951 in which he passionately advocated art by people “uncontaminated by artistic culture”; and a decade-long exhibition of 1,200 pieces from his collection, starting in 1952, at the East Hampton mansion of his friend the artist Alfonso Ossorio.
