Confirmed: Female musicians and their fans dominate Instagram.The photo-sharing company, which is celebrating its fifth birthday on Tuesday, has officially ranked its five most popular accounts for the first time — four are pop stars and all are women.Taylor Swift, who mixes cat and concert photos on her account, has the most followers of all, with 49.6 million and counting. The human brand Kim Kardashian comes in second with 48.1 million followed by the singers Beyoncé (47.3 million), Selena Gomez (45.9 million) and Ariana Grande (44.7 million). (Instagram’s own official account has 103 million followers, but it was not counted in the rankings.)Charles Porch, the head of global creative programs at Instagram, said the most popular women tend toward content that is “authentic and often times really fun,” according to Reuters. For Beyoncé — who all but shuns the press in favor of social media — that means a lot of tropical vacation pictures, while Ms. Gomez and Ms. Grande are big on behind-the-scenes glimpses. “What Instagram is doing is giving all these ladies a direct line to their fans and, by having a direct line, they’re controlling their message,” Mr. Porch said.Instagram has said it has more than 400 million users worldwide; 75 percent are from outside the United States.The most popular man on the service is Justin Bieber, who has more than 40 million followers.
