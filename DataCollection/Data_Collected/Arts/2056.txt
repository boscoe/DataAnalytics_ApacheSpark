Hodel and Sean M. Wright, and features Sherlock’s older brother. He was taken with the character, who appears in several of Arthur Conan Doyle’s stories and works for the British government.“I realized more could be done with this ‘older, smarter’ character and his window onto the highest levels of British government — at a time when Britain was the most powerful country in the world,” Mr. Abdul-Jabbar said in a statement.Mr. Abdul-Jabbar, who has published an autobiography, as well as nonfiction and children’s books, will also release his third children’s book, “Streetball Crew – Stealing the Game,” in February.A version of this article appears in print on 01/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: He Scores!
