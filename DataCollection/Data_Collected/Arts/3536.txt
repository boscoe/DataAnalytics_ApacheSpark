The UP channel, expanding its efforts to grab some of the family-and-faith market, acquits itself pretty well Sunday night with “Noah’s Ark,” a film treatment of the religious story that relies on restraint and credible performances rather than literal and figurative thunder and lightning. Not a drop of precipitation falls until the final 10 minutes in this version of the oft-told tale; the focus is on a man’s personal ordeal rather than God’s rainy wrath. The channel’s self-description — “dedicated to uplifting viewers every day” — might call to mind innumerable movies that try to impart religiosity with simplistic scripts badly acted. “Noah’s Ark” isn’t without its Important Messages, but it keeps a lid on them and instead lets David Threlfall take the focus. Kudos to Mr. Threlfall for making about as big a transformation as an actor can make, going from playing the miscreant Frank Gallagher on the British version of “Shameless” to playing Noah. He is quite convincing as a man of faith in an increasingly faithless world, pursuing the boat-building assignment from God although initially even his own beloved family doesn’t support him. This version, written by Tony Jordan and directed by Kenneth Glenaan, has elements of the Koran’s telling, by the way, giving Noah a fourth son in addition to the three of the Bible. That fourth son’s fate is a central element of the story line.The film is a coproduction of Red Planet Pictures and the BBC, and the acting shows a BBC influence; there are no amateurs here. Joanne Whalley is especially good as Noah’s wife. Yes, this is the story born of religion, but it can also be viewed simply as a tale of single-minded pursuit of a goal no matter how quixotic it might seem to the rest of the world.
