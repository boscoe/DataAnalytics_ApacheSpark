In 1881, a year after opening its building on Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, the Metropolitan Museum of Art received its first official bequest of Japanese art: a collection formed by Stephen Whitney Phoenix, scion of a New York merchant and political family. The Met has since amassed a world-class Japanese collection. That story will be told in “Discovering Japanese Art: American Collectors and the Met,” opening at the museum on Saturday.The show will present more than 200 objects in mediums ancient to modern that collectors have donated over the decades. Highlights include sliding-door paintings from the Zen Buddhist temple Ryoanji in Kyoto from the early 17th century; small carved ivory toggles called netsuke from a collection of around 2,500 such objects donated in 1910 by Margaret Olivia Slocum Sage; and, from Henry O. Havemeyer, an early, exceptionally fine impression of Hokusai’s “Great Wave” woodcut print from 1830-31, which entered the Met in 1929. (Through Sept. 27, metmuseum.org.)A version of this article appears in print on February 8, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Art: Glories of Japan, Aglow at the Met.
