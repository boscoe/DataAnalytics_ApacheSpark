Columbia/Legacy Recordings is to announce Thursday that it plans to release “Miles Davis at Newport 1955-75: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4” on July 17. A four-disc set of live recordings, it traces the history of Davis’s concerts at the various Newport Festivals — in Newport, R.I., as well as in Berlin; Dietikon, Switzerland; and New York City. (About three-quarters of the tracks have not been commercially released.) The set includes his complete performance at a festival all-star jam session in 1955, which led to his signing with Columbia; the 1969 concert played shortly before the recording of the studio album “Bitches Brew”; and an appearance in 1975 before a extended hiatus from performing — all of which cemented his status as a Newport mainstay. This year’s Newport Jazz festival, in Newport, R.I., will observe the 60th anniversary of his first performance there with various events: panel discussions about Davis’s history inside and outside the festival, and performances of pieces related to Davis during scheduled sets by various trumpeters. Information about the box set and the festival is at legacyrecordings.com and newportjazzfest.org.A version of this article appears in print on 04/30/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Miles Davis at Newport: Four-Disc Set on the Way.
