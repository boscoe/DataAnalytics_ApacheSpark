LOS ANGELES — Michelle MacLaren, known for her work on television series like “Breaking Bad” and “Game of Thrones,” may not after all be the first woman to direct a major studio superhero franchise: She has parted ways with Warner Brothers and its planned “Wonder Woman” film. In a brief statement, Warner said Ms. MacLaren and the studio had ended their collaboration over creative differences. A Warner spokesman declined to elaborate, and a representative for Ms. MacLaren didn’t immediately respond to a query. A warrior princess from the DC Comics universe, Wonder Woman has figured in past film and television productions, but a contemporary superhero movie has proved elusive. Warner had been planning to release “Wonder Woman” sometime in 2017. That remains the studio’s target date, according to one person briefed on Warner’s plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures. Whether Ms. MacLaren will be replaced by a female filmmaker is an open question, that person said.A version of this article appears in print on 04/15/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Female Director Leaves u2018Wonder Womanu2019 Film.
