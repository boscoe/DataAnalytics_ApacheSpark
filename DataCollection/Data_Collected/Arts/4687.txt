It was the statue laughed at across the country and around the world, but not in the way it was intended: a 400-pound bronze sculpture meant to depict Lucille Ball, the comic actress and “I Love Lucy” star, was instead nicknamed “Scary Lucy” for its large, glaring eyes, frightening smile and general lack of resemblance to the television pioneer. (At least the statue was holding a bottle of Vitameatavegamin.)But now a new comedy attraction set to open next year in upstate New York may be having the last laugh. On Monday, the board of trustees in Celoron, N.Y., the village that had been the reluctant home of “Scary Lucy,” voted unanimously to allow the National Comedy Center to display this notorious statue after it opens next year in nearby Jamestown, N.Y.Tom Benson, the chairman of the National Comedy Center, had asked the Celoron board for the opportunity to display the widely mocked work of art, and applauded the decision on Monday. “We are excited to embrace the statue in a different light,” Mr. Benson said in a statement. “Not as a likeness of Lucille Ball, but as a tribute to what she was all about – making people laugh. This piece of comedy history has made millions of people laugh since going viral.” Shirley Sanfilippo, the clerk treasurer of Celoron, confirmed the board’s unanimous vote in a telephone interview on Monday. She said that the village would retain ownership of the statue while it is on display at the National Comedy Center, and that it must remain in Celoron until a replacement statue is found. Ms. Sanfilippo said that more than 50 sculptors had offered their services to create a new Lucille Ball statue.
