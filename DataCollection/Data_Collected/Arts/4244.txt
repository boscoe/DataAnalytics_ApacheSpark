Mikhail Baryshnikov will perform in a new solo work based on the poems of Joseph Brodsky, created for him by Alvis Hermanis, the director of the New Riga Theater in Riga, Latvia, where Mr. Baryshnikov was born. Called “Brodsky/Baryshnikov,” the piece will have its premiere in Riga on Oct. 15. A tour to the United States, as part of an international tour, is planned for 2016.Mr. Baryshnikov met Mr. Brodsky in 1974, soon after the poet had been forced by the Russian authorities to leave his home country and had moved to the United States, and remained close to him until his death in 1996. (In 1987, Mr. Brodsky was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and in 1991 he became the United States Poet Laureate.) But Mr. Baryshnikov said that the idea had come from Mr. Hermanis, after they discussed a number of potential collaborations.“Alvis knew that I had been very lucky to be next to Joseph for 20-plus years, and he had grown up reading his work, which had a big impact on his life and creative credo,” Mr. Baryshnikov said in a telephone interview. “In Russia, there is a tradition that an actor goes onstage and reads the poems, but he said that he is not looking for this at all.”Mr. Baryshnikov said that the show would not be biographical and would focus solely on Mr. Brodsky’s poetry, selected by Mr. Hermanis, which will be performed in Russian with surtitles. “We are working on the text through Skype, which is new to me and which I’m enjoying,” Mr. Baryshnikov said. He added that although the show will not use dance, “there will be some kind of body language.”It will be the year of the one-man show for Mr. Baryshnikov, who will also perform solo in Robert Wilson’s “Letter to a Man,” based on the diaries of Vaslav Nijinsky, which opens at the Festival di Spoleto in Italy in July.A version of this article appears in print on 04/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Poetry in Motion: Baryshnikov and Brodsky.
