LONDON — Ever since it was reported that the Royal Ballet would visit Washington and Chicago in 2015 rumors have been swirling about a New York stop. The rumors are true. The Royal Ballet and the Joyce Theater Foundation announced Thursday that the company would appear at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center from June 23 to 28, after performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington from June 9 to 14, and at the Auditorium Theater in Chicago from June 18 to 21. It will be the Royal Ballet’s first New York appearance since 2004.Carlos Acosta’s 2013 production of “Don Quixote,” with designs by Tim Hatley and new choreography from Mr. Acosta, will be on the program in Washington and Chicago, but New York gets more adventurous fare in two all-British mixed bills. The first features Frederick Ashton’s “The Dream” and Kenneth MacMillan’s “Song of the Earth,” set to a Mahler song cycle. The second offers “Infra,” a 2008 piece by Wayne McGregor, the Royal Ballet’s resident choreographer, alongside Liam Scarlett’s recent “Age of Anxiety,” and “Divertissements,” which will include the pas de deux from Christopher Wheeldon’s “Aeternum.” None of these choreographers are new to New York dancegoers, although Mr. McGregor’s work has been seen less frequently than that of Mr. Wheeldon, who was resident choreographer at New York City Ballet from 2001 to 2008, or Mr. Scarlett, who has recently created two works for City Ballet and one for American Ballet Theater.Although casting hasn’t been announced, it is expected that most of the company’s principal dancers — including Natalia Osipova, Marianela Nuñez, Lauren Cuthbertson, Steven McRae, Edward Watson, Thiago Soares and Vadim Muntagirov — will perform.A version of this article appears in print on 01/16/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Royal Ballet Adds New York to Tour.
