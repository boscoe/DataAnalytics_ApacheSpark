Once an Atlanta secret weapon who wrote hits for Usher and 112, among others, Poo Bear spent several years dealing with bad contracts and little recognition before a chance meeting with Mr. Bieber led to a period of intense collaboration.The first fruit of that team-up was the 2013 compilation “Journals,” which showed off Mr. Bieber’s affinity for contemplative and sweaty R&B and is easily his strongest release. Between that and this new wave of hits, Mr. Bieber is on the rise, and Poo Bear is the engine behind him.On this week’s Popcast, I spoke with our pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli, who recently spent time with Poo Bear in Los Angeles. We spoke about the songwriter’s early affiliation (and falling out) with the kid-rap phenoms Another Bad Creation, his years in the Atlanta R&B trenches and in the Scott Storch shadows, his sometimes mischievous relationship with Mr. Bieber, and whether Mr. Bieber might ever — with Poo Bear beneath his wings — be freed to pursue his true R&B dreams.Listen to tracks by artists discussed this week.Advertisement
