The title of Rebecca Patek’s new performance piece is a mouthful: “The Future Was Looking Better in the Past: My Family Herstory: or from religious persecution to american greed to murderous infamy to denial, repression and the slow dissolution into moral confusion, financial ruin and karmic retribution.” In the work, Ms. Patek, a choreographer and performance artist who often confronts disturbing subject matter — her last show involved rape — explores facets of violence, both buried within herself and out in the world. In her premiere, presented by the Chocolate Factory and Abrons Arts Center, she finds inspiration in the vicious 1924 murder of Bobby Franks by Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb. Performed by John Hoobyar, Sam Roeck and Chris Tyler, the work blends material from the murder trial, Patek’s family history and her own imagination: Who were Leopold and Loeb? What were their psychological complexities? What leads to acts of horror?
