The actress Reese Witherspoon will narrate the audiobook for Harper Lee’s second novel, “Go Set a Watchman,” which comes out on July 14, HarperCollins announced on Thursday. The novel, which Ms. Lee finished in the mid-1950s before she wrote “To Kill a Mockingbird,” takes place some 20 years after “Mockingbird,” and features a grown-up Scout and her aging father Atticus. Ms. Lee’s publisher and literary agent say that the story is distinct from “To Kill a Mockingbird,” though the two novels share the same setting and characters. HarperCollins is planning a huge two million copy first printing.“The publication of Harper Lee’s “Go Set a Watchman” is the literary event of the year, and Reese Witherspoon’s extraordinary talent and southern roots make her the perfect narrator,” Sean McManus, the senior director of HarperAudio, said in a statement. The award-winning audiobook for “To Kill a Mockingbird” was narrated by the actress Sissy Spacek. In a statement released by HarperCollins, Ms. Witherspoon said that she was excited to give voice to characters who had inspired her as a child.“As a Southerner, it is an honor and privilege to give voice to the Southern characters who inspired my childhood love of reading, Scout and Atticus Finch,” Ms. Witherspoon said. “I am eager for readers to be transported to a pivotal time in American history in the manner that only Harper Lee’s gorgeous prose can deliver.”
