Time Inc. has donated its vast archives to the New-York Historical Society, which will open a dedicated gallery to showcase highlights from what it called “a unique chronicle of the past century and the people who shaped politics, culture and society.”The archive includes some seven million documents and artifacts relating to the company’s leading publications, including Time, Fortune, Life, Sports Illustrated and People. There are field reports from correspondents, photographs, original artwork, newsreels and reference files, as well as artifacts like an autographed robe and pair of boxing gloves worn by Muhammad Ali and a dress worn by Diana, Princess of Wales. The collection also includes the personal papers of the magazine’s leaders, starting with its co-founder Henry R. Luce, whose correspondents included Winston Churchill, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chiang Kai-shek and other major historical figures. Louise Mirrer, the historical society’s president and chief executive, said in a statement that the new dedicated gallery, set to open next year, would feature some of the most important and unusual items drawn from the more than 7,500 linear feet of material, including a first edition of “The Wealth of Nations,” inscribed by Adam Smith to Edmund Burke, that Luce gave to Fortune on its 25th anniversary.
