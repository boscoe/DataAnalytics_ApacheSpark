LONDON — “Artist” isn’t the first word that comes to mind when you hear the name Winston Churchill, prime minister of Britain from 1940 to 1945 and then again from 1951 to 1955. But a part-time artist he was, and a collection of 37 of his paintings has been accepted by the British government in lieu of an inheritance tax, and will be displayed at his family home, Chartwell, which has been open to the public since 1966.The paintings, created between 1915 and the late 1950s, were offered last year after the death of Mary Soames, Churchill’s youngest and last surviving child, who died at the age of 91 in May. The Acceptance in Lieu program is run by the Arts Council England and allows artworks to be donated to the nation in lieu of inheritance tax. The paintings are sought after by collectors of Churchilliana; in December, his “Goldfish Pool at Chartwell” sold for $2.7 million. The donation of the paintings would settle £9,404,990 (about $14 million) of taxes, more than the amount owed by the Soames estate, so the estate is in effect giving more than required.Although many of Lady Soames’s possessions were sold at auction, she expressed a wish that the paintings already on loan to Chartwell should remain there. “In his 41st year, painting literally ‘grabbed’ him,” she wrote, “thereafter playing an increasing and abiding role in his life, renewing the source of his great inner strength and enabling him to face storms, ride out depressions and rise above the tough passages in his political life.” Some 35 paintings will hang at Chartwell, while “Coast Scene Near Cannes” (1935) will go to the Houses of Parliament and “View From a Bathing Hut at the Miami Surf Club” (1945) to the Churchill War Rooms. Art wasn’t the only part-time activity enjoyed by Churchill, who died in 1965. Britain has also accepted the Aly Khan Gold Cup, won in 1961 by Churchill’s horse, High Hat.
