LOS ANGELES – The Sundance Institute said on Thursday that it will expand its avant-garde New Frontier section at the coming Sundance Film Festival to include 30 virtual-reality experiences, more than double the number offered last time. New Frontier, started in 2007, often gets lost amid the premieres and parties that make Sundance such a rollicking event. To bring more attention to the festival’s experimental section and celebrate its 10th anniversary, programmers have decided to make it bigger. In addition to the 30 virtual reality offerings (compared to about a dozen at the last festival), the section will include two films and 11 multimedia installations.Sundance also said New Frontier-related exhibitions will come to New York’s Museum of Modern Art in April and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in June. Sundance described the MoMA exhibit, titled “Slithering Screens,” as showcasing older New Frontier works that “hack the theater space.” The Walker’s exhibit will focus on virtual reality. (More details will be announced in the coming months.)The virtual reality experiences available to Sundance attendees next month – the festival runs Jan. 21 to 31 in Utah — will include “Across the Line,” described as allowing viewers to gain “intimate knowledge of the harassment outside and compassion inside” abortion clinics; “theBlu: Encounter,” a visit with an 80-foot blue whale; and “Nomads: Maasai,” which places viewers in Kenya, where tribal women build mud houses and collect water.
