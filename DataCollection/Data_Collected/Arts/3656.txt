King’s 1961 soul ballad “Stand By Me.”  Also on the list is Steve Martin’s comedy album “A Wild and Crazy Guy” (1978).The most recent recording, made in 1999, is the album “Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman,” composed by Joan Tower and performed by the Colorado Symphony Orchestra under Marin Alsop.A version of this article appears in print on 03/25/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Library of Congress Opens Doors to the Doors.
