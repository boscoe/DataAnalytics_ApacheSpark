British monarchs, past and present, are currently holding court on Broadway, in “Wolf Hall” and “The Audience.” This fall Broadway will be paid a visit by a future monarch, when “King Charles III,” the Olivier Award-winning speculative play about a paranoid Prince Charles ascending to ruler, opens at the Music Box Theater.“King Charles III,” written in iambic pentameter by Mike Bartlett, imagines a future where the monarch subverts tradition and refuses to rubber-stamp the wishes of the elected government. Filled with ghosts, tanks outside Buckingham Palace and a coup orchestrated by a manipulative daughter-in-law, the play opened last spring to mostly excellent reviews in London.Tim Pigott-Smith will reprise the title role on Broadway, and the production will once again be directed by Rupert Goold. Previews are to begin Oct. 10, with opening night scheduled for Nov. 1. The run will be a limited engagement, as “Shuffle Along, or, the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,” starring Audra McDonald, plans to move into the Music Box in March.A version of this article appears in print on 04/14/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Charles’ to Reign On Broadway in October.
