A-Trak has enjoyed the good life as Kanye West’s tour turntablist and still works New York club floors with “Barbra Streisand,” his winningly nonsensical hit released with the house act Duck Sauce. His alchemy of hip-hop and electro is as invigorating as it is influential; he released a soulful house single, “We All Fall Down,” with Jamie Lidell this fall. With AraabMuzik and Falcons. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Stacey Anderson)★ ‘Blood Orange and Friends’ (Saturday) In his electro-industrial persona Blood Orange, Dev Hynes imparts the sonic memories of his street-performance days in the Shoreditch district of London, making his albums “Coastal Grooves” and “Cupid Deluxe” works of psychedelic eclecticism. Mr. Hynes, a talented multi-instrumentalist and composer, is now at the forefront of New York’s electro-R&B scene and has produced distinctive jams for Solange, Carly Rae Jepsen and Sky Ferreira. This multi-artist concert benefits Opus 118 Harlem School of Music. At 3 and 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, 800-745-3000, apollotheater.org. (Anderson)Will Butler (Thursday) This member of Arcade Fire opens his debut solo album, “Policy,” with a stretch of cheery, clanging throwback country-rock akin to Jake Bugg (“Take My Side”); he then segues into detached New Wave synth-pop (“Anna”) and somber pop piano (“Finish What I Started”). Mr. Butler’s mind clearly works swiftly, and he exhibits a healthy dose of irreverence, but the hectic, diffused approach makes his true solo strengths unclear. With Jo Firestone and Hearing Things. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, 718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com. (Anderson)AdvertisementMariah Carey (Friday, Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Dec. 18) Some jovial clubs around the city have been blasting Ms. Carey’s yuletide hit “All I Want For Christmas Is You” since early November. Time for the rest of New York to join in for the whimsical, endlessly melismatic singer’s eight-night run at the Beacon Theater, the second time in as many years that she’s hosted a seasonal residency in New York. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)Advertisement‘John Henry’s Friends With Steve Earle and the Dukes’ (Monday) Mr. Earle, the roots-country renegade who once growled, “If you buy me a strong drink of whiskey/I will tell you the tale of my life” (in “The Gringo’s Tale”), kicks up his dusty heels at Town Hall for this benefit concert for children with autism. His hardscrabble vagabond stories and baleful slide guitars were highlights on the soundtracks for “True Detective” and “The Wire.” With his son, Justin Townes Earle, as well as Jackson Browne and the Mastersons. At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, thetownhall.org. (Anderson)‘Z100’s Jingle Ball 2015 With the Weeknd and Calvin Harris’ (Friday) The cool kids from the pop class of 2015 storm Madison Square Garden’s stage for truncated spectacles. Expect sinuous moves from the Weeknd, the clarion-voiced Canadian electro-R&B singer behind “Can’t Feel My Face,” and Mr. Harris, the globe-trotting D.J., to foster a frenzied pop dance party. There will also be splashy sets from Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas and more. At 7:30 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 866-858-0008, thegarden.com. (Anderson)Billy Joel (Thursday) The piano man has achieved what the Knicks can only fantasize about: a yearlong winning streak at Madison Square Garden. His open-ended monthly residency, which began in January 2014, has been billed by the arena as its fourth franchise. So far, it has included hearty appearances by Sting, John Mellencamp and Brian Johnson of AC/DC, as well as many euphoric singalongs to “New York State of Mind.” At 8 p.m., 800-745-3000, billyjoelmsg.com. (Anderson)Jerry Lee Lewis (Wednesday) Rockabilly’s original fire hound, whose 1950s hits “Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On” and “Great Balls of Fire” heavily influenced both rock ’n’ roll and its rebellious spirit, doesn’t swing by New York often. At 80, he is now something of a mythic figure on the more debauched end of the unofficial Great American Songbook. At 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, bbkingblues.com. (Anderson)Pharoahe Monch (Wednesday) This Queens rapper’s intricate rhymes deftly interweave and self-reference better than an episode of “Arrested Development.” He continues to support his latest record, “PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder),” an album set in the squalid battlefields of the music industry. At 9 p.m., S.O.B.’s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, 212-243-4940, sobs.com. (Anderson)★ Joanna Newsom (Friday) One of the best classically-influenced pop composers of her generation, Ms. Newsom is often infantilized with such cloying descriptors as “elfin” and “twee.” But her lilting fourth studio album, “Divers,” reasserts her as a powerhouse musician with intricacies and intimacy in finely calibrated balance. The arrangements – which include a guest collaboration with Dave Longstreth of the Dirty Projectors – particularly reach new baroque heights. At 8 p.m., Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, 800-745-3000, apollotheater.org. (Anderson)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Its newest full-length album, “Content Nausea,” released under a quasi- pseudonym, Parkay Quarts, speeds along with surf-rock guitar rolls and gonzo spoken lyrics that are sure to please fans of Pavement; the group also released a more shambolic EP, “Monastic Living,” in November. With Pill. At 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 866-777-8932, warsawconcerts.com. (Anderson)★ Sleater-Kinney (Saturday to Wednesday) Many an indie-rock fan lamented the summer of 2006, when Sleater-Kinney announced its hiatus after 12 years together. This year the members, Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss, reunited to release their eighth album, “No Cities to Love.” The record is a gripping comeback filled with taut punk riffs, and its dauntless, alternately wailed and growled vocals are an exhilarating reclamation of feminist power. The group returns to New York for a five-night run. Saturday at 8 p.m., Kings Theater, 1027 Flatbush Avenue, near Tilden Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, kingstheatre.com; Sunday at 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; Monday at 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Manhattan, 212-777-6800, irvingplaza.com; Tuesday at 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, 718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Market Hotel, 1142 Myrtle Avenue, Bushwick, Brooklyn, ticketfly.com. (Anderson)Advertisement‘An Evening With Sting: Symphonicities’ (Monday) Whoever approved this punny title — a play on the Police’s most popular album, “Synchronicity” — deserves a tantric slap on the wrist. Otherwise, enjoy an evening of this singer-songwriter’s hits lushly reconfigured for symphonic accompaniment by the Orchestra of St. Luke’s. Even odds that “Fields of Gold” will include a flute solo. At 7 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Anderson)Thievery Corporation (Friday) This D.J. collective from Washington, anchored by the core members, Eric Hilton and Rob Garza, draws on disparate and often unpredictable sources: acid jazz, Indian ragas and late-1990s electronica, to name a few. Some of its recent collaborators have included David Byrne, Femi Kuti, Seu Jorge and Anoushka Shankar; for its latest, “Saudade,” released last year, the duo skipped the flashy cameos and revisited their Brazilian bossa nova roots. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)This Month in Cabaret Michael Feinstein, the suave singer, pianist and all-around entertainer, will play his first engagement at Feinstein’s/54 Below, the midtown club that now bears his name, Dec. 20 through 30. In earlier years, Mr. Feinstein’s annual holiday shows at his former club in the Regency Hotel were the closest New York nightclub equivalents to the kind of family-friendly holiday television specials that flourished in the 1960s, with their emphasis on yuletide cheer.He has said his debut at 54 Below will be more musically focused. Instead of a jolly swing band, Mr. Feinstein will be accompanied by a pop-jazz trio led by Tedd Firth, the genius nightclub accompanist of the moment, with Mark McLean on drums and Sean Smith on bass. There will be holiday songs, but the emphasis will be on hard-core swing and expansive ballads. A suite of Broadway songs will celebrate his 30th year performing in New York.On Dec. 20 through 24, the heroic baritone Norm Lewis will appear at the club in its 9:30 p.m. slot. (Mr. Feinstein performs mostly at 7 p.m.) Mr. Lewis, like his only rival for king of the Broadway baritones, Brian Stokes Mitchell, can do no wrong; his voice is that powerful and his dramatic command range that confident. (254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, 646-476-3551, 54below.com.)Other highlights include the Brazilian singer Eliane Elias through Saturday at Birdland (at 8:30 and 11 p.m., 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com) and the annual end-of-the-year engagement of Steve Tyrell (singing Frank Sinatra) at Café Carlyle, through Jan. 2. (At various times, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com) (Stephen Holden)★ Patrick Watson (Friday) When their gorgeous 2006 album, “Close to Paradise,” won the prestigious Polaris Music Prize in Canada, Mr. Watson and his namesake band found themselves victors over Arcade Fire and Feist. These chamber-pop specters bested that effort with the dissonant experimentations of “Adventures in Your Own Backyard,” and they explore bucolic acoustic- and electro-folk pathways on their shimmering latest album, “Love Songs for Robots.” At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800, irvingplaza.com.
