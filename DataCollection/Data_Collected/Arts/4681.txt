Traversing the worlds of dance and visual art, Mr. Laris Cohen is interested in their architectural spaces, the nature of black boxes and white cubes. Recently at St. Mark’s Church, he assembled and disassembled, over several nights, a portable stage belonging to New York City Ballet. During last year’s Whitney Biennial, he shuttled a gallery wall from the old Whitney Museum to what is now the new one. These displays of manual labor embed shrewd aesthetic and economic critiques, sometimes punctuated by more traditional dancerly feats.In “Fine,” opening on Thursday at the Kitchen, he continues in this vein. According to a news release, the work “asks architecture’s lowest common denominators to both outperform and fall short of their usual duties.” (Through Saturday, 512 West 19th Street, 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org.)
