THIS year, as always, the Winter Antiques Show monopolizes the glamour and the glory, with top-end wares — at top-end prices — making it the trade-fair equivalent of a big Broadway musical. But there is an Off Broadway too, smaller-scale shows that accommodate the wayward, the whimsical and the downright weird.Two of them opened this week: Metro Curates, at the Metropolitan Pavilion in Chelsea, which exhibits folk art, outsider art, ethnographic art and Americana, and the New York Ceramics and Glass Fair at the Bohemian National Hall on the Upper East Side.First, the weird. At Metro Curates it is hard to overlook Matthew Dutton’s doglike sculpture, part yeti, part child, at the Stephen Romano Gallery. Clad in synthetic grass, with creepy splayed fingers and toes, it (she?) leans on a beat-up child’s highchair and gazes upward plaintively, as if hoping to be released from a spell. Mr. Dutton, a self-taught artist, lives in Chattanooga, Tenn., where he makes the figurines for Gnome Valley at the nearby Rock City attraction.Metro Curates, formerly known as the Metro Show, is the successor to the American Antiques Show, whose ticket sales and opening-night fund-raiser helped support the American Folk Art Museum. In 2011 the museum, in a state of turmoil, handed over the event to the Art Fair Company of Chicago. It has since taken on a more antic personality, although there is plenty of straight-down-the-middle Americana. M. Finkel and Daughter have exquisite samplers hand-sewn by girls like Mary Robinson, an 11-year-old from Lancaster, Pa., whose two 1808 works on green linsey-woolsey show her precise needlework and command of a graceful, curving line.AdvertisementIf that’s not American enough, Jeff R. Bridgman American Antiques can help. Its many American flags include a giant hand-sewn version from the Reconstruction era with 37 six-pointed stars arranged in clusters and a 19th-century silk flag not much larger than a postage stamp, to be worn with a medal or on the lapel.

Its drawers bristle with serrated wood strips painted in gaudy colors, making it look a bit like a Technicolor hedgehog.The Tambaran Gallery, devoted primarily to tribal art, has an intricately carved red-and-black Tlingit rattle from the Pacific Northwest. On the back of a fierce-looking raven, a shaman figure exchanges a torrent of vision-inducing fluid, mouth to mouth, with a tiny toad. It is an interesting situation.AdvertisementTwo more highlights: an ornate 19th-century bird cage in the shape of a galleon at Marion Harris, and a copper Nepalese guardian figure, circa 1950, that looks like an Easter Island statue crossed with a praying mantis.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The fair does this in a marketplace setting.”The timeline at the Bohemian National Hall is closer to 4,000 years. Anavian Gallery has a gemlike Roman amphora from the first to fourth century A.D., perhaps four inches tall, encircled with raised bands in a shiny blue glaze. It seems positively modern next to a pair of tiny terra-cotta boots, smooth and tan, from Iran that date to somewhere between 2000 and 1500 B.C. The original figuring has been lost, but the boots somehow survived, twinned through near-eternity.The French glassmaker and ceramist Émile Gallé, an Art Nouveau pioneer, is known for his floral forms but he also made faience cats. Their green glass eyes shining, they look absurdly happy, blissfully unaware that they have been decorated in showy wallpaper and drapery patterns. Leo Kaplan has several, along with small Staffordshire farm animals from the late-18th and early-19th centuries (do not miss the sheep that looks as though it is wearing a bad Christmas sweater) and a crazy vase adorned with tiny cows and tufts of moss.“I think the potter had too much to drink and that’s what came out,” Mr. Kaplan said.A number of contemporary artists disturb the polite atmosphere of British tea sets and Chinese export pottery. Paul Scott, an English artist at Ferrin Contemporary, has updated English transferware, with its romantic evocations of American scenes, in the rudest possible way. “Turnpike No. 3,” a rectangular tray showing a toll plaza on the New Jersey Turnpike, is one of a series devoted to such heartwarming sights as the Indian Point nuclear plant and a fracking derrick.Martin Cohen has given a lot of shelf space to José Arias, a Dominican artist in New York who reinterprets the protective shape-shifting African spirits known as bakas. “They were sort of like house insurance and health care all in one,” Mr. Cohen explained.Mr. Arias’s simplified forms, part animal but vaguely human too, have a beguiling cartoonish look, decorated in bright primary colors or with finely inscribed black lines or bold bands, like his oddly imposing squirrel with a white clerical collar and air of impenetrable dignity. Every home needs one.An article on Friday about two art fairs in Manhattan — Metro Curates and the New York Ceramics and Glass Fair — misstated the given name of a dealer who is showing work by the artist José Arias at the ceramics and glass fair. He is Martin Cohen, not Morton.Metro Curates runs through Sunday at the Metropolitan Pavilion, 125 West 18th Street, Chelsea; 212-463-0200; metroshownyc.com.
