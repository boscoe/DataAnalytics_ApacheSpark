New York welcomes back two bel canto divas this week, both known for the warmth and dexterity of their singing and for their likability and down-to-earth humor. On Sunday, Dec. 6, the German soprano Diana Damrau presents a song recital at Carnegie Hall with the pianist Craig Rutenberg that draws on Schubert, Strauss and Dvorak as well as a sprinkling of artful ridiculousness in the form of Poulenc’s “Fiançailles Pour Rire” and Manuel Rosenthal’s survey of weighty themes — elephants, grammar — seen through a child’s eyes. (Stern Auditorium, 2 p.m. carnegiehall.org.)On Friday, Dec. 11, the Metropolitan Opera revives its winning production of Rossini’s “La Donna del Lago” with the American mezzo Joyce DiDonato in the virtuosic title role as the free-spirited Scottish beauty fielding advances from multiple suitors. With the noted tenor Lawrence Brownlee as King James V and the versatile conductor Michele Mariotti in the pit, this revival promises fresh chemistry and dazzling vocal fireworks.
