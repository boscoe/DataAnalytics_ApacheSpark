Allen Quartet (Friday through Sunday) The tenor saxophonist J.D. Allen has done strong work in recent years with a pianoless trio, featuring the bassist Gregg August and the drummer Rudy Royston. For this weekend run, which concludes Smoke’s annual John Coltrane Festival, he augments that unit with the up-and-coming pianist Victor Gould. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Nate Chinen)Ben Allison Band (Thursday) The bassist and composer Ben Allison inched closer to a rock ethos on his recent album, “The Stars Look Very Different Today.” (The title is from a David Bowie lyric.) But the agile band on the album — with Steve Cardenas and Brandon Seabrook on guitars and Allison Miller on drums — still functions with a post-bop metabolism. From 9:30 p.m. to midnight, Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, smallsjazzclub.com. (Chinen)★ The Bad Plus (through Sunday) This was a banner year for the Bad Plus: in addition to a sturdy new album of originals, the band released its take on Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring,” and took a bravura spin through Ornette Coleman’s “Science Fiction.” All of which adds up to a wealth of possibilities for its annual stand at the Village Vanguard, straddling the turn of the new year. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Peter Bernstein Quartet (Friday through Sunday) The astute hard-bop guitarist Peter Bernstein can always be trusted in a quartet setting, and this one features extravagantly capable partners, whose overlapping histories go back some 20 years: the pianist Brad Mehldau, the bassist Christian McBride and the drummer Greg Hutchinson. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jalc.org. (Chinen)★ Richard Bona and Mandekan Cubano (through Sunday) Mr. Bona, an electric bassist and vocalist whose proficiency may be rivaled only by his charisma, hails from Cameroon, but uses this group to explore the alchemy of African rhythms in Cuba. His band mates are the trumpeter Dennis Hernandez, the trombonist Rey David, the pianist Osmany Paredes and the percussionists Luisito and Roberto Quintero (who are cousins). At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Chris Botti (through Sunday) Mr. Botti, whose adult-pop savvy and controlled but brooding trumpet sound have made him a global superstar, descends on the Blue Note each year around this time for an extended engagement. This is his 10th annual run, and as usual he brings a slick but substantial band, and the clout to welcome the occasional unbilled celebrity guest. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Irabagon Festival (Friday through Sunday) A smart young saxophonist who has successfully ducked in and out of the mainstream jazz tradition, Jon Irabagon works on Friday with an expeditious trio featuring two veterans of the avant-garde, the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Barry Altschul. On Saturday, Mr. Irabagon leads a different but equally expeditious trio, with Mary Halvorson on guitar and Nasheet Waits on drums. And Sunday’s offering will be an Irabagon quartet with the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Rudy Royston. Friday and Saturday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Jazz Resolutions for 2015 (Thursday) Timed to coincide with the annual conference of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, this evening will spotlight four ensembles working along the fault line of composition and improvisation. Starting at 6 p.m., with sets every hour, the lineup consists of the Ben Wendel Group, with Mr. Wendel on saxophone, Taylor Eigsti on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Eric Harland on drums; the flutist Jamie Baum and her group Short Stories, which includes Mr. Wendel; the Michael Blake Quartet, led by its namesake saxophonist; and the Joel Harrison 4, whose leader is a venturesome yet roots-minded guitarist and composer. At 6 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)Russ Lossing’s King Vulture (Thursday) Mr. Lossing, a pianist of inquisitive temperament, features his own new compositions in King Vulture, a quartet with Adam Kolker on tenor saxophone and bass clarinet, Matt Pavolka on bass and Dayeon Seok on drums. From 8:30 to 10:30 p.m., IBeam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Chinen)Shai Maestro Trio (Friday) Last fall the young Israeli pianist Shai Maestro released a thoughtful and melodic album, “The Road to Ithaca,” loosely inspired by the “Odyssey.” He’ll probably draw from it here, at 8:15 p.m., in a trio with Jorge Roeder on bass and Nate Wood on drums. ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com. (Chinen)Matt Mitchell Quartet (Tuesday) Matt Mitchell, a proficient and probing pianist, has had a hand in some of the better bands of recent vintage, like Tim Berne’s Snakeoil and the Dave Douglas Quintet. He surfaces next week with his own quartet, which will record an album days after the gig; it features the saxophonist and clarinetist Chris Speed, the bassist Chris Tordini and the drummer Dan Weiss. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Monterey Jazz Festival on Tour (Tuesday through Jan. 11) This brand extension of the Monterey Jazz Festival, which celebrated its 55th anniversary last year, makes its premiere next week with an impressive lineup. The trumpeter Terence Blanchard and the saxophonist Ravi Coltrane form the front line of a quintet whose rhythm section travels under separate cover as the acclaimed Gerald Clayton Trio. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net.

(Chinen)Bill O’Connell and the Latin Jazz All-Stars (Tuesday) Mr. O’Connell, a pianist and composer-arranger, began his professional career in Latin jazz almost 40 years ago, and he has never abandoned the calling. His partners in this aptly named band are the saxophonist Steve Slagle, the trombonist Conrad Herwig, the bassist Luques Curtis, the drummer Adam Cruz and the percussionist Román Díaz. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.

At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Marcus Roberts and the Modern Jazz Generation (Wednesday through Jan. 11) Mr. Roberts, an erudite jazz pianist drawn to a mission of edification, has long enjoyed an emeritus status at Jazz at Lincoln Center. His new big band, the Modern Jazz Generation, will hold court next week in the organization’s house nightclub; the child prodigy Joey Alexander, recently signed to a record deal, plays an opening solo piano set on Wednesday (only for the first seating). Wednesday at 7 and 9:30 p.m., Thursday through Jan. 11 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jalc.org. (Chinen)★ Kurt Rosenwinkel New Quartet (Tuesday through Jan. 11) The guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel favors floating lyricism, a luminous tone and an ultramodern harmonic language, all reasons for his stature as one of the young gurus on his instrument. His New Quartet is first and foremost a showcase for his bond with the pianist Aaron Parks, who appears here along with the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Allan Mednard. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Helen Sung Quintet (Tuesday and Wednesday) The articulate young pianist Helen Sung has lately been drawing sustenance from the standard jazz canon, though she has her own book of tunes. She has no shortage of thoughtful accomplices in this quintet, which features the trumpeter Mike Rodriguez, the saxophonist Seamus Blake, the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Obed Calvaire. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Advertisement
