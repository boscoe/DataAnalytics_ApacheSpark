Describing it as the most important sculpture gift it has received in decades, the Smithsonian American Art Museum said it has been given an important work by the American sculptor David Smith, an artist who conjured welded iron and steel shapes from tools, metal plates and other industrial objects.The sculpture, “Agricola IV,” from 1952, is from the artist’s first major series —  works that were constructed from discarded farm tools and machinery Mr. Smith found near his studio in Bolton Landing, N.Y., the museum said.Elizabeth Broun, director of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, said it represented the most important sculpture gift since the late 1960s.“‘Agricola IV’ is a transformative acquisition, one that anchors the story of sculpture in America and shows how Smith changed the arc of visual expression in three -dimensions in the 20th century,” she said in a statement.The sculpture was sold this year at Christie’s for about $6 million. It is being given to the museum by Sam Rose and Julie Walters, collectors whom the museum described as longtime supporters.
