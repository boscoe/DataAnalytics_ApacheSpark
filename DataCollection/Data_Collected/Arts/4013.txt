THE Luxor Mummy returns. Last seen onstage in the 1930s, the bogus but brilliant artifact, reputed to be a contemporary of King Tut, takes an encore at the Morbid Anatomy Museum in Brooklyn in the exhibition “Do the Spirits Return?: From Dark Arts to Sleight of Hand in Early 20th Century Stage Magic.” It opens on Saturday.The show will include about 150 posters, artworks, props, photographs and artifacts from the collection of Rory Feldman, a magician and historian who has amassed more than 50,000 items devoted to Howard Thurston, a contemporary of Harry Houdini and one of the most celebrated magicians of the early 20th century.The museum will be showing the cabinet Thurston used for his trick “Sword of Damocles,” in which an assistant, after apparently being run through with 11 swords, disappeared and then — presto! — reappeared after the swords were withdrawn.The Luxor Mummy originally belonged to Alexander Pantages, the owner of a vaudeville theater chain, who claimed that it was a seer and prophet named Ra Ra Ra. A theater poster in the exhibition proclaims his powers in florid terms: “Has the Wisdom of the Sages, the Knowledge of the Ages.”Audiences were encouraged to ask the mummy questions through a telephonelike device. Answers would emanate — in English — as if from the ancient past. Mr. Feldman, asked to explain the trick, maintained the silence of the tomb. “We would like to keep the spirit alive,” he said.“Do the Spirits Return?: From Dark Arts to Sleight of Hand in Early 20th Century Stage Magic” runs Saturday through Jan. 6 at the Morbid Anatomy Museum, 424A Third Avenue, at Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn; 347-799-1017, morbidanatomymuseum.org.A version of this article appears in print on April 10, 2015, on Page C29 of the New York edition with the headline: Swords, Sleight of Hand and a Speaking Mummy.
