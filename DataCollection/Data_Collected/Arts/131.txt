Boston University and the Huntington Theater Company announced on Wednesday that they are ending their 33-year partnership, attributing the separation to “different goals.”Boston University, which owns the three buildings that have served as the theater company’s main stage and offices, and has also been providing annual financial assistance to the Huntington, plans immediately to put the buildings, located in Boston’s Symphony neighborhood, up for sale.
