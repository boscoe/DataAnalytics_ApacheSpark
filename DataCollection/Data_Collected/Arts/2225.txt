WARSAW — Polish prosecutors on Tuesday forwarded a request for the extradition of the director Roman Polanski to the United States, over a 1977 conviction for having sex with a 13-year-old girl, to the district court in Krakow. The  prosecutors’ office in Krakow has confirmed that despite earlier legal disputes, the extradition of Mr. Polanski, 81, can be carried out if approved by the court, even though the charges against him have expired under the statute of limitations in his native Poland.Boguslawa Marcinkowska, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors, said on Tuesday that her office’s motion was based on “formal reasons” and did not take into account other circumstances that might affect Poland’s final ruling on the United States’s request.Before the verdict Mr. Polanski, the Oscar-winning director who was interviewed by Polish prosecutors for two hours last week, will be questioned by a judge one more time.Mr. Polanski, who in July plans to start shooting his new film about the Dreyfus affair in Warsaw, said at a news conference in Krakow last week that he was not worried about being extradited to the United States, which he had fled in 1978 before final sentencing.“I expect this will not happen,” Mr. Polanski said, “I trust Polish justice system.”
