The contours of National Sawdust, the concert space in the shell of a former sawdust factory that opened last week in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, continue to take shape: the hall announced Wednesday that it would begin a new concert series next month with an evening of music by Brooklyn composers that will be hosted by Julie Taymor, the theater director.The concert, which will be held Nov. 6 and be called “Made in Brooklyn,” will feature music by Brooklyn-born composers, including George Gershwin, Aaron Copland, John Corigliano and Elliot Goldenthal, Ms. Taymor’s frequent collaborator. It will be the first concert in a new series called “National Sawdust+” that will offer music programs as well as discussions featuring artists and thinkers, often pairing people from different disciplines and backgrounds.“National Sawdust is a place that was created to explore music and ideas,” Elena Park, who conceived of the new series and is overseeing it, said in a statement. The first conversation, between the composer Terry Riley and the director François Girard, was held on Sunday. The next, between Reggie Gray, known as Regg Roc, the pioneer of flex dancing, and Emel Mathlouthi, the Tunisian singer, will be held on Nov. 22.
