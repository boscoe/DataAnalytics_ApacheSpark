There is no shortage of prizes in the art world, but few specifically recognize sculpture.That will change, a bit, on Thursday with the announcement of the Nasher Prize, an honor that comes with a $100,000 award. The annual prize is intended to recognize “a significant body of work that has had an extraordinary impact on the understanding of the art form,” according to a news release.The prize, open to artists from around the world, is administered by the Nasher Sculpture Center, in Dallas; the winner will be chosen by a jury of curators, artists and other experts. The museum is planning public and educational programs related to the prize as well, to help increase the appreciation of sculpture.The Nasher, which opened in 2003, includes more than 300 notable works of Modern and contemporary sculpture collected by Raymond and Patsy Nasher.The inaugural prize jury includes Okwui Enwezor, director of the Haus der Kunst in Munich and visual arts director of this year’s Venice Biennale; Lynne Cooke, a curator at the National Gallery of Art; Yuko Hasegawa, chief curator at Tokyo’s Museum of Contemporary Art; Steven Nash, the founding director of the Nasher Sculpture Center; the art historian Alexander Potts; the artist Phyllida Barlow; and Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate art museums.The first winner of the Nasher Prize will be announced in the fall; the prize will be presented on April 2, 2016, in Dallas.A version of this article appears in print on 04/03/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A $100,000 Award To Honor Sculpture.
