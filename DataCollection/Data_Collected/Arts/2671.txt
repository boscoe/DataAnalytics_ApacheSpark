New plays about families under varying kinds of stress, by the writers Matthew Lopez (“The Whipping Man”), Noah Haidle (“Mr. Marmalade”), and John Pollono (“Small Engine Repair”), will be staged in the 2015-16 season of MCC Theater, the company’s artistic directors announced Tuesday.Mr. Lopez’s “Georgia McBride,” which earned strong reviews during its world premiere at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts last winter, follows the transformation of an Elvis impersonator into a drag queen to make ends meet for himself and his pregnant wife. The play, directed by Mike Donahue, will begin performances on Aug. 20 at MCC’s home next season, the Lucille Lortel Theater in the West Village.“Lost Girls,” Mr. Pollono’s drama about a divorced couple forced to confront the past when their teenage daughter goes missing, will begin performances Oct. 22. The director will be Jo Bonney, who staged Mr. Pollono’s “Small Engine Repair” for MCC in 2013.Mr. Haidle will reunite with the director Anne Kauffman to collaborate again on “Smokefall,” a surrealist look at emotional troubles extending across multiple generations of a family. The two worked together on the play at Goodman Theater in Chicago, where the play earned critical acclaim and an encore production there last fall. MCC’s performances of the play will begin Feb. 3, 2016. A fourth show for the season will be announced later.A version of this article appears in print on 02/12/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: MCC Theater Season: Families Under Stress.
