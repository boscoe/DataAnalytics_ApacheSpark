Founded in 1933 by the classics scholar John Andrew Rice and the engineer Theodore Dreier, it was a progressive institution based in Black Mountain, a small North Carolina town that aimed to place art making at the heart of a liberal arts education. That same year, the Nazis forced the closing of another grand experiment, Germany’s Bauhaus school, prompting many of its teachers and students to decamp for the United States. Several landed at Black Mountain, most prominently Josef Albers, who was chosen to lead the art program, and his wife, Anni, who taught textile design and weaving.Under Albers, whose course on materials and form was one of only two requirements (the other was a class on Plato), Black Mountain soon became known as a kind of Shangri-La for avant-garde art. Former Bauhaus instructors and students like the architect Walter Gropius and the stage designer Xanti Schawinsky taught there, alongside American artists like Jacob Lawrence and Robert Motherwell, and, at one time or another, the student body included Cy Twombly and Robert Rauschenberg, who later became titans of modern American art. Merce Cunningham’s dance company was founded at the college; Buckminster Fuller, also on the faculty, completed his first large-scale geodesic dome there in 1949; and Black Mountain was the site of what some regard as the first happening, mounted in 1952 by the composer John Cage.The school closed in 1957, some years after Albers left to direct the first design department at Yale. But since 1993, another experimental institution, the Black Mountain College Museum & Arts Center, has kept its flame alive. In a storefront in downtown Asheville, a short drive from the old campus, it organizes talks, exhibitions, performances and an annual fall conference in which scholars (and sometimes practicing artists) examine the college’s legacy.This spring the museum is also embarking on an expansion that will more than double its current size, to 2,900 square feet. The original gallery space, remodeled to incorporate a study center, reopened in January with a show covering 30 decades of “poemumbles” (daily poems and drawings) by a Black Mountain alumna, the painter Susan Weil. In June the museum plans to open a new gallery space across the street with a historical exhibition, “Something Else Entirely,” which will examine the making of the 1965 Fluxus mail-art book “Paper Snake,” by Ray Johnson, another former student, using films and some collages that have never been shown before.Advertisement“We try to have one foot in the past, honoring what happened at the college,” said Alice Sebrell, the museum’s program director, who runs the institution with a staff of two and a few interns. “But we also keep one foot very much in the present, looking to the future and what ideas artists are investigating today.”AdvertisementThe larger space “will enable us to do more,” she added, including educating visitors, providing easier access to the center’s archives and mounting more shows from the permanent collection. (The collection ranges from correspondence and dance performance programs, to historical gems like a desk designed by Albers for the students, to new artwork made by Black Mountain alumni, “because we don’t want to freeze anyone in time,” as Ms. Sebrell put it.) Both spaces were built and designed by an Asheville-based artist, Randy Shull, who drew inspiration from Black Mountain’s Modernist utilitarian aesthetic, maintaining the old scuffed, paint-stained floors; creating shelves and bookcases from double layers of plywood; and using repurposed Southern yellow pine as a unifying trim.The idea for the museum arose when its founder, Mary Holden Thompson, who had grown up nearby, moved to Paris and discovered that the name Black Mountain was far more revered there than in North Carolina. Conceived as a corrective, the institution was nomadic for its first decade, publishing an annual “dossier,” or catalog, on someone who had taught or studied there and mounting a show in the Asheville area.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But as time passes, the museum strives to maintain a sense of growth and experimentation — central to Modernism and the school’s ethos — without cultivating nostalgia.“We keep trying to find ways to channel that spirit,” said J. Richard Gruber, the chairman of the museum’s board, by asking, “What would Black Mountain and its artists be doing today?”One example of faithfulness to that spirit is the annual (Re)Happening, invoking Cage’s long-ago event and now in its sixth year. This year’s extravaganza, a seven-hour program to be held on April 4 at the site of the college’s final campus, at the nearby Lake Eden, will involve nearly 80 people and 29 events, most of them multidisciplinary and many taking place simultaneously.There will be performances by the New York cult thereminist Dorit Chrysler, as well as the Los Angeles-based keyboardist and composer Aron Kallay. Two Tennessee artists, McLean Fahnestock and Michael Dickins, will project NASA footage of space shuttle takeoffs onto trees for the project “Rocket Launch.” And the media artist Andrew Lloyd Goodman, who teaches at the Rhode Island School of Design, will present an interactive event involving his Light Hammer device, which produces images by using a hammer to trigger a camera shutter.“It’s sort of a sprawling event,” Ms. Sebrell said. “You can’t do it all.“We just imagine what a Saturday night at Black Mountain College must have been like, and transport that notion to the current year.”A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page F2 of the New York edition with the headline: New Life for Cradle of Avant-Garde.
