A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Carl Allen Quartet  (Saturday) Carl Allen is a drummer of steadfast purpose within the hard-bop lineage and a bandleader who likes to cut to the heart of the matter. His quartet is well stocked with peers: the guitarist Rodney Jones, the pianist Bruce Barth and the bassist Gerald Cannon. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Nate Chinen)★ Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society, With the Nadje Noordhuis Quintet  (Sunday) Ten years ago, an emerging young composer named Darcy James Argue presented the first known performance by the Secret Society, which he evocatively described as a “steampunk big band.” The ensemble has since been widely acclaimed, as has Mr. Argue — just this spring, he received both a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Doris Duke Performing Artist Award — which might imbue this 10th-anniversary concert with the air of a victory lap. (Playing an opening set is Nadje Noordhuis, a stalwart in Mr. Argue’s trumpet section, leading her own quintet.) At 8:30 p.m., Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 718-643-6510, thebellhouseny.com. (Chinen)Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival  (through May 17) This homegrown festival, now in its 16th season, celebrates the borough. Among the highlights in the coming week are the saxophonist T.K.

More information is at cbjcjazz.org. (Chinen)Stanley Clarke Band  (through Sunday) The bass virtuoso Stanley Clarke has a peppy recent album, “Up,” that makes a show of his breadth, ranging from chamber miniatures to fusion odysseys, with special guests. Here Mr. Clarke leads a four-piece band featuring the pianist Beka Gochiashvili, the keyboardist Cameron Graves and the drummer Michael Mitchell. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ The Claudia Quintet  (Friday) Led by the drummer John Hollenbeck — whose next big-band album, “Songs We Like a Lot,” reimagines Cyndi Lauper and Daft Punk — this chamber-jazz unit occupies its own unclassifiable space. With Chris Speed on reeds, Red Wierenga on accordion and piano, Drew Gress on bass and Matt Moran on vibraphone, it’s a model of shifting texture and smart rapport. This is the end of a three-night run that is being recorded for a future live release. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Freddy Cole Quartet, With Houston Person  (Tuesday through May 16) On “Singing the Blues,” the energetic album he released last year, the singer and pianist Freddy Cole turns toward a specific corner of his musical heritage — one that puts him in just the right mind-set to feature the tenor saxophonist Houston Person, a musician of comparable gallantry. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Stephan Crump’s Rosetta Trio  (Thursday) Mr. Crump, a bassist, leads Rosetta Trio, a kind of chamber string ensemble with two guitarists, Liberty Ellman (acoustic) and Jamie Fox (electric). The group’s most recent album, “Thwirl,” is a collection of intimate, engrossing originals likely to crop up again here. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, West Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Kris Davis Quartet  (Saturday) The pianist Kris Davis has an arresting new album, “Save Your Breath,” made with a rockish rhythm section and a front line of four bass clarinetists. She’ll have more conventional instrumentation — not that she’ll be working conventionally — on this one-nighter, with the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Michael Formanek and the drummer Tom Rainey. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, West Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Harlem Lights/U Street Nights  (Saturday) Jointly organized by the broad-minded jazz pianists Jason Moran and Marc Cary, this concert — part of the Harlem Jazz Shrines Festival — will consider the connections between African-American musical communities in Harlem and in Washington, past and present.

(Chinen)Billy Harper Quintet  (Friday through Sunday) The tenor saxophonist Billy Harper has a sound both spiritual and physical, in the mode of certain major predecessors, notably John Coltrane. Lately he has been featured to good effect in the Cookers, a hard-bop all-star group; here he leads a quintet with Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Francesca Tanksley on piano, Hans Glawischnig on bass and Aaron Scott on drums. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Instant Composers Pool Orchestra  (Friday) The name of this 10-piece Dutch ensemble, often abbreviated to ICP Orchestra, conveys both the immediacy and the integrity of its mission. Led by the brilliant, madcap drummer Han Bennink, the group has a recent album, “East of the Sun,” that provides the repertory for this residency, part of a two-week cross-country tour. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)★ Ethan Iverson and Ron Carter  (Thursday through May 16) Mr. Iverson, the pianist in the Bad Plus and a jazz scholar of scrupulous independence, has performed once before at the intimate room Mezzrow with Mr. Carter, the august bassist-composer. It went well enough to facilitate this return, which should involve similar collegial strolls through fare like “Lover Man.” From 9 p.m. to midnight, 163 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. (Chinen)★ Guillermo Klein y Los Guachos  (Tuesday through May 17) Last year, the pianist-composer-bandleader Guillermo Klein released an evocative album, “Live at the Village Vanguard,” made during a recent club engagement with the commanding Argentine singer-songwriter Liliana Herrero. Returning to the same room without a guest vocalist, Mr. Klein explores a mix of rhythmic permutation and folkloric candor with his flagship state-of-the-art band. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Brad Mehldau Trio  (through Sunday) The pianist Brad Mehldau has led this iteration of his pace-setting trio — with the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard — since 2005, and it has evolved into a graceful powerhouse, equally savvy about groove and harmony. There’s still no better place to hear the band than the Village Vanguard, a special room for Mr. Mehldau and his devoted base. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com; some shows sold out. (Chinen)John Patitucci  (Wednesday through May 16) A bassist whose purview has included funk-fusion as well as the most aerodynamic modern jazz, Mr. Patitucci has a new album, “Brooklyn,” that draws on many of his interests. He celebrates its release with a band featuring the astute guitarists Steve Cardenas and Adam Rogers, and the drummer Brian Blade, Mr. Patitucci’s rhythm mate in the Wayne Shorter Quartet. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)Odean Pope Saxophone Choir, With James Carter  (Thursday through May 17) Led by Mr. Pope, a tenor saxophonist and composer from Philadelphia, this band includes enough saxophonists to field a baseball team and marshals their sound in powerful gusts. As on a semi-recent album, “Odean’s List,” this run features yet another saxophonist as a guest soloist: Mr. Carter, a longtime admirer and fellow traveler of the band’s. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)‘Remembering Herbie Nichols’  (Friday) From the mid-1990s into this decade, the pianist Frank Kimbrough has led a small-scale but serious repertory band called the Herbie Nichols Project. Here Mr. Kimbrough revisits the music of Nichols, a pianist and composer of spiraling intrigue, in fine company as usual: the trumpeter Ron Horton, the tenor saxophonist Ted Nash, the bassist Ben Allison and the drummer Matt Wilson. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Mike Rodriguez Quintet  (Thursday) The trumpeter Mike Rodriguez brings a sleek postbop modernity to his engagement with Latin jazz. His band here is equipped to do the same, with input from the saxophonist John Ellis, the pianist Gerald Clayton, the bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and the drummer Rodney Green. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Michele Rosewoman’s New Yor-Uba  (Friday) Ms. Rosewoman is a pianist and composer whose great guiding purpose, over the last few decades, has been a synthesis of modern jazz and ancient Afro-Cuban folklore. Her group New Yor-Uba, which appears here before a date at the Kennedy Center, includes the percussionists Román Díaz and Mauricio Herrera, the saxophonist Roman Filiu and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 9:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com. (Chinen)★ Wayne Shorter Festival  (Thursday through May 17) A few years ago, the eminent saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter made a rare and regal appearance at Jazz at Lincoln Center, with his quartet. He returns next week, but this time as a guest of honor with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis. Thursday’s concert will be the first of three consecutive performances, and the anchor of a Shorter-esque celebration running throughout Frederick P. Rose Hall next weekend, with highlights including a two-night stand by Sound Prints, the post-bop band led by the saxophonist Joe Lovano and the trumpeter Dave Douglas. At Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)★ David Torn  (Friday) Mr. Torn is a guitarist and producer with a wizardly gift for abstract landscapes, and on his new ECM release, “Only Sky,” he creates one that’s both immersive and deftly disorienting. This solo concert not only celebrates the album’s release but also kicks off a 22-city tour. At 7 p.m., SubCulture, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, 212-533-5470, subculturenewyork.com. (Chinen)24th-Anniversary Celebration of Downtown Music Gallery  (Monday) Downtown Music Gallery, a well-organized record shop in Chinatown, celebrates two dozen years of business with this pair of benefit concerts. At 8 p.m., an assortment of improvisers, including the bassist Mark Helias, the pianist Sylvie Courvoisier and the trombonist Steve Swell, play a free-form set; at 10 p.m., the pianist Matthew Shipp squares off with a regular partner, the bassist Michael Bisio. At the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com. (Chinen)Steve Wilson and Wilsonian’s Grain  (through Sunday) The alto and soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing, as a sideman or a leader. Wilsonian’s Grain, his crisp quartet with Orrin Evans on piano, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Bill Stewart on drums, is celebrating the release of a live album recorded around this time last year. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)Advertisement
