How dynamic is British theater? If you judge the vitality of a national theater scene by the percentage of new work it produces, then Britain is enjoying a period of unprecedented invention on the stage. According to a recent study of the national repertoire by the British Theater Consortium, in 2013, for the first time ever, new writing overtook revivals — a huge category that would include everything from Shakespeare to the West End production of “Gypsy,” which returned there last month to the Savoy Theater.The rise of new writing has been curiously sharp. As recently as 1998, original plays represented 20 percent of the repertoire. By 2003, it jumped to 40 percent before topping out at 59 percent in 2013, the most recent year studied by the British Theater Consortium. (The study defines new writing as any original theater work that is new to Britain — including musicals and opera, new adaptations or translations, and works that may have premiered elsewhere before arriving in  Britain).Dan Rebellato, a professor of contemporary theater at Royal Holloway, University of London,  and one of the study’s authors, traces this rise in new plays  to the 1950s, when the reinvented Royal Court Theater in London began producing “pugnacious, complex, challenging new works” that shook the conservative status quo.
            A exhaustive new study of the British theater repertoire shows that over time revivals are shrinking as a percentage of performances, making way for more new voices on the stage.

The new generation of postwar theater companies — many of which receive government funding — might account for some of the increase in  new works over the past decades. But another factor is the rise of so-called devised theater — collaborative efforts by a team of directors and playwrights that, occasionally, revolve around an adaptation of a film or a book. Mr. Rebellato pointed to the Kneehigh theater company’s take on the 1946 film “A Matter of Life and Death,” which played at the National in 2007, as a pioneer of the form.While these statistics are reassuring to lovers of contemporary theater, one might wonder if there’s a point at which too many new plays becomes too much of a good thing? Mr. Robetello conceded the possibility, pointing to the Canadian theater scholar Holger Syme, who in a recent blog post lamented the works chosen for the Theatertreffen festival in Berlin. Seven of the 10 were  new works or adaptations of recent films or books.“Let me be clear: New plays are totally necessary.” Mr. Syme wrote. “A theater that only ever restages different versions of the same texts is doomed. Obviously. But I would argue that a theater that doesn’t wrestle with its own past openly, repeatedly, continually, also lacks a vital element.”A version of this article appears in print on May 21, 2015, in The International New York Times.
