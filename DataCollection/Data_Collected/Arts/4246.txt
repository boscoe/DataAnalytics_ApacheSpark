Netflix has bet its future on original programming but its latest announcement stretches the notion of original. On Tuesday, it officially confirmed that the long rumored reboot of the family sitcom “Full House” would debut on the streaming service in 2016.The original “Full House,” which ran on ABC from 1987 to 1995, tracked a family of three girls overseen by three men, leaning heavily on the youngest child, played by both Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, saying and doing the darnedest things. Netflix is billing the new show, “Fuller House,” as a sequel. It will star the original cast members Candace Cameron Bure (D.J. Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner) and Andrea Barber (Kimmy Gibbler). John Stamos (Uncle Jesse) will reprise his role as a guest star, and be a producer of the show.Discussions with other “Full House” stars, including the Olsens, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin, are “ongoing,” according to Netflix.Jeff Franklin, who created “Full House,” will oversee the sequel. “The continued support of ‘Full House’ fans of all ages for the last 28 years has been astounding,” Mr. Franklin and the other executive producers, Robert L. Boyett and Thomas L. Miller, said in a statement. “It is an honor and a thrill to catch up with these beloved characters and explore their lives today.”The new show inverts the formula of the original, with a group of three women taking care of two boys and a baby. Ms. Cameron Bure’s D.J. will begin the show as a pregnant and recently widowed mother of two young sons. Ms. Sweetin’s and Ms. Barber’s characters will move in to help D.J., a veterinarian, care for her children.Netflix has ordered 13 episodes of the series, which joins a raft of ’80s and ’90s TV revivals, including “The X-Files” and “Coach.”A version of this article appears in print on 04/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Full House’ Finds New Life on Netflix.
