LONDON — The artists Nicole Wermers, Janice Kerbel and Bonnie Camplin and the London-based art and architecture collective Assemble are the four nominees for this year’s Turner Prize, the museum group Tate announced on Tuesday.This year’s nominations — particularly that of Assemble — are out of the ordinary even for the iconoclastic Turner Prize, which usually goes to individual artists for visual artworks.Assemble, which was founded in 2010, was nominated for a project for which its members are working with residents of Liverpool, England, to revitalize a block of rowhouses that had fallen into disrepair. Ms. Kerbel was recognized for “DOUG,” a cantata that had one performance at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow last year. Ms. Wermers was nominated for “Infrastruktur” and Ms. Camplin for “Military Industrial Complex,” both of which are installations that showed at lesser-known London galleries.The annual award for the best in contemporary British art comes with a cash prize of 25,000 pounds, or around $39,000. The prize, established in 1984, has served as a crucible in Britain’s culture wars nearly since its start, and some nominees – like Tracey Emin, from 1999, whose work “My Bed” featured a bed strewn with the detritus of sex and binge drinking – have drawn lively criticism and even protests. Last year’s prize went to the Irish artist Duncan Campbell, for a video work that combines dance by the British choreographer Michael Clark with film clips that evoke a mid-20th-century educational reel on African art.An exhibition dedicated to the nominees will run at Tramway, a venue in Glasgow, from Oct. 1 to Jan. 17. (The prize exhibition takes place outside of London every other year, a measure instituted in 2011 to open the festival to various parts of Britain.)  The winner will be named at an awards ceremony on Dec. 7.A version of this article appears in print on 05/13/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Turner Prize Nominees Are Announced.
