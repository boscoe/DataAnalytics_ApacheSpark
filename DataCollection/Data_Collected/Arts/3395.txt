Reality shows built around fashion, whether “Project Runway” or “Say Yes to the Dress,” tend to rely on histrionics — competing designers argue, frantic brides melt down, and so on. The Smithsonian Channel’s “L.A. Frock Stars,” which returns for a second season on Thursday night, is a different animal, a mix of history and Hollywood glamour that is still a guilty pleasure but makes you feel a little smarter for having watched it.The show follows the goings-on at the Way We Wore, a vintage clothing store in Los Angeles where the prices are lofty and clientele includes costume designers and the occasional celebrity looking to make a fashion statement. The season premiere finds the owner, Doris Raymond, at a Whitaker clothing auction in New Hope, Pa., trying to replenish her racks. She and her staff note that period shows like “Mad Men” and “Boardwalk Empire” have made vintage clothing more trendy than ever. But bring a fat wallet; this isn’t thrift-shop material. “It’s not even half an hour into the auction, and I’ve already spent $36,000,” Ms. Raymond says at one point.A version of this article appears in print on March 15, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Television; This Old Thing?
