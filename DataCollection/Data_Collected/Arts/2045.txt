Michael Cunningham, Joshua Ferris, Nicole Krauss and Lili Taylor will be among the participants at a reading in New York on Jan. 26 in honor of the publication of “Guantánamo Diary,” described as the first and only diary written by a still-detained prisoner at Guantánamo Bay to be publicly released.The diary’s author, Mohamedou Ould Slahi, is a Mauritanian citizen who was arrested in November 2001 on suspicion of connections with Al Qaeda. A federal judge ordered his release in March 2010, but the United States government has fought that order. Mr. Slahi has not been charged with a crime.The diary, which was written in English, was begun three years into Mr. Slahi’s captivity in Guantánamo, and describes “what he calls his ‘endless world tour’ of detention and interrogation,” the book’s editor, Larry Siems, has written.  It is being published by Little,  Brown after a seven-year legal effort by Mr. Slahi’s lawyers and with some of the text redacted, according to a press release. After participants read from the diary, Mr. Siems, a former director of PEN American Center’s Freedom to Write program, and Nancy Hollander, a lawyer for Mr. Slahi, will speak. The event, which will be held at the Culture Project at Lynn Redgrave Theater, is presented by PEN and the American Civil Liberties Union.A version of this article appears in print on 01/09/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Public Reading of Detaineeu2019s Diary.
