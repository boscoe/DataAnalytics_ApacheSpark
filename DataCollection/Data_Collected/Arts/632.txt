LONDON — In the mid-18th century, George Frideric Handel wrote his epic oratorio “Messiah” in a Georgian town house here. Around 230 years later, Jimi Hendrix moved in next door.Now, a revamped museum dedicated to both musical pioneers is set to open Feb. 10 on Brook Street in the Mayfair district, in the adjacent apartments where they lived.The museum, Handel & Hendrix in London, will re-create Hendrix’s apartment as it appeared when he lived there with his girlfriend Kathy Etchingham in the late 1960s — at the height of his guitar career. (He moved out in 1969, and died at the Samarkand Hotel in west London in 1970.) It will chronicle the last years of the guitarist’s life, when he played concerts to massive crowds in London’s leading venues, and released his final studio album, Electric Ladyland.The museum is run by the Handel House Trust, which opened a small museum about Handel life’s and musical output at the site in 2001. Exhibition rooms downstairs from and next door to the Hendrix apartment will continue to focus on the composer.The trust had always planned to expand the museum to incorporate Hendrix, according to a spokeswoman. A recent grant from a national lottery fund, along with gifts from private donors, allowed organizers to go forward with the plan.Hendrix’s bedroom has been used by staff as office space until now, the museum said in a news release.In addition to re-created rooms, the museum will include a 40-seat studio that will serve as both an education space and a concert venue. Tickets for the new museum go on sale on Monday.A version of this article appears in print on 10/29/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Handel and Hendrix Museum Sets Opening Date.
