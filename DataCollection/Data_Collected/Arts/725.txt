Finally a major New York ballet company has a black swan. Misty Copeland’s promotion to principal dancer at American Ballet Theater this summer put ballet back on popular culture’s map and ushered in a conversation about diversity in ballet. So what now? Classical ballet is still overwhelmingly white, but over the past few years diversity has finally become a priority.On the stages of American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet black, Asian, Latino and multiracial dancers are beginning to change the face of ballet where it matters most: Lincoln Center, home base to both companies.More than equality is at stake when Ms. Copeland — the first African-American principal female dancer in the company’s 75-year history — dances. When a company is diverse, the audience becomes more diverse, too, and for those faced with aging, dwindling audiences, that is priceless. Money is another incentive to change: The Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Ford Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation have financed recent diversity initiatives.The two major New York companies have realized that change starts with the schools. If it takes 10 years to make a dancer — and you can’t waste a minute — diversifying ballet must begin with children. Both Ballet Theater’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School and the School of American Ballet, the training ground for City Ballet, have initiated programs to spot and recruit young minority dancers.AdvertisementIt’s still early days, but minority enrollment has increased at both schools. Growth at the School of American Ballet expanded substantially in 2011 with its “Beauty of Ballet” program at Queens Theater and Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College.That seemingly small step led to an increased turnout for the school’s free community auditions, which has dramatically shifted the minority presence in the children division. “It’s gone Technicolor fast,” said Silas Farley, a 21-year-old member of City Ballet whose mother is black and father is white. (He refers to himself as “a cultural gumbo.”)Peter Martins, the ballet master in chief of City Ballet as well as the artistic director and chairman of faculty at the School of American Ballet, says that substantial change may take time, but it will happen. “We are not a white company,” he said. “We don’t seek to be a black company. We don’t seek to be half and half. I just want to be American.”AdvertisementWhile it’s still too soon to tell if the children discovered through recent community auditions will make it into City Ballet, since 2008-9, the school has graduated 36 minority dancers who have gone on to join professional companies. Eleven of those joined City Ballet. India Bradley, a 17-year-old advanced student at the school said her ambition — obsession really — is to become one of them. “More than anything in life,” she said. “I have actual dreams.”Ms. Bradley, a Detroit native, found her way to the School of American Ballet through the Dance Theater of Harlem. One of her teachers, Andrea Long-Naidu — a former City Ballet dancer — encouraged her to audition for the school.“Maybe she wanted me to follow in her footsteps,” Ms. Bradley said.And now Ms. Bradley has a chance to get into City Ballet, which rarely accepts dancers who have not trained at its school. Still, she said that she has had friends tell her that the school “probably needs a black girl to make it look more diverse.”She disagrees. “The teachers don’t care about that,” she said. “They just want you to do your tendu. I’m glad S.A.B. is like that. Lately, with this whole Misty Copeland thing — she’s black. It just shouldn’t have anything to do with that. It should just be like, she’s so good at ballet, she should be a principal. Now she is a principal, but it shouldn’t have taken all of that.”Last spring, of the five apprentices Mr. Martins named for City Ballet only one was white. In the main company, Mr. Farley, Olivia Boisson, Preston Chamblee, Taylor Stanley and Lara Tong have become familiar dancers. Is the company ready for a black female principal, too?

I’ll take her in a minute.”Mr. Farley is firm about what it takes for a ballet dancer to succeed. “It’s about the particular person and about their particular gifts,” he said. “And the dancer’s race and their socio-economic background and their parents’ education — all of that is secondary or tertiary.”But there’s more to changing the racial makeup of ballet companies than the determination of individual dancers. And different generations see the issue differently. Theresa Ruth Howard, a teacher and former member of Dance Theater of Harlem who wrote a much-talked-about piece for the website My Body My Image focusing on the many black ballerinas that preceded Ms. Copeland, can’t help but view diversity initiatives with some skepticism.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Are we just getting pictures for our brochure? Are you going to hire the dancers that you’re training?”AdvertisementOne way to increase that possibility, as the School of American Ballet sees it, is to broaden its scope nationally. It has recently formed an alumni advisory committee to assist with recruitment and to raise issues about how it handles diversity — criticism is welcome. The school also works with Arthur Mitchell, the former City Ballet principal and a co-founder of Dance Theater of Harlem, who advises it on diversity initiatives. One major issue is training. Simply put: Students seen at auditions around the country weren’t where they needed to be. “We want the field to be level by the time students come and audition for us,” said Kay Mazzo, the school’s co-chairman of faculty, “and it’s not at this point.”This fall, the School of American Ballet instituted a national visiting fellows program, in which five ballet teachers who work with students from a variety of backgrounds will attend two sessions at the school to observe classes and discuss issues related to diversity and training.One fellow, Angela Harris, a ballet teacher and choreographer from Atlanta, said she wasn’t so sure that the problem has to do with training. For her, more emphasis needs to be placed on getting jobs for higher-level dancers. Ms. Harris, who has had many conversations with artistic directors across the country, said, “A lot of them say, ‘I don’t discriminate — if I see talented dancers, I’m going to hire them no matter what.’ ” But, she continued: “I challenge that notion. I am a ballet choreographer, and I always seem to find really talented dancers of all races.”At Ballet Theater, there is a group of promising minority dancers, including Calvin Royal III, Courtney Lavine, Gabe Stone Shayer, Zhiyao Zhang and Sung Woo Han. It’s the presence of Ms. Copeland that has led to an increase in minority auditions for the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School. Yet Rachel Moore, the former executive director of American Ballet Theater, who started the company’s Project Plié program, sounded a cautionary note, “If it turns out to be about only Misty, then we have failed miserably.”Ms. Moore started Project Plié in 2013 to diversify American ballet through teacher training and partnering with companies. In 2014, Ballet Theater-certified teachers chose 15 students from Boys and Girls Clubs of America master classes to attend their schools; none of those students have advanced to the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School or summer intensives so far, but their progress is being monitored. The education department of Ballet Theater said that there is diversity in its teacher-training program, but there are no demographics available. The company plans to track minority percentages in the future.“We’re still young in this,” Ms. Moore said. (With her departure in August, Ballet Theater’s artistic and acting executive director, Kevin McKenzie, oversees Project Plié with the director of education and training, Mary Jo Ziesel.)This fall, a special children’s division class was added to the curriculum for 22 students recommended by dance teachers in public schools and at organizations like Harlem School of the Arts and Groove With Me. Travel assistance, uniforms and shoes are provided. “The hope is after a full year, coming to American Ballet Theater won’t be quite so scary,” Ms. Moore said. “They’ll feel much more part of the class when they integrate into the regular school.”The problem of diversity in ballet is complex, and linked, in part, to economic issues that include the cost of training as well as a lack of role models. But why have companies done so little to change the status quo? Ms. Moore said that there had been a reluctance in the field to discuss it. “Even with my peers, people don’t want to talk about the statistics in their companies and in their schools because they’re afraid people are going to come down on them and they don’t want to be called a racist,” she said. “It’s much more complicated than just that.”AdvertisementOutreach initiatives related to diversity are in place at companies outside of New York. Miami City Ballet, for example, offers Ballet Beyond Borders, a program that helps subsidize tuition, travel and housing for dancers from Central and South America; and Ballet Bus, a new scholarship program for students, 90 percent of whom are living at or below the poverty line. Other companies offer scholarship programs, like Pacific Northwest Ballet with DanceChance and San Francisco Ballet with Dance in Schools and Communities.No matter how they start, ballet, as all dancers know, is an arduous path. Rachel Hutsell, 18, a City Ballet apprentice, said that diversity had never been her biggest struggle. “I just decided, I don’t care if people think it’s an issue,” she said. “I’m not going to take it on as an issue. I’m not going to let it personally get to me, because I have a lot of other bigger giants to kill right now. I need to work on my splits.”Yet she would love for there to be a minority female teacher at the School of American Ballet — someone to lead by example. “A lot of young girls are told that because of your color or because of your body shape that this isn’t a possibility,” she said. “It’s like you don’t have access to the beauty that ballet is, and that’s not true. It’s a complete lie. You look at Michaela DePrince and Misty Copeland and so many other beautiful dancers, and they did it because they stopped believing that lie.”For Mr. Farley, there is an extraordinary possibility for ascent at City Ballet, whether a dancer is black, white or otherwise. “Anyone’s number could get called up to be the Swan Queen,” he said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re in the corps. Like this girl Miriam Miller who just did Titania. Just seeing that is so exciting for everybody, because it’s like: Look, it doesn’t matter if you’re 19, it doesn’t matter if you’re black — if you’ve got it, and the boss sees it, you fly.”A version of this article appears in print on November 1, 2015, on Page AR1 of the New York edition with the headline: Taking Steps Forward.
