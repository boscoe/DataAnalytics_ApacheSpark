After almost 200 years in New York City, American Bible Society is moving its national headquarters to Philadelphia.The ministry, which will mark its bicentennial next year, has sold its building on Broadway, at 61st Street, in Manhattan and hopes to open its new offices on Market Street in Philadelphia this summer, but its longtime tenant in New York, the Museum of Biblical Art (or Mobia), will stay in the city and is looking for new space.The society’s relocation is not expected to affect the museum’s coming exhibition of 23 masterpieces of early Florentine Renaissance sculpture that will be the centerpiece of its 10th anniversary celebration.The exhibition, “Sculpture in the Age of Donatello: Renaissance Masterpieces From Florence Cathedral,” which will feature the works of Donatello, Filippo Brunelleschi, Nanni di Banco and Luca della Robbia, among others, is scheduled to open on Feb. 20 and run through June 14.The museum plans to vacate its current space on Broadway after the show closes.“This year, 2015, Mobia is taking its final steps to independence, operating without American Bible Society’s financial support,” a Bible Society spokesman said. “It is American Bible Society’s understanding that Mobia will remain in New York, thought not in its current location.”In a news release, the society said that the move to Philadelphia was based on such factors as “strategic collaboration opportunities, affordability and livability.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/04/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Museum of Biblical Art Seeks a New Home.
