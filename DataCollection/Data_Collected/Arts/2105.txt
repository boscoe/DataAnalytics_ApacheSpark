Lorrie Moore’s “Bark,” the author’s first collection of short stories since 1998, is one of three finalists for this year’s Story Prize, which comes with an award of $20,000. The other two finalists are Francesca Marciano for “The Other Language” and Elizabeth McCracken for “Thunderstruck and Other Stories.”In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani said Ms. Moore’s book was “disappointing,” although it contained “some deeply affecting moments.” Ms. Kakutani called the stories in “The Other Language” “magical” and “fleet-footed,” saying they showed off Ms. Marciano’s “sympathetic, but wryly unsentimental knowledge” of her characters. In The New York Times Book Review, Sylvia Brownrigg called “Thunderstruck” an “unforgettable” collection that offers “a powerful testament to the scratchy humor and warm intelligence of McCracken’s writing.”The winner of the prize will be announced at a ceremony at the New School on March 4, where the finalists will read from and discuss their work. The two runners-up will each receive $5,000.Kyle Minor’s “Praying Drunk” received this year’s Story Prize Spotlight Award, an honor that comes with $1,000 for “an additional collection deserving of further attention.” The first Story Prize was awarded in 2004. Past winners include Edwidge Danticat, Anthony Doerr and George Saunders.A version of this article appears in print on 01/13/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Moore a Finalist for Story Prize.
