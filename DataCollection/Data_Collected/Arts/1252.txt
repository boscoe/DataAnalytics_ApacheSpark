Indiana’s cultural institutions just got $100 million richer, thanks to a series of grants that were announced on Tuesday morning by the Lilly Endowment.The Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, which received $10 million as part of the initiative, said it would use the money to stream some of its concerts, as well as to bolster its musicians’ pension plan and its endowment. Other groups receiving $10 million grants included the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Children’s Museum of Indianapolis and the Indianapolis Zoo. Ten other groups received grants of between $5 million and $7.5 million.Ace Yakey, the Lilly Endowment’s vice president for community development, said in a statement that the endowment hoped that the grants — which will be used for capital projects, to strengthen endowments and on programming — would put the organizations in stronger shape as they prepare for Indiana’s bicentennial in 2016, and Indianapolis’s in 2021.“The endowment hopes that these grants enable recipients to cross these milestones in a stronger position to sustain and build on their contributions to the cultural vitality of the city and state,” he said. The Lilly Endowment, which is based in Indianapolis, was created in 1937 by J.K. Lilly and his two sons, Eli and J.K. Jr., with gifts of stock in their pharmaceutical company.Like many orchestras, the Indianapolis Symphony has faced serious challenges in recent years. Vince Caponi, the chairman of its board of directors, said in a statement that with the grant, the orchestra would “expand its reach beyond the walls of our concert hall, will help fulfill an important commitment to our extraordinary musicians, and will help secure the future of the institution.”
