About that closing of “The Fantasticks”: Never mind.The producers of the long-running Off-Broadway staple, who announced last month that they would close the show in early May, said on Saturday that two unnamed fans had contributed enough money to keep it open indefinitely.“The Fantasticks” has had near-death experiences before – in 2002, it closed, after 17,162 performances over 42 years, only to reopen in 2006.The lead producer, Catherine Russell, said last month, “It has become increasingly challenging to sell lots of tickets consistently – we are either incredibly busy and selling out or selling fewer tickets that we have been in previous years.”But Ms. Russell has now reversed course.“Two individuals who are longtime fans of the show have come forward indicating that they will contribute financially to keep the show going, and she has accepted their offers,” the show’s spokesman, Daniel DeMello, said. He said that, for the moment, the donors were choosing to remain anonymous.The show, with music by Harvey Schmidt and a book and lyrics by Tom Jones, is a love story about two neighboring fathers who scheme to make their children fall for each other, and is based on “Les Romanesques,” a play by Edmond Rostand. It now runs at the Jerry Orbach Theater at The Theater Center. It is relatively inexpensive to produce, and ticket sales will presumably pick up during the summer, because much of the show’s audience is made up of tourists.A version of this article appears in print on 04/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Anonymous Donors Keep ‘The Fantasticks’ Afloat.
