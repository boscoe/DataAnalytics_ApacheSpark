ChowLincoln Center showed its appreciation to Reynold Levy, its president who stepped down last January, by raising his bonus to $600,000 in 2013, his last year with the organization, according to recent tax filings. The bonus was on top of his $1.29 million salary and pushed Mr. Levy’s total compensation package to $2.4 million, including retirement payments and other benefits, up from $2.2 million the previous year. “The bonus was based on annual reviews of his performance and his project performance,” said Eileen McMahon, a representative for Lincoln Center. She also noted that the bonus, first reported by The New York Post, was based on 18 months of work, not 12. Mr. Levy spent 11 years as president of the performing arts center, where he was renowned for his fund-raising abilities and applauded for completing an ambitious $1.2 billion renovation project. His recently released memoir, “They Told Me Not to Take That Job: Tumult, Betrayal, Heroics, and the Transformation of Lincoln Center,” depicts the interior struggles over the renovation and included criticism of other New York cultural executives.Advertisement
