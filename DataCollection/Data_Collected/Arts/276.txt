Salman Rushdie spoke out on censorship in Frankfurt on Tuesday, opening the Frankfurt Book Fair with a keynote speech apparently directed at the Iranian government’s decision to boycott the fair because of his presence there.“Limiting freedom of expression is not just censorship, it is also an assault on human nature,” Mr. Rushdie said in his speech, according to Agence France-Presse. “Expression of speech is fundamental to all human beings. We are language animals, we are story-telling animals.” He added, “Without that freedom of expression, all other freedoms fail.”Last week Iran’s ministry of culture signaled the country’s intention to boycott the fair – a major event for publishers across the world – if organizers went ahead with plans to open the fair with a speech by Mr. Rushdie. The ministry said that inviting the author insulted Islam. The ministry later confirmed its stance, saying that Iran would have no stand at the fair and would stage a “strong protest campaign” on the site.In 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the revolution in Iran, sentenced Mr. Rushdie to death, urging Muslims to kill him because the Ayatollah believed that sections of Mr. Rushdie’s book “The Satanic Verses” were offensive to Islam. In 1998 the Iranian government called off the death threat, though it could not be officially rescinded because Ayatollah Khomeini had died.The book fair opens to industry professionals on Wednesday. Some Iranian publishers are still expected to attend, The Associated Press reported.
