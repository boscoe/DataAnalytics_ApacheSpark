AUSTIN, Tex. — Every festival needs one all-out barrage, and I got mine on Thursday night from Ho99o9 (pronounced “horror”). It’s a hip-hop group from Newark that blasts every way it can think of, which is plenty: “I’m an overload,” one song truthfully announced.  Reports from the South by Southwest conference and festival in Austin.With two rappers backed by electronics and a drummer, the songs leaped through decades worth of gut-punching sounds — slow subwoofer-abusing hip-hop, death metal, thrash, wriggly synthesizer tones, punk, post-punk, some splotches of pink noise — as waveforms flashed and strobed on a video screen and the rappers jumped all around the stage; one did a flip. The lyrics were mostly lost in the cacophony, though there were a lot of imprecations and flashes of humor: “murder, murder, mo’ murder,” one song chanted, reminiscent of  “The Name Game” by Shirley Ellis. Whatever else was being shouted, at midpoint in SXSW, Ho99o9  was a welcome charge of adrenaline.SPOTIFY PLAYLIST
