LONDON — In the very moments that Britons cast their vote for the next Parliament, a Dame will flicker across the nation’s TV screens.On May 7, as voting takes place in the British general election, Dame Judi Dench will appear in “The Vote,” a new play set in a polling station in the final minutes of a general election. The television station More4 will broadcast the production live across Britain from the Donmar Warehouse here, which announced Ms. Dench’s participation on Friday.The performance-broadcast is timed to coincide precisely with the final 90 minutes of the real-life election, from 8:30 to 10 p.m.The playwright James Graham wrote the play specifically for the occasion. The Donmar’s artistic director, Josie Rourke —  who collaborated with Mr. Graham on the lauded production “Privacy,” an excavation of British and United States government surveillance techniques — directs. Mr. Graham also wrote the book for  “Finding Neverland,” which is to open on Broadway next month.The American playwright Richard Nelson undertook a similar experiment, writing a series of plays set in real time during major events (including the 2010 and 2012 elections).Twenty-four other actors were named in the announcement including Paul Chahidi (a Tony nominee for the recent “Twelfth Night” on Broadway), Mark Gatiss (of “Sherlock” fame) and the comedian Catherine Tate.In a statement Ms. Rourke said of the production: “Some of the nation’s greatest actors are coming together this election night to give theater a seat at the table of a national event. Everyone involved is approaching this experiment with a sense of adventure.”The production will play at the Donmar for two weeks in the lead-up to the election. Tickets go on sale March 30.
