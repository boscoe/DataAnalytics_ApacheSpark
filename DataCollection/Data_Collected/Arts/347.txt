Updated, 12:26 p.m. |  The Bruce Springsteen faithful will soon have much more material to pore over with the release of “The Ties That Bind: The River Collection,” a box set exploring the era around the Boss’s 1980 double album. The new four-CD, three-DVD collection (plus a coffee-table book) will be out Dec. 4 via Columbia.The extras include “The River: Single Album,” the original 10 tracks that Mr. Springsteen recorded in 1979 for the project; another CD of 22 rare and unheard studio outtakes from “The River” sessions, which continued into the next year; an hourlong documentary, directed by Thom Zimny, that features Mr. Springsteen reflecting on that period; and concert footage from a 1980 show.The live material, nearly three hours from a set Mr. Springsteen played on Nov. 5, 1980 at Arizona State University, was recorded on four cameras, with multitrack audio. There’s also footage from a “River” tour rehearsal that shows the E Street Band figuring out live arrangements for the album’s tracks. “The Ties That Bind,” a new documentary about the album, will have its world premiere as part of DOC NYC film festival on Nov. 14. “The River,” which Mr. Springsteen has said was when he “first started to tackle men and women and families and marriage” in song, was his fifth studio album and first to hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart.A version of this article appears in print on 10/17/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A u2018Riveru2019 Box Set Coming From Springsteen.
