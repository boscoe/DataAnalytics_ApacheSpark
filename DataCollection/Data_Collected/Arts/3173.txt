The winners of the 2015 Whiting Awards were announced on Thursday night at the New-York Historical Society. Each of the 10 chosen writers receives a cash award of $50,000. The awards are “based on early accomplishment and the promise of great work to come,” according to the Whiting Foundation.This year’s list of winners included the fiction writers Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi, Leopoldine Core and Dan Josefson. Ms. Van der Vliet Oloomi’s first book, “Fra Keeler” (2012), was a short novel about a man investigating the death of the title character after he moves into his former house. On Slate, Jenny Hendrix wrote: “Subtly menacing, but not without humor, the novel derives momentum and tension from the space between its clear, intelligent language and the absolute unreliability of its narrator.”Other Whiting winners included the poets Anthony Carelli, Jenny Johnson, Aracelis Girmay and Roger Reeves, and the nonfiction writer Elena Passarello, whose first collection of essays was “Let Me Clear My Throat” (2012).The playwrights Lucas Hnath and Anne Washburn also received the honor. One of Ms. Washburn’s plays, “Mr. Burns,” imagines a post-apocalyptic future in which the only culture passed down by the characters is remembrances of one episode of “The Simpsons.” In 2012, Ms. Washburn told The Times that the play is “not a ‘Simpsons’ story,” but “a story of people telling ‘Simpsons’ stories.”This year is the 30th anniversary of the awards. Past winners include Jonathan Franzen, Mona Simpson, Suzan-Lori Parks and David Foster Wallace.An earlier version of this post misstated the plot of Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi’s first book, “Fra Keeler.” It is about a man investigating the death of the title character, who is a man, not about a man investigating the death of a woman.A version of this article appears in print on 03/07/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Winners Announced for Whiting Awards.
