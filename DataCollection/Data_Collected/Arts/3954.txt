The artist Maya Lin, best known for her work on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, has been chosen to lead the redesign of the Smith College library, a historic structure built in 1909 that has been added to three times over the years.The assignment would be Ms. Lin’s first work on a college library, though she designed the Langston Hughes Library in Clinton, Tenn. The job also involves a personal connection for Ms. Lin as her mother, Ming-Hui Chang, attended Smith as an undergraduate after she fled China in 1949.She will partner on the library redesign, one of the biggest capital projects in Smith College’s history, with the firm Shepley Bulfinch. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2017 and take at least two years to complete.Smith College said in a statement that since the natural environment has been an important source of inspiration for Ms. Lin’s career, this made her a good fit to work on the library, called the Neilson Library. It sits centrally on a campus designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the chief architect of Central Park in New York. Olmsted  intended that the site serve as both college campus and botanic garden.Ms. Lin characterized the library’s three additions as unwieldy and said they had led to a “telescoping” so that the library has become a “wall” right in the center of the campus, located in Northampton, Mass.“It’s become a bit of a gorilla,” she said in an interview.As part of the redesign, which is estimated to cost around $100 million, the 1909 building will remain, she said, but she will be examining possible alterations to the additions.“This is a real opportunity to take away,” she said. “It gives you the opportunity to go there and excavate and understand the original Neilson of 1909 and how do we begin taking away as well as adding.”She added, “It’s about giving back space.”A version of this article appears in print on 04/09/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Maya Lin to Lead Smith Library Redesign.
