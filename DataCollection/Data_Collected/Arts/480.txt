Devan, the company’s general director, said in a recent interview previewing the change. “This is kind of like a 12-day opening night party that never ends.”The first festival, called O17, will feature Barrie Kosky’s innovative production of “The Magic Flute”; the premiere of “Elizabeth Cree,” by Kevin Puts; the premiere of “We Shall Not Be Moved,” by Daniel Bernard Roumain, directed by Bill T. Jones; Monteverdi’s “Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda,” paired with  Lembit Beecher’s “I Have No Stories to Tell You,” at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; a Sondra Radvanovsky recital; and a yet-to-be announced work.The company has already raised the $10 million it needs to cover the incremental costs associated with switching to a festival format for four years, Mr. Devan said. The first will be held from Sept. 14 through 25 in 2017.Mr. Devan said that research showed that a fifth of the audience for the company’s contemporary works came from outside a 70-mile radius of Philadelphia, and that he believes that the festival can entice them to visit Philadelphia for opera-packed weekends.It also found that while more than three-quarters of Opera Philadelphia’s subscribers are over 55, more than a quarter of its single-ticket buyers are between 25 and 34.And the company discovered that their tastes were not necessarily different: Older audience members enjoyed “Andy: A Popera,” an opera about Andy Warhol, and younger audiences enjoyed Verdi’s “La Traviata.”“They don’t discriminate by age on what they want to see,” Mr. Devan said. “What all customers want is a new experience relative to them.”Advertisement
