For more than a decade, Ciara has been a stalwart of the R&B margins. At the beginning of her career, she was more a rhythm instrument than a singer — a high-energy, sleek dancer with chilly songs to match. That approach has sustained, but not nourished, her. She’s long been an unremarkable vocalist, meaning she’s been more memorable for delivery than content, for pulse over feeling. Her best songs — including “1, 2, Step,” and “Ride” — were often about literal movement, but almost never about what was happening on the inside.It didn’t help that Ciara lacked a narrative; she had no discernible emotional tremors. But she has all that and more now, thanks to a highly public romance with the rapper Future that resulted in a son and a spectacular flameout amid rumors of his infidelity.“I Bet” — the first single from her new album, “Jackie” (Epic) — is Ciara’s emotional coming-out party, announcing the arrival of the heart pumping intensely inside that hardworking body. It’s gentle guitar-driven acoustic soul, relying both on her hurt delivery — “You acting like you upgraded me, I upgraded you/You and me Fashion Week at Paris, I put you on to that new,” she sings — and in the background, the staccato ad-libs by Theron Thomas of Rock City, one of the song’s writers, delivered to sound quite a bit like Future.As a revenge tactic, it’s almost on par with Taylor Swift’s “Dear John,” her merciless unraveling of her ex John Mayer.AdvertisementAt Best Buy Theater on Tuesday, “I Bet” came near the end of Ciara’s show, after more than an hour devoted largely to pneumatically intense dancing and the songs that inspire it. For much of the night, Ciara was torn between her comfortable old self and her uncertain new one.
            This is the first single from her new album, “Jackie.”        She and her backup dancers were outfitted in billowy black silk, creating a cascade effect every time they moved, which was often. Ciara is a hard, almost severe dancer, emphasizing ticktock movement and joints at right angles. Her routines are like boot camp aerobics, from the blend of “Ride” with Ginuwine’s “Pony” to an extended version of the bubbling-hot “Body Party” that included a friction-heavy routine with an overwhelmed audience member.Advertisement“Jackie” is among Ciara’s strongest albums, and her most varied. It includes a handful of songs with a fleet, bright thump that recall the heyday of Atlanta bass, and “I Got You,” a lullaby for her young son. She sang that near the end of the show, but then undercut the mood with “Give Me Love,” a shallow dance record from the new album.Ciara still doesn’t quite have the voice to register the depths of pain she’s singing about — and her microphone was unusually high in the mix, underscoring that fact — but still, bravely, she returned to unadorned singing on several occasions. She did a quick take on “I Will Survive,” in which she added a line about fending off someone who wants to win her back — “How many times I told you it don’t work like that?” — and “I Bet” turned into a full-room singalong, her stern face giving way to softness from the embrace.Right after “I Bet,” she sang “Goodies,” her first hit, and one of her most physical songs. It’s also a song about remaining demure: “If you’re looking for the goodies/Keep on looking/’cause they stay in the jar.” But in this new context, it read also as a statement of strength and resilience — her body and heart working as one.A version of this article appears in print on May 7, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: An Evolving Singer Reaches Deeper .
