Visitors to the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, which opened in a temporary location four months ago, have more to look forward to than the construction of the museum’s permanent home, which is set to break ground later this year.A gift of $5 million to the museum from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, announced on Monday, is intended to support “in perpetuity” exhibitions by emerging and under-represented artists, according to a news release. In the next year, the gift will support exhibitions by Shannon Ebner and John Miller.The $5 million for the Institute of Contemporary Art is just a part of the Knight Foundation’s effort to support culture in South Florida. The foundation also announced significant gifts on Monday to institutions including the Pérez Art Museum Miami ($5 million) and the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami ($7.5 million). The foundation will also continue to fund the Knight Arts Challenge ($7.5 million), which provides matching funds to projects designed to benefit the arts in South Florida.In a statement, Alberto Ibargüen, the foundation’s president, said, “Knight’s goal is to help build the community we all want to live in, a community where art is general and available to everyone, in all of our neighborhoods.”A version of this article appears in print on 03/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Knight Foundation Gifts Benefit South Florida.
