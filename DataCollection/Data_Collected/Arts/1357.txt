For its new multimedia staging of Britten’s unsettling chamber opera “Rape of Lucretia,” the company returns to 501 Union, a former car restoration shop in Gowanus, Brooklyn.The opera, about the self-sacrificing title character, who is married to the Roman general Collatinus and violated by the prince Tarquinius, is narrated by a Male and Female Chorus (each consisting of one singer). The libretto has problematic elements like a moralizing Christian epilogue, but the score is evocative, with a poignant aria for Lucretia interwoven with plaintive English horn solo.Laine Rettmer directs the staging, featuring costumes by Ohne Titel and billed as a timeless setting influenced by the intended Roman aesthetic.(At 8 p.m. on various dates from Wednesday, Dec. 2, through Dec. 12; loftopera.com.)Advertisement
