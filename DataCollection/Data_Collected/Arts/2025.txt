A controversial visitor center proposed for the grounds of the Gilded Age Vanderbilt mansion, the Breakers, was approved by the Newport, R.I., Zoning Board of Review on Monday.The Preservation Society of Newport — a nonprofit organization that owns and operates the city’s mansions – seeks to construct a center that can better accommodate the mansion’s 400,000 annual visitors, with wheelchair-accessible bathrooms and prepared food.Unless the 4-to-1 vote is appealed, the society will be issued a building permit and the project is expected to be completed within two years.Residents, preservationists and Vanderbilt family members had opposed the project on the grounds that it would violate the integrity of the historic seaside site.“One of the precedents being set is food service being approved for the first time at a Newport museum,” said Robert Beaver, former chairman of the Bellevue Ochre Point Neighborhood Association, who has lived in Newport for nearly half a century. “So there are many other museums here that may now choose to add food service as a source of income.”
