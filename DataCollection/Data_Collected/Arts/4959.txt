Shamir, a singer-songwriter from North Las Vegas, has just released his first album, “Ratchet.” He’s a 20-year-old with a high, light voice and a wide frame of reference, channeling a lean kind of post-disco/post-house, and also an emotional, ballad-y kind of country music.  The record is charming, fizzy, funny, self-assured.  Intuition and intelligence and some kind of ambition are all over it. But what kind of ambition?  What kind of intelligence?  Who is he, musically, and what does he want to be? Jon Caramanica interviewed Shamir Bailey recently in his hometown, and came to this week’s Popcast with the answer you might have expected: these may be the wrong questions.  Disco?  House? Shamir’s into Taylor Swift and Daniel Johnston and post-punk: Vivian Girls, Yvette, Crystal Stilts. He’s  only been making dance music for about a year.  He calls himself  “genreless.”   Artists are good at reinventing themselves and generally keeping their options open, but Shamir seems virtuosic at it: the casual, lightly worn aspect of his whole enterprise feels like a strength, not a liability.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
