The Super Bowl halftime show is all about star power, with multiple top-tier pop acts joining forces in recent years for maximum wattage. Among the performers scheduled for Super Bowl 50: the British rock band Coldplay, whose new album, “A Head Full of Dreams,” has the kind of all-star guests that the big stage commands.The group’s appearance was announced during halftime of a game between the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions on Thursday night. The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Super Bowl 50 will be played Feb. 7 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., and broadcast by CBS.Coldplay follows in the footsteps of Katy Perry, who performed with Missy Elliott and Lenny Kravitz in 2015, and Bruno Mars, who was joined by the Red Hot Chili Peppers the previous year. Perry’s performance was the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show ever, drawing 118.5 million viewers.Led by Chris Martin and known for piano-based hits like “Clocks” and “Yellow,” Coldplay will release “A Head Full of Dreams,” its seventh studio album, on Friday. The album features vocals by Beyoncé (who performed at the Super Bowl in 2013) and Gwyneth Paltrow, Martin’s ex-wife. Should they not be available for cameos, there is always President Obama, whose emotional rendition of the hymn “Amazing Grace” is sampled on the album.
