Similarly, “performative” is the current buzzword — high praise even for traditional art objects. So it was probably inevitable that the performance-art lens would be turned on the complex realm of outsider art.That this process would yield a groundbreaking exhibition wasn’t as clear. But it has, the strange and wonderful “When the Curtain Never Comes Down: Performance Art and the Alter Ego” at the American Folk Art Museum.This small museum was a beacon of curatorial excellence before straitened circumstances forced it to sell its building on West 53rd Street in Manhattan and downsize to its branch near Lincoln Center. From this tiny perch it sometimes still runs rings around New York’s larger museums, including — now — its performance-besotted former neighbor, the Museum of Modern Art.“When the Curtain Never Comes Down” is fresh, innovative and view-altering, introducing many artists virtually unknown in the United States and reaching from the late 19th century to the present. It has been organized by Valérie Rousseau, a French-Canadian art historian who became the Folk Art Museum’s curator of 20th-century and contemporary art in 2013. Her effort expands our understanding of how many outsider artists — like many insiders — are cross-disciplinary, working several mediums at once, including performance. Beyond that, the show should deepen our appreciation of eccentricity as not only basic to creativity but to personal liberty and democracy itself.Advertisement“When the Curtain Never Comes Down” is, not surprisingly, a deeply eccentric concoction of objects, audiotapes, documentary photographs and films that reveal a cast of singular, sometimes unfathomable characters, often shaped by illness, trauma or tragedy. Their creations relate to one another in odd and unexpected ways, but it may be best to approach this show knowing that each endeavor revealed here, each life touched on, is something of a world unto itself — if not a complete cosmology. Go with the flow. Look at the objects and photographs, read the wall texts. Also, watch the short films and partake in the listening stations, which include some extraordinary moments. It all adds up and then quietly overwhelms.AdvertisementThe show covers the activities of 26 creators and one visionary grass-roots religious community, the Saint Paul Spiritual Holy Temple. Described as an “African and Native American spiritual church,” it was founded in Memphis by Washington Harris, known as Doc, in 1960. For healing rituals and processions, its members use large painted sculptures made from dried cane or wood, among them the bright-red house and elaborate crosscut saw in this exhibition.Several artists here wrote music. The great Adolf Wölfli included complex scores in his extravagant drawings like the two here, which are accompanied by tapes of his music being played. Hans Krüsi (1920-95), a Zurich flower seller, recorded cowbells, church bells and insects and blended these sounds, which can be sampled at a listening station. And Léonide Chrol (1902-82), a Russian-born French priest who made lacy, two-sided collages from cutout colored paper, composed music for an out-of-tune piano during trancelike sessions (also available for listening).Other artists made fantastical clothing for an alter ego or second self, sometimes living permanently on that stage where “the curtain never comes down.” Such garments and costumes are often feats of transformation or assemblage, and they form the heart of this show. The most astounding examples are the magnificent dresses, shirts and trousers that Giuseppe Versino (1882-1963), an Italian asylum inmate, made from cleaning rags he tore or unraveled, then wove or braided together. They have a royal, medieval mien but also evoke Inuit garb or something by Comme des Garçons.

This Italian-born father of 13 settled in Montreal, where he eventually became convinced he was the pope. He devoted his final decades to producing all manner of papal regalia, working and leading prayers in a crowded storefront arrayed with his efforts. Several of his ornate papal hats are here, gleaming with recycled jewelry and trinkets, but don’t miss the 2008 segment of the Canadian radio program “The Late Show,” hosted by the actor Gordon Pinsent, which deftly pieces together that pretender’s life from the memories — spoken and sung — of his many relatives. It is itself a marvelous performance.As evidenced throughout this show, performance can also be defined as the extended process of creating relatively modest things and sharing them with others, making works that exist only briefly or are given away. This much is implied by the opening display: blowups of two photographs that are the only known evidence of the existence — and artistry — of a woman named Marie Lieb. Taken around 1894, they show torn strips of linen arranged on the floor of an unidentified German hospital in beautiful patterns suggestive of flowers and snowflakes. This is installation art before the fact, and with a strong performative aspect. Like much outsider art, they make us wonder where modern art began. The answer is, once more, often in the doings of various “others” — children, the woodcarving sculptors of Central Africa or people living on the margins of Western society, sometimes in psychiatric hospitals.Increasingly, around the turn of the 20th century, works created by inmates in these hospitals began to be documented or preserved. The show includes 23 images by Pier Nello Manoni recording the achievement of Fernando Oreste Nannetti (1927-94), who called himself “an Astronautic Mining Engineer in the mental system” and spent most of his life in a hospital in Volterra, Italy. From 1959 to 1973, Mr. Nannetti covered more than 200 feet of the courtyard walls with incised texts and drawings telling a series of elaborate tales, including the history of the universe. His life and cosmos are explained in a film directed by Mr. Manoni and his daughter Erika Manoni.Nearby, you’ll find the process-oriented art of Jean Loubressanes (born around 1860, death date unknown), who lived in a French asylum, where he made flutes and also carved small talismanlike stone sculptures — heads, figures, buildings, animals, shoes — that he bartered or gave away. The hospital still has many of these. The 144 examples here resemble antiquities from an unknown culture and constitute one of this show’s high points.The exhibition vividly documents the lives and work of three machine-obsessed talents: Heinrich Anton Mueller (1869-1930), Gustav Mesmer (1903-94) and Martial Richoz (born 1963). Further excursions in freestyle dressing include the bright skirt, mask and hats of the American knitting prodigy Deborah Berger (1956-2005); the extravagant get-ups, seen in color photographs, of the Japanese street performer Eijiro Miyama (born in 1934); and the LED-lighted, cast-aluminum chestplates, hats and dumb bells of the Canadian Bill Anhang (born 1931), an engineer turned mystic. Above all, don’t miss the creations of Vahan Poladian (1902/05-82), survivor of a well-off Armenian family from Istanbul fractured by the Armenian genocide. Landing in Paris, Mr. Poladian worked as a tailor, opened a shoe-repair shop and was wounded in World War II before retiring to a home for Armenians in the South of France. During the last 15 years of his life, he became a kind of crisscross dresser, sallying forth twice a day in conventional garments gorgeously elaborated into regal, sometimes liturgical ensembles topped off with towering headgear made of everyday objects, and further accessorized with purses, scepters, walking sticks and musical instruments that serve as cigarette holders.AdvertisementTwo ensembles are displayed here, along with a gem of a film directed by Jean-Noël Cristiani. This 13-minute study tenderly captures its subject as he dresses, models outfits and interacts with his housemates, laughing to himself. As Ms. Rousseau writes in the wall text, his luxurious-looking costumes “were a parody of supremacy even as they evoked the nostalgia and need for memory caused by exile.”“When the Curtain Never Comes Down: Performance Art and the Alter Ego” runs through July 5 at the American Folk Art Museum, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue near 66th Street; 212-595-9533, folkartmuseum.org.
