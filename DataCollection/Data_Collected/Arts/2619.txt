Here are some types of conductors officials may consider, though many of the maestros named are under contract elsewhere.THE WUNDERKIND Young conductors are all the rage these days, as stars like Gustavo Dudamel at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Andris Nelsons at the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Yannick Nézet-Séguin at the Philadelphia Orchestra, Ludovic Morlot at the Seattle Symphony and Pablo Heras-Casado at the Orchestra of St. Luke’s have all shown.THE ÉMINENCE GRISE With the Philharmonic planning to leave its Avery Fisher Hall home in 2019 for two years of renovations, will it opt for a more established star to try to keep subscribers in the fold? The orchestra has unsuccessfully wooed Riccardo Muti, who is now the music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, in the past. Lorin Maazel once toyed with the idea of trying to lure Daniel Barenboim. Then there is the much-sought-after Simon Rattle, whose exciting tenure at the Berlin Philharmonic is set to end in 2018.THE AMERICAN Will Leonard Bernstein’s old orchestra pass the baton to another homegrown talent? Plenty of orchestras have found success with that formula: the San Francisco Symphony with Michael Tilson Thomas, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra with Marin Alsop, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra with Leonard Slatkin, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra with Robert Spano. David Robertson, the music director of the St. Louis Symphony, was seriously considered for the New York post last time.THE INSIDER Orchestras often look to conductors who have made guest appearances with them when choosing a leader. So it may be notable that next season Esa-Pekka Salonen, the former music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, will begin a three-year stint as the orchestra’s composer in residence — with plans to conduct there a bit as well.Advertisement
