Where will the Tony Awards be held next year? Scouts for the annual awards show have begun visiting sites around New York, looking for alternatives to Radio City Music Hall, which is expected to be unavailable next year because of a summertime Rockettes show. Over the last few days, according to two theater industry insiders told about the process, officials representing the Tony Awards have visited the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, and the Kings Theater in Brooklyn, trying to decide whether either location might be preferable to the Beacon Theater, on the Upper West Side, where the Tonys were held in 2011 and 2012, and which was the default fallback if Radio City was unavailable. Tonys officials are hoping to make a decision over the next month, according to those individuals, who asked not to be identified while describing confidential conversations.All three alternative locations are significantly smaller than Radio City Music Hall — roughly 3,000 seats, compared to roughly 6,000. Tony officials are said to believe that the Kings Theater, although appealing, is too far from Broadway, making it impractical because during the show casts are often bused back and forth from theaters. It is not clear whether Tony officials would prefer the Koch or the Beacon — the Koch, home to the New York City Ballet, is arguably more glamorous and better suited for theater, but the Beacon has more orchestra seats.The Tony Awards declined to comment on the process or the options. “The location is still in negotiations, and we will announce as soon as the deal is finalized,” said a spokeswoman for the awards.A version of this article appears in print on 10/03/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Tonys Start Search for New Ceremony Site.
