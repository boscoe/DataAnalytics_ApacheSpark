A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.John Abercrombie Quartet  (Tuesday through March 28) The guitarist John Abercrombie takes a measured, self-possessed approach to improvisation, so much so that it’s easy to underestimate the considerable chance-taking in his playing. He appears here with the same sterling rhythm team as on “39 Steps,” his fine album from 2013: Marc Copland on piano, Drew Gress on bass and Joey Baron on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton; 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.

(Chinen)AdvertisementBarry Altschul and the 3dom Factor  (Friday) The drummer Barry Altschul has been a stealth eminence in jazz: known mainly within the avant-garde, and for music he made many years ago. But that’s changing, thanks to work like “The 3dom Factor,” which features the youngish saxophonist Jon Irabagon, who has been one agent of Mr. Altschul’s recent re-emergence, and the veteran bassist Joe Fonda, who has been another. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village; 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.

(Chinen)John Escreet Quartet  (Saturday) On his exploratory recent release, “Sound, Space and Structures,” the pianist John Escreet connects with an uncompromising elder, the great British free-jazz saxophonist Evan Parker. For this one-nighter, the framework will probably be a bit less abstract, as Mr. Escreet connects with the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Harish Raghavan and the drummer Antonio Sanchez. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor; 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org.

Mr. Morgan, an intuitive young bassist, made his appearances in the club with Mr. Motian, who died in 2011. This duo — a rarity at the Vanguard — might not refer to Mr. Motian, but it should uphold compatible values, among them a sense of unforced discovery.

At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan; 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Steve Lehman Octet  (Friday) The alto saxophonist Steve Lehman is a state-of-the-art musical thinker — a composer of high academic credentials and complex algorithm — but he has a true affinity for postwar jazz modernism, as a benchmark and a literature. His octet, featured on two superb recent albums, features longtime peers like the trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson, the tenor saxophonist Mark Shim, the vibraphonist Chris Dingman and the tubaist Jose Davila.

At Avenue C and Second Street, East Village; thestonenyc.com. (Chinen)NettWork Trio (Friday and Saturday) The bassist Charnett Moffett has led more than one version of this powerhouse postbop trio, which suggests that he’s the first among equals in its lineup, featuring two more virtuosos who came to prominence in the 1980s: the guitarist Stanley Jordan and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton; 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.

A Journey Home,” a film in progress about that pilgrimage, will screen during this fund-raising event, which also features a solo piano performance by Mr. O’Farrill. At 9 p.m., Drom, 85 Avenue A, at Sixth Street, East Village; dromnyc.com. (Chinen)Maceo Parker (through Sunday) Mr. Parker, the alto saxophonist best known for his longtime service with James Brown, has soldiered on in the name of funk, and his live show never fails to connect. His most recent album, “Soul Classics,” features him in the company of a spit-and-polish big band; he works here with a smaller but still potent crew. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village; 212-475-8592 bluenote.net. (Chinen)AdvertisementJacob Sacks Trio/Yoon Sun Choi-Jacob Sacks Duo  (Wednesday) Jacob Sacks is a pianist of exploratory temperament, drawn to open space and shrewd irresolution. In one-half of this concert, he features his own compositions for a trio with the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Dan Weiss.

(Chinen)★ Trio 3  (Tuesday through March 29) The alto saxophonist Oliver Lake, the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Andrew Cyrille are esteemed veterans of the avant-garde, and as the collective Trio 3, they share an agenda of rugged epiphany. They have released recent albums featuring an array of impressive pianists, but this weeklong run at the Village Vanguard has no billed guests, which isn’t at all a problem. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village; 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Joanna Wallfisch and Dan Tepfer  (Tuesday) Ms. Wallfisch is an introspective singer-songwriter, originally from London, with a natural attraction to chamberlike musical settings. On her new album, “The Origin of Adjustable Things,” she works strictly with Mr. Tepfer, a pianist with roughly equal footing in jazz and classical music. Their interplay, on original songs as well as on a few choice covers, is sensitive and deep. At 8 p.m., SubCulture, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village; 212-533-5470, subculturenewyork.com.

With “Identities Are Changeable,” first presented a few years ago and released as an album last fall, he explores the Nuyorican experience, with snippets of oral history woven into his state-of-the-art big-band arrangements. For this performance, at a hub of Nuyorican culture in the Bronx, he leads his excellent quartet, with a video component by the artist David Dempewolf. At 7:30 p.m., Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx; 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts.
