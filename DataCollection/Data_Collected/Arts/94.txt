In the elaborate, stylish video trailer for BigBang’s new tour, this K-pop megastar boy band appears in its own highly stylized Tarantino flick, full of screeching cars, curvaceous women dancing in dimly lit spaces and threats of imminent violence. It’s safe to say that won’t be replicated onstage when the tour comes to the Prudential Center in Newark on Oct. 10 and 11. Partly that’s because onstage, BigBang is more theatrical than moody, and partly because several of the group’s recent singles — songs like “We Like 2 Party” and “Loser” — are notably more mellow than its hyperkinetic early work.Those new songs mark the end of a three-year hiatus for BigBang and are part of the roll-up to its forthcoming album, “Made” (YG). This tour takes its name from that album and may also be the last time the full BigBang five perform as a unit before, one by one, they enlist for mandatory South Korean military service.
