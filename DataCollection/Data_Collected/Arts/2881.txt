Reuben Cox started off in the documentary mode, photographing people from social groups and subcultures: marriages at City Hall, rural transgender women, bands and fans at the club CBGB, or players at a contract-bridge world championship. In this show, he turns the camera elsewhere or discards it entirely and uses changes in photography as a metaphor for his own move cross-country, from New York to Los Angeles, and the onset of middle age.A handful of works use the chemicals from the cyanotype process to create abstract images that look more like paintings. “Domestica” (2014) is cyanotype painted over a hummingbird’s nest mounted on the wall. “Kaput” (2014), a black monochrome, consists of cyanotype painted on panels of American chestnut, a tree that was essentially wiped out during the last century, thus linking the death of chemical photography to the death of species in nature. But Mr. Cox slips back into quasi-documentary mode occasionally. “Christopher Wool Painting Found in Pasadena Basement” (2014) depicts a black-and-white word painting, actually made by Mr. Cox, in a crowded storeroom, while “iPhone Slouch. Sunset Boulevard” (2014) updates the street-corner “heroin slouch” for the digital age. The names of works here sound like song titles — so much you can almost hear a soundtrack of slacker bands like Pavement, Silver Jews or Bedhead playing in the background as you view the works and remember, if you were there, the Lower East Side in the ’90s, when it was a haven for that culture, not a gallery district.Blackston 29C Ludlow Street, at Hester Street, Lower East SideThrough March 1A version of this review appears in print on February 20, 2015, on Page C21 of the New York edition with the headline: Reuben Cox: ‘Topical Songs’.
