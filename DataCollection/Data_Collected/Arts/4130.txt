For the first time in a generation a dancer has made the cover of Time magazine: Misty Copeland, the American Ballet Theater soloist, was chosen as one of the magazine’s “100 most influential people,” and is featured on one of the five different covers for its upcoming issue.That puts her in rare company. Time officials said that the last time a dance figure made the magazine’s cover was in 1994, when the choreographer Bill T. Jones was featured. Previous dancers who got their own Time covers include Gelsey Kirkland (1978), Mikhail Baryshnikov (1975), Rudolf Nureyev (1965) and Margot Fonteyn (1949).The magazine created five covers for the issue. Ms. Copeland is on one cover; the others feature the musician Kanye West, the actor Bradley Cooper, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jorge Ramos, the anchorman.  Ms. Copeland, who has not yet reached the rank of principal dancer at Ballet Theater, is scheduled to dance the roles of Odette and Odile in “Swan Lake” and Juliet in “Romeo and Juliet” during the company’s spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House.  But her fame has extended beyond the ballet world, thanks in part to her recent memoir, “Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina,” which recounts how she overcame adversity to find success as one of the few African-American women stars in the predominantly white ballet world. Her profile was further raised by advertisements she made for Under Armour.“She really has become kind of a breakout star of the ballet theater, and people were very moved by her book,’’ Radhika Jones, Time’s deputy managing editor, said in a telephone interview. Asked why the magazine included her on its list of “pioneers” rather than its list of “artists,” Ms. Jones said Ms. Copeland could have been included in either category, but that the editors were moved by her influence as a role model.
