Bringing a touch of Marina Abramović to the music industry, the musician PJ Harvey is turning her next album into a public art installation. This month, Ms. Harvey, the Mercury-award winning British songwriter and vocalist, will record her ninth album behind a one-way mirror at Somerset House, a cultural center in London.Three times a week over four weeks, the public will be invited to watch Ms. Harvey and her bandmates write and arrange their tracks in a makeshift studio, set up in a former staff gymnasium in the building’s newest wing. Ms. Harvey said she wanted the album-making to feel like an interactive gallery exhibition.  “I hope visitors will be able to experience the flow and energy of the recording process,” she said in an interview with the Guardian.Among her production team are her regular collaborators John Parish and the producer Flood, with whom she made her 2011 album “Let England Shake,” which won her a second Mercury Prize, the coveted English music award. The installation, called Recording in Progress and presented in part by the arts organization Artangel,  begins Jan. 16. Tickets are sold out.
