For its winter season, the Kitchen — the performance and exhibition space in Chelsea — will present an ambitious, months-long show that traces the evolution of art-making for the past 50 years.The exhibition, “From Minimalism Into Algorithm,” which runs Jan. 7 through April 2, will aim for a new narrative of recent art history using Minimalist art as a lens for reconsidering the next generation’s works inspired by digital technology. At least a dozen artists in a variety of disciplines will be shown in the Kitchen’s theater and gallery spaces, among them Donald Judd and the composer Laurie Spiegel. The show will also change over the course of the Kitchen’s season, with openings of additional works scheduled for Feb. 4 and March 3.Also among the season’s highlights is a premiere by the experimental choreographer and Judson Dance Theater veteran Steve Paxton, collaborating with the composer Robert Ashley, who died in 2014. Their work, “Quicksand,” opens Jan. 28 and includes elements of music, dance and light in an adaptation of Mr. Ashley’s novel of the same name.The Kitchen will also look back on its own history. On Feb. 9, the composer George Lewis will line up an evening of performances to celebrate the archival CD “The Kitchen Improvises: 1976-1983.” Celebrating its past as well is Big Dance Theater, which under the leadership of the creative duo Annie-B Parson and Paul Lazar presents its 25th anniversary program, “Big Dance: Short Form,” beginning Jan. 6.More information about the season, which includes about a dozen programs, is at thekitchen.org.A version of this article appears in print on 12/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Kitchen to Explore Evolution of Art.
