LONDON — The Dowager Countess has been outranked. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, (a.k.a. Kate Middleton) paid a visit to the London set of “Downton Abbey” on Thursday, in an official outing to celebrate the show, which is in the midst of shooting its sixth season. A royal Twitter account referred to “Downton” as “one of the UK’s greatest cultural exports.”The visit was announced on Kensington Palace’s Twitter account this morning. The hashtag #DuchessAtDownton was used to chronicle the visit.
