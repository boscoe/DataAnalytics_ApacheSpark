Some people are born with silver spoons in their mouths. For Edith Wharton, a sterling rattle with a coral teething ring was more like it.  A five-inch-long rattle that once belonged to Wharton has been listed for sale at AbeBooks.com by Priscilla Juvelis, a rare books dealer in Kennebunkport, Me., and carries a price of $16,500, including commission. The ornate piece, which bears the mark of a British silversmith, has the name Edith engraved on the lip of the whistle and, on the other end, a long tongue of coral, which was once believed to have protective properties for infants. (In the 18th and 19th centuries teething rings were often known as corals.)Wharton, who was born into a wealthy, well-traveled family in 1862, gave the rattle to the daughter of the French scholar and journalist Leon Belugou, a close friend, as a christening present in 1920. The gift was mentioned in Hermione Lee’s 2007 biography of Wharton, where it was described, apparently incorrectly, as “a silver dog-whistle with a coral mouthpiece and ‘Edith’ engraved on it, which she had had since childhood.”Ms. Juvelis, in an email, called the rattle, which came to her through a scholar who received it from Belugou’s daughter, “a remarkably personal souvenir of a remarkable woman.”“It is a tangible reminder of another era – and the rarefied life into which Wharton was born,” Ms. Juvelis said. “That she was able to escape a world in which women were not expected to work, let alone be compensated and awarded prizes (first woman to win Pulitzer Prize for Literature), shows not only talent which she carefully honed but determination.”
