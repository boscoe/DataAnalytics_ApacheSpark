The “Blurred Lines” trial wrapped up in Los Angeles this week. Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay the family of Marvin Gaye about $7.4 million in damages and profits earned, for what a federal jury understood to be a copyright infringement.

On this week’s Popcast, we discuss the case, which revolved, of course, around the similarity of Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” featuring Mr. Williams and T.I., to Gaye’s 1977 song “Got To Give It Up.” (Players of the bass and the cowbell should feel special: those elements played a large role in the copyrightable identity of the two songs.) Similarities between songs are common and often pointed out by the copyright holder of the earlier song; settlements are often made out of court, or negotiated through a changed credit. It’s rare for a case like this to go to trial, rarer when the alleged copiers are enormous fans of the alleged copyee. But the ruling also brought up complex and hard-to-resolve issues about how popular music is understood, identified and protected — how it shouldn’t be copied, and perhaps how it needs to be.  Ben Sisario reported on the trial for The Times; Jon Caramanica wrote a critical take about the shortcomings of copyright law with regard to the way pop is currently made. Both joined the Popcast this week, for a conversation about bass phrasing, production technique and musical atmosphere, the amazing Robin Thicke deposition, moral rights, and Pharrell’s bluegrass defense.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
