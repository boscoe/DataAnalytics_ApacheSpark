This winter the dazzling young Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov has been almost in residence in New York. Mr. Trifonov, who won both the Arthur Rubinstein Competition in Tel Aviv and the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 2011, played an acclaimed solo recital at Carnegie Hall in December. He then appeared with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall, exciting audiences in Rachmaninoff’s First Piano Concerto.Lest anyone think Mr. Trifonov, at 23, is just the latest hot shot virtuoso, he is returning to Carnegie Hall this week with the formidable Latvian violinist Gidon Kremer, 67, one of the most respected musicians of our time. Their intriguing recital offers two sonatas — one for solo violin, the other for violin and piano — by the Polish-born Russian composer Mieczyslaw Weinberg (1919-1996). Mr. Trifonov will play a Mozart fantasy for piano; the duo performs a Mozart violin sonata. The most revealing performance may come with Schubert’s great Fantasy in C for Violin and Piano.
