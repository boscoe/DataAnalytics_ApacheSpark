That theory has been debunked, so let’s move on to another one: Is Bellows actually Sufjan Stevens? He says his name is Oliver Kalb, but he matches Mr. Stevens in wit, tone and charm. Find out for yourself on Friday at this newly opened D.I.Y. spot, where the musician is likely to conjure the layers of guitar fuzz, choristers and auxiliary percussion found on his immersive 2014 release, Blue Breath. With Sharpless, Yes Yes a Thousand Times Yes, and Fern Mayo. At 8 p.m., Aviv, 496 Morgan Avenue, near Beadel Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 510-316-4730, facebook.com/avivbrooklyn. (Andrew R. Chow)Hollie Cook, the Barr Brothers and Taylor McFerrin (Thursday) At first glance, this is a gathering of music royalty offspring. Ms. Cook is the daughter of the Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook, while Taylor McFerrin is the son of Bobby, patriarch of the talented McFerrin clan. But these musicians aren’t resting on their parents’ laurels; Mr. McFerrin has created his own brand of electronic soul, and Ms. Cook makes effusive pop-reggae. They’ll be joined by the Canadian folk-rockers the Barr Brothers. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, 800-745-3000, highlineballroom.com. (Chow)Steve Earle (Mondays through Jan. 26) This Texas singer has received a second career wind thanks to TV showrunners who aspire to his grittiness. He’s appeared either in person or through song on “The Wire,” “Longmire,” “Treme,” and most recently, “True Detective.” And like that newest series, Mr. Earle’s music is entrenched in the backwater past: bluesy slide guitars, lo-fi vocals, plenty of heart and fury. On Monday he kicks off his monthlong residency at City Winery, which includes a double bill with Shawn Colvin on Jan. 12. Mondays at 8 p.m., 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, 212-608-0555, citywinery.com. (Chow)Advertisement★ Lisa Fischer and Grand Baton (Thursday through Jan. 10) This Grammy-winning vocalist (she won for her early 1990s single “How Can I Ease the Pain”) has been a popular backup singer for years, touring with the Rolling Stones, Nine Inch Nails, Tina Turner and many others. Her star rose significantly when she was featured in the Oscar-winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom,” in which she explains why she shunned a solo career. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Nicole Herrington)Advertisement‘The Temptations and the Four Tops on Broadway’ (through Sunday) No, it’s not just your imagination: Two Motown stalwarts, the Four Tops and the Temptations, are wearing their dancing shoes once again on Broadway this week. Only one original member from each group remains — Abdul Fakir, known as Duke, of the Four Tops and Otis Williams of the Temptations — but still expect them to conjure the old-school magic of hits like “Reach Out, I’ll Be There,” “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg” and “My Girl.” The two groups will hit the road afterward for a cross-country tour. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Chow)Future Islands (Thursday and next Friday) Last March, a D.I.Y. band from Baltimore stepped onstage at “The Late Show With David Letterman” and promptly hurled itself into the stratosphere. The performance, propelled by the lead singer Samuel Herring’s twisting, shimmying and gasping, racked up millions of hits online, and by the end of the year, the song that Future Islands performed — “Seasons (Waiting on You)” — had been anointed song of the year by The Guardian, the Line of Best Fit, Pitchfork and other publications. Since the band treats every song like a singalong, expect them to be a perfect fit for the large room of Terminal 5. With Operators and Wing Dam. At 8 p.m., 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Chow)★ Gabriel Garzón-Montano (Saturday) “Rock me real slowly,” this SUNY Purchase grad implores on the first song of his 2014 debut, “Bishouné: Alma del Huila.” Mr. Garzón-Montano hardly seems to be in a rush — he spent five years helming the party-funk group Mokaad before breaking out on his own. In his music, he lets spacious R&B grooves soak and simmer, leaving the listener to revel in his inventive keyboard voicings. With Quincy Vidal and AllNat. At 9 p.m., Rough Trade NYC, 64 North Ninth Street, at Kent Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, roughtradenyc.com.

The players’ frantic, hard-core-meets-Brechtian cabaret vivacity is only partly captured on their records; the remaining X factor resides in their unending stage dives. With Ana Tijoux and Man Man. At 9 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Stacey Anderson)Nick Hakim (Tuesdays through Jan. 27) A lot of young artists are putting out minimalist R&B these days, but Mr. Hakim is not just another face in the crowd — his delicate guitar work and hazy harmonies make him a singular and vital presence in the genre. His 2014 EPs (“Where Will We Go,” Parts 1 and 2) have been exercises in restraint, drenched in liquor and physicality. Tuesday and Jan. 20 at 7:30 p.m., Jan. 13 and 27 at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com. (Chow)★ Darlene Love  (Friday) Her lovelorn “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” is a holiday rock showstopper, and her annual festive show has become a New York holiday staple. A former protégée of Phil Spector’s, she has been an indelible voice in pop since the 1960s — as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame affirmed when she was made one of the 2011 inductees. At 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000 bbkingblues.com. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret: Barb Jungr, Christine Ebersole and Cheyenne Jackson (through Jan. 31) The British singer Barb Jungr performed last year’s most sensational cabaret show, “Hard Rain,” at 59East59 Theaters, and her devastating evisceration of songs by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen was sung and acted with such passion that she reminded you that both songwriters, at their most rousing, are prophets as well as rock royalty. At 54 Below, from Friday through Sunday at 7 p.m., she will perform her new show, “Mad About the Boy and No Regrets,” described as a “walk on the dark side of love and loss, sex and corruption of the soul.” (Songs by Noël Coward, Kurt Weill and Bruce Springsteen — as you’ve never heard them before — have been added to a program.) The British comedian Julian Clary has called Ms. Jungr a “one-woman enema and not for the fainthearted.” 54 Below, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, 646-476-3551, 54below.com. This month’s other high points are the return of Christine Ebersole to 54 Below (Jan. 21 through 24 and 28 through 31 at 7 p.m.) in her tart semi-autobiographical show, “Big Noise From Winnetka”; the Broadway heartthrob Cheyenne Jackson’s debut (Jan. 13 through 16 and 20 through 23 at 8:45 p.m., Jan. 17 and 24 at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m.) at the Café Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com; the unstoppable Marilyn Maye (Friday through Sunday and Wednesday through Jan. 10 at 7 p.m.) at the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Flatiron district, 212-206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; and the jazz diva Jane Monheit’s two shows, “To the Men I Love” (Jan. 12 at 7 p.m.; Jan. 13 and 14 at 8:30 and 11 p.m.) and “Hello Bluebird” (Jan. 15 through 17 at 8:30 and 11 p.m.), at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Stephen Holden)Serpentine Path (Sunday) Bring earplugs for this bruising New York supergroup, which put out its sophomore album, “Emanations,” this year. The band members all have impressive pedigrees on the local circuit — with stints in Electric Wizard and Unearthly Trance, among other outfits — but the doom group still manages to be heavier than the sum of its parts, crushing one snarling guitar riff after another. With Fórn and Vilkacis. At 8 p.m., Saint Vitus, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, at Clay Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 877-987-6487, saintvitusbar.com. (Chow)Tipper (Saturday) David Tipper has been a mad beat-making scientist for the past 20 years, slicing and mutating samples out of glitch, trip-hop and ambient music. He’s less a D.J. than a sound designer, and his 2014 release, “Forward Escape,” spills and swells its way across 50-odd serene and mesmerizing minutes. With Orchard Lounge. At 9 p.m., Best Buy Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, 888-929-7849, bestbuytheater.com.
