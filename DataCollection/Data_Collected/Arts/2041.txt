It’s, like, so weird: despite a decades-long acting career that includes the films “Grease,” “Saturday Night Fever” and “Pulp Fiction,” John Travolta has played relatively few television roles. He’s been Vinnie Barbarino on four seasons of “Welcome Back, Kotter”; the title character in TV movies like “The Boy in the Plastic Bubble”; and a creative enunciator of names on the Academy Awards. Now, this two-time Oscar nominee is taking a surprising turn back to the small screen, where he will play a starring role in a coming FX mini-series about the 1995 murder trial of O.J. Simpson. FX said on Wednesday that Mr. Travolta will play the role of defense lawyer Robert Shapiro in the 10-episode project, called “American Crime Story: The People V. O.J. Simpson,” which is adapted from Jeffrey Toobin’s nonfiction book “The Run of His Life.” Other previously announced cast members include Cuba Gooding Jr. as O.J. Simpson, Sarah Paulson as prosecutor Marcia Clark and David Schwimmer as defense lawyer Robert Kardashian. No debut date has yet been announced for the mini-series, whose producers include Ryan Murphy, the “Glee” and “American Horror Story” co-creator and director of HBO’s “The Normal Heart.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/08/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Travolta to Star in FX Mini-Series.
