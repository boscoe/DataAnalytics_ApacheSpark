Phil Taylor, the drummer who was known as Philthy Animal and whose breakneck playing for the British rock band Motorhead helped give rise to the thrash metal genre, died on Wednesday. He was 61.His guitarist bandmate Eddie Clarke announced the death on Facebook but did not specify a cause or say where Mr. Taylor died.“He had been ill for sometime, but that does not make it any easier when the time finally comes,” Mr. Clarke wrote.Mr. Taylor was the band’s drummer from 1975 to 1984 and then for another five-year stint beginning in 1987. He played on many of the band’s multimillion-selling hits, including “Overkill” and “Ace of Spades.”AdvertisementHis double-bass drum style on tracks like “Overkill” helped give rise to thrash metal, a frenetic-paced genre popularized by Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax and other bands.Advertisement“Motorhead was the first time I heard double bass done at that pattern,” Dave Lombardo, the drummer for Slayer, said in the television documentary series “Metal Evolution,” as quoted by The Guardian. “I had heard of other double-bass drummers, but I don’t think they did anything like that, at that tempo and that beat.”In the same series, Lars Ulrich, Metallica’s drummer, also credited Mr. Taylor as a major influence.“When I first heard ‘Overkill’ in early 1979, that was what blew my head off,” he said.Mr. Taylor was born on Sept. 21, 1954, in Hasland, a suburb of Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in central England. He joined the band not long after it was formed in 1975, replacing the original drummer and playing alongside Mr. Clarke and another guitarist, Ian Kilmister, known as Lemmy.Slash, the guitarist of Guns N’ Roses, offered his sympathies on Twitter.
