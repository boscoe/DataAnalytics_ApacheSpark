Cervantes’s comic masterpiece, “Don Quixote,” inspired many artworks, most notably tapestries by Charles Coypel, Louis XV’s artist. Coypel created 28 tapestries woven at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris. Starting on Wednesday, the Frick Collection will present a complete series of the scenes. The exhibition, “Coypel’s Don Quixote Tapestries: Illustrating a Spanish Novel in Eighteenth-Century France,” will include five of the original paintings they were based on; these have never been seen before in New York and are on loan from the Palais Impérial de Compiègne and the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris. The museum will also show three Gobelins tapestry panels from the J. Paul Getty Museum and two Flemish tapestries inspired by Coypel from the Frick Collection, which have not been on view in more than 10 years. The Frick’s tapestries — rarely seen, because they take so much room to display — were cleaned in 1999 and restored at the Textile Conservation Lab at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
