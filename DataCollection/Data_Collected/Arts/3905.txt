Even chamber music often lacks intimacy in New York: Alice Tully and Zankel Halls, while smaller than some concert spaces, aren’t really ideal for trios or quartets. But two events this week deliver music for small groups at inspiringly close range. On Monday, the BAC Salon series, a program at the Baryshnikov Arts Center, presents five musicians (the oboist James Austin Smith, the violinist Tessa Lark, the violist Max Mandel, the cellist Edward Arron and the pianist Pedja Muzijevic) in an intriguing program: Mozart’s seminal Piano Quartet in G Minor, Berio’s “Sequenza VII” for oboe and the solo-piano version of Cage’s “The Seasons.” (7:30 p.m., 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan; 866-811-4111, bacnyc.org.)On Wednesday, at the Italian Academy at Columbia University, the adventurous Talea Ensemble plays three works by the Italian composer Pierluigi Billone, including an American premiere and a world premiere.
