Saturday is Free Comic Book Day and visitors to participating comic book stores will once again have the chance to pick up a wide selection of comic books at no cost.Among the highlights this year: Marvel is offering a peek at the latest roster of Avengers, which includes the teenage heroes Ms. Marvel, who is Muslim, and Ultimate Spider-Man, who is of black and Hispanic decent; DC promotes Commissioner Gordon to Batman and outs Superman’s secret identity; and Dark Horse Comics explores the world of Chuck Palahniuk’s “Fight Club,” in a story about the main character’s life before and after the 1996 novel, which became the 1999 film starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. While this event is of no cost to consumers, it is an expense for participating stores and many comic book creators are asking fans to show their support by buying merchandise during their visit for the free books. “If you do it on FCBD, the message that this is a good, worthwhile expenditure of time, money and resources will be heard and everyone benefits!,” the writer Gail Simone posted on Facebook. “Promote your local comics shop.” For a full list of available titles and to find participating stores, visit freecomicbookday.com.A version of this article appears in print on 05/02/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Want a Free Comic Book?
