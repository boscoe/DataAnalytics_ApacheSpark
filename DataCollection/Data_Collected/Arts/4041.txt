A Mark Rothko painting that was once owned by Rachel Lambert Mellon — better known as Bunny — will soon be up for auction at Sotheby’s.“Untitled (Yellow and Blue),” a color-field painting on a canvas eight feet tall, will be included in the contemporary art evening auction on May 12 and is estimated to sell for $40 million to $60 million, Sotheby’s said in a news release.The painting, with a blue hue that Mrs. Mellon was known to favor in designing her houses, was on display at the National Gallery in Washington for 10 years while she owned it. It was later sold to François Pinault, the owner of Christie’s, and was shown at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice in 2006. Most recently, an anonymous buyer acquired the painting from Mr. Pinault’s collection.Last year Sotheby’s sold two Rothko paintings from Mrs. Mellon’s estate: “Untitled” (1970), which fetched $39.9 million, and “Untitled (Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light Orange)” (1955), which sold for $36.5 million.The estimate for “Untitled (Yellow and Blue)” is even higher because of the year Rothko painted it: 1954, when he was 51 and landed his first one-man exhibition at a major American museum, the Art Institute of Chicago. Seven other works he painted that  year are in permanent collections at museums around the world, according to Sotheby’s.Last month Christie’s announced that another Rothko work, “No. 36 (Black Stripe),” painted in 1958, would lead its evening auction on May 13; that work is estimated to sell for $30 million to $50 million
