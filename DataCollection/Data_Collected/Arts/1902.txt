“Queen of the Night,” the sensually interactive dinner theater spectacle, will close two years after its first performance at the Paramount Hotel.The show’s final performance, at the Diamond Horseshoe club in the hotel’s basement, will include a decadent black-tie party on New Year’s Eve, with tickets going for $450. The closing date, which was first reported by the New York Post, was confirmed by Jennifer Baum, a publicist for LDV Hospitality, which manages the venue.“Queen of the Night” was originally scheduled for a six-week run beginning New Year’s Eve in 2013. Directed by Christine Jones (the set designer for “American Idiot”) and presented in part by Randy Weiner (“Sleep No More”), the production marked the opening of the reimagined Diamond Horseshoe, a vaudeville venue in Midtown that closed in 1951 and remained a vacant basement until 2013.The show’s run was extended multiple times, eventually netting more than $30 million in ticket sales, Ms. Baum said. Reasons for the closing and recent box office figures were not available. In the future, she added, the space will be used for private events.A version of this article appears in print on 12/30/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Queen of the Nightu2019 Is Set to Close.
