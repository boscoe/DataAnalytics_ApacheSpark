WARSAW — Polish officials on Wednesday received an official request from the United States government to extradite the filmmaker Roman Polanski, who fled the United States before final sentencing on a statutory rape charge in 1978.Polish prosecutors first plan to question Mr. Polanski, 81, then bring the case before a judge to determine whether Poland should comply with the request, Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor general, said. Mr. Polanski was questioned by Polish prosecutors in October at the request of the United States.If the judge rules that Poland should comply, the minister of justice still has the power to overrule the decision. But if the judge rules that Poland should reject the request, the case would not go before the ministry.The extradition treaty between the United States and Poland obligates each country to extradite any person whom the authorities of the requesting country seek for prosecution. The treaty doesn’t apply to Polish citizens unless a court rules otherwise. Mr. Polanski, who lives in France, still holds Polish citizenship and plans to shoot a film in Poland about the Dreyfus affair..A version of this article appears in print on 01/08/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: U.S. Asks Poland To Extradite Polanski.
