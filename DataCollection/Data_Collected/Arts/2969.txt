LONDON — Wayne McGregor, the resident choreographer at the Royal Ballet who also has his own troupe, Random Dance, will open a new arts space in 2016 in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The space, Studio Wayne McGregor, will form part of an ambitious new educational and cultural hub for East London, which includes organizations like the Victoria and Albert Museum, Sadler’s Wells theater and University College London.The space will be built inside the former media and broadcast center at the park, now called Here East, and is intended to house a mix of cultural, academic, educational and business enterprises. Studio Wayne McGregor, which received substantial financing from a private foundation, the Quercus Trust, will have three large dance studios and other work spaces. In addition to creating his own work there, Mr. McGregor plans to make some of the space available, free (“that’s right, free, for no money” he said recently of the project) to outside companies and individuals. In return, they would be required to spend time working with local schools and community groups.In a statement, Mr. McGregor said that the studio “will be a shared space for making, where artists can exchange knowledge and invent together.”“It will be a crucible of collaboration across disciplines and scale,” he added. “It will be a base from which we can work with local communities and young people to share experiences and nurture creativity.”
