The critically acclaimed epic play “Father Comes Home from the Wars (Parts 1, 2, & 3)” by Suzan-Lori Parks has won the Edward M. Kennedy Prize for a theatrical work inspired by American history, the stewards of the award announced Monday. A check for $100,000 will also go to Ms. Parks, a Pulitzer Prize winner for the drama “Topdog/Underdog.”“Father Comes Home” depicts sacrifices and soul-searing moments in the Civil War through the eyes of a slave, Hero, who goes off to fight with his plantation master and, with echoes of “The Odyssey,” eventually returns to his loved ones as a transformed man. Ms. Parks is now working on the remaining Parts 4 through 9 of “Father Comes Home,” which will follow descendants of her Civil War characters as the plot unfolds through the 20th century to present day.“The story of Hero, a slave who chooses to fight on behalf of the Confederacy, feels fresh and alive, shining new light on the complicated nature of freedom,” said the panel of jurors for this year’s prize in a statement released Monday. “In its unflinching treatment of homecoming, betrayal and heroism, ‘Father Comes Home from the Wars’ announces itself as an iconic work that challenges and engages Western theatrical tradition while providing a compelling contribution to the urgent American conversation about race.”“Father Comes Home” was produced at the Public Theater last fall and is now running through March 1 at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.The finalists for the 2015 Kennedy prize were “Appropriate” by Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, “The Great Society” by Robert Schenkkan, “The House that Will Not Stand” by Marcus Gardley and “An Octoroon” by Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins (which is  running through March 8 at Theater for a New Audience).The winner was announced by Columbia University and Jean Kennedy Smith, a sister of Mr. Kennedy who established the prize to honor him.
