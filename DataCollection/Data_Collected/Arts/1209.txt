As photography disperses in an ever more granular way into daily life — through phones, social media, ubiquitous screens — artists are hauling the medium back into the studio to see if it can be reconstituted into something more tangible. Sara VanDerBeek once described how she created an object, captured its image and “then, through the process of making a final print, framing it and hanging it on the wall,” rendered the image “an object again.”Ms. VanDerBeek is one of 10 artists in “Photo-Poetics: An Anthology,” an exhibition that tries to wrap its arms around the increasingly amorphous subject of photography’s future in art, at the Guggenheim Museum. Over 70 works are featured, by Leslie Hewitt, Elad Lassry, Ms. VanDerBeek and more. All are seeking, as the curators write, “an image imbued with poetic and evocative personal significance — a sort of displaced self-portraiture — that resonates with larger cultural and historical meanings.” (Through March 23, guggenheim.org.)A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Art; Images as Objects, Objects as Images.
