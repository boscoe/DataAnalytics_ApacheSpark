The Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis has named its next artistic director: Joseph Haj, who currently leads PlayMakers Repertory Company in North Carolina. Mr. Haj, one of the few Arab-American artistic directors in the country, will take over the Guthrie on July 1, succeeding Joe Dowling, who is stepping down after 20 years. The Guthrie board’s chairman, Lee Skold, said  Tuesday that the search team and board members – who spent a year looking for a leadership match – had been drawn to Mr. Haj’s “inspired vision, collaborative spirit, and standard of excellence.”As producing artistic director since 2006 at PlayMakers, the resident theater company at the University of North Carolina, Mr. Haj programmed about 10 shows a year and developed work with artists from New York (Mike Daisey, Lisa Kron, Taylor Mac) and around the country (Rude Mechs, Pig Iron). Mr. Haj began his career as an actor, training with some of the foremost directors of experimental theater like Anne Bogart, Peter Sellars, and Robert Woodruff. Founded by the director Tyrone Guthrie in 1963, the theater is a cultural force in Minneapolis and an important source of job opportunities and professional development for actors and artists throughout the Midwest.
