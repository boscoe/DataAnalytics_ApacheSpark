Gimple, the show runner of AMC’s “The Walking Dead,” is taking questions from Times readers.Pop culture’s zombie renaissance was well underway when “The Walking Dead” debuted in 2010. But few would have predicted that the show, based on the comic books of the same name, would achieve such outsize success. Early internal instability — “The Walking Dead” went through two show runners and a number of writers before Mr. Gimple took over in Season 4 — didn’t keep audiences from gobbling up the episodes like walkers at a human buffet, and the audience has continued to grow. The show has become the most-watched cable series of all time and top episodes have been known to outdraw even N.F.L. broadcasts among adults aged 18 to 49, TV’s most coveted demographic.Along the way the show has occasionally gotten bogged down in some subplots, killed off popular characters and diverged significantly from the comic books, but none of it has mattered from a viewership perspective. The Season 5 finale, in March, was the show’s highest-rated to date. “Fear the Walking Dead,” a spinoff series, concluded its own popular run last Sunday. (An online spinoff is also avilable now.)The sixth season of “The Walking Dead,” beginning on Oct. 11, finds Rick Grimes and the other core survivors settling uneasily into more (somewhat) domesticated lives in the “Alexandria Safe Zone.” But there are threats lurking outside the walls, and not just the usual flesh-eating kind.Before “The Walking Dead,” Mr. Gimple was a producer and writer on series like “Chase,” “Flashforward” and “Life.”Please leave questions for him in the comments. We will post his responses to some of them soon.Advertisement
