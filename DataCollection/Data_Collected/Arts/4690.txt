The French film director Agnès Varda will become the first woman to receive an honorary Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes film festival, which opens on Wednesday. According to a statement on the festival website, the award is given to a director who has had “a global impact,” but has not previously won the award. It has previously been given to Woody Allen (2002), Clint Eastwood (2009) and Bernardo Bertolucci (2011). Ms. Varda responded to that illustrious company on the website, commenting, “And yet my films have never sold as much as theirs!” The award will be presented during the closing ceremony on May 24, when the jury, headed by Joel and Ethan Coen, presents the prizes.Ms. Varda, 86, was a major figure in the French New Wave, alongside filmmakers like François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and Claude Chabrol. Among her notable earlier works are “Cléo From 5 to 7,” “Vagabond” and “Jacquot de Nantes.”She has continued to make films. Writing about one, “The Beaches of Agnès,” in 2009, A. O. Scott described her as “an artist of undiminished vigor, curiosity and intelligence” with “a kind of thrifty, skeptical anarchism of the spirit, a liberating willingness to find inspiration and even beauty in what might conventionally be dismissed as rough, ugly or commonplace.”A version of this article appears in print on 05/12/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Agnès Varda to Receive Palme d’Or at Cannes.
