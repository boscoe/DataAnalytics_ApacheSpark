Yes, we must.”In this scene she fields calls from Broadway-savvy parents eager to have their children attend the school.  The show, written by Greg Edwards and Andy Sandberg, continues through April 19 at the Westside Theater.Recent theater videos in this series include Tonya Pinkins and Dianne Wiest in a scene from “Rasheeda Speaking,” and Patrick Mulryan singing the number “Giants in the Sky” from the musical “Into the Woods.”Coming soon: Songs from Lena Hall and T.
