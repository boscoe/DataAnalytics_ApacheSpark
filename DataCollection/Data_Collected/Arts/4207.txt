Updated, 3:12 p.m. |  Before starting an ambitious capital campaign to finance the creation of a bold new building by Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has been engaged in a 50th-anniversary acquisitions campaign designed to boost a collection that has long been considered uneven.This weekend the museum announced that it had secured roughly $200 million worth of art as “anniversary gifts,” on top of the $500 million in art recently pledged by the former Univision chairman Jerry Perenchio. A show called “50 for 50: Gifts on the Occasion of LACMA’s Anniversary,” which will open April 26, reveals the scope of these new acquisitions. Highlights include a version of Hans Memling’s masterpiece “Christ Blessing,” donated by Lynda Resnick of POM fame; a verdant Monet garden landscape showing the artist’s wife, donated by the Hollywood veterans Wendy and Leonard Goldberg, and Vija Celmins’s dark 1964 painting, “T.V.,” which shows a television scene of aircraft combat or explosion, given by the film producer Steve Tisch. An imposing, sinuous wooden sculpture identified as a serpent headdress from Guinea came from the head of Activision, Bobby Kotick. Many of the gifted artworks are promised or future pledges. Mr. Perenchio’s also has a remarkably specific condition attached: his donation will occur only  if the museum completes the Zumthor building, designed to replace four older structures on campus at a cost upwards of $600 million. The museum has already received pledges of about $70 million towards a $100 million fund-raising campaign tied to the 50th anniversary, according to multiple trustees who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak about the matter. Museum representatives declined to confirm this figure.A version of this article appears in print on 04/20/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Los Angeles Museum Reveals New Acquisitions.
