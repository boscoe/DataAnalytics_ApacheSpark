“Mamma Mia!,” the hit musical based on the songs of the Swedish pop group Abba, will end its 14-year run on Sept. 5. The show, which opened at the Winter Garden on Oct. 18, 2001, and moved to the Broadhurst Theater in 2013, will close after 5,765 performances, making it the eighth-longest-running show in Broadway history, seen by more than 7 million people.Judy Craymer, the show’s creator and global producer, is to announce the closing after Thursday night’s performance. “I am thrilled that ‘Mamma Mia!’ has brought the music of Abba to Broadway,” Ms. Craymer said in a news release. “And so grateful to the hundreds of wonderful actors, musicians, stage managers, crew, front of house staff and the other people of the theater who have given their professional lives and souls to be part of the ‘Mamma Mia!’ family and adventure on Broadway.”The Broadway show has grossed more than $600 million. For years it steadily took in nearly $1 million a week at the box office, but sales had declined in the last two years. Ticket sales, helped by the holiday weekend, totaled $813,160 for the week ending April 5, out of a potential gross of just over $1.1 million.More typically, the show had been averaging about $500,000 each week.A version of this article appears in print on 04/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Mamma Mia!’ to Close After 14-Year Run.
