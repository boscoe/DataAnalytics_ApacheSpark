The French photographer Valérie Belin has won the sixth Prix Pictet for photography, for her series “Still life, 2014.” The award was announced by Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations and the honorary president of the prize, on Thursday at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris, at the opening reception for an exhibition of work by the 12 finalists.The Prix Pictet, which is annual and offers a prize of 100,000 Swiss francs (about $100,000), has a mandate on sustainability, and asks photographers to submit entries on a specific subject each year. This year’s topic was “Disorder,” and Ms. Belin’s winning entry shows a series of still lifes with jumbled accumulations of brightly hued plastic items, that she described as “a jarring commentary on the effects of our obsession with cheap objects.”Ms. Belin was chosen by an international jury of nine, from a shortlist that included Ilit Azoulay, Matthew Brandt, Maxim Dondyuk, Alixandra Fazzina, Ori Gersht, John Gossage, Pieter Hugo, Gideon Mendel, Sophie Ristelhueber, Brent Stirton and Yang Yongliang.Speaking of the theme of the exhibition — which will run through Dec. 13, before traveling to Geneva, Zurich, Barcelona and San Diego, among other destinations still to be announced — Mr. Annan said: “Our mastery over manifold aspects of life has deluded us into thinking that we have bent the planet to our will.  Yet the fragility of that assumption is exposed with each new pandemic, earthquake, tsunami or drought.  With each passing day our illusion of order is shattered.”
