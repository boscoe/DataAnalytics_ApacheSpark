Rhythmically adept, she is an accomplished scat improviser who exudes an engaging blend of confidence and cheer. Her singing, at its most inventive, recalls Jane Monheit’s flights of fancy but without Ms. Monheit’s vocal lushness. She is at ease with tricky samba rhythms that break up phrases into staccato exclamations, and her far-reaching taste in songs encompasses both standards and original collaborations that take her in a pop direction.The problem with Ms. Gazarek’s performance was the voice itself. Although she knows her way around a lyric, her sound is neither distinctive nor compelling enough to grab your ear or your heart. Her intonation is secure, but her nearly vibrato-less instrument has little color and becomes shrill when deployed at full volume. And some of her song choices seemed questionable, most notably a version of “Where Is Love?,” the trite ballad from the musical “Oliver!,” which she elongated into an extended torch song that simply couldn’t withstand the weight she put into it. Ms. Gazarek had solid support from a trio that included Josh Nelson on piano, Matt Aronoff on bass and Zach Harmon on drums. The high points of her set were Mr. Nelson’s winding solos.Sara Gazarek performs through Saturday at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton; 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. Advertisement
