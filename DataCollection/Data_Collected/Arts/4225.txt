HBO will produce six new episodes of the buzzy and popular web series “High Maintenance.”The show, which can currently be seen on Vimeo, centers on a marijuana dealer who travels in and out of people’s New York City apartments and lives. It was created by the husband-and-wife team of Ben Sinclair and Katja Blichfeld. Ms. Blichfeld was a former casting director for “30 Rock.”HBO said on Monday that in addition to new entries, it will carry the show’s previous five seasons (totalling 19 episodes) on HBO and its apps, HBO Go and HBO Now. Episodes vary in length, and six episodes from the show’s most recent season all run under 20 minutes each.Vimeo, a video-sharing platform, offered financial backing for the series after the first season of the show, which ran 3 episodes, said Kerry Trainor, Vimeo’s chief executive. It charged $1.99 per episode for the second season. Mr. Trainor said it’s unclear if “High Maintenance” will still appear on Vimeo after the series goes to HBO but he said he’s looking for other projects to support.  The move comes less than two weeks after the cable network launched its HBO Now streaming service, which is being directed at millennials, many of whom are, as HBO chief executive Richard Plepler described it in a recent interview, “cord cutters and cord nevers.” Earlier this month, HBO expanded its content relationship with Vice, and later this year will debut a daily newscast, the first time HBO has ever done such a thing.A version of this article appears in print on 04/21/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: HBO Will Deliver More ‘High Maintenance’.
