But Twitter messages and Facebook posts often fail to satisfy the Miser’s thirst to join the conversation.Fortunately, New York City always seems to be hosting intimate talks with intellectuals from across the globe. This weekend, leave the earbuds at home and join the thinkers, scholars and award-winning writers at these free events.The Albertine bookshop at the Payne Whitney mansion is once again hosting five days of debate and discussion through its Festival Albertine, now in its second year.The weekend’s highlights include a discussion (Friday, 7 p.m.) on graphic novels with a coming-of-age theme between Phoebe Gloeckner, whose “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” was recently adapted into a critically acclaimed movie, and Riad Sattouf, a former cartoonist for Charlie Hebdo and author of “The Arab of the Future,” which Carmela Ciuraru recently called “exquisitely illustrated” and “a disquieting yet essential read” in the Newly Released column of The New York Times. Françoise Mouly, art editor of The New Yorker and the publisher of Toon Books, moderates.On Saturday at 6:30 p.m., French and American women will discuss the legacy of “The Second Sex,” Simone de Beauvoir’s 1949 feminist classic. The lineup features Margo Jefferson, a former critic at The New York Times and author of the new memoir “Negroland”; the author Katie Roiphe (“The Morning After: Sex, Fear, and Feminism,” 1993); Réjane Sénac, a professor at Sciences Po, the institute of political studies in Paris; and Sandrine Treiner, director of France Culture, a French public radio station. Judith Thurman, a National Book Award winner and staff writer at The New Yorker, moderates.On Sunday at 5 p.m., David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker; Adam Gopnik, a staff writer at The New Yorker; and Nabil Wakim, director of editorial innovation at Le Monde, will gather to discuss journalism in the digital age and how their publications are adapting to new technology.Other don’t-miss events at the festival include a discussion with RoseLee Goldberg, founding director of the arts organization Performa, and the choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Jérôme Bel on the legacy and influence of dance (Sunday, 3 p.m.) and a forum on climate change that includes three Columbia University professors (Saturday, 3 p.m.).(972 Fifth Avenue, at 79th Street; 212-650-0070; albertine.com. Events will be streamed at livestream.com/frenchembassy.)Across town, the weekend-long PoetryFest will match American poets with Irish counterparts for discussions and book signings at the Irish Arts Center.Misers will most likely want to skip Friday’s opening gala (at $35, the only event that is not free) and dive in Saturday, with discussions and a chance to mingle with the Pulitzer Prize-winning poets Vijay Seshadri and Tracy K. Smith and with Leontia Flynn and Ciaran Carson, poets from Northern Ireland.(Friday through Sunday, 553 West 51st Street, Manhattan; 212-757-3318; irishartscenter.org.)Advertisement
