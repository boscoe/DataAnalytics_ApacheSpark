In The New York Times Book Review, Marilyn Stasio reviews “The Crossing,” the latest crime novel by Michael Connelly. Ms. Stasio writes:Michael Connelly’s maverick cop, Harry Bosch, has been kicked off plenty of important police cases over his long career. But until now, he has never gone over to the dark side to work against the prosecution in a homicide case. In “The Crossing,” the forcibly retired (and terminally bored) Bosch, a former California detective, breaks faith by taking on a private investigation for his half brother, Mickey Haller. The slick defense lawyer has convinced Bosch that his client, a reformed gangbanger named Da’Quan Foster, is not guilty of murdering Lexi Parks, a well-liked city official who was bludgeoned to death in her bed. But the case still makes Bosch uneasy. “Did he miss the work so much that he could actually cross the aisle and work for an accused murderer?” he asks himself.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Connelly discusses his new novel; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; Joseph Kanon talks about a new biography of John le Carré and a memoir by Frederick Forsyth; feedback from readers; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
