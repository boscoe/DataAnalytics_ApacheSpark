Mikhail Baryshnikov, who has performed all over the world during the last four years, will appear at his own Baryshnikov Arts Center for the first time since 2010, from March 9 to 19. He will perform in the United States premiere of “Brodsky/Baryshnikov,” a previously announced work that is part of the center’s spring season, which was announced on Thursday.“Brodsky/Baryshnikov” is based on poems by the Russian writer Joseph Brodsky and directed by Alvis Hermanis. The work had its premiere Oct. 15 in Riga, Latvia, where Mr. Baryshnikov and Mr. Hermanis were born, and will tour to Tel Aviv before coming to New York. Mr. Baryshnikov and Brodsky, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1987, were close friends until his death in 1996. When the project was announced Mr. Baryshnikov said that the show would not be biographical and would focus on Mr. Brodsky’s poetry, which will be performed in Russian with supertitles.The spring season, which runs Jan. 12 to April 30, also includes “Morphia Series” by the Australian choreographer and performer Helen Herbertson and the designer Ben Cobham; the Corn Exchange, an Irish theater company; a performance series by the composer Daniel Wohl; and a collaboration between the 12-member string band Acronym and the voice ensemble Les Canards Chantants.A version of this article appears in print on 11/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Baryshnikov to Return to His Arts Center.
