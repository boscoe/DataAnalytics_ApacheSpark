A rap album inspired by the TV show “Seinfeld” — and featuring Jerry Seinfeld himself — has opened at No. 1 on Billboard’s chart.The album, called “The Album About Nothing” (Maybach/Atlantic), by the Washington rapper Wale, sold 88,000 copies and had 6.9 million streams, according to Nielsen Music. It follows Wale’s 2008 breakthrough, “The Mixtape About Nothing,” which used samples from the hit show; since then Wale has become friends with Mr. Seinfeld, and recruited him to appear on the new record.Meanwhile, Mark Ronson’s “Uptown Funk” has extended its run as the No. 1 single. At 14 weeks, it has now tied six other songs —  among them the Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling,” from 2009, and Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You,” from 1992 — for the second-most weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. The record, 16 weeks, is held by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s 1995 hit “One Sweet Day.”Also on this week’s album chart, the soundtrack to the new movie “Furious 7,” which features Wale on one track, “Ride Out,” and was released by Atlantic Records, rose 15 spots to No. 2 in its third week out. Ludacris, who appears in the film, opened at No. 3 with his new album, “Ludaversal” (Disturbing Tha Peace/Def Jam). Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly” (TDE/Aftermath/Interscope), which held the top spot for the last two weeks, fell to No. 4, while Taylor Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine) held at No. 5.A version of this article appears in print on 04/09/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Wale’s Seinfeld Album Soars to Top of Chart.
