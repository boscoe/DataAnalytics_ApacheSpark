“On Your Feet!,” a jukebox musical about Gloria and Emilio Estefan, barrelled onto Broadway last week, grossing $970,013 in its first seven preview performances and suggesting that the show might be the first new hit since “Hamilton.”The musical, which tracks the couple’s journey from Cuba to the U.S. and from anonymity to stardom, was the eighth most popular show, out of 31 now running, by audience size, and had an average ticket price of $96.54, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. The show, which had a pre-Broadway run in Chicago, began previews on Oct. 5 and has scheduled an official opening on Nov. 5.Overall, the week ending Oct. 11 was a strong one for Broadway, boosted, as it is every year, by the Columbus Day holiday weekend. Almost all shows saw big jumps in their grosses, led by “Wicked,” which was up $310,699 to $1,765,268, and “Aladdin,” which was up $275,938 to $1,641,903. Last week’s top-grossing shows were “The Lion King,” “Wicked,” “Hamilton” and “Aladdin.” Another new musical, “Allegiance,” about Japanese-American internment camps and featuring George Takei, is off to a solid, if less booming, start: it grossed $608,241 in its first eight performances. A revival of “Spring Awakening,” which opened Sept. 27 to generally strong reviews, is doing only moderately at the box office, grossing $474,057; a production of “Dames at Sea” is off to a slow start in previews, grossing $194,663, though it is playing in a relatively small theater.Two play revivals opened last week, “Old Times,” starring Clive Owen, and “Fool for Love,” starring Sam Rockwell and Nina Arianda, but both are productions of nonprofit theater companies and have low grosses because many audience members acquired tickets as subscribers. The Manhattan Theater Club, which is producing “Fool For Love,” announced on Tuesday that it was extending the show by a week, to Dec. 13.
