The National Archives in Washington is commemorating the 150th anniversary of the death of Abraham Lincoln with a series of book talks, a panel discussion and the exhibition of a key document relating to the assassination: a copy of the death report drafted a day after the shooting by Charles A. Leale, a doctor in the audience at Ford’s Theater.Dr. Leale, 23, was just six weeks out of Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York and a recent hire at the United States Army General Hospital in Washington on April 14, 1865, when he went to Ford’s Theater. He had been intrigued by Lincoln’s face and facial expressions when he attended a presidential speech a few days earlier and hoped to get a closer look.After John Wilkes Booth fired the fatal shot Dr. Leale was the first medical professional on the scene. “I immediately ran to the President’s box,” he wrote in his report, “and as soon as the door was opened was admitted and introduced to Mrs. Lincoln when she exclaimed several times, ‘O Doctor, do what you can for him, do what you can!’” For the next nine hours he stayed by Lincoln’s side.The document on display, signed by Dr. Leale but not in his hand, is believed to be a clerk’s copy of the original report, which has not survived. It remains on display through April 29.
