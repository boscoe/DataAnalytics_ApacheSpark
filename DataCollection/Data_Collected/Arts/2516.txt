Bobby Shmurda will remain in jail for the time being.A $2 million bail package application posted Friday on behalf of the 20-year-old Brooklyn rapper, who is facing an array of gang conspiracy charges, was pulled on Wednesday, the office of the special narcotics prosecutor for New York City said.“It’s our understanding that the suretor has withdrawn and that no hearing is currently scheduled,” said Kati Cornell, a spokeswoman for the office.Kenneth Montgomery, Mr. Shmurda’s lawyer, confirmed that the bail arrangement, which was backed by the rapper’s “management associates,” has been put on hold. “We’re trying to do a new bond application and are in the process in the figuring that out,” Mr. Montgomery said. “We’re hoping to get it done within the next week.”Mr. Shmurda, born Ackquille Pollard, was a rising star, signed by Epic Records and known for his viral hit “Hot Boy,” before he was arrested on Dec. 17 along with a dozen associates, whom the city says were part of a violent gang in East Flatbush known as GS9. Called the “driving force” and “organizing figure” of the group by prosecutors, Mr. Shmurda was charged with multiple counts of conspiracy and weapons possession.On Wednesday, Mr. Montgomery called the $2 million bail “ridiculous,” and questioned Mr. Shmurda’s leadership role within GS9. “Bobby is not claimed to have shot anyone, he has no drug dealer weight on him,” he said. “It’s simply a gun case and some phone conversations.”
