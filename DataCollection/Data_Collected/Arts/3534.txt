LUCK, Tex. — I wanted a break from the music festival, so I went to a music festival. It was the Heartbreaker Banquet, held at Willie Nelson’s ranch, a place called Luck, Tex., located in the dry, rolling scrubland of Spicewood, Tex. It’s about 45 minutes northwest of Austin and a universe away from the frantic miscellany of SXSW.  For me, it was a glimpse of the Austin I was introduced to in the early years of SXSW — one that’s still there, as evidenced in the annual Austin Music Awards held on Wednesday night, but a local flavor that gets inundated during SXSW with newer, flashier events. Reports from the South by Southwest conference and festival in Austin.Luck, Tex., is like a movie set, a mock-up of a main street of an old Texas small town, complete with chapel, saloon, bank and jailhouse, with space to park Austin’s inevitable food trucks.  One stage was a huge tent behind the chapel; the other, in what passed for the town square, was a large outdoor stage facing an area that could easily hold about 3,000 people, an order of magnitude smaller than Mr. Nelson’s old Fourth of July picnics. For my midafternoon visit, there was ample room to get close to either stage, and no one was in any rush.  The lineup — capped by two sets from Mr. Nelson himself, which I couldn’t stick around for — was rootsy Americana, broadly defined, from the retro country of Nikki Lane to the edge-of-grunge roots-rock of the Heartless Bastards to the soul-searing introspection of Angel Olsen to new songs from Hamilton Leithauser, who led the Walkmen during the early-2000s renaissance of New York City rock.   Most of the performers also had gigs at SXSW, but for much more distracted crowds. The Heartbreaker Banquet was narrowly focused, manageable, almost a vacation — but those 1,500-plus bands were calling back at SXSW. SPOTIFY PLAYLIST
