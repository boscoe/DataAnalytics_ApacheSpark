The cartoonist who drew the Prophet Muhammad for the first issue of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo after the killings at the publication’s offices in January has said that he will no longer turn his pencil to that subject. Muhammad “no longer interests me,” Rénald Luzier, who works under the name Luz, said in an interview with the French magazine Les Inrockuptibles that was excerpted on its website on Wednesday. “I’ve gotten tired of it, just as I got tired of drawing Sarkozy,” he added, referring to the former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr. Luzier’s cover, published after an attack on the magazine’s office by Islamic extremists that left 12 people dead, featured Muhammad holding a sign reading “Je Suis Charlie,” under the caption “All Is Forgiven.” “The terrorists did not win,” he told Les Inrockuptibles, in his full remarks, as reported by Agence France-Presse. “They will have won if the whole of France continues to be scared.”A version of this article appears in print on 04/30/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Charlie Hebdo Cartoonist Moves On From Muhammad.
