In The New York Times Book Review, Hampton Sides reviews Erik Larson’s “Dead Wake: The Last Crossing of the Lusitania.” Mr. Sides writes:Erik Larson is one of the modern masters of popular narrative nonfiction. In book after book, he’s proved adept at rescuing weird and wonderful gothic tales from the shadows of history. Larson is both a resourceful reporter and a subtle stylist who understands the tricky art of Edward Scissorhands-ing multiple narrative strands into a pleasing story. Few nonfiction books have employed this technique better than his best seller “The Devil in the White City,” a horrifying account of a serial killer lurking at the edges of the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago. It’s a contrapuntal tale of depravity and sophistication, of evil and beauty, of the hunter and the hunted.And so Erik Larson and the sinking of the Lusitania would seem to be an ideal pairing. The mighty ocean liner was the paragon of civilization, big and fast, strong and sleek, tricked out with every kind of innovation, a White City on the high seas. And hunting it was an ever sly and furtive machine of the deep, a nautical sociopath with an unquenchable thirst for bringing down tonnage.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Larson talks about “Dead Wake”; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; Orlando Patterson discusses two new books by black conservatives, “Please Stop Helping Us” and “Shame”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
