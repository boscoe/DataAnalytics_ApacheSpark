Festivals fill some of the gap, but summer can still be a little quiet for classical music lovers in New York, when many organizations take breaks or head out of town as they hold to season schedules that were created before the dawn of reliable air-conditioning.So the news that the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is planning its first brief summer season — with three concerts in July at Alice Tully Hall — is sure to be welcomed by music fans who long for more choices when temperatures rise and work stress tends to ebb a bit.The first season, announced Monday, will offer blocks of $20 tickets to people between the ages of 21 and 39; tickets for everyone else will be $30 and up. The concerts will feature crowd pleasers — Schubert’s “Trout” Quintet and Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor are among the works planned — and audiences will be offered free wine in the lobby afterward.The concerts are planned for July 15, July 19, and July 22.The new season was announced as the society prepared to hold its spring gala Monday night at Alice Tully Hall. The event took on special interest this year because the man being honored, Reynold Levy, the former president of Lincoln Center, has a book coming out next month that offers sharp criticisms of some of his former colleagues. Copies of his book, “They Told Me Not to Take That Job: Tumult, Betrayal, Heroics, and the Transformation of Lincoln Center” (PublicAffairs), were to be given out for the first time at the gala.A version of this article appears in print on 04/21/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Chamber Music Society Plans Summer Concerts.
