A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Dee Dee Bridgewater (Tuesday through Thursday) Ms. Bridgewater is a sure-footed and sparkling singer, as well as a lauded actress, a public radio host and a United Nations goodwill ambassador. Her command of a club stage, this one in particular, is absolute. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Nate Chinen)Ron Carter Quartet  (through Sunday) Ron Carter, one of jazz’s most highly regarded bassists, tends to favor polish over power in his small-group work, but that doesn’t mean his bands lack a spark. This one shouldn’t, anyway: it features an intuitive pianist, Renee Rosnes, along with the drummer Payton Crossley and the percussionist Rolando Morales-Matos. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Edmar Castañeda (Friday) Edmar Castañeda, the Colombian harpist, has a percussive interface with his instrument, saving the sweeping glissandi for special accents and otherwise using a sharp attack, all pluck and strum. He performs this concert with his longtime partners: the saxophonist Shlomi Cohen, the percussionist David Silliman and his wife, the vocalist Andrea Tierra. At 9:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org.

She draws from the album here, with an adaptable rhythm section of Jason Lindner on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Daniel Freedman on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Steve Coleman and Five Elements  (Friday and Saturday) Last year Mr. Coleman — a formidable alto saxophonist and composer, and a guru among the maverick class of jazz musicians — received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the so-called “Genius Grant.” His flagship band Five Elements has Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet, Anthony Tidd on bass and Sean Rickman on drums. For this engagement, part of the Jazz Gallery’s 20th anniversary festivities, it also has Marcus Gilmore as an additional drummer on Friday, and the guitarist Miles Okazaki on Saturday.

At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com. (Chinen)Harris Eisenstadt and Golden State  (Thursday) A venturesome drummer and composer, Mr. Eisenstadt likes to walk the line between free-form exploration and meticulous composition, and this texture-rich new ensemble — with the multireedist Marty Ehrlich, the bassoonist Sara Schoenbeck and the bassist Eivind Opsvik — should suit that purpose handily. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Beka Gochiashvili and Friends  (Sunday) Beka Gochiashvili is a piano virtuoso from Tbilisi, Georgia, just shy of 19, who has earned the endorsement of some prominent elders in the music industry — like the bassist Stanley Clarke, in whose band he plays, and the pianist Chick Corea, a clear influence. Drawing few distinctions between styles, he leads a band with Jaleel Shaw on alto saxophone, Daryl Johns on bass and Justin Tyson on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)★ Tootie Heath, Ethan Iverson, Ben Street  (through Sunday) Albert (Tootie) Heath is a jazz drummer of experience — he was born in 1935, the youngest of the Heath Brothers, and has worked near the music’s aesthetic center for some 60 years — and he presides as a resident sage in this trio. Featuring a pair of collaborators in their 40s, Mr. Iverson on piano and Mr. Street on bass, the group is celebrating the release of its utterly convincing third album, “Philadelphia Beat.” At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.

His career has been quieter in the last decade, but he has lost nothing in the vocal department, and he still knows how to command a room. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ Jason Moran Celebrates the 80th Anniversary of the Village Vanguard  (Tuesday through March 15) As part of the Village Vanguard’s anniversary festivities, the club commissioned this tribute from the pianist Jason Moran, who never met a programming challenge he couldn’t enliven. Mr. Moran decided to feature a different part of the Vanguard legacy each night — starting on Tuesday with an evening of solo piano, featuring himself along with Kenny Barron, Stanley Cowell, Fred Hersch and Ethan Iverson. On Wednesday, Mr. Moran’s trio, the Bandwagon, will accompany the poets Elizabeth Alexander and Yusef Komunyakaa; on Thursday the band will appear with the comedians Marina Franklin, David Alan Grier and Keith Robinson.

(Chinen)John O’Gallagher Trio  (Friday) John O’Gallagher, an alto saxophonist of dry tone and daring temperament, has a new album, “The Honeycomb,” featuring Johannes Weidenmueller on bass and Mark Ferber on drums — the same rhythm team that backs him in this concert, presented by the Sound It Out series. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)Salute to Betty Carter  (Friday and Saturday) Betty Carter was one of jazz’s greatest singers, a master of the infallible left-field digression. Her former drummer Alvester Garnett leads this tribute, stocked with other alumni of her one-woman academy, like the pianists Jacky Terrasson and Stephen Scott and the tenor saxophonist Craig Handy. On vocals is Charenee Wade, a spiritual heir; a troupe of tap dancers will also join the party. (Preconcert discussions, one hour before the performances, are free for ticket holders.)

(Chinen)Mike Stern and Bill Evans Band  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Stern, a guitarist, and Mr. Evans, a saxophonist, have a long history together, stretching at least as far back as their tenure in the early-1980s comeback bands of Miles Davis. They have kept building on the language of jazz-rock and jazz-funk, each in his own way; their jointly led quartet has Tom Kennedy on bass and Steve Smith on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.
