The zombie apocalypse will hit New Jersey in December when “The Walking Dead Experience,” an immersive theater production based on the popular horror franchise, arrives at the Meadowlands.Billed as “Chapter 1,” the attraction uses actors, technical effects and over 10,000 square feet of elaborate sets to approximate the outbreak of a zombie plague in a small town. Small groups of attendees, who opt to be “walkers” or “survivors,” will make their way through the zombiescape for anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes, based on how how much they pay to play. (Ticket prices start at $50, with premium options including professionally applied makeup.)“The Walking Dead Experience” will run Dec. 4-6 at the Meadowlands during Walker Stalker Con, a zombie and horror convention.  The production was created by Michael Counts, a director and visual artist known for innovative productions like “The Ride,” a 2010 theatrical bus tour, and a multimedia staging of Rossini’s “Moses in Egypt” at New York City Opera in 2013. It is the latest iteration of a franchise that includes the original comic books, as well as video games and the hit television series on AMC.“The Walking Dead Experience” is produced by Walker Stalker Con and Skybound Entertainment, a company led by Robert Kirkman, creator of “The Walking Dead,” and David Alpert, an executive producer for the series. Subsequent productions will continue the stories and experiences introduced in “Chapter 1.” “The Walking Dead Experience” made its debut in October at the Walker Stalker Con in Atlanta, where the television series is filmed. After the Meadowlands, it will begin a national tour that includes stops in Nashville; Orlando, Fla.; Dallas; and Chicago, among other cities.
