Ms. Steinem, the feminist, and Mr. Buñuel, a filmmaker, will join Tine Fischer, the founder of the CPH:DOX documentary festival in Copenhagen; David Gelb, who directed “Jiro Dreams of Sushi”; and the Time Out New York film editor Joshua Rothkopf as jurors for the world documentary competition.  Ms. Goldberg will judge the world narrative competition, along with the “Donnie Brasco” screenwriter Paul Attanasio; the director Sophie Barthes; the actor Dylan McDermott; and the filmmaker Burr Steers, whose credits include “Igby Goes Down.”  The festival runs from April 15 to 26, and winners will be announced April 23.
