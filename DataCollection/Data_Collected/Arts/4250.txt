Updated, 9:03 a.m. | After more than 16 years at the helm of “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart said that his final episode as host of the Comedy Central news satire would be on Aug. 6. Mr. Stewart made the announcement at the end of Monday’s broadcast of “The Daily Show.” When the fateful day comes, Mr. Stewart said: “I will be wearing a suit. I will more than likely be showered.” Reacting to the disappointment of his studio audience, he added: “I’m sorry, I will be wearing overalls and I won’t shower. So I hope that you will join us for that program.”Mr. Stewart, who has hosted “The Daily Show” since 1999, announced in February that he was stepping down. “This show doesn’t deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you,” he said at the time.In March, Comedy Central said that Mr. Stewart would be succeeded by Trevor Noah, a 31-year-old South African comedian who has appeared as a contributor on the show. Comedy Central said Tuesday that “The Daily Show” would go on hiatus for the rest of summer after Mr. Stewart’s departure and relaunch with Mr. Noah some time in the fall. A start date for Mr. Noah has not been announced.
