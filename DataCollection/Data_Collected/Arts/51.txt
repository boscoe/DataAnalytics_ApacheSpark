A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band (Sunday) Ms. Ono will return to what she deems “the most lovely park in the world” with her longstanding conceptual project, the Plastic Ono Band, which is likely to include some high-profile guests. (Next week, she’ll return again to attempt to create the world’s biggest human peace sign for John Lennon’s 75th birthday.) This concert is part of the Chinese-driven Modern Sky Festival; also on the bill is New Pants, Gang of Four and Song Dongye. At 2 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, midpark at 70th Street, 212-360-2777, modernskyfestivalnyc.com. (Andrew R. Chow)Laurie Anderson’s ‘Habeas Corpus’ (Friday through Sunday) A fixture of counterculture since the 1970s, Laurie Anderson arrives at the Park Avenue Armory with a protest piece based on the story of a Guantánamo Bay detainee. The joint audiovisual project, called “Habeas Corpus,” concludes each evening with a world dance music concert featuring Omar Souleyman, Merrill Garbus of Tune-Yards and Ms. Anderson. At 8 p.m., 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, 212-933-5812, armoryonpark.org. (Chow)Jon Batiste and Stay Human (Saturday) If you turn on your television after 11:30 p.m., you just might catch Jon Batiste dancing, beaming, wiggling, scatting his way around the Ed Sullivan Theater Stage as the brand new bandleader of Stephen Colbert’s “The Late Show.” While perhaps most comfortable in New Orleans second-line parades, Mr. Batiste is a veritable chameleon with a manic energy that is only really understood when seen live. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Chow)Eskimeaux (Friday) Another week, another concert from the talented Brooklyn-based collective, the Epoch. This one is led by Eskimeaux, a project fronted by the singer-songwriter Gabrielle Smith and made up of fellow Epoch members. Ms. Smith writes wispy, heartfelt melodies, and her album this year, “O.K.,” is painstakingly and gorgeously etched from fragile parts. With Told Slant, Attic Abasement and Real Life Buildings. At 8:30 p.m., Baby’s All Right, 146 Broadway, near Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, babysallright.com. (Chow)Art Garfunkel (Saturday) Hello Art, my old friend. The 73 year old was plagued by vocal ailments over the five years, but has returned in full force for a yearlong worldwide tour that passed through Korea, Israel and California. Don’t be surprised if he reads some poetry — but really, the main goal of attending is simply to let “Bridge Over Troubled Water” deliver you home. At 8 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Chow)Noah Gundersen (Tuesday) The soft-spoken singer-songwriter from Seattle released a gorgeous, hazy album this August titled “Carry the Ghost,” which was inspired by Neil Young. Like Mr. Young, Mr. Gundersen’s craft relies on yearning, raggedness and pinpoint harmonies. With Field Report. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, boweryballroom.com. (Chow)The Hum (Mondays) This inventive weekly residency brings together female musicians across genres for collaboration. The successful first installment in April included Shilpa Ray and Teen; this time around, they’ve booked rockers from Half Waif and White Prism. (Through Oct. 26.) At 9 p.m., Manhattan Inn, 632 Manhattan Avenue, hypnocraftpresents.com. (Chow)Ibeyi (Friday) These 20-year-old French-Cuban twins are the daughters of Angá Díaz, a prominent percussionist in Cuba who performed with the Buena Vista Social Club. Their music is an ecstatic whirl of Yoruba chants, French and English purrs, sparse electronic beats, Cajón drums and a lot of preternatural tenacity. The duo’s self-titled debut album, which was released on XL this year, is a remarkable first outing. With Vicktor Taiwò and Janelle Kroll. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Stacey Anderson)★ Mitski (Saturday) It’s a sight to behold when Mitski screams directly into her electric guitar, coaxing out every bit of reverberation and feedback her small frame allows her; she’s a tightly wound package of TNT, and not to mention one of the foremost lyricists working today. With Margaret Ross, Leslie Jamison and Jenny Zhang. At 8 p.m., Shea Stadium BK, 20 Meadow Street, between Waterbury and Bogart Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, liveatsheastadium.com; sold out. (Chow)The Month in Cabaret The fall’s splashiest event is the return of the New York Cabaret Convention — now in its 26th year — to the Town Hall, the place it all began. The gala opening, on Oct. 13, is hosted by K.T. Sullivan and features Christine Andreas, Marilyn Maye, Amanda McBroom and Vivian Reed. Karen Akers and Ann Hampton Callaway are among the singers on the Oct. 14 program, titled “A Sentimental Journey: World War II Songs.” It’s followed on Oct. 15 with “Life is a Cabaret: The Songs of Kander & Ebb,” which includes performances by T. Oliver Reed, Steve Ross and Sandy Stewart. And Maureen McGovern is the biggest name in the Oct. 16 double-barreled finale, “What I Did For/Take a Chance on /Love: The Music of Vernon Duke and Marvin Hamlisch.” (At 6 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, thetownhall.org.)Other notable October engagements include the jazz singer Kurt Elling swinging Sinatra standards at Café Carlyle (Oct. 13 through 17), followed by Alexa Ray Joel, Billy’s singing and songwriting daughter, on Oct. 20 through 24 and Oct. 27 through 31. (At 8:45 p.m., with an additional performance on Oct. 17 at 10:45 p.m.; 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com.)Jarrod Spector and Kelli Barrett’s show, “This Is Dedicated: Music’s Greatest Marriages,” at Feinstein’s/54 Below, salutes married show business couples from Sonny and Cher, to Beyoncé and Jay-Z (Oct. 20 through 23). Also at that venue, on Oct. 28 through 31, Barb Jungr and John McDaniel eviscerate the songs of the Fab Four in “Come Together: The Music of the Beatles.” (At 7 p.m., 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, 646-476-3551, 54below.com.)At Birdland, the jazz-singing gamine Karrin Allyson swings Rodgers and Hammerstein beginning Tuesday through Oct. 10. (At 8:30 and 11 p.m., 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.)In more dangerous avant-garde mode, Tammy Faye Starlite’s “Cabaret Marianne” pays tribute to the equally nervy Marianne Faithfull (Thursdays in October at 7:30 p.m., 178 Second Avenue, between East 11th and 12th Streets, East Village, 212-995-0900, pangeanyc.com.) And that’s just skimming the surface. (Stephen Holden)Tame Impala (Tuesday and Wednesday) The video for Tame Impala’s recent single, “Let it Happen,” is a taut exercise in stress and panic, as a man cycles through nightmare situations on and off a plane. But this band’s live sets couldn’t come from a further place: they cycle through absorbing, soothing riffs that mesh wonderfully with the lead singer Kevin Parker’s hypnotic nasal drone. Tuesday at 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 866-858-0008, radiocity.com; Wednesday at 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Chow)Tedeschi Trucks Band (Friday and Saturday) This storied blues-rock band, led by the married musicians Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, makes its annual pilgrimage to the Beacon Theater, with the handpicked special guest Scrapomatic on Friday. At 8 p.m., 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Chow)Television (Thursday) The lo-fi rock band Television will serve a patriarchal role at this cross-generational House of Vans showcase, which also features synth-poppers Lower Dens and the savage post-punks formerly known as Viet Cong (currently between names because of an online protest, they still nabbed a spot on the shortlist for the esteemed Canadian Polaris Prize this year). At 7 p.m., House of Vans, 25 Franklin Street, at Meserole Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, vans.com/events. (Chow)★ Kurt Vile (Tuesday and Wednesday) Mr. Vile’s new album, “B’lieve I’m Goin Down,” is filled with aw-shucks charm, wandering blues licks and tongue-in-cheek text speak, including titles like “That’s Life, Tho (Almost Hate to Say).” But there’s an underlying poignant sadness, too: “Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?” he sings at his own reflection on “Pretty Pimpin,” one of the year’s most confounding and moving songs. With Waxahatchee and Luke Roberts. At 8:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Chow)The War on Drugs (Thursday) It’s easy to get swept away in the swampy morass of a War on Drugs song, which are often a Springsteen-ian tangle of blazing guitar riffs, creeping organs, saxophones and atmospheric synthesizers. Natalie Prass, who will open the show, works on a much smaller, but no less gratifying, scale. Radio City Music Hall, 866-858-0008, radiocity.com. (Chow)★ Wavves and Twin Peaks (Friday and Tuesday) No frills here, just rock ’n’ roll. These flippant, gnarly crews — the first from San Diego, the second from Chicago — have been churning out eardrum-busting chorus-verse-choruses for the last five or so years. Wavves releases its fifth album, “V,” on Friday. With Steep Leans. Friday at 8 p.m., Saint Vitus, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, at Clay Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, saintvitusbar.com; Tuesday at 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, irvingplaza.com. (Chow)Zedd (Friday) The maximalist, fist-pumping EDM bro Zedd headlines a bill with two slightly more tactful and nuanced artists: Madeon, who traffics in helium pop, and AlunaGeorge, an English duo whose lead singer, Aluna Francis, has become an it-girl of dance culture, as evidenced by collaborations with Disclosure, Baauer, Skrillex and Diplo. At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 866-858-0008, thegarden.com. (Chow)Advertisement
