Glance at her menu for the season and see a feast of new music: a garnish of Sibelius topping the meat of concertos by Thomas Adès, John Adams, Oliver Knussen and Sean Shepherd.So if it was a surprise to hear Ms. Josefowicz play Schumann’s Sonata No. 1 in her committed Carnegie Hall recital on Tuesday evening, it was less surprising that she made it sound so contemporary. In her performance at Zankel Hall, with the pianist John Novacek, messages from the 21st century kept impinging: slight bends in pitch, a tone that was serrated at its edges and a pulse that was not quite under control. The result was jagged and unsettled, taking its power from nervous energy. She made the work sound like a secret, one she was not quite ready to share.This was Schumann looking forward, particularly from the final movement’s propulsive drive to the Post-Minimalism of the program’s second half. Ms. Josefowicz took every rhythmic detour in Erkki-Sven Tuur’s “Conversio” (1994), which starts stuck in a rut, confused and circling, and seems to get out by remembering how to be silent, despite interruptions by slashing chords. She gave the highways and byways of Mr. Adams’s “Road Movies” (1995) childlike wonder. The music seemed to wake, disoriented, from a nap at the end of the first movement, “Relaxed Groove,” and overdose on sugar in the hyperactive finale, “40 Percent Swing.”Her repertoire of tone was just as broad in the dances of Falla’s “Suite populaire espagnole,” with ethereal halftones in “Nana,” caustic aggression in “Polo” and a wheezy fug in “Asturiana.” If the heavenly light of Messiaen’s “Theme and Variations” began a little dim, it blinded by the end. Most affecting of all was the encore, Claus Ogermann’s arrangement of Charlie Chaplin’s “Smile,” at first watery, then content.Advertisement
