YouTube and on-demand streaming services like Spotify have made it easier than ever to tap into another country’s music scene. This has forced the recording industry to adapt in novel ways, like designating Fridays as “global release day,” so that fans in different countries can buy or stream new music simultaneously — and won’t be tempted to pirate a new song because it isn’t yet available where they live.But while access to music is increasingly globalized, local tastes still run strong, and it’s hard to predict which artists can cross cultures. This week, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry released data showing 2014’s best-selling albums in its member countries.

The list did not include “Frozen,” the soundtrack to the animated Disney film, which reached No. 2 in Japan and No. 3 in Malaysia and was the year’s top record worldwide, with 10 million units sold, almost double the amount of the next best-selling global album, “1989,” by Taylor Swift.Spain also didn’t have one foreign record in its top 10. Neither did France, with the notable exception of the French-speaking Belgian artist Stromae.Brazil and Portugal may have a common language, but they did not share one top-10 album. Brazil’s list was led by a series of singing Catholic priests, including the Rev. Marcelo Rossi, whose musical sermons generate stadium-size crowds of worshipers.In Sweden, two foreign artists made it into the top 10. One was Ed Sheeran, the 24-year-old English singer-songwriter whose “x” (pronounced “Multiply”) was among the best-selling albums globally. The other was an American country singer, Doug Seegers, who was a homeless busker in Nashville before being discovered singing on the street by a Swedish documentary program. Mr. Seegers became an overnight musical celebrity in Sweden, where his success led to a 60-date sold-out tour  and a record deal back in the United States.A version of this article appears in print on April 23, 2015, in The International New York Times.
