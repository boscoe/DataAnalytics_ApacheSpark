The New York Philharmonic announced that the 24-year-old Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov is joining its board of directors. Mr. Trifonov, who is the current star soloist of the Philharmonic’s three-week Rachmaninoff festival, was elected to the board on Nov. 13.“Daniil Trifonov will be an outstanding addition to the New York Philharmonic board of directors,” said Oscar S. Schafer, the board’s chairman, in a statement. “He is a brilliant pianist who, since his debut in 2012, has thrilled our audiences and established a strong rapport with our musicians that critics and audiences have noticed. His insights as a young musician who travels the world will bring an immensely valuable perspective to the board at a time of growth and expansion for the orchestra.”Mr. Trifonov’s career has taken off since 2011, when at 20, he won the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Master Competition in Tel Aviv, then weeks later won the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.“Daniil Trifonov joins Joshua Bell, Yefim Bronfman, and Itzhak Perlman as musicians on the board with whom the New York Philharmonic has closely collaborated,” the Philharmonic said in its statement.
