It’s pivotal in some game shows, like GSN’s “Lie Detectors.” So why not a documentary? On Thursday at 10 p.m., CNBC obliges with “(Dis)Honesty: The Truth About Lies,” an illuminating look at the whys, hows and how-oftens of the ancient practice. The program juxtaposes stories of people who have lied — two men from an inside-trader scheme; a woman who used a website that facilitates adulterous hookups; an N.B.A. referee caught in a betting scandal, and more — with studies on the nuts and bolts of lying. That research has produced counterintuitive findings. The high-stakes liars who make headlines, for instance, might draw a disproportionate amount of scorn. “Yes, there are some big cheaters out there,” says Dan Ariely, a professor at Duke University, “but they are very rare, and because of that their overall economic impact is relatively low. On the other hand, we have a ton of little cheaters, and because there are so many of us, the economic impact of small cheating is actually incredibly, incredibly high.”Advertisement
