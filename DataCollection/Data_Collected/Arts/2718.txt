Just in time for Valentine’s Day, the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., is receiving a sweet gift – sweet in subject matter but made all the sweeter because the museum itself could probably never have afforded to buy the gift. It announced the donation to its permanent collection of “Boy and Girl Gazing at the Moon (Puppy Love),” a 1926 painting that Rockwell created for a cover of The Saturday Evening Post, a heartland scene of a redheaded boy and pigtailed girl sitting side by side on a rickety bench, mooning at the moon.The painting – which has been widely reproduced and was used for a popular Google Doodle in 2010, in honor of Rockwell’s 116th birthday – was a gift from Bill Millis and his family, who have had the painting in their home in High Point, N.C., since Mr. Millis bought it for around $27,000 in 1975, when he was 26. “I loved everything Rockwell had painted,” said Mr. Millis in a statement, adding that he used to write Rockwell “and he’d always write me back.”“I asked him if he knew whether any originals would ever be for sale, and he told me that there was going to be a showing at the Bernard Dannenberg Galleries in New York City,” said Mr. Millis, a philanthropist and real-estate developer whose family made its fortune in the hosiery business. Prices for paintings by Rockwell have soared into the stratosphere in recent years. In 2013, an auction record was set when “Saying Grace,” one of Rockwell’s most beloved works, sold for $46 million at Sotheby’s.Laurie Norton Moffatt, the Rockwell Museum’s director, said the gift “deepens our holdings of the world’s largest collection of original Norman Rockwell paintings and American illustration art, helping us tell the nation’s story through pictures.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/13/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Valentineu2019s Gift for Rockwell Museum.
