Christie’s will auction a bronze sculpture by Alberto Giacometti at a sale next month, and has estimated its value as high as $130 million, which would be the highest price paid for a sculpture at auction, the company said Tuesday.The sculpture, “Pointing Man (L’homme au doigt),” shows an elongated bronze figure, 5 feet 10 inches high, standing in a commanding pose with both arms raised.Christie’s said the sculpture, from a private collection, had never been sold at auction before. It is from an edition of six casts, plus an artist’s proof, that Giacometti made shortly after the end of the Second World War. The Museum of Modern Art in New York holds one of the versions in its collection.The Giacometti joins a 1955 Picasso canvas, “Les Femmes d’Alger (Version ‘O’),” which the auction house has estimated might fetch as much as $140 million, in a May 11 sale that Christie’s has titled “Looking Forward to the Past.” That sale, of about 30 artworks, combines Impressionist, Modern and contemporary works spanning about 100 years, and has been specially put together to attract what Christie’s says is a broadening population of buyers interested in art from a variety of periods.Jussi Pylkkanen, global president of Christie’s, said this cast stood apart from other versions because Giacometti, who died in 1966, had hand painted it.“It’s got this sense of incredible presence and age,” he said.Unlike the Picasso, the Giacometti is being offered without a guaranteed minimum price to the seller. In 2010, Sotheby’s sold another Giacometti, “Walking Man I,” a lanky bronze figure, for $104.3 million.A version of this article appears in print on 04/15/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Record Auction Estimate for Giacometti Sculpture.
