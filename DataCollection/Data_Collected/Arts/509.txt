Ms. Swift brought youthful, diaristic intensity to the genre, before leaving it behind to be the world’s pre-eminent pop star. Ms. Lambert championed for country’s scrappier side, preserving traditionalist aesthetics while overlaying them with pugnacious feminist storytelling.It is not quite an insult to say that Carrie Underwood could reasonably play the Broadway version of either of those singers. At the country vocal Olympics, she’s a gold medalist. She had a victorious turn scream-singing on “American Idol” and has extended it into a victorious scream-singing career in Nashville, in which she has sold approximately 15 million albums, been inducted into the Grand Ole Opry and acted as the longtime co-host (with Brad Paisley) of the Country Music Association Awards.All she’s missing is the one thing Ms. Swift and Ms. Lambert have down cold: a fixed identity.“Storyteller” is her fifth album, and even though a decade has passed since her debut, Ms. Underwood is still preoccupied with power, not texture or finesse. She largely picks songs that serve as launch platforms for her ballistic-missile voice, but they don’t cohere into a whole identity. Her voice is pure, lean, potent — it doesn’t have multiple settings. By tone alone, it can be difficult to divine when she’s ecstatic, or aggrieved, or wretched.That means Ms. Underwood sings with equal intensity on the insipid “Heartbeat” and “The Girl You Think I Am,” an unrelentingly treacly song about being daddy’s little girl, as on the breathy, sly “Relapse,” about falling back into old habits. She calls her lover, in quick succession, “time that I’m wasting,” “some wine that I’m tasting” and “a high that I’m chasing,” in a voice that recalls Lita Ford more than any country singer.If Ms. Underwood has developed a thematic specialty, it’s the woman-done-wrong anthem. The ones on this album are some of the better songs here. “Dirty Laundry” finds her catching her man in lies, and “Church Bells” is a worthy addition to country’s proud line of songs about domestic violence:Everyone thought they were Ken and BarbieBut Ken was always getting way too drunkSaturday night after a few too manyHe came home ready to fightAnd all his money could never save JennyFrom the devil living in his eyesIt was all bruises covered in makeup, dark sunglassesAnd that next morning sitting in the back pewPraying with the BaptistsAlthough the song is elegantly structured and technically impressive, it still lacks bite or pulp. It’s tough not to wonder what Ms. Lambert might have done with it.Advertisement
