LONDON — A monthlong “living exhibition” organized by the multimedia artist Doug Aitken and an international Shakespeare festival are just two of the highlights of the Barbican Center’s extensive 2015-16 season, announced on Wednesday.Other projects include new theater productions from Ivo van Hove and Simon McBurney; a celebration of the life and work of Dr. Robert Moog, the inventor of the Moog synthesizer; contemporary dance from India; and a photography exhibition curated by Martin Parr.The Barbican, which programs all art forms but is particularly well-known for music and theater, is home to the London Symphony Orchestra, which recently announced that Simon Rattle would become its music director in 2017, when the principal conductor, Valery Gergiev, steps down. Audiences can get a taste of Mr. Rattle’s talents throughout the next season, when he will conduct programs of music by Ravel and Hadyn, as well as a new children’s opera by Peter Maxwell Davies.Other classical music highlights include an Artist Spotlight on the soprano Renée Fleming, who will give two concerts and a master class in February, and an audiovisual song-cycle exploring the work of World War I poets, composed by Michael Nyman and filmed by Max Pugh.Full details of the new season can be found at: //www.barbican.org.uk.
