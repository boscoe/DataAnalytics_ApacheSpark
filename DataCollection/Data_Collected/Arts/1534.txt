Margaret Atwood, who has written poetry, children’s literature and fiction and nonfiction, is adding another genre to her repertoire: graphic novels. Dark Horse Comics will publish “Angel Catbird,” written by Ms. Atwood and drawn by Johnnie Christmas, in the fall of 2016. The story, which will be told over three graphic novels intended for all ages, is about a superhero that derives his powers from two animals. In a statement, Ms. Atwood explained some of how this new hero came to be: “Due to some spilled genetic Super-Splicer, our hero got tangled up with both a cat and an owl; hence his fur and feathers, and his identity problems.” For Ms. Atwood, who is Canadian and lives in Toronto, the choice of cat and bird has additional meaning. She is using the book to raise awareness for Keep Cats Safe and Save Bird Lives, a program led by Nature Canada, the oldest conservation charity in the country. Each volume of the trilogy will be $10.99 and in full color.
