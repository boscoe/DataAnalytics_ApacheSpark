Thanks to them, thoughtfulness and ostentation finally went hand in hand — one didn’t have to trade one revolution for the other.The arrival of Raury may mark the beginning of the inevitable reversal of that movement.A hip-hop-generation shaman with an alert sense of musical history and a fearless humility, Raury isn’t interested in rejecting the hard-fought innovations of the generations just above him, but rather has mainlined them so thoroughly that he’s able to remold them.“All We Need,” his second album, is full of confidently expressed delicateness. This is folk music refracted through hip-hop sensibilities, an aesthetic that suggests that not all the post-rap tributaries have been explored yet.From the beginning of this album, Raury is earnest and aggrieved — he begins by lamenting consumerism and income inequality, in a voice that’s part tense rapping and part wistful singing. Then he swings toward songs about emotional connections, be it the wide-eyed “Mama”; or “Love Is Not a Four Letter Word,” an aggrieved spoken rant aimed at a woman who has let him down; or “Woodcrest Manor II,” about a friendship riven by time and mistrust.Throughout, Raury is backed by a mélange of space-soul and soft rock produced largely by Malay, who cut his teeth refining his brand of earthy romanticism with Frank Ocean. This Woodstock-era approach feels like the logical result of the last generation of hip-hop outsiders subjected to several years’ erosion by the elements — think Andre 3000’s “Prototype,” or the scrappier songs on the first N.E.R.D. album, or the way early records by A Tribe Called Quest had a palpable air hiss to them.Even as Raury oozes naturalist, hippieish energy, he manages to remain playful — not humorous, but almost childlike. He sees the flaws of the world around him and raises his hand, volunteering to make the first change. He’s the type of artist who, when he performed on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” the same night Donald Trump was a guest, wore a shirt with Trump’s name crossed out. The ostentation he grew up around could be deafening, so instead, Raury has taken what was handed to him and, from it, made his own Walden Pond.Advertisement
