The first work by a black American artist to be acquired by an American museum was Henry Ossawa Tanner’s luminous “The Annunciation” (1898), in which the angel Gabriel in the form of a burst of pure light appears to Mary in her humble, typically Middle Eastern bedroom — it entered the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1899. The museum has since collected much more art by black Americans. On Jan. 10, it will open “Represent: 200 Years of African American Art,” an exhibition of about 75 works by more than 50 artists from the museum’s holdings. The show will include works made by free and enslaved pre-Civil War artists and artisans; early Modernists like William Henry Johnson and Jacob Lawrence; and self-taught artists like William Edmondson, Horace Pippin and Bill Traylor. Glenn Ligon, Martin Puryear, Carrie Mae Weems and other contemporary artists will bring up to date what promises to be an enlightening, kaleidoscopic reflection of black American history and experience.
