Season 3 of A&E’s “Bates Motel,” which has its finale Monday night at 9, has been transformative for young Norman Bates. And not just figuratively.Episode 6, broadcast last month, represented the first time that Norman — a teenage version of the Anthony Perkins character from “Psycho” — fully transformed into his mother, including donning her bathrobe.It was a moment everyone involved in the show knew was coming at some point as the prequel works its way toward the adult Norman. Freddie Highmore, who plays Norman, recalled surveying wardrobe racks with the costume designer at the beginning of the season and taking note of the gowns.“I wondered, ‘Which ones of those am I going to get to try on?’ ” he said in an interview in New York, where he and Kerry Ehrin, a creator of the series, were preparing for A&E’s upfront presentation to advertisers.Ms. Ehrin also wrote the transformation episode. She and Mr. Highmore cracked each other up with speculation on who else might do a little cross-dressing. What about Norma, Norman’s mother, whose portrayal by Vera Farmiga grows more intense by the week? Perhaps the two of them might swap outfits? “That’s when the show becomes a full-on comedy,” Ms. Ehrin joked.A version of this article appears in print on May 10, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Television; Just Like Mom Used to Make.
