In 1844, the 13-year-old heir apparent to the Qajar dynasty throne in Persia had his first portrait photograph taken by a traveling European, and a lifelong shutterbug was born. A few years later, when the prince inherited the crown as Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, he not only hired a resident court photographer but also learned to take pictures himself, turning a royal building into a darkroom and training court eunuchs to print the pictures he took of his wives.These images are among the 200 photographs in “The Eye of the Shah: Qajar Court Photography and the Persian Past” at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, an Upper East Side outpost of N.Y.U. The images of the royal ladies, dressed in what look like square-dance skirts and bobby socks, are fascinating, but so are shots of fabulous palace interiors, common daily life (market activity, railroads, a public execution) and the ancient ruins at Persepolis. Through photography, we see a culture simultaneously discovering and creating a present and a past.
