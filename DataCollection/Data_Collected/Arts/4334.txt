Human beings may excel at making things, but destroying them is equally a specialty. The second skill has given the history of art many tantalizing mysteries, remnants of cultures whose achievement is unmistakable yet fragmentary, limited by extensive losses resulting from accident, neglect or war.One such mystery is examined in “Sultans of Deccan India, 1500-1700: Opulence and Fantasy,” a landmark exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This beautiful, sometimes heart-rending show is the most comprehensive yet to focus on the cosmopolitan Muslim kingdoms that ruled the verdant Deccan Plateau of south-central India for nearly two centuries, fostering a turbulent golden age. The some 200 objects here include extraordinary examples of metalwork, textiles, calligraphy, jewels, carved stone and, most significantly, around 70 — or about one-third — of the known miniature paintings from this period of Deccani history, among them a very high percentage of masterpieces.“Sultans of Deccan India” is rife with rare works from collections in Europe and India that are seldom seen together, especially in New York, and includes several new discoveries. Prominent among them is the magnetic “Portrait of a Ruler or Musician” (circa 1630), which features an elegantly attired dark-skinned man of noble mien and anxious expression with a seemingly withered hand. He sits in profile on a resolutely flat striped carpet against an equally flat dark blue background — a pillowy expanse that could be a cloudy night sky, a hillside landscape or a quilted tent. It matches the thick curtain that has been pulled back and tied to the picture’s edge, a wood structure or frame of ambiguous location.The show has been organized by Navina Najat Haidar, the Met’s curator of Islamic art, and Marika Sardar, an associate curator at the San Diego Museum of Art, and it benefits greatly from an atmospheric installation whose density and sumptuous wall colors (salmon, deep violet, avocado, maroon) conjure courtly lavishness. Small, finely detailed treasures abound in a profusion that can initially daunt. But pick up one of the available magnifying glasses and plunge in. Concentration is rewarded, and encouraged: the show’s many paintings are installed in small groups on bookended walls that tilt inward, creating a comfortable lean-in intimacy.AdvertisementThis intimacy is enhanced by the curators’ determination to display some works in a strikingly fresh manner. In several cases, they have exchanged conventional, rather hygienic white mats for ones of richly colored shot silk. Elsewhere, mats have been removed altogether, revealing seldom-seen borders like the rows of somewhat naïvely painted little red flowers marshaled around a meticulously realistic drawing of an elephant. In a few instances, lenders have agreed to let their works be shown in gilt antique European frames from the Met’s collection, including “Portrait of a Ruler or Musician,” which has also been given one of the shot silk mats. All of this creates a visual and cultural complexity that proves transformative.AdvertisementThe Deccan was coveted territory. Located on east-west trade routes, it was rich in natural resources and fine products, and it attracted people from across the Middle East and Europe, making it a cultural melting pot if not always a political one. Its golden age began toward the end of the Bahmani Empire, which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate to the north in 1347 and ruled over the entire Deccan with decreasing power until around 1538. By then the governors of the five Bahmani states had rebelled, declaring themselves sultans of individual kingdoms. The greater were Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Golconda, the lesser Bidar and Berar.

Their efforts produced a unique Indo-Islamic painting style, and for a time the Deccan also set the standard for Persian poetry and was an important center of Arabic literacy and literary composition. But the kingdoms’ power waxed and waned as they fended off challenges from the north and south and fought with and sometimes absorbed one another. Needless to say, such machinations had a dire effect on the material culture, as implied by Antonio Martinelli’s photographs of ruined palaces here. In 1687 the last of the Deccani sultanates was annexed by the Mughal Empire.As if to rivet our attention on the small and the beautiful, the exhibition begins with a brief ravishing display of diamonds, for which the Deccan was the world’s main source during this period, and which were celebrated for their impressive size and color. The most remarkable here in terms of size and faceting include the exquisitely simple “Shah Jahan Diamond” and the startlingly kaleidoscopic brilliant-cut stone known as the Idol’s Eye.From here the show unfolds according to kingdom, alternating dazzling clusters and singular works. In the Bijapur gallery, where painting and calligraphy reign supreme, don’t miss the six small images made with marbling, a local specialty. They reflect several uses of the technique and culminate in a rotund woman depicted in a marbled cloak and seated, perhaps beside a marbled stream. But the pinnacle of marbling is the magnificent “Royal Hunting Falcon, from the Musée Guimet in Paris. Its wide border, visible here for the first time, alternates two bands of soft-seeming marbling with one that looks like polished granite.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One ewer is so dense with scrolling vines that it is almost entirely silver, while its neighbor is predominantly black. The ratios of the contrasting metals continue to fluctuate in a group of trays and vaselike hookah bases, as do treatments for water, flowering plants, horizon lines and architecture. Their vitrine is one of the show’s highlights.The largest gallery is devoted to the fruits of the sultanate of Golconda, famous for its diamond mines. It begins with several mordant painted and resist-dyed cotton wall hangings called kalamkari, whose mixtures of Persian, Indian and European motifs include men or women reclining in gardens implied by fields of plant and animal motif.There is further metalwork, this time brass and bronze vessels with Koranic or poetic inscriptions in low relief. Notable here is an elliptical begging bowl thought to have been used in Sufi shrines; it would fit gracefully into uplifted hands. This epigraphic tendency is also evident in an alam, or royal standard, made of perforated gilt copper in the silhouette of a falcon. Other singular Golconda works include the gilded-copper finials of a palanquin — another recent discovery — and a prayer rug for six, with architectural designs and contrasting patterns creating a niche for each worshiper.One source of the Deccan’s instability may have been, as the show’s subtitle of “opulence and fantasy” suggests, that the sultans had a greater interest in culture and leisure than governing. If so, Deccani otherworldliness is nowhere more apparent than in the intense colors, dreamy moods and inexplicable motifs of many of their paintings. At the bottom of one painting, probably from Ahmadnagar, that depicts a woman splashing water on her lover, there is a flotilla of red amoeboid shapes that can read today as magnification of microbes from the river she stands in. A nearby image of three women in a garden has a more landlocked version of the same motif.Perhaps the grandest departure from reality is found in the sky of roiled pinks, whites and lavenders in an expansive Bijapur hunting scene that is one of the show’s best-known masterpieces. Undoubtedly inspired by marbling, the artist intimates nature’s immense power, delicate yet unmistakable, above the controlled choreography of two princes on impeccably coifed steeds. Examining the clouds with a magnifying glass gives little sense of how they were made, but their miragelike realm, opulent and fantastic, is among this revelatory show’s many mysteries — one to be cherished and explored rather than mourned.An art review on Friday about “Sultans of Deccan India, 1500-1700: Opulence and Fantasy,” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misidentified the entity from which the Bahmani Empire, toward the end of which the Deccan region’s golden age began, broke away in 1347. It was the Delhi Sultanate — not the Mughal Empire, which was not founded until 1526.“Sultans of Deccan India, 1500-1700: Opulence and Fantasy” continues through July 26 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.
