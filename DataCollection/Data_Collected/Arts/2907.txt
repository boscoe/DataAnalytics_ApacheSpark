Keith Carradine, a two-time Tony nominee for his roles in “The Will Rogers Follies” (1991) and “Hands on a Hardbody” (2013), will star in “Paint Your Wagon” next month at New York City Center, the organization announced on Sunday.   The musical comedy, written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, is about a prospector (Mr. Carradine) and his daughter (Alexandra Socha), who find love and gold in a small California mining town during the gold rush era. The original production of “Paint Your Wagon” opened on Broadway in 1951, and was adapted into a movie in 1969 starring Clint Eastwood – a role that inspired the comedian Billy Crystal to publicly ask Mr. Eastwood to “please don’t sing no more.” Mr. Carradine has more than four decades of experience in Broadway and has recently had recurring roles in the television series “Madam Secretary” and “Fargo.” Other “Paint Your Wagon” cast members include Jenni Barber (“The Nance”) as Elizabeth Woodling and Justin Guarini (“Wicked”) as Julio Valveras. The musical runs March 18 through 22 as part of City Center’s Encores! series. It is directed by Marc Bruni and choreographed by Denis Jones, with Rob Berman as musical director.
