A Spanish court on Tuesday ordered the soprano Montserrat Caballé to pay a fine of 254,000 euros, about $278,000, for avoiding taxes by falsely claiming residency in Andorra.Ms. Caballé, 82, a star of the international opera stage for five decades, was charged in 2014 with failing to declare about €508,000 in earnings in 2010 from performances in countries that included Italy, Russia and Switzerland.She reached a deal with prosecutors that would allow her to pay the fine and avoid jail time with a symbolic sentence of six months. Spanish law normally applies prison terms for first-time offenders in tax cases only when the sentence is for two years or more. Ms. Caballé failed to appear in a Barcelona court in May to settle the case but agreed to the judge’s verdict on Tuesday by video conference from her home, according to Spanish media reports.The court said in its ruling on Tuesday that Ms. Caballé had been “habitually” living in Barcelona even as some of her overseas performance revenues were paid into an account in Andorra, a principality and offshore financial center in the mountains dividing Spain and France.As part of the agreement she must also pay interest charges of about €72,000 for taxes on the undeclared income.A version of this article appears in print on 12/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Spanish Soprano Fined for Avoiding Taxes.
