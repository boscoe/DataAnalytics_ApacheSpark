The architect Zaha Hadid has settled her case against the New York Review of Books and critic Martin Filler, and donated the settlement money to an undisclosed charity that “protects and champions labor rights,” dezeen magazine reported on Tuesday. Ms. Hadid had filed the libel suit in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan last August.In his June review of Rowan Moore’s “Why We Build: Power and Desire in Architecture,” Mr. Filler wrote that Ms. Hadid “unashamedly disavowed any responsibility, let alone concern” for an “estimated one thousand laborers who have perished” while building the Al Wakrah stadium she designed for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.Ms. Hadid said Mr. Filler had taken remarks she made in February 2014 — before work on the stadium she designed had even begun — out of context and that there had been no worker deaths at that site.In a subsequent letter to The New York Review’s editors that was appended to his review online, Mr. Filler acknowledged that the comments by Ms. Hadid that he had quoted “had nothing to do with” the stadium she designed.“I regret the error,” he wrote.Gonzalo S. Zeballos, one of the lawyers at BakerHostetler who are representing the architect, said: “Ms. Hadid is pleased to have put to rest this dispute, and to have resolved it in a way that demonstrates her commitment to safe and fair working conditions at construction sites around the world.”
