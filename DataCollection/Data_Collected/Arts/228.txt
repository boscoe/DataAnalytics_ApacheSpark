If their shows have grown a little musty, the scores — with their great melodies and morally serious lyrics — still loom as a cultural bulwark against chaos.Because these songs, especially the semi-operatic ballads, were written for characters, they resist attempts to loosen them up. The more you fiddle with them, the more they lose their emotional focus.The latest jazz singer to try to shake them up is Karrin Allyson, who performed excerpts from her new album of Rodgers and Hammerstein songs, “Many a New Day,” at Birdland on Wednesday evening, with a trio featuring Miro Sprague on piano, Ed Howard on bass and Adam Cruz on drums.Several songs, most notably “Happy Talk,” from “South Pacific,” lent themselves to Ms. Allyson’s relaxed approach. She spewed the semi-nonsensical lyrics, padded with playful scat improvisation, in a joyful, freewheeling gush of improvisatory babble. “I Cain’t Say No,” one of several songs from “Oklahoma!” in the set, brought out her mischievous streak.A remarkably flexible stylist who is equally comfortable with bebop, rock and swing, Ms. Allyson has never been an interpreter who probes lyrics in search of a psychological subtext. With her pixie haircut and informal slacks-and-tops stagewear, she conveys the easygoing attitude of a gal on the road who likes to hang with the band and have fun. Romantic intensity is low on her list of priorities.That nonchalance, coupled with arrangements that elongated stretched-out ballads like “I Have Dreamed,” “We Kiss in a Shadow” and “Hello, Young Lovers,” sapped them of weight and melodic clout.She brought an appropriate tone of sarcasm to that classic indictment of racial prejudice, “You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught,” but refrained from expressing the stinging rage and frustration necessary to make the song register.Karrin Allyson performs through Sunday at Birdland, Manhattan; 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz­.com.Advertisement
