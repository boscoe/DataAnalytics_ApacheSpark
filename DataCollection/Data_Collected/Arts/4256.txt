The differential between the two bands indicates many of the strengths of Ava Luna, especially in its third record, “Infinite House.”Here’s what you get more of with Ava Luna and less of with the other group: a committed belief in dance grooves, a casual interest in harmonic development, an insularity and playfulness, an establishment of a single, real-time band sound.Most of the members of Ava Luna grew up in New York City, as opposed to having arrived after the colonization of Brooklyn, and you can hear their proprietary connection with the new-wave funk of the early ’80s, bands like Konk and Liquid Liquid and Dinosaur L and Tom Tom Club. The charm is in the open spaces: This is music that lets you in. Once you’re in, the singing of Carlos Hernandez may determine how long you’ll stay. He spends a lot of time singing in a falsetto, and he’s channeling soul phrasing — a line of seduction songs stretched between Al Green and Prince.It’s dicey business. You get the sense that he knows it.It’s welcoming, but it’s weird, this band. It’s got the sound of practice, especially in the rhythm section: It establishes strains with strong bass-lines and stirring chord movement that could open up and linger, and yet the greatest songs here — “Tenderize,” “Roses and Cherries,” and especially “Billz,” which is this band’s wonder of dynamics, its “Darling Nikki” — shut themselves down within three and a half minutes.For its chance to go long, it chose “Victoria” — a good groove over which the band members mess around aimlessly with delay and distortion for seven and a half minutes. There’s some deliberate perversity there, and some trust in the flexibility, forgiveness and loyalty of its audience. Those are all New York things, too.Advertisement
