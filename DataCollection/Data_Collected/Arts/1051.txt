The saxophonist John Coltrane released his most revered album, “A Love Supreme,” on the Impulse! label in 1965, and from the start it was understood as something special: a four-part suite that drew Coltrane’s magnificent quartet into deep, devotional focus. The album has been reissued in a deluxe edition before, but a boxed set due out on Friday, Nov. 20, “A Love Supreme: The Complete Masters,” offers the deepest dive yet, with alternate takes, studio chatter, photo reproductions and a new essay by Ashley Kahn, who once wrote a book on the subject.And as part of the 50th-anniversary festivities around “A Love Supreme,” the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis will perform its large-group arrangement of the suite, released on an album a decade ago. The performance, on Tuesday and Wednesday, Nov. 17 and 18, is being presented under the banner of Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival. (At 7:30 p.m., Starr Theater, Alice Tully Hall, 212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org.)A version of this article appears in print on November 15, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Pop; Ever Devoted to Coltrane.
