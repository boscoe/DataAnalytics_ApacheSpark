Seeking to make its ever-packed galleries and programs more hospitable to older art patrons, the Museum of Modern Art announced on Thursday an initiative – “Prime Time” – that will offer film screenings, online courses, gallery conversations and other events free to New York City residents ages 65 and older. The new programs begin on May 9 with a daylong event that will include free museum admission to those 65 and older.Museum officials have been working for several months to create the programs, motivated in part by the city’s growing population of older adults: More than 1 million people age 65 and over now live in New York, and the number is expected to increase by almost 50 percent by 2040. The new programs have been planned in consultation with an advisory group of older museum patrons and with organizations that included New York City’s Department for the Aging, the Martha Stewart Center for Living at Mount Sinai and the Henry Street Settlement.“While museums may not be able to address all of the diverse needs of older adults,” said Glenn D. Lowry, the museum’s director, “we believe we can contribute significantly to their quality of life through fostering a sense of well-being, connectedness and purpose.” To mark the beginning of the programs, the museum announced that throughout May it would offer half off the $18 price of a senior ticket to all New Yorkers 65 and older, and a $25 discount on new annual memberships.A version of this article appears in print on 05/01/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New MoMA Plan For Older New Yorkers.
