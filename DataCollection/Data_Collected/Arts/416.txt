The idea of the modern happy hour as a chunk of time set aside for twilight revelry is thought to have military origins. By the end of World War II, it had spread to the civilian world; now it’s served with a dance twist. In “Happy Hour,” opening on Wednesday, Oct. 21, the idiosyncratic team of Monica Bill Barnes and Anna Bass — who have collaborated with the radio host Ira Glass on a popular touring show — bring a charming brand of clumsiness to the great tradition of post-work socializing.The dancers are masters of the pratfall and the facial twitch, descendants of vaudeville and old-timey entertainers in the best sense. In a carpeted room strewn with streamers (capturing the corporate office party vibe), the besuited pair court an audience with song, dance and the endearing awkwardness of the cocky but sincere bros you might find at a bar down the street. Like all good happy hours, this one has plentiful munchies and libations. And like the best ones, it offers abundant laughter.
