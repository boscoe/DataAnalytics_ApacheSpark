PARIS — The Académie Goncourt on Tuesday awarded the Algerian novelist Kamel Daoud its 2015 prize for best first novel, for “The Meursault Investigation.” The book is a retelling of Albert Camus’s 1942 classic “The Stranger” from the perspective of the brother of the Arab man killed by that novel’s protagonist, Meursault.Mr. Daoud, 44, is a journalist and columnist based in Oran, Algeria. “The Meursault Investigation,” was a finalist in November for the Goncourt Prize, the academy’s top award, which went to Lydie Salvayre  for her novel “Pas Pleurer” (Don’t Cry). The prize for best first novel covered books that came out in 2014 or early 2015.In a profile of Mr. Daoud in The New York Times Magazine last month, Adam Shatz wrote that “the great theme of Daoud’s writing is the Algerian condition. To be Algerian, he argues, is to be ‘schizophrenic,’ torn between religious piety and liberal individualism.” The novelist also told Mr. Shatz that Manuel Valls, the prime minister of France, had called him to express admiration for “The Meursault Investigation.”In December, Mr. Daoud, a harsh critic of the government of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria, was the target of a fatwa by a Salafist imam who accused him of being an enemy of Islam and of the Arabic language. Mr. Daoud told the French newspaper Le Monde at the time that he wanted to carry on writing as before.“The Meursault Investigation” will be published in the United States in June by Other Press. It was first published in Algeria in 2013 and in France last year.A version of this article appears in print on 05/06/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Algerian Wins Goncourt Prize.
