Right now, he only looks back, content with making standard-issue Post-Minimalism derived from ideas and materials pioneered more than 40 years ago by artists like Richard Van Buren, Keith Sonnier, Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. Mr. Lang has long been acquainted with contemporary art, but this work evinces an all-too-typical amnesia about the recent past and a seeming disdain for the rigors of finding your own art rather than settling for a pastiche of the achievements of others.Mr. Lang’s textured sculptures are made from resin mixed with shreds of garments from his archive. He casts this substance in tubes, creating tall, thin poles that lean against the wall, or builds it into shorter, thicker columns that are sliced open to reveal contrasting textures. Colors tend to be white, gray, black, rust and dusty pink, with occasional forays into red, yellow or deep green.His newer wall reliefs, which feel more contemporary but no less routine, are made from the boxes, tape and string used to package designer clothes and are painted a single hue of enamel.The gallery’s news release quotes Mr. Lang saying that “the substance of artists’ lives has always been the subject of their art” — but, so far, he has taken this truism much too literally. Nothing here is likely to carry him far beyond bauble-prone collectors and celebrity-besotted glossies, but these days, it is usually enough to create the illusion of a career.Sperone Westwater 257 Bowery, near Houston Street, Lower East Side Through SaturdayAdvertisement
