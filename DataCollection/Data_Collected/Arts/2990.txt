The graffiti artist Banksy unveiled his latest politically charged creation online on Thursday, posting on Instagram a photograph of a weeping figure, which the artist tagged with the hashtags “Banksy” and “Gaza.”A two-minute movie was also posted on his website, with short clips of Palestinian citizens standing amid rubble and what appear to be armed Israeli soldiers. The clip is peppered with captions, like “the locals like it so much they never leave…. (Because they’re not allowed to).”The artist also posted two other artworks that he created in the area — a silhouette of a group of children swinging around a foreboding watchtower and a disarmingly childlike picture of a cat, with a caption explaining that he created the image because “on the Internet people only look at pictures of kittens.” The short film also shows a quotation scrawled by the artist onto a wall: “If we wash our hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless we side with the powerful — we don’t remain neutral.”A publicist for the artist would not reveal where in the region the images were taken, or when. But she released a quote she attributed to Banksy: “I don’t want to take sides. But when you see entire suburban neighborhoods reduced to rubble with no hope of a future — what you’re really looking at is a vast outdoor recruitment center for terrorists. And we should probably address this for all our sakes.”Banksy, whose identity has not been confirmed although there has been  wide speculation, has a history of creating political works in and beyond his native Britain. In 2005, he tagged a series of images along the West Bank wall, and in 2007 he returned, painting images including a now-iconic rendering of a young girl patting down an Israeli soldier.This month, a number of other British artists have also turned their focus to the Israel-Palestine conflict, with over 600 British artists announcing a “cultural boycott” of Israel in a letter published in The Guardian.In an apparently unrelated event, Banksy’s only existing mural in Germany was vandalized on Wednesday  in Hamburg.
