LONDON — Multiple sclerosis may have contributed to the mysterious early death of Constance Wilde, the wife of the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, according to a paper published on Friday in the medical journal The Lancet.Until now, her death in 1898 at age 40 had been variously ascribed to an injury to the spine, a creeping paralysis or even syphilis.The paper, co-written by Merlin Holland, the couple’s grandson, and Ashley H. Robins, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Cape Town Medical School in South Africa, is based on roughly 130 letters that Ms. Wilde wrote to her brother from 1878 to the year of her death. The letters describe widespread pain, weakness in the right leg, exhaustion and partial facial paralysis. According to The Lancet, a likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis.Although multiple sclerosis, a disease of the immune system, was described as early as 1868 by the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, it was not widely understood in the medical community at the time.“I am tired of doctors, and no doctor finding out what to do with me,” Ms. Wilde said, according to the paper.After her husband was imprisoned for homosexual acts in 1895, Ms. Wilde lived in self-imposed exile with her two sons near Genoa, Italy. She sought treatment there from an Italian professor of gynecology, Luigi Maria Bossi, who believed that some neurological problems in women were caused by lesions in the female reproductive system. Ms. Wilde had surgery to remove a uterine fibroid, and died five days after the procedure.The Lancet paper suggests that the procedure may have resulted in blood poisoning or in an obstructed intestine, which in turn could have contributed to her death, less than a year after Mr. Wilde was released from prison.In an article in the British daily newspaper The Guardian, Mr. Holland said that he hoped the Lancet paper would put an end to speculation about his grandmother’s death.
