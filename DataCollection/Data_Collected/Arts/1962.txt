Its many offerings include traditional gumboot dancing, a tribute to Nelson Mandela, and an array of musical genres, including Zulu drums and kwaito, a club genre born in post-apartheid Johannesburg. Tuesday through Thursday at 7 p.m., next Friday at 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Siobhan Burke)Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (through Sunday) If any holiday dance tradition can rival “The Nutcracker,” it’s the Ailey company’s winter season at City Center. This year’s five-week run wraps up with classics from the Ailey repertoire and the evergreen “Revelations” concluding each program. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m., 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org, alvinailey.org. (Burke)★ American Realness (Thursday through Jan. 18) “American Realness is dead. Long live American realness.” That’s the slogan for the sixth edition of this genre-crossing festival. According to the schedule — 10 days packed with performances, parties, discussions and workshops, mostly at Abrons Arts Center — it’s very much alive. A pantheon of smart, subversive artists will be in the building, including Miguel Gutierrez with the next installment of his “Age and Beauty” suite (Thursday through Jan. 10); Liz Santoro with the return of her hypnotic “Relative Collider” (Jan. 10 and 11); and Keith Hennessy, who annexes Nijinsky’s “Rite of Spring” in his new solo, “Bear/Skin” (Thursday through Jan. 11). At various times, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, americanrealness.com. (Burke)Advertisement★ AUNTSforcamera  (through Feb. 15) The New Museum hosts this exhibition of nine video works dispersed throughout the building, a project of the protean dance entity AUNTS. The entries deal with everything from dancing with drones to mastering the original Harlem Shake. Grab a map and find your way among the monitors and screens, or take an artist-led tour, offered on selected days. Tours are free with a submission to Karl Scholz’s interactive experiment “#auntsforcamera.” Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, 212-219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Burke)Advertisement★ Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo (through Sunday) Since 1974, this all-male ballet troupe, affectionately known as the Trocks, has been celebrating and satirizing the cult of ballet with a delicious blend of cheeky humor and true reverence. The pokes come from a place of love — and knowledge. Its 40th anniversary Joyce season spans a spectrum of dance history, including excerpts from “La Naiade et Le Pecheur,” which dates to the mid-19th century, and smart parodies of classics, like “Swan Lake” and “Don Quixote.” Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Brian Schaefer)Bodytraffic (Tuesday, Thursday and Jan. 10) Of the companies breathing new life into Los Angeles’s contemporary dance scene, this repertory troupe, directed by Lillian Rose Barbeito and Tina Finkelman Berkett, is one of the most popular. The ensemble visits the Joyce Theater with three pieces: a world premiere by the Israeli choreographer Hofesh Shechter; a work combining break dancing and ballet by Victor Quijada of Montreal; and Richard Siegal’s “The New 45,” a duet to jazz classics by Oscar Peterson and Clark Terry. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Jan. 10 at 2 and 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org.

For those looking for some spice with that sugar, there’s “Nutcracker Rouge,” a baroque-burlesque take on the Christmas classic by Austin McCormick’s Company XIV. The saucy fusion of dance, theater, circus and song takes place in the company’s intimate and opulent new home in NoHo. Cocktails and coquetry abound for those 21 and older. Tuesday through Sunday at 8 p.m., XIV, 428 Lafayette Street, between Astor Place and East Fourth Street, 212-677-1444, companyxiv.com; many performances are sold out. (Schaefer)Faye Driscoll (Tuesday, and Thursday through Jan. 10) In “Thank You for Coming: Attendance,” Ms. Driscoll transforms St. Mark’s Church into a theater-in-the-round where five fearless dancers fight, frolic and pull off one of the stealthiest set-design maneuvers in recent dance history. What looks at first like a wrestling match becomes a kind of utopian ritual. This raucous, participatory piece (don’t expect to get too comfortable) receives an encore run at Danspace Project, where it had its premiere last spring. Tuesday, Thursday and next Friday at 8 p.m., Jan. 10 at 5 and 9 p.m., 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Burke)Doug Elkins Choreography, Etc. (Wednesday, next Friday and Jan. 11) In his latest work, “Hapless Bizarre,” Mr. Elkins stays true to both words in the title while displaying his characteristic craftsmanship and wit. Inspired by new vaudeville and silent comedy, with especially hapless roles for the physical comedian Mark Gindick, the piece has its New York premiere alongside the catchy “Mo(or)town/Redux,” in which Mr. Elkins interprets José Limón interpreting Shakespeare. Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., next Friday at 8 p.m., Jan. 11 at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Burke)★ Molly Lieber and Eleanor Smith (Wednesday through Jan. 12) When Ms. Lieber and Ms. Smith dance together, their connection seems telepathic. Their latest duet, “Rude World,” presented as part of Performance Space 122’s Coil festival, is the third in a triptych exploring the intimacy of collaboration, the results of unfettered improvisation and meticulous paring down. Wednesday at 6 p.m., Thursday and Jan. 10 at 5 p.m., next Friday at 7 p.m., Jan. 11 at 3 p.m., Jan. 12 at 4 p.m., Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, 866-811-4111, chocolatefactorytheater.org. (Burke)★ Live Artery (Thursday through Jan. 11) If you missed some of the best dance productions of 2014, now is the time to catch up. This series at New York Live Arts, which coincides with the citywide Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference, reprises several gems, including Beth Gill’s starkly luminous “New Work for the Desert” (Thursday at 7:30 p.m.) and John Jasperse’s fickle, densely packed “Within Between” (Jan. 10 at 5 p.m.). Also on deck are previews of new works by Rashaun Mitchell and Okwui Okpokwasili. At various times, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org. (Burke)★ New York City Ballet (Friday and Saturday) “George Balanchine’s the Nutcracker” had its premiere in 1954, and has returned to City Ballet’s repertory every year since. At 60, the holiday classic is still working its charm on balletgoers of all ages. While the principals are sure to be divine, the real stars are the two casts of 50 children from the School of American Ballet. At 2 and 8 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-496-0600, nycballet.com.
