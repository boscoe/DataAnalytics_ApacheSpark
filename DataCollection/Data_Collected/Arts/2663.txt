Rosie O’Donnell is leaving ABC’s “The View” at the end of the week to focus on her health and family. Cindi Berger, Ms. O’Donnell’s publicist, told the The New York Post’s Page Six that the 52-year-old comedian and actress wanted to spend more time with her five children after separating from her second wife, Michelle Rounds, in November. “Rosie has teens and an infant at home that need her attention,” Ms. Berger said. “This has been a very stressful situation. She is putting her personal health and family first.” Ms. O’Donnell won’t be walking out of the spotlight completely. “Rosie O’Donnell: A Heartfelt Stand Up,” her HBO Documentary special about cardiac health (she suffered a heart attack in 2012), premieres Feb. 14. And a Tweet posted on “The View” Twitter account said Ms. O’Donnell would “be back often with her unique point of view and updates on her work and family.”A version of this brief appears in print on February 9, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: O’Donnell Saying Goodbye to ‘The View’.
