The Kit Kat Klub closed up shop with a bang last week, as Sienna Miller led “Cabaret” to a strong finish in its run at Studio 54.The Roundabout Theater Company revival brought in $936,000 in its final week, with an average ticket price of $133, according to the Broadway League. Ms. Miller was the third actress (after Michelle Williams and Emma Stone) to play Sally Bowles in this production opposite Alan Cumming, who reprised his Tony-winning role as the Emcee for the 388-performance run.Even as “Cabaret” went dark, a flurry of new shows began performances as producers rushed to open before April 23, the deadline to qualify for this year’s Tony Awards. Twelve shows are now in previews, and only a few seem to have captured the public imagination: Broadway grosses over all were $1 million lower than during the same week last year.Two star-driven vehicles remain the standout performers among recent Broadway openings. “Fish in the Dark,” starring Larry David, and “The Audience,” starring Helen Mirren, continued to rake in money, earning more than $1 million each last week. Among the musicals now in previews, “Finding Neverland” was the best performer, while “An American in Paris” (earning $860,000) and “The King and I” ($777,000), both fondly remembered from their film versions, did well. Among plays, “Wolf Hall” is off to a particularly strong start, bringing in $887,000 with its two-part adaptation of the Hilary Mantel novels.The spring promises to be challenging for many of the shows about to open, as they struggle to win attention from  tourists, who dominate the Broadway audience. Some, like “Something Rotten!,” have been discounting deeply as they seek to build buzz; others, like “Fun Home,” are hoping strong reviews and awards will lure audiences.And some are already struggling financially. Despite strong reviews, a revival of Wendy Wasserstein’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “The Heidi Chronicles” brought in only $336,000 last week, 38 percent of the possible total.
