The realm of Disney princesses is expanding to include its first member of Latina royalty. The company announced in a blog post on Friday plans for the 2016 airing of “Elena of Avalor,” an animated series about a princess in a fairy-tale kingdom inspired by Latino cultures and folklore. The “bold, caring, funny and clever” 16-year-old Princess Elena, to be voiced by Aimee Carrero of the ABC Family series “Young & Hungry,” will be introduced next year in an episode of the Disney Junior series “Sofia the First.” The spinoff show, produced by Disney Television Animation and geared to ages 2-7, will include messages of “leadership, resilience, diversity, compassion and the importance of family and family tradition,” according to the announcement. “Our creative team has delivered a universal story with themes that authentically reflect the hopes and dreams of our diverse audience,” Nancy Kanter, executive vice president and general manager of Disney Junior Worldwide, said in a statement. Disney made history in 2009 with the announcement of its first black princess, Tiana, in “The Princess and the Frog.” But unlike that of Tiana’s and many other previous princesses’ ascents to the throne, descriptions of the “Elena of Avalor” story line seem to reflect a modern trend in the tiara-clad crew: No prince required to rule. The story begins with Princess Elena becoming trapped in a magical amulet while trying to protect her family from an evil sorceress. Decades later, Princess Sofia learns that her amulet is the one that’s holding Elena prisoner, and she sets out to return Elena to her human form. “Elena of Avalor” will be presented in 25 languages in 154 countries on Disney Junior channels and other platforms.A version of this article appears in print on 02/03/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Disney to Crown a Latina Princess.
