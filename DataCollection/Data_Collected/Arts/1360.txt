Last week’s holiday turned out to be a most bountiful one for theater producers, as Broadway enjoyed its best-attended Thanksgiving week since official record keeping began 31 years ago.More than 288,000 people sampled from 36 Broadway shows last week, according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League. But though nearly 3,500 more people enjoyed a musical or play this year than last, Thanksgiving week in 2014 grossed more at the box office despite two fewer productions — $34,121,642 compared to $33,851,352.Twelve shows surpassed more than $1 million apiece at the box office, and three of those — “The Lion King,” “Wicked” and “Aladdin” — brought in more than $2 million. “Hamilton,” Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop infused musical about the nation’s first secretary of the Treasury, grossed $1,833,886 last week, nearly $400,000 more than the week before, thanks to higher ticket prices.  The newest revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” with Danny Burstein as Tevye, brought in $1,221,716 in its first full week of previews. Another musical in previews, “School of Rock,” Andrew Lloyd Webber’s version of the 2003 movie comedy, is also off to an auspicious start, grossing $1,304,251.Plays proved a tougher sell; even the popular thriller “Misery,” starring Bruce Willis, suffered a box-office drop from the previous week, and despite outstanding reviews the revival of Arthur Miller’s “A View from the Bridge” remained largely flat.
