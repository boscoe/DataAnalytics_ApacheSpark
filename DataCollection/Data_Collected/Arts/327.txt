Hilla Becher, the German photographer who, with her husband, Bernd, meticulously documented coal mines, steel mills and other features of the industrial landscape, straddling the worlds of archival documentation and conceptual art, died on Saturday in Düsseldorf. She was 81.The cause was a stroke, her publisher, Schirmer/Mosel Verlag, said.Over nearly five decades, the Bechers — Bernd died in 2007 at 75 — developed a signature technique. Using an 8-by-10 large-format camera, they shot factory plants, water towers, blast furnaces, gas tanks, grain solos, lime kilns and other utilitarian structures in overcast weather.Each photograph was a solo portrait — from which humans were, for the most part, absent.They then developed their prints by hand and arrayed them for display, often in geometric grids.Ordered, analytical, rigorous and unsentimental, the images were a deadpan chronicle of the built landscape, hinting at the environmental and social consequences of extracting natural resources. The Bechers’ photos illustrated the effects of industrialization, as plants and factories were shuttered, rendering them obsolete, presumably like those workers who had once toiled inside.AdvertisementGabriele Conrath-Scholl, the director of Die Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kultur, a gallery in Cologne that exhibited and archived the couple’s work, described them as outsiders who deeply unsettled the art world with a seminal catalog, “Anonymous Sculptures: A Typology of Technical Buildings,” in 1970.

It was followed by shows, organized by the gallerist Ileana Sonnabend, in Paris and New York.Advertisement“People were astonished that this could be art,” Ms. Conrath-Scholl said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.The Bechers’ photographic grids influenced the Minimalist and Conceptual art schools as well as artists like Ed Ruscha and Douglas Huebler, who produced images according to systematic rules.Hilla and Bernd Becher, who were themselves influenced by August Sander’s photographs of industrial Germany between the two world wars, referred to their artistic orientation as the New Objectivity.Some critics found the images too unsparing and reductive. Assessing “Europe in the Seventies: Aspects of Recent Art,” a 1977 show at the Art Institute of Chicago, the critic Hilton Kramer, writing in The New York Times, described the Bechers’ images of “preparation plants,” which are used to process coal, salt and other minerals.“From these photographic sets we are expected, I gather, to glean some intelligence about process and structure,” he wrote. “The pictures themselves are not intended to exert an aesthetic appeal, and in fact they have no aesthetic appeal. They look like the sort of pictures one sees in a real estate office.”The images were not merely documentation. The Bechers developed what they called typologies: sets of 9, 12 or 15 images of structures of the same type and construction, comparing and contrasting their shared features, establishing a visual grammar akin to the biological illustrations to which Hilla Becher compared their process.AdvertisementIn time, most of the buildings the Bechers documented were abandoned or demolished. “Both artists regarded this situation with a heavy heart,” Ms. Conrath-Scholl said, “but as an irrefutable fact: Photography always allows us to look back, it transports the present to another point in time — and there is no reason to grieve or wax sentimental about it.”Hilla Wobeser was born on Sept. 2, 1934, in Potsdam. She began taking pictures as an adolescent, and then trained in the studio of the photographer Walter Eichgrün, photographing local structures like the Prussian palace Sanssouci.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In 1957, while working at an advertising agency in Düsseldorf, she met Bernhard Becher, known as Bernd, an art student at the Düsseldorf Art Academy, which she was then attending. Their collaboration began while they were still in school, in 1959, in the industrial Siegerland area, where Bernd was raised, and the Ruhr. They married in 1961.Traveling in a Volkswagen, they photographed sites all over Germany, and also in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France; they also took photos in Britain and the United States. In time, they received many accolades, and they taught a generation of German photographers, including Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, Thomas Ruff and Thomas Struth.Ms. Becher is survived by a son, Max, also an artist and photographer, and two grandchildren.“What we were interested in were the visual and the sculptural aspects of the structures,” Ms. Becher once said. “And because these types of purpose-built structures can’t be preserved forever, we wanted to at least hold them fast in pictures, and so we began to collect them. Photography basically means nothing more than collecting.”A version of this article appears in print on October 15, 2015, on Page B19 of the New York edition with the headline: Hilla Becher, German Photographer of Industrial Scenery, Is Dead at 81.
