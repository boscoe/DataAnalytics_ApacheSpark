The music festival Primavera Sound has announced its lineup for its 2015 event in Barcelona, with acts by the Strokes, the Black Keys, Interpol, Belle & Sebastian and Damien Rice. The 15th edition will run from May 28 to 30.Primavera Sound has become one of the top tickets of the European festival season, with better chances of warm-weather partying than British festivals like Glastonbury can generally offer, and with the beaches and night life of Barcelona giving it an edge over other urban European festivals like Rock en Seine in Paris.Highlights of the Spanish event this year will include concerts by Patti Smith, who is set to perform her landmark 1975 album “Horses” in its entirety, and acoustic and “spoken word” events, organizers of the festival announced.The festival will also feature a series of acts by female bands — many associated with the 1990s riot grrrl movement — that “found clear reference” in Ms. Smith’s work, the organizers said. These include Kathleen Hanna and her new band, the Julie Ruin; Babes in Toyland; Mary Timony with Ex Hex; and Sleater-Kinney, which released its first album in 10 years this month.As in previous editions, the festival’s musical approach is international and eclectic: Alongside mainstream names, its sounds this year include Flamenco from the Spanish singer Rocío Márquez; experimental electronica from the pioneering German musician Hans-Joachim Roedelius; and Afrobeats from the Nigerian drummer and composer Tony Allen.Ticket prices for the full three-day festival increase as the event approaches: through Feb. 3, tickets are 175 euros, or about $202, each; from Feb. 4 to May 4, they will sell for €185; and from May 5 to the start of the festival, they will be available for €195. With an ear seemingly attuned to Europe’s economic woes, the festival also offers the option, through March, of paying for tickets in installments.
