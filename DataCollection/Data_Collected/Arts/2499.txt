The New York Philharmonic will mark the 50th anniversary of its free parks concerts this June with Alan Gilbert leading the orchestra in a program of American music on Central Park’s Great Lawn featuring the violinist Joshua Bell performing a suite from “West Side Story.”That opening concert, on June 17, will be followed by free concerts throughout the city. Charles Dutoit will conduct the Philharmonic in Central Park and Prospect Park in Brooklyn in a program that will include Saint-Saëns’s Violin Concerto No. 3, with Renaud Capuçon as soloist; Stravinsky’s “Petrushka” and Ravel’s “La Valse.” And Mr. Gilbert will lead the orchestra in American music in Cunningham Park in Queens and Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. The time and place of a free indoor concert on Staten Island featuring musicians from the Philharmonic will be announced later. The concerts will run from June 17 through June 23. It will be the ninth year they are presented by Didi and Oscar S. Schafer. Mr. Schafer is the Philharmonic’s new chairman of the board.The Philharmonic estimates that 14 million people have attended its parks concerts since the first one was held on Aug. 10, 1965. Over the years the concerts have featured musicians including Benny Goodman, who played Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto; Aaron Copland, who performed his own Piano Concerto; and Marian Anderson, who narrated Copland’s “A Lincoln Portrait.”This year the Philharmonic plans to invite people to share photographs, films, and personal recollections of the parks concerts online at Crowdsourcing Memories: 50 Years of the Philharmonic in New York City’s Parks, an online portal that will collect material to be stored in the orchestra’s archives. Information on the initiative will be posted at nyphil.org/parks50.A version of this article appears in print on 02/04/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Philharmonic Schedules Concerts in the Parks.
