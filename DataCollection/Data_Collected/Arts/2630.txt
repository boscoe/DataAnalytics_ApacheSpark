The early-music specialist Jane Glover conducted a Met-Juilliard “Armide” in 2012, and she returns with semi-staged performances of “Iphigénie en Aulide” on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The cast includes Yunpeng Wang, Liv Redpath, Ying Fang, Andrew Stenson, Takaoki Onishi and Brandon Cedel. (8 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday, and 2 p.m. Saturday, Peter Jay Sharp Theater, Lincoln Center, 212-769-7406, juilliard.edu.) On Monday, the brilliant keyboard performer Richard Egarr plays Bach and Handel at Carnegie Hall. (7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, carnegiehall.org.) The same night, the New York Philharmonic’s Contact! series offers new music from Israel jointly presented by the 92nd Street Y, including chamber pieces by Josef Bardanashvili, Avner Dorman, Yotam Haber and Shulamit Ran.
