Angelina Jolie’s film “Unbroken,” which opened in the United States in December 2014, will be seen in Japan next February, some 14 months after Japanese nationalists leveled accusations of racism and historical inaccuracy against the movie and called for Ms. Jolie to be banned from visiting the country. The announcement was made Thursday, the opening day of the Tokyo International Film Festival.“Unbroken” was based on a 2010 book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand, and told the harrowing World War II story of an American Air Force pilot and former Olympic runner, Louis Zamperini, who survived 47 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean after his plane crashed, before being taken prisoner by the Japanese. His two years in Japanese prisoner of war camps, where he was starved and tortured by a sadistic guard, Mutsuhiro Watanabe, forms the central part of the film.Reports of calls for boycotts of the film surfaced in Japan even before the worldwide release of the movie, and were followed by campaigns on social media, challenging the film’s account of events. In an interview last December Hiromichi Moteki, secretary general of the Society for the Dissemination of Historical Fact, a nationalist pressure group, told the British newspaper The Telegraph that the movie was “pure fabrication.”In an interview with The New York Times soon after the film’s release, Ms. Jolie said, “Louie’s story comes with a harsh reality, but Watanabe does not represent Japan.”The distributors Bitters End will manage the release of “Unbroken,” initially scheduled for just one cinema, the Theater Image Forum, in Tokyo’s Shibuya district.A version of this article appears in print on 10/24/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Jolieu2019s u2018Unbrokenu2019 To Be Screened in Japan.
