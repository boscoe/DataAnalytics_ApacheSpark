The 26-year-old rapper Big Sean is a protégé of Kanye West, and gets plenty of paparazzi attention as the boyfriend of the pop starlet Ariana Grande. Now he has another claim to fame: a No. 1 album.Big Sean’s new album, “Dark Sky Paradise” (G.O.O.D./Def Jam), opened at the top of Billboard’s latest chart, with 139,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen Music. By album sales alone, “Dark Sky” barely beat the next-best seller, Kid Rock’s “First Kiss” (Warner Bros.), which opened at No. 2 with 137,000 copies sold. But recent changes to Billboard’s chart rules widened Big Sean’s lead.First, “Dark Sky” was far more popular on streaming services like Spotify, with songs getting 17 million plays in the United States; “First Kiss,” on the other hand, had only 580,000 streams. Billboard’s rankings also reflect how many individual tracks have been downloaded from an album, and Big Sean had the advantage there, too, with 218,000 tracks, versus just 85,000 for Kid Rock.In Billboard’s new rules, 1,500 streams or 10 track downloads are each equivalent to the sale of one complete album. So by that formula, “Dark Sky Paradise” ended up with 173,000 “album equivalent units” and “First Kiss” had 146,000.As a sign of just how many streams it takes to make a difference on the new chart, take a look at Drake’s latest album, “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” (Cash Money/Republic). The album continues to be a huge success online, this week racking up 34.6 million streams. But that was not nearly enough to push the album toward a higher position on the chart. With 59,000 full album sales, “It You’re Reading This” fell two spots this week to No. 4, just behind the “Fifty Shades of Grey” soundtrack (Republic Records), which holds at No. 3 with 67,000 sales and 13.3 million streams.Also this week, Taylor Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine) falls one to No. 5 in its 18th week on the chart, and Imagine Dragons’s “Smoke & Mirrors” (KIDinaKORNER/Interscope), last week’s No. 1, fell eight spots to No. 9.A version of this article appears in print on 03/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Big Sean Opens at No. 1.
