CBS even had a “soft kitty” contest, asking fans to upload videos of themselves singing the song, according to the lawsuit.“The Soft Kitty Lyrics are among the best-known and most popular aspects of The Big Bang Theory,” the lawsuit says. “They have become a signature and emblematic feature of the show and a central part of the show’s promotion.”Ms. Newlin, who was born in Indiana, died in 2004, according to the lawsuit. She studied and taught in New York before settling in Alstead, N.H., where she worked as a nursery school teacher for 35 years. Throughout her life, she wrote several children’s books and poems that were published.One of the daughters discovered the show’s use of the lyrics in 2014 while researching her mother’s life for an article she was writing.Advertisement
