The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is looking into gender discrimination in Hollywood and last week sent letters to women directors asking them to share details of roadblocks they have encountered in their careers, according to The Los Angeles Times.  The agency is responding to  requests the American Civil Liberties Union made to state and federal governmental bodies in May, asking them to investigate major studios, networks and talent agencies for overwhelmingly hiring men.  Citing dismal statistics about representation of women behind the camera – just 4 percent of top-grossing movies were directed by women over the last 12 years – the A.C.L.U. said women were purposefully excluded from being recruited and hired by what remains an old boys’ club in Hollywood, and that  was a violation of civil rights. “I’m so glad we’re finally attacking this,”  Catherine Hardwicke, the director of the coming film “Miss You Already,” told The Times. She was not among those who received letters. In a statement, the employment commission said it was barred by law from confirming or denying that an investigation was underway. The agency is tasked with enforcing, among other laws, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars employment discrimination based on sex, race, color, national origin or religion.
