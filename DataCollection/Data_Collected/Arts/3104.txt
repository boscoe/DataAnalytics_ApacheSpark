The British playwrights Simon Stephens and Nick Payne are likely competitors in June for the Tony Award for best play, given the critical acclaim and popularity of their current Broadway shows, “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” (Mr. Stephens) and “Constellations” (Mr. Payne). And now, just as the theoretical-minded “Constellations” is winding down its run at Manhattan Theater Club this month, the club announced on Tuesday that it will produce another new play this spring that has echoes of quantum mechanics – this one by Mr. Stephens. “Heisenberg,” about the spark lit when a woman kisses a much older man at a London train station, will star the Tony winner Mary-Louise Parker (“Proof,” Showtime’s “Weeds”) and Kenneth Welsh (“The Day After Tomorrow”) and be directed by Mark Brokaw (“The Lyons”). The six-week run of the play will begin May 19 at one of the club’s Off Broadway spaces, the Studio at Stage II. Mr. Stephens wrote “Heisenberg” on a commission from the club. Lest you assume that the club is putting “Heisenberg” into contention against “Constellations” for Tony Award glory, “Heisenberg” will be ineligible for Tonys because it is not a Broadway production.
