The Bolshoi Ballet is coming to a movie theater near you. Well, in all likelihood: the 2015-16 season of “Bolshoi Ballet in Cinema,” presented by Pathé Live and BY Experience, will show seven full-length ballets — three prerecorded (so the casts are known) and four shown live or on the day of performance — in some 450 spots across the United States and Canada. Some of the Bolshoi’s signature pieces are on offer: Yuri Grigorovich’s “Spartacus” (March 13, with Mikhail Lobukhin, Svetlana Zakharova and Vladislav Lantratov) and Alexei Fadeyechev’s production of “Don Quixote” (April 10). But there are also pieces newly acquired by, or created for, the Bolshoi, like John Neumeier’s “The Lady of the Camellias” (Dec. 6) and Jean-Christophe Maillot’s recent “The Taming of the Shrew” (Jan. 24). Also on offer are Giselle (Oct. 11), Balanchine’s “Jewels” (on Nov. 15, with Olga Smirnova and Semyon Chudin in the “Diamonds” section) and Grigorovich’s “The Nutcracker” (Denis Rodkin and Anna Nikulina on Dec. 20). And let us hope that the multilingual company spokeswoman, Katya Novikova, will remain the skillful host of the backstage chats and presentation. Tickets go on sale on June 19.
