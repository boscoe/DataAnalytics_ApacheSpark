For the last two weeks, the music charts have been led by albums that rose with up-to-the-minute technology: Shawn Mendes went to No. 1 after emerging on Vine, the six-second-video app, and the week before that the “Furious 7” soundtrack reached the top with help from Spotify and Shazam.By comparison, this week’s chart-topper, the band Alabama Shakes, had a more old-fashioned climb, marked by constant touring and enthusiastic reviews. The band’s second album, “Sound & Color” (ATO), opened at No. 1 on Billboard’s chart with 91,000 sales and 3.6 million streams, according to Nielsen Music. (Not that Alabama Shakes is allergic to the new ways of the music business, however: last summer, in the kind of corporate sponsorship that has become increasingly common, the group headlined a tour organized by Mercedes-Benz.)Also this week, the “Furious 7” soundtrack, released by Atlantic, holds at No. 2, with only 18,000 sales but a very healthy 11.6 million streams. “Love Story” (Slumerican/Shady/Interscope), the new album by the rapper Yelawolf, opens at No. 3; Drake’s “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” (Cash Money/Republic) is No. 4; and the “Fifty Shades of Grey” soundtrack (Republic) is No. 5.And all that newfangled technology — how well does it work? In the case of Mr. Mendes, a 16-year-old high school student from Canada, Vine helped make him famous and his album, “Handwritten” (Island), opened at No. 1, but in its second week the album fell to No. 17, with an 83 percent drop in its combined sales and streaming numbers.A version of this article appears in print on 04/30/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Alabama Shakes No. 1.
