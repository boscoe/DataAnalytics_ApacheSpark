The Château de Versailles has mounted its own response to the attack on Charlie Hebdo, placing a rarely seen portrait of Voltaire front and center in the main tourist circuit inside the palace.The work, painted around 1724 by Nicolas de Largillière, is accompanied by a quote from the French philosopher transcribed in French and English: “What is Tolerance? It is the consequence of humanity.” Alongside the quotation is a dedication, also in both languages:  “homage to the victims of the attacks of January 7, 8 and 9, 2015.”The installation was conceived by Catherine Pégard, the palace’s president. Ms. Pégard explained in a telephone conversation in French that the project was a way to honor the victims, “because at Versailles we’re in a certain sense an emblem of ‘l’esprit français,” she said, referring to the enlightenment thinkers on view in the museum’s collection and on its website. “It’s also the liberty to say things, the liberty to think, the liberty to express oneself. And all these authors express this humanity.”  She added: “The homage that Versailles is showing is a ‘just’ homage. Just in the exact sense. Just in the sense of the continuity of French history.’’In addition to the painting, the museum posted a series of portraits of leaders of the French Enlightenment on its website, titling the post “Words of Freedom in the Collections of the Palace.” The page, which appears in French and English,  includes another quote by Voltaire: “Let us support the freedom of the press. It is the grounds of all other freedoms, that by which we are mutually enlightened.” Images include those of Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Molière. Ms. Pégard said that she has not yet decided when she will remove the dedication.
