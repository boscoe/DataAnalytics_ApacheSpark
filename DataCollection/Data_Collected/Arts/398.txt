LONDON:   There were few signs of demand cooling at the first of Frieze Week’s nine live auctions here of postwar and contemporary art.On Wednesday night, Phillips held an auction of 36 contemporary works that completely sold out, raising 31.5 million pounds with fees, about $48 million, in line with estimates.In fact, two thirds of the material was always going to sell, thanks to financial guarantees.But most of the lots attracted more than one bid, either on a telephone or from the crowd of more than 300 crammed into the salesroom.The top lot encapsulated why the rich want to buy blue-chip contemporary art. A loopy 2006 abstract “Untitled” by Cy Twombly had been bought at auction by Wednesday’s seller for $9 million in November 2011.AdvertisementAt Phillips, it sold to a lone telephone bidder for a hammer price of £7 million, plus £922,500 in fees, adding up to the equivalent of about $12 million.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
