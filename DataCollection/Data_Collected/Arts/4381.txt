The New World Symphony, the orchestral academy founded by Michael Tilson Thomas to train graduates of top music programs, has long been known for innovative educational programs. Its newest venture, unveiled Monday evening in New York, is aimed more at music lovers than players: it is an ambitious website dedicated to the music of John Cage. The free website, called “Making the Right Choices: A John Cage Celebration,” is built around videos of a dozen Cage works performed by the New World Symphony during a festival it held in 2013 at its Frank Gehry-designed home, the New World Center in Miami Beach, commemorating the centenary of his birth. The website augments those performances with interviews, rehearsal videos and essays that provide insight into Cage’s work.  “The diversity of his music inspired us to use all the capabilities of our ensemble and of our building to present his works in installations designed for them,” Mr. Thomas said in a statement. “The videos on the website are, in some cases, reportage of those installations.  In other cases they are new video works based on the experiences of the live performances.”The website, which was funded in part by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, was unveiled Monday evening at an event at Lincoln Center. The New World Symphony is in New York for a concert Tuesday at Carnegie Hall with the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter.
