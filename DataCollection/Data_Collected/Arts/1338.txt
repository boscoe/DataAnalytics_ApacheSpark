Your laptop now counts as Off Broadway. On Dec. 10, the musical “Daddy Long Legs” will be streamed live online for free from the Davenport Theater.Musical “Daddy Long Legs” Will Stream Live Online“Daddy Long Legs” will be the first off-Broadway production to be streamed live online.The show is partnering with Live Stream for what they claim is the first Broadway or Off Broadway performance to be broadcast live on the Internet. “I’m worried about the theater industry falling behind,” Ken Davenport, one of the show’s producers, said in a phone interview. “The streaming of our content through digital channels is the most important and powerful audience development tool that we’re not using.”Currently, union rules make it difficult for productions to be filmed. “Daddy Long Legs” seemed ideal for a streaming test run, Mr. Davenport said, because of its small cast and material — as well as the fact that he controls the Davenport Theater, named after his great-grandfather. “We can get up close and personal on this very beautiful and intimate relationship between these two people,” Mr. Davenport said.“Daddy Long Legs” was written and directed by John Caird with music and lyrics by Paul Gordon, and stars Megan McGinnis and Adam Halpin. In The New York Times review, Alexis Soloski described “Daddy Long Legs” as “sweet, beautifully sung and only occasionally unsettling.”The stream will air on DaddyLongLegsMusical.com/Livestream at 8 p.m.
