The Boston Lyric Opera is looking for a new home: the company announced Friday night that it would leave the Shubert Theatre at Citi Performing Arts Center, where it has performed for nearly two decades, for a yet-to-be-determined new space next fall.Esther Nelson, the company’s general and artistic director, said in a statement that the decision to leave the Shubert, a 1,500 seat theater, was “the right choice for our continued fiscal and artistic success.” The Boston Globe wrote that the decision should spur the city, which has an otherwise thriving classical music scene, to finally build a proper opera house. “Now more than ever, finding or building such a home should become a priority for opera fans, city government, and the philanthropic community,” Jeremy Eichler wrote in The Globe. “It should also become a simple matter of civic self-respect for a city that likes to feel proud of its performing arts scene — in most cases, deservedly so.”Ms. Nelson said that the company planned to announce a location for its 2016-17 season soon.A version of this article appears in print on 10/12/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Boston Lyric Opera Looks for a New Home.
