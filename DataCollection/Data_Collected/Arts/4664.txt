No, “Hamilton” will not win a Tony this year — it will arrive on Broadway too late. Instead, it’s sweeping up just about everything else it’s eligible for, including the Lucille Lortel Awards, which honor Off Broadway works and were announced on Sunday. “Hamilton” took home 10 awards, including for outstanding musical, director (Thomas Kail), lead actor in a musical (Lin-Manuel Miranda), and lead actress in a musical (Phillipa Soo). “Hamilton,” which just wrapped up its run at the Public Theater, was nominated for 12 awards, and failed to take home two only because those nominated actors lost to their cast mates. Meanwhile, “Between Riverside and Crazy” nabbed three awards, including for outstanding play and lead actor in a play (Stephen McKinley Henderson). Tonya Pinkins won for her lead role in “Rasheeda Speaking,” and “Into the Woods” won for outstanding revival.Hamilton won three more awards from the Outer Critics Circle, which also announced its annual awards on Sunday. The Outer Critics Circle, an organization of writers and media members covering New York theater, gave five awards to “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” including outstanding new play, and three to “An American in Paris,” including for new musical.
