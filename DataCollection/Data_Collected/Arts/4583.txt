The firm founded by the Pritzker Prize-winning architect I.M. Pei committed “architectural malpractice” in submitting “inherently flawed and materially defective” designs for the expansion of Cornell University’s Johnson Museum of Art, the school has charged in a lawsuit.Cornell alleges that it has experienced “at least” $1.1 million in damages as a result of designs by the firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners that led to structural deficiencies, roof cavities, ceiling cracks and other flaws.The news of the Supreme Court suit, filed last month in Tompkins County, was reported by the Ithaca Voice on Wednesday.Mr. Pei designed the original museum in 1968, and the firm, from which he retired in 1990, was hired by the university in 2006 to build the addition. The new wing was completed in 2011, though some construction continued into 2012.Neither the university nor the firm would comment because of the pending litigation.The Pei firm’s projects include the Louvre Pyramid in Paris, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston and the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar.A version of this article appears in print on 05/08/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Cornell Accuses Pei Firm of Defective Designs.
