It is an established fact that women are underrepresented in cinema, particularly among the ranks of directors. In the United States, women direct from 5 to 10 percent of feature films, according to statistics compiled by the entertainment website Indiewire. Last month, the European Women’s Audiovisual Network released statistics it had collected showing that the situation was only slightly better in Europe, where 16 percent of the movies released from 2003 to 2012 were directed by women.Before one assumes that this gender imbalance is one of those regrettably intractable problems, tied to social forces that take decades to alter, consider the case of Sweden.The government-backed Swedish Film Institute helps fund most of the country’s cinematic output. Between 2000 and 2012, these films were essentially dominated by men, who in a given year typically directed between 70 and 90 percent of all productions. Those statistics began to change quite rapidly after the 2011 appointment of Anna Serner as chief executive of the Institute. She called the gender imbalance in Swedish cinema a “catastrophe” and set an ambitious target that half the films supported by the Institute should be made by women. Last year, the Institute achieved gender parity among directors for the first time and is on track to replicate its success, or come close, in 2015.
            The Swedish Film Institute contributes funding to the majority of films made in Sweden. In 2014, women made up half of all directors for those films, from below a quarter ten years ago.

And so they started finding them.”AdvertisementThe Swedish example suggests that setting similar benchmarks might help improve the statistics in other countries.But as much as the Swedish Film Institute’s success has made it a case study in how to improve gender diversity in film, it has also resulted in backlash from some male directors in Sweden who, Ms. Serner said, feel “abandoned,” claiming that the new guidelines put the gender of the filmmaker ahead of the merits of a film.AdvertisementMs. Serner said that was not the case. She said that between 2000 and 2015, women outperformed men in the country’s Guldbagge Awards, the Swedish Oscars, even though they directed far fewer films. “I don’t think women are more competent or more talented at being directors than men,” she said. “I just think that we’ve been longing for the female gaze, the female perspective. Right now it’s unique, which is a problem. Eventually, it should all balance out.”A version of this article appears in print on October 8, 2015, in The International New York Times.
