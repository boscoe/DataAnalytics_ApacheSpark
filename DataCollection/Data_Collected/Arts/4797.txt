A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah  (Friday and Saturday) The declarative mode comes easily to the trumpeter formerly known as Christian Scott, who was born and raised in New Orleans but recently settled in Harlem. His dynamic current band features Braxton Cook on alto saxophone, Elena Pinderhughes on flute, and Corey Fonville and Joe Dyson on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com. (Nate Chinen)Bruce Barth Quintet  (Friday through Sunday) The pianist and composer Bruce Barth prefers subtlety and fluency to any kind of flash. That, among other things, makes him a good match for his partners in this weekend run: the trumpeter Terell Stafford, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer Montez Coleman. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Peter Bernstein Quartet  (Tuesday through May 24) The astute hard-bop guitarist Peter Bernstein can always be trusted in a quartet setting, and this one has a fine lineup: the pianist Gerald Clayton, the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.

More information is at cbjcjazz.org. (Chinen)Bill Charlap Trio  (Tuesday through May 24, and May 26 through 31) The pianist Bill Charlap has become a trusted docent of the American Songbook through his decade-long programming role at the 92nd Street Y. But his interaction with jazz standards finds no clearer or more illuminating results than in this spruce trio, with Peter Washington on bass and Kenny Washington (they are not related) on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Freddy Cole Quartet, With Houston Person  (Friday and Saturday) On “Singing the Blues,” the energetic album he released last year, the singer and pianist Freddy Cole turns toward a specific corner of his musical heritage — one that puts him in just the right mind-set to feature the tenor saxophonist Houston Person, a musician of comparable gallantry. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ Michael Formanek’s Resonator  (Saturday) Mr. Formanek, a bassist and composer drawn to scintillating frictions, put together this new ensemble with dynamic counterpoint in mind. Its personnel consists of musicians intrepid with texture and line: the alto saxophonist Loren Stillman, the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Chris Speed, the pianist Angelica Sanchez and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Don Friedman 80th-Birthday Celebration  (Saturday) The pianist Don Friedman, who turned 80 earlier this month, has a stylistic history that runs from very traditional to slightly left of center, with a similarly kaleidoscopic range of partners. For this celebratory one-nighter, he leads a trio with the bassist Martin Wind and the drummer Matt Wilson. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Tim Hagans Quartet  (Friday) The trumpeter Tim Hagans is about equally attracted to slashing intensity and brooding melancholy, and he’ll probably visit both during this engagement with the pianist Luis Perdomo, the bassist Rufus Reid and the drummer Joe Hertenstein. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)★ Fred Hersch Duo Invitation Series  (Tuesday through May 23) Mr. Hersch, a sophisticated and abidingly melodic pianist, has made a tradition of engaging in musical tête-à-têtes at Jazz Standard, and this edition of his series looks especially promising. He opens on Tuesday with Brad Mehldau, his most celebrated former piano student; on Wednesday, he connects with the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón. On Thursday, his guest is Kate McGarry, one of the many singers in his circle. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)★ Dave Holland & Prism  (Tuesday through May 24) As on a recent album with the same title, the bassist-bandleader Dave Holland digs back into knockabout jazz-funk mode with Prism, a road-tested band featuring a famous old colleague, the guitarist Kevin Eubanks, along with the brilliant pianist Craig Taborn and the indomitable drummer Eric Harland. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)The Horns Band  (Thursday) The Horns Band, which released its self-titled debut album last summer, is the chief expressive outlet for the bassist Matt Pavolka, with Kirk Knuffke on cornet, Loren Stillman on alto saxophone, Jacob Garchik on trombone and Mark Ferber on drums. At 9 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Ethan Iverson and Ron Carter  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Iverson, the pianist in the Bad Plus and a jazz scholar of scrupulous independence, has performed once before at the intimate room Mezzrow with Mr. Carter, the august bassist-composer. It went well enough to facilitate this return, which should involve similar collegial strolls through fare like “Lover Man.” From 9 p.m. to midnight, 163 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. (Chinen)★ Guillermo Klein y Los Guachos  (Through Sunday) Last year, the pianist-composer-bandleader Guillermo Klein released an evocative album, “Live at the Village Vanguard,” made during a recent club engagement with the commanding Argentine singer-songwriter Liliana Herrero. Returning to the same room without a guest vocalist, Mr. Klein explores a mix of rhythmic permutation and folkloric candor with his flagship state-of-the-art band. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Lage Lund 4  (Friday) Lage Lund is a guitarist who balances his abundant proficiency with an aesthetic of gleaming calm. Drawing partly from his assured most recent album, “Idlewild,” he leads a quartet with Gerald Clayton on piano, Matt Brewer on bass and Craig Weinrib on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Ibrahim Maalouf: ‘Kalthoum’  (Friday and May 25) Born in Beirut but raised in Paris, Ibrahim Maalouf has in some ways carried the mantle of his father, Nassim: Both have made a specialty of playing Arabic music on the four-valve quarter-tone trumpet, with classical precision. For these concerts, the younger Mr. Maalouf will interpret the music of the great Arabic singer Oum Kalthoum, with a band that includes the saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Frank Woeste and the drummer Clarence Penn. Friday at 7 p.m., Lycée Français de New York, 505 East 75th Street, Manhattan, lfny.org; also on May 25 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Mike Moreno Quartet  (Friday) A guitarist-composer with a knack for mystery and euphony, Mike Moreno leads a band with several like-minded souls: the pianist Aaron Parks, the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Adam Cruz. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Eddie Palmieri’s Latin Jazz Septet  (Saturday) Eddie Palmieri, a tirelessly charismatic pianist, one of the great bandleaders in salsa and a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, leads one of his regular ensembles, stocked with players like the trumpeter Jonathan Powell, the alto saxophonist Louis Fouché and the conguero Little Johnny Rivero. At 8 p.m., Walt Whitman Theater at Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, 718-951-4500, brooklyncenter.org. (Chinen)John Patitucci  (Friday and Saturday) A bassist whose purview has included funk-fusion as well as the most aerodynamic modern jazz, Mr. Patitucci has a new album, “Brooklyn,” that draws on many of his interests. He celebrates its release with a band featuring the astute guitarists Steve Cardenas and Adam Rogers, and the drummer Brian Blade, Mr. Patitucci’s rhythm mate in the Wayne Shorter Quartet. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)Odean Pope Saxophone Choir, With James Carter  (through Sunday) Led by Mr. Pope, a tenor saxophonist and composer from Philadelphia, this band includes enough saxophonists to field a baseball team and marshals their sound in powerful gusts. As on a semi-recent album, “Odean’s List,” this run features yet another saxophonist as a guest soloist: Mr. Carter, a longtime admirer and fellow traveler of the band’s. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ Wayne Shorter Festival  (Friday through Sunday) A few years ago, the eminent saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter made a rare and regal appearance at Jazz at Lincoln Center, with his quartet. He’s now at the Rose Theater (through Saturday) as a guest of honor with the organizations’s house orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis. Meanwhile, on Friday and Saturday in the Appel Room, the tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and the trumpeter Dave Douglas lead their Shorter-inspired Sound Prints band, which recently released its debut album on Blue Note; and in Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola through Sunday, the bassist Russell Hall spearheads “The Music of Wayne Shorter: The Early Years,” with a cohort that includes the saxophonists Tivon Pennicott and Stacy Dillard. At Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)★ Esperanza Spalding Presents: Emily’s D+Evolution  (Friday) To call Ms. Spalding the most talked-about jazz musician in a generation seems almost like an understatement, and beside the point: She’s a phenomenon in human form, unbound by strictures of style. Her new album and tour were inspired by experimental theater, performance art and other bohemian pursuits, and if it seems to nudge her further from jazz proper and toward the zone of someone like Cold Specks or FKA Twigs, Ms. Spalding has no problem with that. At 7:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, 212-505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com. (Chinen)‘Sweet and Lowdown’ Reunion  (Tuesday) The final spring concert of the Sidney Bechet Society will engage in two separate layers of jazz reminiscence — for the 1930s music of Django Reinhardt, and for its repertory re-enactment on “Sweet and Lowdown,” the 1999 Woody Allen film. Most of the musicians from the soundtrack will appear, notably the guitarists Howard Alden and Bucky Pizzarelli, the trumpeter Byron Stripling and the clarinetist Ken Peplowski. At 7:15 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Chinen)Ben Van Gelder  (Saturday) Mr. Van Gelder, a conscientious young alto saxophonist originally from the Netherlands, has recently been composing for chamberlike midsize ensembles. He pares down just slightly here, leading a group with Pete Rende on keyboards, Alon Albagli on guitar, Matt Brewer on bass and Craig Weinrib on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Brandee Younger’s Jazz Harp Quartet  (Sunday) Ms. Younger is a harpist who has explored the spiritual side of her instrument’s legacy, as well as its improvisational potential. Her quartet includes Chelsea Baratz on tenor saxophone, Rashaan Carter on bass and E.J. Strickland on drums. At 5:30, 7, and 8:30 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com. (Chinen)Advertisement
