After having played Queen Elizabeth II on both stage and screen, Helen Mirren told BBC Radio 4 that she had not been asked to reprise the role in a coming Netflix series.“We must all move on and me most of all,” Ms. Mirren said in an interview. “They’ll find many wonderful actresses and they’ll have a grand time.”Last fall Netflix announced a new 10-episode series, “The Crown,” from the director Stephen Daldry and the playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan. Given that Mr. Morgan wrote the film “The Queen,” for which Ms. Mirren won an Academy Award, and “The Audience,” currently on Broadway and starring her as Elizabeth II, it seemed a natural fit for the actress to jump into the assignment. Furthermore, the Netflix show is actually inspired by “The Audience,” which details a series of meetings between the British monarch and various prime ministers from Winston Churchill to David Cameron. It is possible that several actresses will portray Queen Elizabeth II, depending on how long the series runs. According to The Hollywood Reporter, “Season 1 begins with a 25-year-old princess faced with the daunting prospect of leading the most famous monarchy in the world while forging a relationship with the domineering, war-hardened prime minister, Winston Churchill.”
