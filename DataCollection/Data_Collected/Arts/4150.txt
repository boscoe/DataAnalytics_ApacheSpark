When it comes to the skyscrapers of East Asia, no country can match the vertiginous zeal of China. After the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, China’s Shanghai Tower is the world’s second-tallest building, and three even loftier skyscrapers — in Suzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan — are now under construction.South Korea, by contrast, has never been known for its vertical ambition. Until recently, the tallest building on the Korean peninsula was actually North Korea’s retro-Futurist Ryugyong Hotel , a pyramid-shaped skyscraper begun in Pyongyang in 1987 and still unfinished.That architectural curiosity will soon be surpassed by the 556-meter Lotte World Tower, which already dominates the skyline of Seoul and will be the world’s sixth tallest building when completed next year.At 123 stories, the $3.6 billion Lotte World Tower will be taller than New York’s One World Trade Center (104 stories) and London’s Shard (72 stories). It is being positioned as a triumph of modern architecture, Seoul’s own version of the Burj Khalifa, complete with a 2,000-seat concert hall, a three-story observation deck, a “six-star” hotel and a rooftop garden accessible from the ground floor via an express high-speed elevator.
            The location, height and year each building was or is planned to be complete.

At its base is a gleaming, 2.5 million-square-foot luxury mall housing high-fashion brands such as Céline, Chanel and Bottega Veneta, not to mention an aquarium and period reproductions of Seoul streets from the 1930s and 1960s.AdvertisementThe building was intended to be the crowning achievement of Shin Kyuk-ho, 92, a Japanese-Korean tycoon who transformed a small chewing gum concern into Lotte Co., a multinational corporation with holdings that range from insurance and soft drink companies to the indoor theme park Lotte World, apparently the world’s largest.AdvertisementWhile conceived as a prestige project, the tower has been dogged by safety concerns since construction began in 2011.  Separate accidents have left three workers dead and a passerby seriously injured. Recently, a series of small sinkholes have appeared near the construction site and a nearby lake has mysteriously shrunk in size. Safety issues have contributed to a decline in visitors to the mall from 100,000 per day when it opened last October to 58,000 per day in recent months, Reuters reported.In an attempt to reassure South Koreans — who have been especially vigilant about public safety since last year’s Sewol ferry disaster — Lotte announced this week that Mr. Shin and 200 employees would move their offices to the building.While the tower will become the largest on the Korean peninsula, it may not hold that distinction for long. In February, the Korean automaker Hyundai announcedplans   to build its own skyscraper in the business district of Gangham, which would surpass the Lotte Tower by 16 meters.A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2015, in The International New York Times.
