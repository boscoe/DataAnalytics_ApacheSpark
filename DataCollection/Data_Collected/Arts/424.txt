Selena Gomez has scored her second No. 1 album, with her “Revival” (Interscope) beating the latest by the rapper the Game to the top of the chart.“Revival,” Ms. Gomez’s first album for the Interscope label after four studio albums for Disney’s Hollywood Records, had the equivalent of 117,000 sales, counting sales of the full album, track downloads and streams, according to Nielsen data reported by Billboard. “The Documentary 2” (Blood Money/Entertainment One) by the Los Angeles rapper the Game —  a sequel to his debut, “The Documentary,” from 10 years ago — stalled at No. 2.Also this week, the Weeknd’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” (XO/Republic) fell one spot to No. 3. (His song “The Hills,” meanwhile, is No. 1 for a fifth week on Billboard’s Hot 100, the magazine’s standard singles chart.) Fetty Wap’s self-titled debut is No. 4, and Drake and Future’s mixtape “What a Time to Be Alive” (Cash Money/Epic) fell two spots to No. 5. The only other new release in the Top 10 this week was “Thirty One” (Elektra Nashville) by Jana Kramer, a country singer and actress — you may remember her as Alex Dupré on the CW drama “One Tree Hill.”The music industry is gearing up for major new releases in November by Justin Bieber, One Direction and – very possibly but still not confirmed – Rihanna and Adele.A version of this article appears in print on 10/20/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Gomez Tops Chart.
