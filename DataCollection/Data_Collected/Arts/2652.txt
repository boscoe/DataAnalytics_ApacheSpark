LOS ANGELES — The 57th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday were a mixture of old songs, new faces and upsets, as Sam Smith, a 22-year-old British singer barely known to American audiences a year ago, won three of the top four prizes, and Beck became the dark-horse victor of album of the year.Mr. Smith took best new artist as well as both record and song of the year for “Stay With Me,” a moody, lovelorn ballad that became a smash on pop radio stations.“I want to thank the man who this record is about,” Mr. Smith said when accepting the prize for record of the year. “Thank you so much for breaking my heart, ’cause you got me four Grammys.”Besides those awards, Mr. Smith also won best vocal album, for “In the Lonely Hour,” one of last year’s biggest hits. The record of the year prize is for the recording of a single song, while song of the year is for songwriters.AdvertisementBeck’s win, for “Morning Phase,” was a classic Grammy surprise, as the awards’ voters chose a modest-selling but critically admired album in a rock context over bigger pop hits. Among its competitors were Mr. Smith’s “In the Lonely Hour”; Beyoncé’s self-titled, multimedia album; and Ed Sheeran’s “x,” a hit around the world on streaming services like Spotify. Held at the Staples Center here, the show was broadcast by CBS.AdvertisementSpeaking to reporters backstage, the country star Dwight Yoakam, who had performed on the show, defended Beck as a worthy recipient. “Beck is genuinely one of the great purveyors of the pure love of music,” Mr. Yoakam said.In addition to album of the year, “Morning Phase” took best rock album, beating releases by U2, Ryan Adams, Tom Petty and the Black Keys.Among the night’s other big winners, Pharrell Williams took home three prizes: “Happy” won best music video and, in a live version, best pop solo performance, while his “G I R L” won best urban contemporary album.Beyoncé, who like Mr. Smith had been up for a total of six awards, also won three: best R&B performance and R&B song, for “Drunk in Love,” and best surround sound album, for “Beyoncé.”Accepting the award for best R&B performance, Beyoncé thanked God and her husband, Jay Z, who appears on the track. But she made sure to thank her fans as well, with whom she keeps in constant contact through social media.

Miranda Lambert, accepting the prize for best country album, for “Platinum,” thanked her record label and “all the people who get it to the fans.”Kendrick Lamar and Eminem split the four rap trophies. Mr. Lamar, a fast-rising young star who had walked away empty-handed last year, took best performance and song this year for “I.” Eminem won best rap album for “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” and shared best rap/sung collaboration with Rihanna, for “The Monster.”AdvertisementNo clear winner emerged in the country field, either. Besides Ms. Lambert’s prize for best album, Glen Campbell’s “I’m Not Gonna Miss You” took best song, Carrie Underwood’s “Something in the Water” won best solo performance and the Band Perry took home best duo or group performance for “Gentle on My Mind.”In the rock categories, Jack White took best performance for his album “Lazaretto,” and the comedy-rock duo Tenacious D beat out Anthrax, Motörhead, Mastodon and Slipknot for best metal performance. Paramore’s “Ain’t It Fun” won best rock song, and the singer St. Vincent’s self-titled release took best alternative album.Chocked with 23 performances over three and a half hours, the night was a mixture of old and new. It opened with AC/DC, the indomitable Australian arena-rock stars, who — now in their 50s and 60s — strutted and duckwalked across the stage to their new song “Rock or Bust” and its 1979 hit, “Highway to Hell.”Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga sang “Cheek to Cheek,” an 80-year-old song by Irving Berlin; their album by that title also won best traditional pop vocal album. Beyoncé sang the gospel hymn “Precious Lord, Take My Hand,” dressed in diaphanous white and surrounded by a company with outstretched hands.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

After singing his song “Thinking Out Loud,” Mr. Sheeran, 23, joined the reunited Electric Light Orchestra for their 1970s number “Mr. Blue Sky.”The night was also full of eye-catching performances of newer songs, in stark colors or elaborately colorful scenes.Kanye West, dressed in a velvety red jumpsuit and a thin gold chain, was barely illuminated by a low spotlight as he sang “Only One,” his voice warped by electronics. Later, Katy Perry followed a testimonial by a survivor of domestic violence by performing her “By the Grace of God” dressed in a white gown and cape, as a shadow pantomime unfolded behind her.At the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Williams led an expansively staged version of “Happy” and Madonna, dressed in red and black matador-style lingerie, sang “Living for Love” as dozens of horn-masked dancers writhed around her like characters from the film “Eyes Wide Shut.”

Those included the pop singer and songwriter Meghan Trainor and Hozier, whose real name is Andrew Hozier-Byrne.AdvertisementAll but 9 of the 83 prizes were handed out in a nontelevised ceremony at the nearby Nokia Theater here. For years, this segment, known unceremoniously as the “pretel,” was a rather drab exercise plagued by artist no-shows. In an attempt to jazz it up a bit — and get more artists to show up — the organizers rechristened it the Grammy Premiere. It had slick production values, but many artists still failed to appear.“Frozen,” the smash Disney soundtrack, had been shut out of the major awards, but took two in the visual media field: best compilation soundtrack, for the album, and best song written for visual media, for its ubiquitous hit, “Let It Go.”The jazz keyboardist Chick Corea won two Grammys, bringing his total career take to 22 — tying Mr. Corea, 73, with U2 and Stevie Wonder. Mr. Corea took best improvised jazz solo for “Fingerprints”; “Trilogy,” the album from which that track was taken, also won best jazz instrumental album.Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter whose father was Johnny Cash, won three prizes in the American roots field, her first Grammys since 1986. Her song “A Feather’s Not a Bird” took best performance and best song, and “The River & the Thread” took best Americana album.“There are second acts in American life,” Ms. Cash told reporters backstage. “I just showed up for work for 35 years, and this is what happened.”In the fourth Grammy of his career, Weird Al Yankovic won best comedy album for “Mandatory Fun,” which last year became Mr. Yankovic’s first No. 1 album after an innovative video promotion campaign. With a nod to his habit of asking permission for his parodies, he thanked “all the recording artists that were nice enough to let me screw around with their music.”This year, lifetime achievement awards went to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, the classical conductor and composer Pierre Boulez, the blues guitarist Buddy Guy, Flaco Jiménez, Wayne Shorter and the Louvin Brothers.The awards are given for recordings released from Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30, 2014, and voted on by thousands of members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.As the music business has changed, an act’s path from the bedroom studio to the top of the charts has grown shorter and often passes through all kinds of new technologies. The quirky vocal group Pentatonix has reflected that change, starting with YouTube and culminating in one of last year’s top-selling albums, and on Sunday the group won best instrumental or a cappella arrangement for its track “Daft Punk.”Advertisement“We recorded this in a bedroom closet; we filmed it in a kitchen,” said Scott Hoying, 23, one of that group’s members, “and now we’re Grammy winners.”A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Voices Fresh and Familiar at the Grammy Awards.
