PARIS — Serge Lasvignes, a high-level French government official, was nominated this week to head the Pompidou Center, in a surprise choice to replace Alain Seban.Mr. Seban’s term of service is ending after eight years in which he drove the expansion of the Paris museum, which houses one of the largest collections of modern art in Europe.The succession — the topic of rumors for weeks — must still be approved by a government council, which will weigh the appointment of Mr. Lasvignes, 61, whose hiring was unexpected because of his low profile in the art world. (When Mr. Seban was hired in 2007, he had no museum management experience.)The selection was made in secret by a council of ministers on the recommendation of Fleur Pellerin, the French culture minister, who nominated Mr. Lasvignes, currently a government secretary general and a graduate of the elite L’École Nationale d’Administration.A spokesman for the culture ministry confirmed the nomination of Mr. Lasvignes, but the Pompidou Center declined to comment Tuesday about the change of leadership.The choice of a manager like Mr. Lasvignes is part of a broader strategy by President François Hollande’s Socialist government to push art institutions to reach out to new audiences within France. The Louvre is dominated by international visitors and the Pompidou Center drew more than 45 percent of its visitors from other countries last year.Under Mr. Seban’s leadership, the number of museum visitors grew to 3.45 million last year, from 2.5 million in 2007 — an increase fueled by temporary art events like its current Jeff Koons exhibition, which opened in November.Previously, Mr. Seban expanded the reach of the Pompidou Center with satellite outposts in Metz in the northeast of France and Malaga in southern Spain.A version of this article appears in print on 03/04/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Leader Nominated For Pompidou Center.
