The more the merrier: The choreographer Larry Keigwin may well agree with that. He likes moving lots of people who crowd and jostle one another and thoroughly enjoy the bustle. His troupe, Keigwin & Company, is offering two of his works for dancers on the move at the Joyce Theater. “Sidewalk” celebrates city folk on a busy street, with steps that range from pedestrian activities to explosions of athleticism.

Although Mr. Keigwin loves ensembles, his new “3 Ballads” is a solo — his first in more than a decade. But he’s still filling the stage with energetic steps.
