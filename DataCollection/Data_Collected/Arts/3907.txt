Paul Taylor just ended the inaugural catwalk of his American Modern Dance initiative to preserve vintage dances and champion younger contemporary voices alongside his own. And last month brought nods to Cunningham, who died in 2009, by Compagnie CNDC-Angers from France and Juilliard Dances Repertory. This week, the Stephen Petronio Company wraps up its 30th anniversary by starting “Bloodlines,” a five-year project to restage important postmodern dances. First up: Cunningham’s “RainForest” from 1968, a work that feels both fanciful and menacing, with layers of drama, innocence and rebellion. Mr. Petronio also contributes a world premiere of his own, “Non Locomotor,” a companion to last year’s “Locomotor” (also part of this program), which confirms that three decades on, he’s still addicted to the art of speed.
