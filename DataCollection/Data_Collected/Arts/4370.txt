He fashioned his own performance audition, rounded up the few cornetto players active in England, auditioned singers from London, including the tenor Robert Tear, and borrowed Trevor Pinnock’s harpsichord. The show caused a stir and put Mr. Gardiner on the map as a conductor of immense persuasive gifts.This week Mr. Gardiner returns to Monteverdi’s Vespers with the forces that grew out of that first student performance, the Monteverdi Choir and the English Baroque Soloists, as well as the wonderful Brooklyn Youth Chorus and a battery of fine soloists. On Friday he conducts a concert of Monteverdi’s radiant “Orfeo,” taking audiences back to the supremely confident beginnings of Italian opera.
