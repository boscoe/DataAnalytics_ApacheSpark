Amy Schumer discusses writing and starring in “Trainwreck,” a comedy directed by Judd Apatow.Updated, 7:52 p.m. |  Before the highly anticipated film “Trainwreck” is released in July, several of the comics from the movie, including its star, Amy Schumer, who wrote the script, and Judd Apatow, its director, will be headlining a seven-city, eight-night tour, with the show’s proceeds going to charity.The Trainwreck Comedy Tour, which will start in Boston and end in Los Angeles, with a stop at the Beacon Theater in New York City on June 15, will feature sets from Ms. Schumer’s co-stars Colin Quinn, Mike Birbiglia, Vanessa Bayer and Dave Attell.Mr. Apatow said in a phone conversation that he wanted to mix up the standard film promotion formula from a post-screening Q. and A. to a stand-up event, and bring together the “best comedians of our generation.”For the show’s headliner, Ms. Schumer, the tour will bring her back to New York City less than a month after she films her first HBO comedy special at the Apollo Theater, and follows the news that her Emmy-nominated show “Inside Amy Schumer” was renewed for a fourth season by Comedy Central. “Her current set is ridiculous,” said Mr. Apatow, “she’s really having her moment right now.”A version of this article appears in print on 05/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Stand-Up Tour For ‘Trainwreck’.
