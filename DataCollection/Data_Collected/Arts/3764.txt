Earlier this year, Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC’s entertainment division, announced that after  “The Sound of Music Live” in 2013 and  “Peter Pan Live” in 2014, his network’s next live musical production would be either “The Wiz” or “The Music Man.”Today, NBC announced that it had eased on down the road. On Dec. 3,  a live version of “The Wiz” will make its debut on the network, produced in partnership with Cirque du Soleil’s theatrical division, which will then take it to Broadway for the 2016-17 season. “We love this yearly tradition, and we’re more excited than ever to not only bring another Broadway musical to America’s living rooms but also see it land on Broadway,” Mr. Greenblatt said in a statement. “The Wiz,” a version of the “Wizard of Oz” story featuring an African-American cast, first appeared on Broadway in 1975. The 1978 movie version, co-produced by the movie wing of Motown Records, was directed by Sidney Lumet and starred Diana Ross as Dorothy, Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow and Nipsey Russell as the Tin Man.A version of this article appears in print on 04/01/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: NBC Chooses u2018The Wizu2019 for Live Telecast.
