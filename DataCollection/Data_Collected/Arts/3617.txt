The 92nd Street Y will open its 2015-16 season in October with Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” in its original jazz band arrangement, pairing the pianist Kirill Gerstein with Vince Giordano & the Nighthawks, it announced Tuesday. Other pairings planned for the season will juxtapose Beethoven’s violin sonatas with contemporary works, and visual art with music.The Y will give a four-concert “Bridge to Beethoven” series in which the violinist Jennifer Koh and the pianist Shai Wosner will play all of Beethoven’s violin sonatas on programs featuring new works by Vijay Iyer, Anthony Cheung, Andrew Norman and Jörg Widmann.A “Seeing Music” festival in the winter will feature the Brentano String Quartet playing Bach’s “The Art of Fugue” alongside a dynamic stage installation created by the architect Gabriel Calatrava; the pianist Matan Porat improvising accompaniment to Buster Keaton’s silent film “The General,” and the pianist Garrick Ohlsson performing Granados’s “Goyescas” and Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition” at a concert that will project the art that inspired the music onto the stage before the performance and during intermission.Other artists scheduled to appear next season include the pianist Jeremy Denk with the violinist Stefan Jackiw and New York Polyphony, a vocal ensemble; the cellist Steven Isserlis and pianist Stephen Hough; the pianist Inon Barnatan; the Pacifica Quartet, and the pianist Daniil Trifonov, who will make his Y debut playing rare Rachmaninoff works with musicians of the New York Philharmonic as part of the orchestra’s Rachmaninoff festival.The season will open on Oct. 20.
