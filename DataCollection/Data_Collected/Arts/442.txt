Shakespeare’s monarchs will meet the County of Kings next year when the Royal Shakespeare Company brings its cycle of history plays to the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the academy’s winter and spring season.“King & Country: Shakespeare’s Great Cycle of Kings,” which will run in repertory at the Harvey Theater between March 24 and May 1, includes “Richard II,” “Henry IV, Part 1,” “Henry IV, Part II” and “Henry V,”  in productions directed by Gregory Doran, the company’s artistic director. It is the exclusive American engagement for the plays, which will also be performed at the Barbican in London — presenting the complete cycle — and in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death. The BAM performances, presented with Ohio State University, will be accompanied by talks, master classes and an exhibition of rare books and objects from the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington.The new season’s other theater offerings include “Rimbaud in New York,” a meditation on that poet’s work by the Civilians, based on translations by John Ashbery and inspired partly by the 1970s downtown New York scene; a production of “The Cherry Orchard” by the Maly Drama Theater of St. Petersburg; and “The Judas Kiss,” David Hare’s play about the downfall of Oscar Wilde, starring Rupert Everett. Dance and opera events include appearances by the Trisha Brown Dance Company, the Mariinsky Theater of St. Petersburg and Les Arts Florissants.Tickets will go on sale to the general public on Nov. 16.A version of this article appears in print on 10/21/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Shakespeare Company Will Bring Plays to BAM.
