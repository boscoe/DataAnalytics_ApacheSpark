After nearly seven years of usually unpredictable, often hilarious and always free nights of comedy, Big Terrific, one of the best weekly stand-up shows in the city, is coming to an end. When Max Silvestri, Jenny Slate and Gabe Liedman started presenting comedy line-ups  in Williamsburg nearly seven years ago, there were few weekly stand-up shows in Brooklyn. “At the time, Eugene Mirman and Michael Showalter had a Sunday show at Union Hall and that was it,”  Mr. Silvestri said. “People were like: ‘Brooklyn, why would people go there?’” Now there’s a bustling comedy scene in the borough with regular shows at Littlefield, Union Hall and Knitting Factory. Big Terrific, a Wednesday-night institution in Williamsburg, earned its reputation thanks to warm hosts and savvy curating, which mixed established stars  like Aziz Ansari and Sarah Silverman with newcomers, including some with more unorthodox bents. (Reggie Watts was on the first bill.) Ms. Slate, who starred in “Obvious Child” as a comic in a show that was much like an early version of Big Terrific, and Mr. Liedman, a stand-up who writes for “Inside Amy Schumer” and “Kroll Show,” would co-host the show with Mr. Silvestri before they moved to Los Angeles several years ago. Mr. Silvestri, who has written for “Billy on the Street” and will host Bravo’s new food show “Recipe for Deception,” says it became difficult to put on the same show with his spending more of his time in Los Angeles.There will be  more free shows at Cameo Gallery and then a final show  April 26 at Warsaw Bar and Lounge in Greenpoint.
