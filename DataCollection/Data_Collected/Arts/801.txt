London — The pair behind “Amy,” the highly successful documentary film about the singer Amy Winehouse, have signed on to make a feature-length documentary about the British pop group Oasis, which disbanded in 2009. Asif Kapadia, the director of “Amy,” and James Gay-Rees, the producer, will be producers on the Oasis project, which doesn’t yet have a title or release date.The documentary will be directed by Mat Whitecross, who has made a fictional film, “Spike Island,” about a group of music fans desperately trying to get tickets for a Stone Roses concert in 1990, as well as “Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll,” a biopic of the punk musician Ian Dury.According to a report in Screen Daily on Monday, the filmmakers have been given “unprecedented” access to the band and unseen archive footage, and will follow the group from 1991, when Noel Gallagher joined his younger brother, Liam, in his Manchester-based band. Their 1994 debut album, “Definitely Maybe,” shot to the top of the charts, but the brothers’ stormy relationship was soon tabloid fodder. Although Oasis continued to produce successful albums and win numerous awards over the next decade, the brothers parted ways in 2009.“It’s with some sadness and great relief to tell you I quit Oasis tonight,” Noel Gallagher wrote on the band’s website at the time. “People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer.”Neither Noel nor Liam Gallagher have commented on the project.
