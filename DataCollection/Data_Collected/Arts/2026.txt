LONDON — Nicholas Cullinan, who has been the curator of modern and contemporary art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the last two years, has been appointed the new director of the National Portrait Gallery here, the gallery announced on Tuesday.Mr. Cullinan, 37, was born in Connecticut but grew up in England. He studied at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and worked as a lecturer there, and at the University of Wales, before joining the Tate Modern as a curator of international modern art. He then moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Last year, he was one of the curators of the Tate Modern’s wildly successful Matisse cutouts exhibition, which is now at MoMA (with a different team of curators).Mr. Cullinan, whose appointment will begin in the spring, will be the 12th director in the gallery’s 158-year history. He replaces Sandy Nairne, who has held the position since 2002, and who became the chairman of the London-based Clore Leadership Program, an organization to develop leadership in the arts, in September.Mr. Cullinan worked part-time at the National Portrait Gallery as a front-of-house assistant from 2001 to 2003 while studying for his master of arts degree and teaching at the Courtauld.In a statement, he said: “It is with great pleasure that I return to the National Portrait Gallery, an institution that I have grown up with and where I first worked 14 years ago. At a time when identity, shared culture and civic values are increasingly relevant to us all, the National Portrait Gallery is uniquely placed to generate a discussion by reflecting on our common artistic, cultural and social history — in short what binds us together.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/07/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Met Curator to Lead Museum in Britain.
