“Selma,” Ava DuVernay’s film about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1965 civil rights marches in that small Alabama town, is making the rounds among Oscar voters, who began casting ballots this week.Now, as the film prepares for its wider rollout, Paramount Pictures, its distributor, is also courting another specialized audience: the people of Selma itself, who will be able to see the film free at the town’s Walton Theater beginning Jan. 9.“The city and people of Selma welcomed the production with open arms this past summer,” Rob Moore, Paramount’s vice chairman, said in a statement, “and in celebration of the film’s national release on Jan. 9, we are incredibly excited and very humbled to be bringing Ava’s finished film to the community.”The announcement comes as the film, which is nominated for four Golden Globe awards, is drawing sharp criticism from some historians for what they consider its inaccurate depiction of President Lyndon B. Johnson as a reluctant supporter of black voting rights who unleashed the Federal Bureau of Investigation against Dr. King in an attempt to shut down his campaign.Neither Paramount nor Ms. DuVernay has offered detailed responses to the criticism. But in a statement provided by Paramount, Selma’s mayor, George P. Evans, thanked the filmmakers before adding, “We must keep in mind that the movie is just that, a movie and not a documentary.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/02/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: In Selma, a Free Screening of u2018Selmau2019.
