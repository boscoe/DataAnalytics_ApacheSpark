The critically acclaimed Broadway drama “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” has recouped its $4.75 million capitalization, its producers announced on Monday, confirming the play’s status as one of the big hits of the 2014-15 theater season. “Curious Incident,” about a British teenager confronting his own limitations as he tries to solve a mystery, has emerged as one of the most surprising successes on Broadway in recent years. It lacks the star actors and easy, crowd-pleasing material that typify many commercial shows, and its performance run is open-ended – compared with most plays that usually run for a few months because of stars’ schedules or limited audience demand. Typically only about 25 percent of Broadway shows ever turn a profit; “Curious Incident” did so last weekend after four and a half months of performances. Written by Simon Stephens, who adapted the work from Mark Haddon’s best-selling novel, “Curious Incident” is directed by the Tony Award winner Marianne Elliott (“War Horse”) and was originally produced at London’s National Theater.
