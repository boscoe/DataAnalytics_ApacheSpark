In the days before Christmas, not much is changed in the music charts — which, once again, means that Adele is No. 1 and everybody else is just lining up behind her.Adele’s “25” (XL/Columbia) is at the top of the Billboard album chart for a fourth straight week, with the equivalent of 825,000 sales in the United States, up slightly from the week before, according to Nielsen. That includes 790,000 copies of the full album; the rest are counted through Nielsen and Billboard’s new formula for factoring in the effects of streams and individual track sales. (In Adele’s case, those streams are only for her single, “Hello” — in a move still causing waves throughout the music industry, she did not release her full album on any streaming services.)In its first four weeks on sale, “25” has now sold 5.98 million copies, which means it has eclipsed sales of Taylor Swift’s “1989” (5.57 million) and is now officially the best-selling album since Adele’s last one, “21.” Since it came out in 2011, “21” has racked up more than 11 million sales in the United States, and well over 30 million around the world.Also this week, Coldplay’s new album, “A Head Full of Dreams” (Parlophone/Atlantic), seems to have run out of steam quickly, falling five spots to No. 7 in its second week out. That may be partly a result of its staggered availability. When the album first came out, the band kept it from Spotify but released it widely elsewhere; it came to Spotify a week later.Justin Bieber is up one spot at No. 2 with “Purpose” (RBMG/Def Jam), while Pentatonix’s “That’s Christmas to Me” (RCA) is No. 3. One Direction’s “Made in the A.M.” (Syco/Columbia) is in fourth place, the Weeknd’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” (XO/Republic) is No. 5 and Chris Stapleton’s “Traveller” (Mercury Nashville) is No. 6.A version of this article appears in print on 12/22/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Adele Tops Swift.
