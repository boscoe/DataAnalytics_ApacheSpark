The U2 concert that was postponed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris has been rescheduled for Dec. 7, HBO said in a statement on Monday.The concert was originally scheduled for Nov. 14 in Paris and was to be broadcast on HBO that night, but U2 called the performance off just hours after the Nov. 13 attacks that left 129 dead in the city, including 89 people who were at a concert hall where the band Eagles of Death Metal was performing.The rescheduled concert will take place at the AccorHotels Arena in Paris, and HBO will broadcast it at 9 p.m. Eastern that night. U2 will also play at the arena on Dec. 6. “So much that was taken from Paris on the tragic night of Nov. 13h is irreplaceable,” U2’s lead singer, Bono, said in a statement. “For one night, the killers took lives, took music, took peace of mind – but they couldn’t steal the spirit of that city. It’s a spirit our band knows well and will try to serve when we return for the postponed shows on Dec. 6th and 7th. We’re going to put on our best for Paris.” The documentary about cartoonists for The New Yorker magazine, “Very Semi-Serious: A Partially Thorough Portrait of New Yorker Cartoonists,” which was supposed to broadcast on HBO on Dec. 7, will be moved to a new date.A version of this article appears in print on 11/24/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: U2 Reschedules Concert Canceled After Attacks.
