The internationally prominent choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui will be the new artistic director of the Royal Ballet of Flanders, the company announced Wednesday in Antwerp, Belgium. Tamas Moricz , a former dancer with William Forsythe’s Ballet Frankfurt, will be the associate artistic director.The appointment of Mr. Cherkaoui and Mr. Moricz, who will take up their positions in September, follows a turbulent period for the company. After losing Kathryn Bennetts, an Australian who gained an international reputation for the troupe between 2005 and 2012, the company appointed Assis Carreiro, the former director of DanceEast, a regional dance center in Britain. Ms. Carreiro, who had not danced professionally, was dismissed two years after taking the job in 2012, and the company has been without an artistic director since August.Mr. Cherkaoui was born in Antwerp and established a substantial reputation as a contemporary choreographer over the last decade, forming his own company, Eastman, and also creating works for a large number of ballet companies, including the Paris Opera Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, the Dutch National Ballet and Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet in New York.“The course I will be seeking to pursue with the company is one of reconciliation,” Mr. Cherkaoui said in a statement. “For a number of years there has been a constantly growing exchange between the different dance disciplines, as classical ballet and contemporary dance increasingly complement each other.”A version of this article appears in print on 02/07/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Troubled Flanders Ballet Gets New Artistic Team.
