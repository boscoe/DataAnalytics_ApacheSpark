Theaters are a reliably cool refuge from summer heat. The children who visit the New Victory Theater on 42nd Street in July will have the added benefit of learning a thing or two about dance. New Victory has announced its second season of Victory Dance, a summer series of free dance performances for children in New York City day camps, summer schools and programs run by social service agencies. The series brings in professional dancers, as well as training artists who guide the children through the show with introductions and discussions. In some cases, the training artists will visit the students for dance workshops. Education is always the emphasis at performances. The dancers will, for example, ask students questions to get a conversation started. “They’ll ask: ‘What do you think the intention was?’ ” Allison Mui, a spokeswoman for New Victory, said. “That way they’re kind of synthesizing what they see.” Students won’t be alone in getting a chance to see the dancers. Three evening performances — on July 9, 16 and 23 — will be open to the public, with tickets for $10. Victory Dance runs from July 8 through July 24. New Victory’s website has more information about the series and partnerships with New York school programs.
