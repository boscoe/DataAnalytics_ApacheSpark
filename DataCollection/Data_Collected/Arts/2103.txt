Call it the Nathan Lane effect. A two-time Tony Award winner and one of theater’s biggest box-office draws, Mr. Lane recently departed the Broadway hit comedy “It’s Only a Play” – and ticket sales promptly slid without him last week, just as they did when he left earlier Broadway shows like “The Addams Family” and “The Producers.”“It’s Only a Play,” which now stars Martin Short in the Lane role of a quip-slinging actor, grossed $690,904 for eight performances, according to box office data released on Monday – or about half of the amount that the production made every week in December and early January. (The play set a record of $1,455,818 for its theater during New Year’s week.) The good news is that the gross was more than enough to cover the show’s weekly running costs, and the play has already turned a profit, recouping its $3.9 million capitalization in mid-December. Moreover, the week following New Year’s is usually a modest-selling one for many Broadway shows because tourists have left and people are newly focused on work and school.All 29 Broadway shows were down at the box office compared to the week before. They grossed a total of $23.8 million last week, compared to $19.6 million for 26 shows during the comparable week in 2014, according to the data released by the Broadway League. Attendance was 232,696 compared to 196,288 a year ago.A version of this article appears in print on 01/13/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: After Lane Leaves, So Do Ticket Buyers.
