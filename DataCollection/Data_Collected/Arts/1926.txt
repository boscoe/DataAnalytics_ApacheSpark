LONDON — The choreographer Matthew Bourne, the actress Imelda Staunton, the Blur frontman Damon Albarn, the ballerina Tamara Rojo and the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon are all on this year’s New Year’s Honors 2016, the list of awards announced by the British cabinet office to those who have distinguished themselves in a variety of professional or charitable fields. (These are wide-ranging, and this year include “honorable services to snooker” among many others.)Mr. Bourne was awarded a knighthood, making him the first modern-dance figure to be able to call himself “Sir,” an honor previously reserved for the ballet world eminences Robert Helpmann, Frederick Ashton, Kenneth MacMillan and Anthony Dowell. The Honors List, which causes much annual excitement in the news media here, is an institution established by King George V in 1917 to fill the gaps in the British awards system, which had previously made provision for the aristocracy, the military and for diplomats but not for those in other fields. The awards are formally called “The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire,” and — Britain being Britain — there is a hierarchy: first Knights and Dames, then CBE (Commander of the British Empire), OBE (Order of the British Empire) and MBE (Member of the British Empire).Among other arts figures the actress Sian Phillips received a damehood, while Ms. Staunton, the writer Peter Morgan (“The Queen” and “The Audience”), Mr. Wheeldon and Ms. Rojo, who is the director of English National Ballet, all received the CBE. The actors Idris Elba and David Oyelowo, and Mr. Albarn, were awarded the OBE.
