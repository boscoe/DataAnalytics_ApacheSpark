Pamela Adlon, who was recently the focus of a multi-episode plot arc on “Louie,” will star in her own show, FX has announced. The network picked up the pilot to “Better Things,” created by and starring Ms. Adlon and directed by Louis CK.Ms. Adlon has been a longtime muse and creative partner of Louis CK. She portrayed his wife on the 2006 HBO sitcom “Lucky Louie” and is a two-time Emmy nominee for her work as a producer and writer on “Louie.” The most recent season of “Louie” ended with an extended storyline titled “Pamela, Parts 1-3,” exploring the two characters’ burgeoning relationship.According to the news release, “Better Things” follows Ms. Adlon, portraying a single working actor with three daughters, as she navigates personal and professional situations. This premise would seem to mirror the verisimilitude found in “Louie,” as Ms. Adlon, who is divorced, has three daughters in real life. Ms. Adlon will continue to appear on the next season of Louie, and it’s possible that she and Louis CK will pursue both projects at the same time.Additionally, FX announced that it had acquired the rights to televise Louis CK’s next stand-up comedy special, the already recorded “Louis CK Live From the Comedy Store.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/20/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: FX Picks Up Pamela Adlon Pilot.
