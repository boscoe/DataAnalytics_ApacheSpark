After a presidential montage proclaiming that “our long national nightmare is over,” David Letterman closed out a 33-year run in late-night television on Wednesday night. The final “Late Show” featured a Top 10 list read by the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Tina Fey and Steve Martin, and a musical performance by the Foo Fighters. But despite the retrospective segments and the love going around during the finale, starting with a lengthy standing ovation at the beginning, the show mostly avoided mawkish sentiment and stayed true to the host’s deadpan, self-deprecating sensibility.Mr. Letterman ended his career, The Times’s Alessandra Stanley wrote, “as he had started it — with the irreverence, self-mockery and mischief that made him such an iconoclastic talk-show host.”Highlights from the “Late Show” finale are below. You can watch the entire show at CBS.com.The MonologueMr. Letterman opened his final “Late Show” monologue with, per usual, a joke at his own expense: “It’s beginning to look like I’m not going to get the ‘Tonight Show.’ ”Other highlights from the monologue (condensed for clarity in some cases):“Earlier, we got a call from Stephen Hawking: 6,028 shows, and he ran the numbers, and it works out to about eight minutes of laughter.”“Here’s the problem when you don’t have you own show anymore: When I screw up now, and Lord knows I’ll be screwing up, I have to go on somebody else’s show to apologize.”“When we started the show there were mixed responses. Half of the people said, ‘That show doesn’t have a chance.’ The other half said, ‘That show doesn’t have a prayer.’ ”“You know what I’m gonna do now that I’m retired? I hope to become the new face of Scientology.”“We are going to continue in show business. Next month in Las Vegas, Paul and I will be debuting our new act in Caesars Palace with our white tigers.”The Final Top 10 ListA number of celebrities participated in the final list: “Top 10 Things I’ve Always Wanted to Say to Dave.”10. Alec Baldwin: “Of all the talk shows, yours is the most geographically convenient to my home.”9. Barbara Walters: “Did you know that you wear the same cologne as Muammar Qaddafi?”8. Steve Martin: “Your extensive plastic surgery was a necessity and a mistake.” 7. Jerry Seinfeld: “I have no idea what I’ll do when you go off the air… You know, I just thought of something, I’ll be fine.”6. Jim Carrey: “Honestly, Dave, I’ve always found you to be a bit of an over-actor.”5. Chris Rock: “I’m just glad your show is being given to another white guy.”4. Julia Louis-Dreyfus: “Thanks for letting me take part in another hugely disappointing series finale.”3. Peyton Manning: “You are to comedy, what I am to comedy.”2. Tina Fey: “Thanks for finally proving men can be funny.”1. Bill Murray: “Dave, I’ll never have the money I owe you.”Looking BackAfter weeks of tributes from Letterman fans famous and otherwise, the final show mostly limited the celebrity appearances to the star-studded Top 10 list. The bulk of the evening surveyed highlights from the host’s more than 6,000 episodes of his late-night shows on NBC and CBS. Packages, including his appearances with children and the Taco Bell segment. Another video, above, offered a mostly straight look at a day in the life of the show.The Last GoodbyeFor his final “Late Show” goodbye, Mr. Letterman mixed gratitude with his signature self-mockery. “We’ve done over 6,000 shows,” he said. “And I can tell you a pretty high percentage of those absolutely sucked.” Mr. Letterman thanked the band, the staff and others associated with the show, as well as his wife, Regina, and son, Harry. (Mr. Letterman’s impersonation of his son has become a fixture on the show.) “Thank you for being my family,” he said. “I love you both and really nothing else matters, does it?”A Final Musical Performance and Tribute to LunacyThe Foo Fighters, and particularly their song, “Everlong,” have been meaningful to Mr. Letterman since his 2000 return to the show after having quintuple-bypass heart surgery.  The band returned on Wednesday night to perform the song as a last frenetic clips package presented memorable moments from throughout the host’s career.Tributes to Mr. Letterman appeared on social media throughout the day on Wednesday:TV won’t be the same without Dave. //t.co/9q5NHTf3b5— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) 20 May 15Our wonderful city won’t quite be the same without @Letterman. #ThanksDave //t.co/OEp2QOdee1— New York Yankees (@Yankees) 20 May 15WOW!
