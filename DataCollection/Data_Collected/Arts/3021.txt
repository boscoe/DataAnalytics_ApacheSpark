A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.David Berkman and the New York Standards Quartet  (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Berkman, a pianist and composer with a smart, uncluttered approach to modern jazz, has led his New York Standards Quartet on and off for the better part of a decade; he formally introduced the group last year with the album “The New Straight Ahead.” For a weekend run, he welcomes two notable interlopers, the trombonist Robin Eubanks and the bassist Ray Drummond. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Nate Chinen)★ Andy Bey  (Friday and Saturday) With his magnificent two most recent albums — “The World According to Andy Bey,” from 2013, and “Pages From an Imaginary Life,” from last year — Mr. Bey has consolidated his rare gifts as a jazz singer of deep patience and extravagant feeling, and a songwriter of intuitive mystery. He had a successful solo engagement at Minton’s near the end of last year, which makes this a repeat performance, though not necessarily a predictable one. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com. (Chinen)★ The Big Band Sound of Rufus Reid (through Sunday) On “Quiet Pride,” his expansively drawn recent album, the bassist and composer Rufus Reid pays homage to the great African-American sculptor Elizabeth Catlett, with a large-ensemble suite. He’ll draw partly from that album in this engagement, with a 20-piece band that includes ace contributors like the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix, the trombonist Luis Bonilla and the saxophonist and clarinetist Scott Robinson. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set on Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Cyrus Chestnut Trio (Tuesday through Thursday) A soulful, straight-ahead pianist, particularly adept with gospel and the blues, Cyrus Chestnut works most often in a trio, which will be the case during this run. Some performances have a limited availability. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Anat Cohen Quartet (Wednesday through March 8) Anat Cohen, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist of irresistible rhythmic aplomb, has a new album, “Luminosa,” that covers some of her key interests, notably the music of Brazilian composers like Milton Nascimento. She draws from the album here, with an adaptable rhythm section of Jason Lindner on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Daniel Freedman on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set next Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Jeff Davis’s Mountains Mountains Water  (Wednesday) Mr. Davis, a drummer and composer of sure footing but adventurous inclination, connects with several good partners in this band, all of them regular associates: the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the guitarist Jonathon Goldberger and the bassist Eivind Opsvik. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Duchess  (Tuesday) This jazz vocal trio — a knowing update of the Boswell Sisters sound, featuring Amy Cervini, Hilary Gardner and Melissa Stylianou — celebrates the release of its self-titled debut, with help from, among others, the saxophonist Jeff Lederer and the drummer Matt Wilson. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Robert Glasper Trio (through Sunday) In recent years Robert Glasper has been chiefly focused on the Experiment, his next-level groove unit, which just won its second Grammy in the R&B field. His acoustic piano trio predates that, though, and hasn’t lost its agile footing — as Mr. Glasper will set out to show with this run in the room where he made his debut nearly a decade ago, with the same rhythm team of Vicente Archer on bass and Damion Reid on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)The Dexter Gordon Legacy Ensemble (through Sunday) Dexter Gordon was a tenor saxophonist of deep composure and ineffable cool, one of the few avatars of bebop who rarely seemed to break a sweat. This tribute, led by a former associate, the pianist George Cables, features Abraham Burton and Craig Handy on saxophones; Joe Locke on vibraphone; Gerald Cannon on bass; and Lewis Nash on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)★ Tootie Heath, Ethan Iverson, Ben Street  (Tuesday through March 8) Albert (Tootie) Heath is a jazz drummer of experience — he was born in 1935, the youngest of the Heath Brothers, and has worked near the music’s aesthetic center for some 60 years — and he presides as a resident sage in this trio. Featuring a pair of collaborators in their 40s, Mr. Iverson on piano and Mr. Street on bass, the group is celebrating the release of its utterly convincing third album, “Philadelphia Beat.” At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Theo Hill Trio  (Thursday) Theo Hill is a painterly young pianist with a chamber-like approach to composition, and a fine recent album on the SmallsLive label. For this one-nighter he leads a trio with Yasushi Nakamura on bass and Rodney Green on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Jazz Across the Americas  (Friday and Saturday) The Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis, is about to embark on a tour of South America (with additional stops in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Mexico).

At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org. (Chinen)Ryan Keberle and Catharsis  (Thursday) Ryan Keberle is a young trombonist of vision and composure, and he has been doing strong work with Catharsis, a quartet featuring the trumpeter Mike Rodriguez, the bassist Jorge Roeder and the drummer Eric Doob. He appears here with one tweak to the lineup: Scott Robinson, a guest saxophonist on the band’s most recent album, steps in for Mr. Rodriguez. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Frank Kimbrough Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) The pianist Frank Kimbrough has a gift for flowing ethereality, along with a fondness for earthy rapture. He’ll draw here from “Quartet,” the sure-footed, poetic album he released last year; his partners are the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the bassist Jay Anderson and the drummer Matt Wilson. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Adam Larson Quintet (Saturday) The impeccably trained postbop saxophonist Adam Larson has been gaining footing as a bandleader, and in this appearance he works with a strong rhythm team: Sam Harris on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass, Jonathan Pinson on drums and Matt Stevens on guitar. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Chris Lightcap’s Bigmouth  (Friday and Saturday) The bassist Chris Lightcap has a strong new album, “Epicenter,” featuring a batch of tunes inspired by New York locales. (Among the song titles: “Arthur Avenue” and “Stillwell.”) The music was composed for Bigmouth, a long-running unit featuring the tenor saxophonists Chris Cheek and Tony Malaby, the pianist Craig Taborn and the drummer Gerald Cleaver. (Andrew Bishop steps in for Mr. Cheek for these performances.) At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Adam O’Farrill  (Saturday) Mr. O’Farrill recently turned 20, but his achievements would have you think him at least a few years older: He’s featured on an assertive new album by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, and last fall he came in third at the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Trumpet Competition. For this concert, part of the Monk-in-Motion series, he leads Stranger Days, with Chad Lefkowitz-Brown on tenor saxophone, Stephan Crump on bass and his brother, Zack O’Farrill, on drums. At 7:30 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, near Greenwich Street, 212-220-1460, tribecapac.org. (Chinen)★ Miles Okazaki Quartet  (Friday) The most recent album by the guitarist and composer Miles Okazaki is “Figurations,” a cerebral but thrilling showcase for his elaborate designs. It was recorded live at the Jazz Gallery, the institution that now presents his excellent current group, with Donny McCaslin on tenor saxophone, François Moutin on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Steps Ahead 35th Anniversary Celebration  (Friday and Saturday) Steps Ahead, a leading fusion outfit of the 1980s, has always stood for advanced interplay, following the lead of its members. This anniversary run features the vibraphonist Mike Mainieri, the pianist Eliane Elias and the drummer Peter Erskine — all heard on the album “Steps Ahead,” from 1983 — as well as Marc Johnson on bass and George Garzone on saxophones. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Mike Stern and Bill Evans Band  (Tuesday through March 7) Mr. Stern, a guitarist, and Mr. Evans, a saxophonist, have a long history together, stretching at least as far back as their tenure in the early-1980s comeback bands of Miles Davis. They have kept building on the language of jazz-rock and jazz-funk, each in his own way; their jointly led quartet has Tom Kennedy on bass and Steve Smith on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Advertisement
