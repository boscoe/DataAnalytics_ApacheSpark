They gotta eat, they gotta hunt, you gotta watch. On Monday, Universal Pictures released its most robust trailer for the newest addition to the “Jurassic Park” franchise, with a more detailed look at the many dinos in action (raptors in training, raptors on the run), along with a good deal more menace. In its earlier trailer, released in November, the studio gave only a hint of the potential havoc a new genetically modified dinosaur might wreak on the park. Here, we see just how hungry and cruel that new dino is, with a shot of dinosaur carcasses she’s left strewn across a field. Viewers also get a fuller view of the creature, wide-jawed and wild as she snacks on a park security guard with a machine gun. In fact, there’s a lot of chomping going on in this trailer, playing up the thriller aspect that made Steven Spielberg’s first film in the series such a pulse-pounding attraction. “Jurassic World” is out June 12, with Colin Trevorrow, the director of the indie comedy “Safety Not Guaranteed,” at the helm.
