Adam Sandler’s first original movie with Netflix, “The Ridiculous Six” – a western send-up of “The Magnificent Seven” — hit rocky terrain this week when a number of Native American actors walked off the set, claiming some of the film’s content was offensive.  According to Indian Country Today Media Network,  which first reported the news, about a dozen actors, including an  adviser on Native American culture, left the set Wednesday after learning the names of some of the film’s  characters, among them Beaver’s Breath and No Bra.  A female Native American character was to urinate while smoking a peace pipe, Indian Country reported. The outlet said that the producers brushed off the  actors’ concerns. “Nothing has changed,” Indian Country quoted a Navajo actress, Allison Young, as saying. Ms. Young, who was among those who left the set, added, “We are still just Hollywood Indians.” Netflix defended the film in a statement. “The movie has ‘ridiculous’ in the title for a reason,” a spokesperson wrote in an email. “It is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized, featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of — but in on — the joke.” Made by Mr. Sandler’s company, Happy Madison Productions, the film also stars  Steve Buscemi, Nick Nolte, John Turturro, Luke Wilson and Whitney Cummings.
