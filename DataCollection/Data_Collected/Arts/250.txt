With Paul Lewis as accompanist, the three-concert traversal of “Die schöne Müllerin,” (“The Lovely Mill Maiden”), “Schwanengesang” (Swan Song) and “Winterreise” (Winter Journey) was to feature a great Schubertian at the piano. But after Mr. Lewis dropped out with health problems, Mr. Padmore announced he would team up with Kristian Bezuidenhout, one of today’s leading performers on period keyboard instruments.Mr. Bezuidenhout will play a fortepiano which, with its more introverted sound palette, may prove a perfect foil for Mr. Padmore’s clear, unforced and grippingly vulnerable style of singing. It’s a rare chance to experience Schubert up close and intimate. (“Die schöne Müllerin,” Wednesday, Oct. 14; “Schwanengesang” on Thursday, Oct. 15; and “Winterreise” on Oct. 17, Alice Tully Hall; whitelightfestival.org.)Advertisement
