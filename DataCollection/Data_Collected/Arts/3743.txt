The crude “Get Hard,” a Warner Bros. effort described by some critics as homophobic and borderline racist, was cowed at the weekend box office by “Home,” a family-friendly adventure from DreamWorks Animation.A story about a purple alien and a lost teenage girl, “Home” generated a surprise $54 million in ticket sales from North American theaters, or roughly 50 percent more than predicted before its release by firms that track interest. The unexpectedly strong turnout — fueled by females, who made up 60 percent of the audience — is a lifesaver for DreamWorks Animation, which has suffered a string of misfires and, after a downsizing, will not release another movie until next year.“Home,” which features the vocal talents of Rihanna, Jennifer Lopez and Jim Parsons, received mixed reviews, but its release was flawlessly timed; there has been a shortage of family offerings in theaters and many children are out of school on spring break. Racially diverse characters may have also helped “Home,” which cost $135 million to make and was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Most big-budget animated movies (and live-action ones, for that matter) are focused on white characters.The R-rated “Get Hard,” starring Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, arrived with an estimated $34.6 million in ticket sales, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. Going into the weekend, analysts had predicted that “Get Hard” had a solid shot at first place. The total nonetheless gave Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Hart the largest R-rated opening of their careers, Warner Bros. said.A version of this article appears in print on 03/30/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Arts, Briefly; Family-Friendly u2018Homeu2019 Takes Top Box Office Spot.
