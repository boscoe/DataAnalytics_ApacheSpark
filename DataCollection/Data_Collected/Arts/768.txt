Anticipating what it believes will be a holiday bump for an already packed exhibition, the Museum of Modern Art will soon begin a timed-ticket program for “Picasso Sculpture,” its survey of more than 60 years of Picasso’s work in three dimensions.There is no surcharge beyond the regular museum admission price ($25 for adults) for the tickets. The system will go into effect Nov. 10, but tickets were to become available Monday at the museum or online, at moma.org. It is not the first time the museum has used timed tickets to even the flow of crowds into popular shows, but it is the first time such a program has been put in place after a show opened. (For “Tim Burton,” in 2009-2010, timed tickets were optional when the exhibition opened, but became required later because of high attendance.)Margaret Doyle, a spokeswoman for the museum, said that Picasso attendance — an average of nearly 6,000 visitors each day, with the largest crowds from Friday through Sunday — was meeting officials’ original projections, “so this move is more proactive than reactive.”“The reaction to the exhibition has been overwhelmingly positive,” she said, “so we anticipate that it will grow during the busy holiday season.”
