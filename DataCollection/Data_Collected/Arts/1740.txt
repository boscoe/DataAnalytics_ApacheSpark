Their trio, sometimes billed as ACS, works with a go-anywhere derivation of the mainstream acoustic jazz tradition, grounded but elastic.

(Nate Chinen)★ Kenny Barron Quartet (Tuesday through Dec. 27) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical and sure-footed piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting. For this engagement, he has his trustworthy rhythm team — the bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and the drummer Johnathan Blake — along with the impressive young flutist Elena Pinderhughes and the deftly intuitive vibraphonist Steve Nelson. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.

His quartet includes the pianist Barney McAll, the bassist James King and the drummer Greg Bandy. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementBig Band Holidays (Friday and Saturday) Jazz at Lincoln Center’s holiday concert has become a seasonal staple in New York, a festive showcase for the organization’s house orchestra. As on “Big Band Holidays,” a new compilation culled from the last several years’ worth of concerts, the band will play zesty arrangements of songs like “We Three Kings,” with vocal reinforcements — in this case, from Denzal Sinclaire and Audrey Shakir. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Cameron Brown 70th Birthday Bash (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Brown, a bassist of sterling, far-ranging credentials, celebrates a personal milestone just a few days early with this weekend run. On Friday he features a close musical acquaintainces of more than 40 years, the fearless singer Sheila Jordan, in a group that also includes Dave Ballou on trumpet and Don Byron on clarinet. On Saturday he lets the band he calls Danny’s Calypso, with the trumpeter Russ Johnson, the drummer Tony Jefferson and the tenor saxophonists Lisa Parrott and Jason Rigby. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Katie Bull (Saturday) Ms. Bull, a lyrically and musically adventurous jazz vocalist, has a new album, “All Hot Bodies Radiate,” that captures the intense breadth of her artistry. She’ll focus on that material in this performance, with a band consisting of the saxophonist Joel Frahm, the keyboardist Landon Knoblock, the bassist Ratzo Harris and the drummer George Schuller. At 7 p.m., ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com. (Chinen)★ Bill Charlap and Renee Rosnes (through Sunday) Mr. Charlap and Ms. Rosnes are jazz pianists of comparable achievement; since 2007 they have also been partners by marriage. Their collaborative history is distinguished, including the album “Double Portrait” and portions of the latest triumph by Tony Bennett. They’re performing this week in a strictly duo format, notwithstanding the possibility of an unexpected guest or two. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Freddy Cole Quartet with Harry Allen (Tuesday through Dec. 26) A charismatic and urbane vocalist, Mr. Cole treats the standard songbook with easygoing grace. He also plays piano in his quartet, with the guitarist Randy Napoleon, the bassist Elias Bailey and the drummer Curtis Boyd. Their featured guest is Mr. Allen, a tenor saxophonist of mellifluous charm. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)‘DIVA Jazz Orchestra Celebrates Ella Fitzgerald’s Swingin’ Christmas’ (Friday through Sunday) “Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas,” released 55 years ago, is still one of the greatest jazz holiday albums ever made, which raises high expectations for this weekend run. But the DIVA Jazz Orchestra is a big band of power and precision, and it will have several strong singers in the rotation: Camille Thurman, Christine Fawson and Sue Giles. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org/dizzys.

On drums is Rudy Royston, capably filling in for Antonio Sanchez. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Club Bonafide, 212 East 52nd Street, 646-918-6189, clubbonafide.com. (Chinen)★ Gotham Holiday Swing (Friday) Continuing a Town Hall holiday custom, this concert will feature as its house band the New Orleans jazz-and-funk outfit Butler, Bernstein & the Hot 9. Its host will be Buster Poindexter, recently seen to rousing effect in Netflix’s Bill Murray holiday special, “A Very Murray Christmas.” Among the evening’s many guest performers are the singers Madeleine Peyroux, Terry Reid and Raul Midón; the alternative-rock band Mercury Rev; and the producer Hal Willner, who knows a thing or two about unlikely assemblages of talent. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, thetownhall.org. (Chinen)Mark Guiliana Jazz Quartet (Friday) This was another year in which the drummer Mark Guiliana elevated the basic function of groove; perhaps you heard him on the mind-bending new single by David Bowie. But with his pointedly named Jazz Quartet, which recently released an album called “Family First,” Mr. Guiliana shifts his emphasis toward melody and interplay, with the tenor saxophonist Jason Rigby, the pianist Shai Maestro and the bassist Chris Morrissey. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementDick Hyman (Monday and Tuesday) Mr. Hyman, 88, has earned a rare stature as a solo pianist, in performance and on releases like “Dick Hyman’s Century of Jazz Piano,” which is about as sprawling and erudite as it sounds. This two-night run will feature him alone with a core premise: jazz standards and stride piano, offered with flair. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)Jessica Jones Quartet (Monday) No, not that Jessica Jones; unlike the tormented Marvel superhero with the namesake Netflix series, this one plays tenor saxophone and has a new album titled “Moxie.” Ms. Jones celebrates the album’s release, leading a reunited version of her quartet, featuring her husband, Tony Jones, also on tenor saxophone; Stomu Takeishi on bass; and Kenny Wollesen on drums. At 8:15 p.m., ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com. (Chinen)Ned Rothenberg’s ‘Inner Diaspora’ Quintet (Friday) Mr. Rothenberg is a saxophonist, clarinetist, flutist and composer with a penchant for insistent frictions. As on his 2007 album “Inner Diaspora,” released as part of the Radical Jewish Culture series on Tzadik, he performs here with Erik Friedlander on cello, Mark Feldman on violin and Jerome Harris on guitars and bass; joining them is the percussionist Satoshi Takeishi. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)Mark Sherman Quartet (Friday and Saturday) The vibraphonist Mark Sherman favors an assertive strain of postbop, crisp and clear. He has enlisted some of the best possible partners for that style: the bassist Ray Drummond, the drummer Carl Allen and either of two articulate pianists: Bruce Barth on Friday, or Helen Sung, on Saturday. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Dayna Stephens (Saturday) Mr. Stephens, a tenor saxophonist and composer of judicious exuberance, leads a post-bop quintet with Philip Dizack on trumpet, Theo Hill on piano, Harish Raghavan on bass and Johnathan Blake on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Matt Wilson’s Christmas Tree-O Featuring Jason Moran (Tuesday and Wednesday) The drummer Matt Wilson has spent most of the last few weeks on tour with the saxophonist and clarinetist Jeff Lederer and the bassist Paul Sikivie, drawing from their exuberant and clever 2010 album, “Matt Wilson’s Christmas Tree-O.” Joining here as a special guest is the pianist Jason Moran, who’s equally equipped to bring some sly delirium to a tune like “You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch.” At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com.
