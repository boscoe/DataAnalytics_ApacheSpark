The Worcester Art Museum, in Massachusetts, which is in the process of recasting itself as more than a small imitator of its grander neighbors, has received $4 million to remove some of its daily costs and create some room for growth.The gift, from the Myles and C. Jean McDonough Foundation, is one of seven from the foundation totaling $15.25 million for Worcester-area cultural institutions, such as the American Antiquarian Society and the Tower Hill Botanic Garden. Ms. McDonough has a long history with the museum, as a docent and member of its board.“She’s been an ongoing supporter of this institution,” said Matthias Waschek, the museum’s director. “She really sees the Worcester Art Museum as a place that contributes to the quality of life in our city.”Mr. Waschek said the money will cover the endowment for his own position, which will free up money to address overhead costs like electricity and heat. “All these things are very unsexy,” he said, “but normally you can’t get funding for them.”In recent years, the museum’s donor base has shrunk; Worcester was built on manufacturing wealth, but the economy has shifted. “It’s a completely different ballgame,” Mr. Waschek said. “We need to think about how we make the museum sustainable.”Part of that, he added, means changing the museum’s mission so it doesn’t strive to imitate giants like Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The smaller Worcester Art Museum, which was founded in 1896, has a collection of 38,000 works and an endowment of about $20 million to buy art. Shaping a new mission — not to mention making it a reality — requires a jump-start, Mr. Waschek said. “This endowment will help us and give us some breathing room.”A version of this article appears in print on 10/07/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Worcester Art Museum Gets $4 Million Gift.
