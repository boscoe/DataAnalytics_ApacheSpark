The Red Bull Music Academy Festival offers three full-scale genre immersions this week: in dancehall, noise and what might be called avant-garde ambience. The first is free: on Sunday at 1 p.m. at Fort Greene Park, where “Yardcore: Brooklyn Bashment,” savors the connections between Jamaica and New York. It features King Jammy, the Jamaican producer whose collaboration with Wayne Smith on “Under Mi Sleng Teng” gave dancehall a new electronic sound. A six-hour marathon of noise — as assault, experiment, improvisation, torment and catharsis — features Merzbow, Pharmakon, Prurient and Genesis P-Orridge (performing the Psychic TV album “Electric Newspapers”) at 10 p.m. Wednesday at Output, 74 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg. On Friday, Tri Angle Records celebrates its fifth anniversary with nine acts including Haxan Cloak, Forest Swords and Evian Christ. They’re primarily electronic musicians creating soundscapes that can be darkly immersive and push you around; 10 p.m., 23 Wall Street, redbullmusicacademy.com.A version of this article appears in print on May 10, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Pop; An Assault of Sounds.
