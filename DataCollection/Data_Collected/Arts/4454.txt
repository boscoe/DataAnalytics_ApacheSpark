In The New York Times Book Review, Sam Tanenhaus reviews Zachary Leader’s “The Life of Saul Bellow: To Fame and Fortune, 1915-1964.” Mr. Tanenhaus writes:Leader suggests he can give a more accurate picture of Bellow because he met him just once, in 1972, at a garden party in Cambridge, Mass., at which Bellow was a glamorous guest, better dressed than everyone else: “I was a graduate student in English and a fan of his writing so I joined the circle and listened for a while. I remember nothing of what he said.” The confession, or boast, hints ominously of boredom, or at least disconnection. For Leader, Saul Bellow is a foreign language, studied through grammar books but not mastered. The nearly 650 pages of his text feel longer — a lumpen mass of undigested and half-formed thoughts, of dreary rote readings and faulty construals.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Tanenhaus discusses “The Life of Saul Bellow”; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; Emily Bazelon discusses Jon Krakauer’s “Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
