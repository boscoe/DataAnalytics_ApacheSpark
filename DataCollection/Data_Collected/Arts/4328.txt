Her pursuit of tough inharmonious motifs is ambitious, but too often leaves her work looking brittle and contrived, as if she were avoiding traditional beauty yet declining to find an alternative.This impressive show of canvases made by Ms. von Heyl in the five years before she moved from Düsseldorf to New York in late 1995 gives us this ambition in youthful form — erudite, heavy-handed and overly serious, sifting through early Modernism with a sure command of scale if too little in the way of fun or spontaneity. Cubism triumphs in a tumble of clunky brown forms against white; a female silhouette reminiscent of Malevich’s early and late figurative styles forms the center of a blue-green and black work amped up by an arc of fluorescent orange. Everywhere painting methods are varied: Note that the gray of the water carrier’s inverted water-drop skirt has little round dots turned three-dimensional by a dusting of black spray paint.The artist seems to have had the most fun in two canvases. In one, a large outlined palette seems to be landing on a bourgeois easy chair (possibly Matisse’s) upholstered in plaid. In the other, a bright yellow ladder seems almost to pop off the canvas thanks to its crisp shadow. But fun is most transcendent in a small 1995 painting by the reception desk in which a woman’s face is mostly veiled by a thin layer of white paint with an actual D.I.Y. fringe. It’s a weird image, beautiful in its own way as most things that lastingly hold our attention are, and it has an ease and generosity that Ms. von Heyl has not yet fully explored.Petzel 35 East 67th Street, Manhattan Through May 2 Advertisement
