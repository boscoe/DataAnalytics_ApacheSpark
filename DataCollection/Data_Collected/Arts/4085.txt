One of the most energetic sets at Coachella last weekend was by the British band Florence and the Machine, led by Florence Welch. On Sunday, previewing songs from the band’s next album, “How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful,” Ms. Welch strutted and skipped across the stage in a flowing white pantsuit, and leaped repeatedly off the stage to convene with the screaming crowd.Apparently she leaped a little too energetically, because on Tuesday, Ms. Welch announced on her Facebook page that she had broken her foot.“I’m so sorry to say that after what was one of my favourite shows ever at Coachella, I have discovered I have broken my foot from leaping off the stage,” she wrote. “Unfortunately while this heals, my performances will have to be somewhat stripped back.”The good news: She is not canceling any shows. Ms. Welch and her band are scheduled to play in Los Angeles on Wednesday, at the Theater at the Ace Hotel, and return on Sunday for the second weekend of Coachella. Then in June, after the album is released, she has a number of major festival dates booked, including the Governors Ball in New York and Bonnaroo in Tennessee. She said she would be “back on my feet” by Glastonbury, the huge British festival that runs June 24 to 28.“This album was so much about making something from what was broken,” she added, “so let’s see what we can do with this.”
