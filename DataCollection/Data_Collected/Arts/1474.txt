This season, the pianist Evgeny Kissin’s series is happily varied — most interesting, an evening of Yiddish poetry and piano works by Jewish composers, coming later this month. A few weeks ago, he again proved his solo credentials with a rare repeated recital, and there’s Rachmaninoff to come with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in the spring.So what did we learn about Mr. Kissin on Thursday night? Not a lot. It’s no surprise that if you combine him with the violinist Itzhak Perlman and the cellist Mischa Maisky, and have them play piano trios by Schubert and Tchaikovsky in a celebrity chamber concert, you can pack Stern Auditorium. (This was only their second performance together.) A standing ovation was inevitable, given the stature of the artists, but it seemed more polite than effusive, a mark of just how turgid their collaboration turned out to be.Sure, Mr. Kissin was his usual, implacable self, serene in the Schubert (his B flat) and powerful in the Tchaikovsky, with no hint of the heavy-handedness that can often creep into Tchaikovsky’s piano part. If Mr. Maisky’s typically extroverted physicality seemed constrained, his playing remained sturdy. Mr. Perlman, though, was wholly out of place, slathering every phrase in treacly, overpowering vibrato.To be a musical success, an impromptu collaboration like this one requires either a meeting of similar aesthetic philosophies or a creative tension among them. Here, nobody took the initiative to lead, yet nobody was entirely willing to blend. The stars, in other words, didn’t align.Advertisement
