A new play with music by Pulitzer Prize winner Paula Vogel, about a controversial moment in Jewish cultural history, and two other world premieres by up-and-coming women playwrights will be part of Yale Repertory Theater’s 2015-16 season.Ms. Vogel’s “Indecent,” created with Rebecca Taichman, who will also direct, looks at the fallout from the 1923 Broadway production of Sholem Asch’s 1907 melodrama “God of Vengeance,” for which the entire cast was arrested on obscenity charges. A coproduction with La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, it will run in New Haven in October and then move west.Also in the Yale Rep season: Jiehae Park’s “peerless,” about twin  sisters who go to great lengths to get into the right college; and “The Moors,” by Jen Silverman, a contemporary riff on gothic romances and their authors. A production of “Cymbeline” directed by Evan Yionoulis, and Dianne Wiest in Samuel Beckett’s “Happy Days,” directed by James Bundy,  round out the Yale Rep season.   A version of this article appears in print on 03/21/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Paula Vogel Play for Yale Rep Season.
