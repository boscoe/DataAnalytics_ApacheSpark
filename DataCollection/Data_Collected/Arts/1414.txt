Leonard Slatkin, who rebuilt the Detroit Symphony Orchestra after a bitter strike and helped make it a point of much-needed civic pride through its innovative web streaming of concerts and its engaging programming, will step down as music director after the 2017-18 season to become its music director laureate, the orchestra announced Thursday.“We’re in a very good place now,” Mr. Slatkin, 71, said in an interview this week, in which he said that he hoped to take on more guest-conducting appearances and write more books in the extra time he will have once he leaves the steps down as music director.As Detroit’s music director laureate — a new title — Mr. Slatkin will remain with the orchestra through at least the 2019-20 season. In the new position he will program and conduct four weeks a season and advise on artistic matters and personnel decisions. Mr. Slatkin said that he was also in talks about his future at his other ensemble, the Orchestre National de Lyon.His tenure, which began in 2008, was momentous for the Detroit Symphony. The orchestra had a bitter strike in the 2010-11 season, which took hard work to rebuild from; more than 30 musicians have joined the ensemble, including a new crop of principal players; the orchestra began its ambitious “Live from Orchestra Hall” webcasts; and the orchestra  became a national leader in programming new and modern American music alongside the classics.As the orchestra embarks on a search for a new music director Mr. Slatkin said the ideal candidate would need to “believe in the mission” and be open to the experiments the ensemble has begun — which have helped raise its national reputation and made it a beacon in Detroit as the city has gone through hard times, including bankruptcy, and struggled to rebuild itself.“There’s still a lot to do,” he said.
