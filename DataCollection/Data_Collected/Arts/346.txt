In The New York Times Book Review, Luc Sante reviews Richard McGuire’s “Here,” a graphic novel that tracks the changes that occur over billions of years in the space occupied by Mr. McGuire’s childhood living room. Mr. Sante writes:Adventurous novelists have been mashing up time in their works for a century, at least since Albert Einstein formulated his general theory of relativity and was semi-understood by the world. Filmmakers followed a couple of generations later; think of Chris Marker’s “La Jetée” or Alain Resnais’s “Muriel,” for example. But novels and movies are handicapped in their presentation of simultaneity by the fact that they are shackled to time themselves, in the physical unfolding of their narratives. The comic strip or graphic novel, however, is allowed to run free across space as well. In “Here,” McGuire has introduced a third dimension to the flat page. He can poke holes in the space-time continuum simply by imposing frames that act as trans­temporal windows into the larger frame that stands for the provisional now. “Here” is the ­comic-book equivalent of a scientific breakthrough.On this week’s podcast, Mr. McGuire talks about “Here”; John Williams has news from the literary world and feedback from readers; Simon Parkin discusses two new books about gaming; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Parul Sehgal, filling in for Pamela Paul, is the host.
