PARIS – A  court ruled on Thursday that it had jurisdiction over Facebook in the case of a teacher who sued the company after he was suspended from the social network for posting a picture of a famous nude painting. Facebook argued that the site’s terms of service, which users consent to when they sign up, state that any legal disputes will be handled by courts in California, where the company is based. But the court, in Paris, ruled that the terms were unfair to French users, asserting that it had jurisdiction over Facebook as a result. It was at least the second such ruling in France in recent years.The case was begun four years ago by a Parisian teacher, identified in media reports as Frédéric Durand-Baïssas. His Facebook account was suspended in February 2011 after he posted a link to a documentary on Gustave Courbet’s painting “The Origin of the World,” which included a picture of the painting and its depiction of a woman’s genitalia.Facebook does not allow users to share pornographic content and places limitations on displaying nudity. An appeals court in the southwestern French city of Pau had already ruled in 2012 that Facebook was answerable to French courts, arguing that Facebook’s terms of service were so long and difficult to read that the clause conferring exclusive jurisdiction to a Californian court was impossible to knowingly consent to.This new ruling will strengthen the precedent for future cases. It also comes at a time when Facebook is facing scrutiny from European Union regulators for its privacy policies and is under increased pressure from Western governments who want access to its data for counter-terrorism purposes.“We are hoping that this will finally enable all Internet users, not just users of Facebook, to consider that all these tech giants, whatever their terms of service, are not shielded from French jurisdiction,” the plaintiff’s lawyer, Stéphane Cottineau, said.  He said that the merits of the case probably would not be decided for a year.
