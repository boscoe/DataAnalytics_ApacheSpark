Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet seemed like the dance company that had it all: a wealthy benefactor, generous contracts and benefits for its dancers, and a snazzy Chelsea home. But on Friday company officials announced that the troupe would shut down. “We are sad to announce the closing of Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet,’’ the company announced on its website. “It has been our honor to work with some of the best dancers and choreographers in the world and we thank all of our valued employees who helped create many inspirational productions over the years.” It was not immediately clear what led to the decision to close.The company said that it still intended to fulfill  its coming engagements in Boston in May and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in June, but that its summer program would be canceled, along with  auditions planned for the end of March. The closing was first reported by The New York Observer. Cedar Lake was founded by Nancy Laurie, a Walmart heiress and dance fan, and early on it distinguished itself from other companies by offering its dancers an almost unheard-of 52-week contract (many top ballet companies do not pay their dancers year-round), along with health insurance and vacation pay. But the company also had other unusual practices that drew the ire of some dancers and union officials: It fined dancers. In 2005 those fines ran to $5 a minute for being late to class, and  $50 for changing choreography or missing an entrance.  “We founded the Cedar Lake Dance company in 2003 to create a home for some of the best dancers and choreographers in the world to showcase their extraordinary talents,” Ms. Laurie said in an emailed statement.  She called working with the company members “both an immense honor and a privilege,” adding, “While we are saddened by its closing, we are extremely proud of their great accomplishments over the years.”
