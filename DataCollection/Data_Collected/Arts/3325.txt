Years of performing on live TV is probably the best practice one can have for the job of hosting a widely televised award show. In recent years “Saturday Night Live’ alumni like Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, and Seth Meyers have all hosted a major award show. (Ms. Poehler and Ms. Fey did the Golden Globes for three years in a row and Mr. Meyers was the host of the 2014 Emmys.)Andy Samberg is the latest “SNL” performer to join that gang. It was announced Thursday evening that Mr. Samberg, current star of “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” would serve as emcee for this year’s Emmy Awards.The Sept. 20 ceremony will be broadcast on Fox — per a longstanding agreement the show rotates to a different network each year. Emmy nominations will be announced July 16.In a statement Mr. Samberg said: “Buckle your seat belts, Emmy viewers! Like, in general you should buckle your seat belts in your car. In fact, even if you’re not an Emmy viewer, you should buckle your seat belt. It can be dangerous on the road. Also, if you’re not an Emmy viewer, you should strongly consider becoming one this year, because I’m hosting, and it’s gonna be a wild ride. So buckle your seat belts.”
