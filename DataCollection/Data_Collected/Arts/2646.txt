In the 28 years since they were established the Martin E. Segal Awards have involved a low-key luncheon that honors two rising artists chosen by two of Lincoln Center’s 11 resident organizations. Each was awarded $7,500, to be used for career advancement and future study.This year the event is ramping things up. The awards will be presented at a gala event in Alice Tully Hall on March 2 — hosted by Audra McDonald — to 11 honorees: Inon Barnatan, a pianist; Sheldon Best, an actor; Julia Bullock, a soprano; the Escher String Quartet;  Ying Fang, a soprano; Silas Farley, a dancer; Alec Knight, a dancer; Claire Kretzschmar, a dancer; Matías Piñeiro, a filmmaker; Camille Thurman, a musician; and Shai Wosner, a pianist.The evening’s presenters will be the composer Jason Robert Brown (himself a former Segal Award winner); Louis Langrée, the Mostly Mozart Festival’s music director; and Tiler Peck and Robert Fairchild, New York City Ballet dancers.The award was established for Martin E. Segal, a former chairman of Lincoln Center, who died in 2012.  Past winners include the pianist Jonathan Biss, the theater director Thomas Kail, the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon and the conductor Xian Zhang.A version of this article appears in print on 02/11/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Martin Segal Awards Expand Field of Honorees.
