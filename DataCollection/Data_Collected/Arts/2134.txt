The 2015 Richard H. Driehaus Prize — which recognizes classic architecture in modern society — has been awarded to the architect David M. Schwarz. Mr. Schwarz will be awarded the prize, for $200,000, on March 21 in Chicago.In conjunction with the prize, presented by the school of architecture at the University of Notre Dame, Dr. Richard J. Jackson, an environmental health expert, will receive the $50,000 Henry Hope Reed Award, given annually to an individual working outside architecture “who has supported the cultivation of the traditional city, its architecture and art through writing, planning or promotion.”Mr. Schwarz, the president and chief executive of David M. Schwarz Architects in Washington, “has succeeded in establishing a renewed and spirited dialogue about the nature of architecture and urbanism in the post-war period,” said Michael Lykoudis, the prize’s chairman and the dean of Notre Dame’s school of architecture. “He has woven traditional principles with modernity throughout various scales and building types that characterize our contemporary world.”Among other things, Mr. Schwarz designed the American Airlines Center in Dallas, the master plan for the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Tex.A version of this article appears in print on 01/16/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Washington Architect Wins $200,000 Prize.
