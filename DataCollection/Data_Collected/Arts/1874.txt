Five premieres spread across a variety of disciplines, from theater to dance, are in store for the inaugural Tilt Kids Festival, a collaboration between the French Institute Alliance Française and Cultural Services of the French Embassy.The festival, a springtime complement to the French Institute’s more avant-garde Crossing the Line event in the fall, runs from March 4 to April 3 at different theaters and gallery spaces around the city, including the New Victory Theater, BAM Fisher and the recently opened Museum of Food and Drink.The premieres include “The Total People,” the first work made for children by the Brooklyn-based theater company 600 Highwaymen. (The troupe is also included in the lineup for the Public Theater’s coming Under the Radar festival.) Other highlights include the U.S. debuts of the interdisciplinary “Cabaret de Magie Nouvelle” by the Parisian artists Cie 12:40, as well as the Australian circus company Circa’s acrobatic take on Saint-Saëns’s “Carnival of the Animals.”On March 19, the free event “Carousel of Ideas” brings together three choreographers — Jérôme Bel, Miguel Gutierrez and Bouchra Ouizguen — and the philosopher Simon Critchley for exercises for the mind and body at the  Albertine bookstore. Mr. Bel will present his interactive work “Ballet,” commissioned in the fall for Performa 15, in which he gave instructions to a cast of mostly unprofessional dancers in art galleries and theaters around New York.The full lineup and tickets are available at tiltkidsfestival.org.
