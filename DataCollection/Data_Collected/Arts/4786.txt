Music conservatories have a reputation for being high-minded purveyors of elite art. Countering this rap, the Manhattan School of Music announced that in fall 2016 it would begin to offer a degree program in musical theater.“Like jazz, which MSM introduced to its academic programs in 1984, musical theater is New York, part of the city’s heartbeat,” James Gandre, the school’s president, said in a statement. “It’s the ‘great’ in the Great White Way.”According to the school, it will be just the second independent conservatory in the country with a musical theater degree option. (The other is the Boston Conservatory.) Susan Stroman, Bebe Neuwirth, Kelli O’Hara and Shuler Henley, a Manhattan School alumnus, are among the starry names on the advisory committee. The program will be directed by Luis Perez, an actor, dancer, choreographer and fight director who has led the musical theater program at Roosevelt University in Chicago since 2008.A version of this article appears in print on 05/16/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Music School Announces Musical Theater Degree.
