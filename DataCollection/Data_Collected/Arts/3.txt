Amid the wanton destruction of antiquities in Syria and elsewhere, the group that represents museum directors on Thursday proposed a set of protocols to help cultural institutions understand how they can provide safe haven for valuable works of art and archaeological relics that are at risk of being damaged, destroyed or looted.Under the protocols outlined by the Association of Art Museum Directors, owners whose works are endangered because of terrorism, violent conflict or natural disasters could request that the items be held by a member museum until conditions improved enough for their safe return. Once transferred, these works would be treated as loans, an arrangement that would assuage those concerns that the pieces would never be repatriated.“The scale of human suffering and loss of life that is taking place in Syria and other afflicted areas is devastating, and is compounded by the loss of unique works that are the record of different cultures and our shared humanity,” Johnnetta Cole, president of the museum directors association, said in a statement.Ms. Cole, who is also director of the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, added, “The level of destruction and the intentional damage is deplorable and an attempt to eradicate cultural identity in tandem with the murder and repression of individuals.”The directors association said it has urged its 240 members in the United States, Canada and Mexico to adopt the “Protocols for Safe Havens for Works of Cultural Significance from Countries in Crisis.”According to the protocols, which total more than a dozen, museums providing safe haven should make the works available to scholars and may exhibit them to the public, depending on the preferences of the owners or the depositors.A version of this article appears in print on 10/02/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Saving Antiquities.
