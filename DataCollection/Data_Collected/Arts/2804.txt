LONDON — At a moment when libraries and archives in the Middle East face threats of damage and destruction from war and ideology, the British Library has announced that it has now made four million images from its Endangered Archives program available online.The initiative, established in 2004 and supported by the Arcadia Fund, has so far financed 246 projects in 78 countries, attempting to preserve manuscripts, records, newspapers, photographs, sound archives and even rock inscriptions that are at risk of loss or deterioration. “What’s at stake is what beliefs and biases will shape the way history is told,” Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times in a 2012 article about the Great Mosque in Djenné, Mali, and the Endangered Archives program’s attempt to preserve and digitize the thousands of Arabic manuscripts housed in the mosque and in the city.A complete list of projects as well as newly available images can be seen on the program’s website. A new publication, “From Dust to Digital: Ten Years of the Endangered Archives Programme,” which includes firsthand accounts from 19 projects, is available  from Open Book Publishers, either to read  free online or for purchase in print. In a news statement, Dr. Maja Kominko, the cultural grants manager at the Arcadia Fund and the editor of the book, said that these “showcase the interest, the historical significance and research potential of the digitized collections.”
