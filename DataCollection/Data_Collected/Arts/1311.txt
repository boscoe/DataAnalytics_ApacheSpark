The band seems likely to draw here from its three fine albums on the ECM label — but Mr. Berne likes to spring new music on his audiences, which means all bets are off. Thursday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. Next Friday at 8 p.m., I-Beam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Nate Chinen)Terence Blanchard E-Collective (through Sunday) On his brooding new album, “Breathless,” the trumpeter Terence Blanchard takes both a plunge into electric fusion and a foray into sociopolitical protest. (Its title refers to the phrase “I Can’t Breathe,” a rallying cry against police brutality after the death of Eric Garner.) He draws from this well with a young band featuring Fabian Almazan on piano and synthesizer, Charles Altura on guitar, Donald Ramsey on bass and Oscar Seaton on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Jane Ira Bloom Quartet (Friday) On her most recent album, “Sixteen Sunsets,” the soprano saxophonist Jane Ira Bloom explores an all-ballads repertory, finding room in the format for horizon-scanning restlessness as well as the reassurance of lyricism. Her partners in this one-nighter are Dominic Fallacaro on piano, Cameron Brown on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementEtienne Charles: ‘Creole Christmas’ (Wednesday) Mr. Charles, a Trinidadian trumpeter, has found a strong niche in the mutual exchange between jazz and calypso, and on his new album, “Creole Christmas,” he applies that interest toward songs like the Mighty Spoiler’s “Father Christmas.” Drawing from that album, he leads a crew that includes the trombonist Corey Wilcox and the vocalist Keith Prescott, a.k.a. Keet Styla. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Nate Chinen)AdvertisementRomain Collin (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Collin, a prepossessing young French pianist, has a new album, “Press Enter,” that confirms his strength in a style often described as “cinematic” — distinguished by dark grandeur, dynamic swells and a chamberesque layering of texture. He largely draws from the album in this weekend run with a trio featuring Harish Raghavan on bass and Clarence Penn on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)Fourplay: ‘Blue & Silver Holiday Celebration’ (Tuesday through Dec. 6) Fourplay, a gleaming standard-bearer for smooth jazz, is celebrating its 25th anniversary with an aptly titled new album, “Silver,” and a related tour. The band still features three of its accomplished charter members — the pianist Bob James, the bassist Nathan East and the drummer Harvey Mason — alongside the well-traveled guitarist Chuck Loeb. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Rob Garcia 4 (Tuesday) The drummer Rob Garcia explores a sonorous but elastic brand of acoustic postbop with this quartet, which includes the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger, the pianist Gary Versace and the bassist Masa Kamaguchi. At 9:30 p.m., ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com. (Chinen)Wycliffe Gordon & Friends (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Gordon, a trombonist, trumpeter, singer and one-man jubilation engine, settles in for a Thanksgiving-week engagement at his second home. He’ll be in good company, with the pianist Ehud Asherie, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Alvin Atkinson Jr. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola; Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Joel Harrison and Infinite Possibility (Tuesday) Mr. Harrison, a prolific and broad-minded guitarist-composer, released his first large-ensemble album, “Infinite Possibility,” a couple of years ago. The band, well stocked with adaptable players like the multi-reedist Ben Kono and the percussionist James Shipp, regroups to perform a new batch of his music in this concert, including a suite titled “America at War.” At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org.

On Saturday Mr. Horvitz performs duos with the dancer-choreographer Yukio Suzuki and the saxophonist and electronic artist Briggan Krauss. That concert also includes a performance of Mr. Horvitz’s music by the Westerlies, a spruce young brass quartet made of players he has mentored. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)Hush Point (Friday and Saturday) A collective jointly led by John McNeil, a trumpeter of dry wit and lyrical concision, and Jeremy Udden, a saxophonist of fluid introspection, Hush Point recently released a strong second album, “Blues and Reds.” The group’s rhythm team, as on the album, consists of the bassist Aryeh Kobrinsky and the drummer Anthony Pinciotti. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Christian McBride Trio (Tuesday through Dec. 6) The bassist Christian McBride holds fast to a mood of generous bonhomie with his trio, which recently released a live album recorded in this room. The band features Christian Sands, a pianist of urgent effervescence, and Jerome Jennings, a crisply capable drummer (filling in for Ulysses Owens Jr.) At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Jason Moran and the Bandwagon (through Sunday) Mr. Moran, the pianist and composer, has been even busier than usual in recent weeks: presenting new work at the Venice Biennale; programming events at the Kennedy Center; touring with several projects; unveiling a new label. The Bandwagon, his trio with the bassist Tarus Mateen and the drummer Nasheet Waits, still represents his baseline, which isn’t at all to imply that it has stopped pushing boundaries or taking risks. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Maria Schneider Orchestra (Friday and Saturday) Led by Ms. Schneider, a composer and orchestrator of penetrating insight, this group has an ambitiously realized new album — “The Thompson Fields,” its first release in eight years — that underscores its stature as the pre-eminent large ensemble of our time. The music from the album, much of it inspired by nature, will be a primary focus in this annual Thanksgiving-week engagement, an institution in and of itself. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Arturo Sandoval: ‘Dear Diz (Every Day I Think of You): A Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie’ (Wednesday) Arturo Sandoval, a Cuban trumpeter of stratospheric power, has long harbored a deep admiration for Gillespie, the bebop exemplar who served for some years as his mentor. This concert, presented by the World Music Institute, will make the homage explicit, as Mr. Sandoval leads a band that includes Kemuel Roig on piano, John Belzaguy on bass and Johnny Friday on drums. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500, 92y.org. (Chinen)★ Saxophone Summit (Tuesday through Dec. 5) The prominent postbop saxophonists David Liebman, Joe Lovano and Greg Osby constitute the front line of this aptly named supergroup. The band’s rhythm section, no less distinguished, consists of the pianist Phil Markowitz, the bassist Cecil McBee and the drummer Billy Hart. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Steve Davis Sextet: A Tribute to J.J. (Friday through Sunday) The trombonist Steve Davis pays homage to J.J. Johnson, a giant of his instrument, with an ace hard-bop band that features the trumpeter Eddie Henderson, the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, the pianist Harold Mabern, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Tain + the Strain (Friday and Saturday) The powerfully propulsive drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts has been doubling down as a bandleader and composer, most recently on a self-released album titled “Blue, Vol. 1.” He appears here with a band that includes Aaron Djuan Burnett on tenor saxophone, Theo Hill on piano and Romeir Mendez on bass. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org.
