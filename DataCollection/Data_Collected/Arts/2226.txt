Justin Bieber, the multiplatinum-selling singer and living public service announcement for why young men require powerful adult role models and high automobile insurance rates, does a pretty good job of making fun of himself. Even so, Comedy Central has determined that television viewers needed an event where this 20-year-old pop heartthrob would be made fun of to his face (and could laugh at himself), and has announced that Mr. Bieber will be the headliner and guest of honor at its next “Comedy Central Roast.” The channel, which has previously roasted such enduring celebrities as David Hasselhoff, Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen and James Franco, announced the Bieber event on Tuesday. Kent Alterman, the network’s president of content development and original programming, said in a statement, “Justin has been asking us for a few years to roast him, and we just kept telling him to go create more source material first. We’re thrilled he listened.” No airdate or celebrity panelists were immediately announced, but here’s hoping that Kate McKinnon of “Saturday Night Live” is somehow involved.
