Early on, combining political activism and art, she began in 2002 documenting hate crimes against gays. In 2007, she initiated the portrait series, which is ongoing and forms the centerpiece of “Zanele Muholi: Isibonelo/Evidence” at the Brooklyn Museum, her largest solo show in the United States.Done in black and white, the portraits are tenderly candid studies in individual style and attitude, as well as documents of a hitherto little recorded social phenomenon, a double apartheid involving race and gender. In Brooklyn, Ms. Muholi will also show a photo-and-video series about same-sex marriage among her friends. The time for those weddings, like the time for her arrival in the international spotlight, has emphatically come. (Through Nov. 1, 718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.)Advertisement
