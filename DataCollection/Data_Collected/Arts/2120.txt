The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston on Tuesday is to reveal designs by Steven Holl Architects for a redevelopment of its 14-acre campus, including a master plan; a 164,000-square-foot-building for 20th- and 21st-century art; and a new, 80,000-square-foot home for the Glassell School of Art.The project also includes preliminary concepts for a conservation center by Lake|Flato Architects and a landscape architect is to be selected. The project, which is to begin later this year and to be completed in 2019, will integrate the new structures into the campus, which already includes a sculpture garden by Isamu Noguchi and buildings by William Ward Watkin, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Rafael Moneo.The museum will also announce that $330 million — more than 73 percent of its $450-million campaign goal — has been raised to date.Remarking on the museum’s “largest transformation yet,” the museum’s director, Gary Tinterow, said in a statement that the renovation “will position us to reshape and reinvigorate the museum experience and the future of Houston’s civic life.”
