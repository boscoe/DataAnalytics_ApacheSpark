Janet Jackson is getting her first chance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, N.W.A. its fourth and the disco band Chic earns a record tenth nomination as the Cleveland museum decides its 2016 induction class. The 15 nominees this year also include first-timers Chicago, the Cars, Cheap Trick, Steve Miller, the J.B.s, Los Lobos and Chaka Khan (who was previously nominated, although not inducted, as a member of Rufus).The other returning acts, thus far kept out of the Hall, are Deep Purple (on its third nomination), Nine Inch Nails (second), the Smiths (second), the Spinners (third) and Yes (second). There is no limit on the number of times an act can be nominated; performers become eligible 25 years after the release of their first recording.The 2016 nominees are a mix of classic rock traditionalism and still-relevant, boundary-pushing acts, in keeping with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s recent push and pull between honoring the genre’s history and incorporating fresh acts from the pop, hip-hop and dance music worlds. Ms. Jackson, for example, is back with a new album and tour, while Nile Rodgers of Chic has worked recently with Daft Punk and Lady Gaga. N.W.A., the pioneering rap group, has fallen short on votes for three straight years, but saw renewed cultural interest in 2015 given the sociopolitical climate and the biopic “Straight Outta Compton.”The Hall of Fame nominating committee is shifting as well after more than a dozen longtime members were removed this summer. The nominating committee has traditionally been made up of about 40 musicians and industry veterans, with attempts to increase diversity among the members in recent years.The inductees for 2016 — selected by a voting body of more than 800 experts — will be announced in December. The ceremony will be held in New York in April 2016, and will be broadcast by HBO later in the year.
