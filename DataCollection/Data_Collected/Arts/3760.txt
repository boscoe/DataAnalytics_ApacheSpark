CreditChang W. Lee/The New York Times        When the Whitney Museum of American Art opens its new building in Manhattan’s meatpacking district on May 1, it’s the big things everyone will notice first: the sweeping views west to the Hudson River; the romantic silhouettes of Manhattan’s wooden water towers; the four outdoor terraces for presenting sculptures, performances and movie screenings; and the tiered profile of its steel-paneled facade, intentionally reminiscent of the Whitney’s Modernist, granite-clad Marcel Breuer building on Madison Avenue, which had been the museum’s home since 1966.Its new digs, designed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano, also offer commodious interior spaces: 50,000 square feet of galleries, unencumbered by structural columns, and huge elevators that are themselves immersive environments, the work of the artist Richard Artschwager.“The game changer is the space,” said Donna De Salvo, the Whitney’s chief curator, standing in one of the raw galleries on a recent wintry afternoon as workmen were erecting walls for the opening show.In its former home, only the fifth floor — some 7,725 square feet — was reserved for the permanent collection, just enough to give the public a tiny taste of the major works the museum owns. Now, 20,500 square feet on the sixth and seventh floors has been dedicated to its holdings, which have grown from 2,000 works 49 years ago to 22,000 works — paintings, sculptures, works-on-paper, photographs, films, videos and installations — today.AdvertisementAlthough the Whitney calls itself a museum of American art, for most of its life it has never had a concrete definition of just what that means. Every inch of new gallery space will be devoted to searching for the soul of American art, using its collection in the most in-depth presentation the museum has ever assembled.AdvertisementIn addition to the Whitney’s signature works — Alexander Calder’s “Circus,” Edward Hopper’s “Early Sunday Morning,” Andy Warhol’s “Green Coca-Cola Bottles,” Georgia O’Keeffe’s “Summer Days” and Jasper Johns’s “Three Flags” — the show will include many areas of collecting that the museum has sought to strengthen in recent years. There are more examples of film and videos by a younger generation of artists, like Cory Arcangel and Paul Chan. There will also be more minority artists, more female artists, a more comprehensive collection of prewar photography and more examples of artist collectives, like Asco, the Chicano collective from Los Angeles. Besides classic American painters like Stuart Davis, Thomas Hart Benton, Marsden Hartley and Florine Stettheimer, there will be many works acquired over the past decade, often by artists in the Whitney’s signature Biennials.Beyond the bravura of the $422 million new building and the rich display of its holdings, there is one small detail likely to be overlooked — a detail that says perhaps as much about the museum’s vision as the new space itself: the wall labels. In addition to providing information about the art, they will also say where the artist who created the work was born and where he or she died, a first for the museum.“Although people have always taken for granted that the Whitney is a museum of American art, we’re trying to signal in a concrete way that who an American artist is has always been open to question,” said Scott Rothkopf, a Whitney curator and its associate director of programs. “Besides, the United States is a country of immigrants, and immigration is one of the most pressing topics in the world today.”The institution’s American roots have long distinguished it from other museums, most notably the Museum of Modern Art, whose exceptional examples of European masters like van Gogh, Picasso, Matisse and Gauguin have been its calling card. Yet 85 years ago, when the heiress and sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney founded the institution, the notion of what could be called American art was as amorphous then as it is now. In 1931, to mark the opening of the museum’s first home, on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village, The New York Times praised what it called the “elastic policy that has governed the purchasing of works of art,” adding that “no attempt has been made to apply any hard-and-fast rules as to what art is manifestly American.”Mr. Rothkopf said, “It’s still a melting pot of artists who have either been born here or lived and worked in the United States for a substantial period of time.” Even the title of the inaugural show — “America Is Hard to See,” taken from a 1951 Robert Frost poem and a 1970 movie directed by Emile de Antonio about Eugene McCarthy’s 1968 presidential campaign — further underscores the difficulty curators have had deciding what constitutes American art now.“Breaking down this monolith has been one of our biggest challenges,” Ms. De Salvo said, sitting in a conference room, a command center of sorts where curators were trying out different ways to organize the opening show, moving miniature paper reproductions of images in various configurations along one wall, like a kind of illustrated workbook. Of the more than 650 pieces, there will be examples ranging from the early years of the 20th century to those made only a year or two ago.Ms. De Salvo pointed out that it was only when Thomas N. Armstrong III was the Whitney’s director — beginning in 1974, for 16 years — that there was a strict rule governing who could be considered an American artist. Back then, he or she had to either have a United States passport or a green card.Donna De Salvo, the chief curator and deputy director for programs at the Whitney Museum of American Art, speaks to the direction the collection has taken over since its beginning in 1930.But that rule was dismissed along with Mr. Armstrong in 1990. It was also during the Armstrong era that the museum considered deaccessioning works from the collection that didn’t meet the strict parameters. It nearly disposed of “Air Mail Stickers,” a 1962 collage by the Japanese-born artist Yayoi Kusama. “She was residing in the United States but was not a citizen,” recalled Dana Miller, curator of the Whitney’s permanent collection. “Fortunately the museum never sold the collage — and now ‘Air Mail Stickers’ is considered one of our iconic works by her,” Ms. Miller added.Advertisement“Air Mail Stickers” will now be in the opening exhibition, along with other recent acquisitions by artists who are not American by birth but have resided here, including “July 4, 1967,” the Whitney’s first work by the Japan-born conceptualist On Kawara, or “Blanco y Verde,” an abstract painting from 1959 by Carmen Herrera, the 99-year-old Cuban-born artist, who now resides in Manhattan.Roughly a quarter of the works on view for the opening have never been exhibited before or haven’t been seen for decades. Some, like “Drawing Restraint 7,” a 1993 video installation by Matthew Barney, or “Whites,” a 1963 sculpture by Ellsworth Kelly, have been languishing in storage; others, including a 2009 untitled painting by Wade Guyton and photographs by Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams, Walker Evans and Man Ray, only recently entered the collection.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But for five years before that, the museum had been holding discussions with artists, scholars and curators from institutions around the world to explore art making today. “We wanted outsiders to point out what we didn’t know and tell us what they considered were glaring omissions in the collection,” said Ms. Miller.The curators also traveled around the country and the world to see how places like Tate Britain in London and the Phillips Collection in Washington, museums devoted to a specific national identity, organized their collections. And they carefully studied places like the Centre Pompidou in Paris to see how they presented broad arcs of Modernism. “We didn’t want to tell a textbook story of canonical movements,” Mr. Rothkopf said, “but be more complex, adding artists who challenged conventional art history.”One big decision the curators agonized over was whether to dispense with the traditional museum practice of devoting separate galleries for drawings and prints; paintings and sculpture; photographs; and film and video — in part because they felt that artists today think and produce across different media.Ultimately they organized the inaugural show chronologically, in 23 different “chapters,” each with its own theme. One of the earliest sections is a homage to the Whitney Studio Club, an exhibition space the museum’s founder created in 1918 to show the work of the American avant-garde. “It brings to life the early days of the museum both as a place for making art and showing artists at work,” Mr. Rothkopf said. On view for the first time will be 13 drawings that Hopper created as part of a life drawing class held there, 11 of which have never been seen before.There are also chapters that explore artists’ relationship to politics in the 1930s, the ’60s and ’70s, as well as the ’90s. One, “Course of Empire,” inspired by a series of paintings by Ed Ruscha, looks at how artists have responded to major global events, including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina and the financial catastrophe of 2008. There will be a drawing by Dana Schutz called “Building the Boat While Sailing,” from 2012, which speaks to the notion of artists trying to navigate life’s tumultuous seas, along with Mr. Ruscha’s 2004 painting “The Old Tool & Die Building,” a comment on American industry in a global age, and “Ruckenfigür,” Glenn Ligon’s neon sign, from 2009, that spells out the word “America.”Pairings may seem surprising. In a chapter on abstraction in the 1960s there will be paintings by Ellsworth Kelly alongside a canvas by Ms. Herrera; both painters were pioneers of Abstraction who each lived in Paris and New York in the 1940s and ’50s. (Among those who didn’t make the cut this time around: Clyfford Still, a leader in the early Abstract Expressionist movement.)Advertisement“It’s a first pass,” Mr. Rothkopf said. Following this exhibition the Whitney will reinstall its collection in rotating displays and include artists who may not initially be on view.A similarly rigorous editing process went into putting together the museum’s new handbook, the first one since 2001. The number of artists represented in the handbook has grown from 282 to 350; 72 were born outside of the United States.“When we were making the selections, we knew the entire collection would be online,” Ms. Miller said, where “the public could see everything, which meant selections for the handbook could be slightly more adventurous. And in some cases we made a slightly bold call, like including a poster created by the Guerrilla Girls that is a comment on the percentage of women in the 1987 Biennial.”Rather than just have one image on the cover, the handbook is a mosaic of work by artists including Asco, Hopper, Ms. Kusama, Alice Neel, Jack Goldstein and Peter Hujar. Like the new Whitney itself, Ms. Miller said, it is intended to be a reflection of “the melting pot of what American is and what art making is today.”A version of this article appears in print on March 29, 2015, on Page AR1 of the New York edition with the headline: Made for America.
