The central work, “It, Heat, Hit,” is a six-minute movie screened in a small, trapezoidal theater built for this show. The film starts with an announcement: The characters are glad you are here; they “need you to exist.” But if you don’t “collaborate,” you’ll be asked to leave. The film then hurtles into a series of jump-cut images that veer from the sensual (a feather grazing the camera lens) to the bucolic (horses and landscapes) and the suggestively violent (objects being chopped).On the wall opposite the mini-theater is a row of texts offering fictional viewer responses. The butcher’s wife thought the film was “modern and different,” and the priest felt “apprehensive, nervous and deeply unsettled.” The ironmonger responded by making a twisted metal object, while the psychoanalyst observed that “the provocation of the gaze provokes sexual satisfaction.”All of this feels familiar. Freud and Lacan are cited in the texts, and the film owes a clear debt to theorists like Roland Barthes, Laura Mulvey and Teresa de Lauretis, and particularly the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard. (There are also echoes of Surrealism, the Situationists, Sophie Calle and Bernadette Corporation.) Nonetheless, the work is seductive — that is, until the last seconds of the film when the pictures disappear and the narrator commands you to leave the room. Suddenly the liberated reader proposed by Barthes in essays like “The Death of the Author” (1967) is banished, and Ms. Prouvost reminds you who’s really in charge of the artwork.Laure Prouvost‘It, Heat, Hit’e-flux311 East Broadway, Lower East SideThrough SaturdayAdvertisement
