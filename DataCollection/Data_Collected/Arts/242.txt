The Wooster Group, an avant-garde New York theater company, is embarking on a three-part exploration of Harold Pinter, one that will include a first-time collaboration with the  choreographer Mark Morris.The company’s director, Elizabeth LeCompte, said the idea for the series had begun when she decided she was finally ready to tackle a production of “The Room,” Pinter’s first play, which a longtime company member, Scott Renderer, had been championing for two decades. “I loved the play, but I couldn’t see it;  I didn’t think we had what we needed,” Ms. LeCompte said. “It’s good for where we are now.”“The Room” was written in 1957; the Wooster Group says its new production will be influenced by stand-up comedy, and will use “tone, inflections and timing” associated with comedic storytelling that the actors observed on a trip to China. The company plans to present “advance showings” of “The Room” in New York from Oct. 28 to Nov. 14; it will then stage the production from Feb. 4 to 14 in Los Angeles, and  next season in New York.Ms. LeCompte said the decision to produce “The Room” had prompted research into Pinter’s works and life, which led to the other ideas: a collaboration with Mr. Morris on a new production of “A Kind of Alaska,” which Pinter wrote in 1982, and a theatrical adaptation of the Nobel Prize lecture that Pinter delivered in 2005. Ms. LeCompte said her company had been looking for an opportunity to work with Mr. Morris, and “A Kind of Alaska” made sense because Mr. Morris had known Oliver Sacks, whose book “Awakenings” inspired the play.“The idea is to do each one separately before putting all three together,” Ms. LeCompte said. She said the company had previously done theatrical series on work by Chekhov and Spalding Gray, among others.A version of this article appears in print on 10/12/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: The Wooster Group Takes On a Pinter Play.
