“Tuck Everlasting” is Broadway-bound.Producers of a musical adaptation of the popular children’s book, who delayed previous Broadway plans because of difficulty finding an available theater, said that they would open the show in New York next spring at an unspecified Shubert theater.The show, about a young girl’s encounter with a family of immortals, is directed by one of the most commercially successful directors of the moment — Casey Nicholaw, who has three Broadway productions running simultaneously, including “The Book of Mormon,” “Aladdin” and “Something Rotten!” Mr. Nicholaw won a Tony award for his direction of “The Book of Mormon,” and this year is nominated for Tonys for the direction and choreography of “Something Rotten!”The children’s book, by Natalie Babbitt, has twice been adapted into movies, including a 2002 version by Disney. The theatrical adaptation, with a book by Claudia Shear (“Dirty Blonde”), music by Chris Miller (“The Burnt Part Boys”) and lyrics by Nathan Tysen (“The Burnt Part Boys”), had its premiere at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta this year. Writing in The New York Times, Charles Isherwood called the musical “polished and enjoyable” and praised its “gorgeous, sweeping ballet,” but cautioned that the show “might find the waters choppy in the commercial sphere, with its Hallmark-specialish period warmth and lack of spectacle.”Despite some hand-wringing in the theater world about the crush of shows that schedule openings at the last-possible moment to qualify for Tony Awards, the producers of “Tuck Everlasting” are apparently unmoved: the show is scheduled to open April 17, 2016, close to the expected deadline to qualify for the Tonys next year.A version of this article appears in print on 05/14/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Tuck Everlasting’ Coming to Broadway in 2016.
