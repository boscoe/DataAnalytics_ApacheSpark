The Irish playwright Brian Friel, who died last month at 86, will be honored in a memorial service on Dec. 7, presented by The Irish Repertory Theater at the Manhattan Theater Club’s Samuel J. Friedman Theater. Additionally, Broadway theaters will dim their lights for Mr. Friel on Dec. 8.The Tony-winning Mr. Friel was renowned as one of the great dramatists of Ireland. His best-known works included “Philadelphia, Here I Come!” (1964) and “Dancing at Lughnasa” (1990). In his appraisal for The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote that a production of Mr. Friel’s “Faith Healer” helped him to define  “the elusiveness of great art and the pain of the artist who creates it.”The Irish Repertory Theater says it has staged more Friel plays than any other company in the United States. The memorial service, at 4 p.m., will include remembrances and readings from colleagues and friends, including Gabriel Byrne, Geraldine Hughes and Loretta Brennan Glucksman. The event is open to the public, but reservations are required and can be made through friel@irishrep.org.
