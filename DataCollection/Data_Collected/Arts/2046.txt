Camilo José Vergara, the Chilean-born photographer who has documented the street culture and the changing face of America’s inner cities for 40 years, agreed to place his entire photographic archive with the Library of Congress in 2013, and now more than 400 images have been digitized and put on the library’s website. This is  the first step toward making more than 10,000 works available to the public.The project is open-ended. As Mr. Vergara continues to shoot, his work will be sent to the library and displayed online, extending his time-lapse studies of specific sites in New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and other cities, to which he has returned many times over the years. To take one example from the online archive, he began photographing 10828 South Avalon Boulevard in Los Angeles in 1980, when it was a Baptist church, and returned 10 more times to record its shifting identities, from auto-parts store to, in 2014, a private home.“I wanted the whole body of work online on a single site, where people can look and develop their own ideas for further exploration,” Helena Zinkham, the chief of the library’s prints and photographs division, said. “His work is a good fit for the nation’s library because he has worked in so many parts of the United States.”In addition to the time-lapse series the library has grouped photographs under categories that reflect Mr. Vergara’s major themes, including “Detroit at Night,” “Cemeteries” and “World Trade Center.”
