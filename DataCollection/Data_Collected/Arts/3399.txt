One of the genre’s best practitioners was and still is Richard Estes, a Chicagoan who has lived in New York since 1958. Working from photographs that he takes himself, Mr. Estes paints images of cars, storefronts, subways, bridges and theater marquees, incorporating the ordinary, banal and overlooked into formally acute and uncannily vivid images. You see as if through the eyes of someone whose perceptions have been somehow intensified.Despite his pre-eminence, Mr. Estes has not had a career survey by a New York museum — not until now, that is: “Richard Estes: Painting New York City” opened at the Museum of Arts and Design last Tuesday. Presenting more than 40 paintings and works on paper dating from the mid-1960s to the present, it’s also noteworthy for being the museum’s first exhibition devoted to a single painter.
