More than 100 students from five New York City high schools will perform on Broadway on Monday night as part of the first Shubert Foundation High School Theater Festival, which will feature excerpted scenes and musical numbers from recent student productions. The schools and shows are Talent Unlimited High School (“Godspell”), Maspeth High School (“Stand and Deliver”), Susan Wagner High School (“Little Women”), Frank Sinatra High School for the Arts (“The Trojan Women”) and LaGuardia High School (“In the Heights”). After years of discussing the festival idea, the New York City Department of Education pitched a proposal to the Shubert Foundation, which provides grants to schools and nonprofit theaters and is the sole shareholder in the organization that owns 17 of Broadway’s 40 theaters. Financing for the festival, which organizers hope to make an annual event, comes from the foundation’s grant of $525,000 to the city school system this year. The festival will take place on Monday at 7 p.m. at Broadway’s Imperial Theater, home of the current revival of “Les Misérables” (which is not performed on Mondays). Free festival tickets are available by invitation only.A version of this article appears in print on 03/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Night on Broadway  For High School Students.
