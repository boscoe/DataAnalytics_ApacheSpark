At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ BRIC JazzFest  (Sunday through next Friday) The centerpiece of the newly formed BRIC JazzFest, happening at the BRIC House complex in Brooklyn, is a two-day marathon on Thursday and next Friday, featuring music ranging from the vaulting ambitions of the tenor saxophonist Kamasi Washington to the clockwork intricacies of Dawn of Midi.

(Chinen)Brian Charette Trio  (Tuesday) Mr. Charette has carved out a strong niche as a Hammond B-3 organ ace with a taste for modernizing classic soul-jazz. As on his new album, “Alphabet City,” he leads a trio propelled by the excellent drummer Rudy Royston; on guitar here is Peter Bernstein, a bop stalwart whose organ-trio credentials are unimpeachable. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 E 27th Street, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Stephan Crump’s Rhombal  (Saturday) Mr. Crump is a bassist with a broad stylistic frame, at home in both the avant-garde and a more traditional framework. His promising new band, Rhombal, has a front line of Adam O’Farrill on trumpet and Ellery Eskelin on saxophone, with Tyshawn Sorey, a smartly combustible drummer. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Jack DeJohnette, Ravi Coltrane, Matthew Garrison  (Saturday) Mr. DeJohnette, 73, is an elder statesman and a moving target: a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master who has been working both within his peer group and with a wealth of younger talent. He’ll be the driving force but not necessarily the leader of this all-star trio with Mr. Coltrane, the saxophonist, and Mr. Garrison, the bassist. The group has worked here before, and will soon be recording an album for ECM. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com. (Chinen)★ Kurt Elling  (Tuesday through Oct. 17) “Passion World,” the new album by the singer Kurt Elling, puts a high-concept gloss on the love song, drawing broadly from a pop repertory and enlisting a global assortment of guests. For his debut engagement at the Café Carlyle, titled “Elling Swings Sinatra,” Mr. Elling offers a centennial salute to a master of the form, with a sharp band that includes Troy Roberts on tenor saxophone, John McLean on guitar and Gary Versace on piano. At 8:45 p.m., with an additional 10:45 p.m. show on Oct. 17, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com. (Chinen)John Ellis and Double-Wide  (Friday and Saturday) A saxophonist and clarinetist fond of blending modern-jazz erudition with street-level grooves, Mr. Ellis has long had a strong outlet in Double-Wide, featuring the New Orleans drummer Jason Marsalis, in a lineup with trombone and sousaphone. “Charm,” Mr. Ellis’s new album, also greatly benefits from the organ, accordion and piano playing of Gary Versace, who rejoins the group here. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Tomas Fujiwara Trio  (Monday) “Variable Bets,” the new album by the drummer Tomas Fujiwara, places him at the fulcrum of two strong and distinctive improvisers: the strategically unruly guitarist-banjoist Brandon Seabrook and the surgically precise trumpeter Ralph Alessi. At 8:30 p.m., IBeam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Chinen)★ Tom Harrell  (through Oct. 18) Mr. Harrell, a trumpeter and fluegelhorn player of prominence since the 1970s, has also been a beacon of small-group bandleading in recent years, working with a regular stable of sidemen. A few of them — the saxophonist Wayne Escoffery, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the pianist Danny Grissett — join him at the Village Vanguard. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Donald Harrison Quintet  (Thursday through Oct. 18) A veteran alto saxophonist working at the convergence of acoustic post-bop, funk and New Orleans second line, Mr. Harrison leads a band whose front line features an accomplished peer, the Brazilian trumpeter Claudio Roditi. (Mr. Roditi appears Thursday and next Friday; for the rest of the run, the trumpeter will be Terell Stafford.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Freddie Hendrix Quintet  (Wednesday and Thursday) A hard-bop trumpeter with a strong tone and an alert style, Mr. Hendrix spearheads a group with Brandon McCune on piano, Chris Berger on bass and Chris Beck on drums. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)The Horns Band  (Friday) The Horns Band, which released its self-titled debut album last year, is the chief expressive outlet for Matt Pavolka, a bassist and composer. As on the album, its lineup features Kirk Knuffke on cornet, Loren Stillman on alto saxophone, Jacob Garchik on trombone and Mark Ferber on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Willie Jones III Quintet  (Thursday) The astute hard-bop drummer Willie Jones III celebrates the release of a new album, “Groundwork,” with a group featuring Eddie Henderson on trumpet, Stacy Dillard on saxophones, Jeremy Manasia on piano and Gerald Cannon on bass. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Ginny’s Supper Club, 310 Lennox Avenue, Harlem, 212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com. (Chinen)★ Jane Monheit  (Tuesday through Oct. 17) When she arrived on the scene 15 years ago, Ms. Monheit was praised and criticized for her fealty to the style of Ella Fitzgerald, her chief jazz-vocal influence. A lot has happened for Ms. Monheit since, as an artist and a person, and it seems likely she’ll bring an unforced maturity, along with a deep reserve of affection, to this tribute, titled “The Songbook Sessions: The Music of Ella Fitzgerald.” At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Noah Preminger Group  (Wednesday) On his often ecstatic new album, “Pivot: Live at the 55 Bar,” the tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger leads his new band in a pair of incantatory half-hour extemporizations on classic blues by Bukka White. For this outing, he leads the same personnel — Jason Palmer on trumpet, Kim Cass on bass, Ian Froman on drums — in a different West Village room. From 7:30 to 10 p.m., Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, smallsjazzclub.com. (Chinen).Kenneth Salters  (Monday) Mr. Salters is a drummer and composer who has worked in a wide range of settings since setting up shop in New York about a decade ago. His debut album, “Haven,” reflects that breadth, and features all of the musicians found here, including the trumpeter Matt Holman, the alto saxophonist Tivon Pennicott and the pianist Brad Whiteley. From 7:30 to 10 p.m., Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, smallsjazzclub.com. (Chinen).★ John Scofield-Joe Lovano Quartet  (Tuesday through Oct. 18) “Past Present,” the excellent new album by the guitarist John Scofield, documents a welcome reunion of his quartet of the early-to-mid 1990s: an elastic, swinging group featuring Joe Lovano on tenor saxophone and Bill Stewart on drums. Larry Grenadier is the bassist on the album, replaced by Ben Street here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Kendra Shank Quartet  (Thursday) An assertive and open-minded jazz singer, Ms. Shank prizes group interplay, and she has worked for more than 15 years with the partners who join her here: the pianist Frank Kimbrough, the bassist Dean Johnson and the drummer Tony Moreno. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)‘Spherical’: A Thelonious Monk Birthday Celebration  (Friday through Sunday) “Spherical,” a new album by the tenor saxophonist Tim Warfield, pays homage to Thelonious Sphere Monk, the pianist-composer of peerless stature in jazz’s modernist canon. As on the album, Mr. Warfield appears here — on what would have been Monk’s 98th birthday weekend — with a band featuring Victor Gould on piano, Eddie Henderson on trumpet and Ben Wolfe on bass. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Yosvany Terry-Baptiste Trotignon Quartet  (through Sunday) Mr. Terry, an Afro-Cuban saxophonist and percussionist, and Mr. Trotignon, a French pianist, have a new album, “Ancestral Memories,” that addresses themes of Caribbean cultural displacement. (It’s a suite created with support from the French-American Jazz Exchange Program.) They work here with Yunior Terry, Mr. Terry’s brother, on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. (Ludwig Alfonso fills in for Mr. Watts on Sunday.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 E 27th Street, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Kenny Werner Trio  (Wednesday) “The Melody,” a sparkling new album by Mr. Werner, serves on one hand to underscore his composure at the piano, which rarely falters even when he’s stretching. At the same time, it’s a showcase for the agile dynamism of this longtime trio, with Johannes Weidenmüller on bass and Ari Hoenig on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Steve Wilson-Lewis Nash Duo  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Wilson, an alto and soprano saxophonist, and Mr. Nash, a drummer, have been sharing bandstands for decades, most often as first-call sidemen. “Duologue,” an album from last year, puts them on equal footing, cutting to the heart of their musical kinship: brisk fluency, crisp flexibility and a capacity for coming up with magic on the spot. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at East 38th Street, 212-885-7000, kitano.com. (Chinen)Advertisement
