It’s mostly gunmetal-gray, holding-pattern tense, with zaps of excitement on the way to more tension.Listen to the drummer Alex Leonard: For long stretches, he hits only snare and toms in mechanical patterns, and he rarely strikes an unclenched cymbal above medium force. Listen to the guitarist Greg Ahee, whose ropy eighth-note lines and deep-echo, non-resolving, minor-seventh chords define at least half of this record’s rich atmosphere. And listen to the singer, Joe Casey. He talk-sings, he interjects, he protests a little, he repeats jaded phrases. (“They lie.” Or “They don’t see us.” Or “That’s not gonna save you, man.”) But he hardly ever shouts or builds to a peak. He’s like an inverse Bono. If you think it’s impossible to sound creative and defeated at the same time, you probably haven’t heard him.Protomartyr is from Detroit, and there’s a dour, industrial affect to this record — the band’s best, though like the others it can sometimes feel like one long song — which seems to confirm everything you think you know about that city. “The Agent Intellect” is partly about Detroit as a place, with references to the Outer Drive and Jumbo’s Bar. But Mr. Casey’s excellent lyrics go bigger and more abstract: They’re also about Detroit as a pile of symbols and emotions. Asked recently by Stereogum what the themes of the record were, Mr. Casey listed 18 possibilities; the first four were “evil,” “false pride,” “lawyer billboards” and “dust.” That is a powerful index.The list also included Alzheimer’s: Mr. Casey’s mother, Ellen, has that disease, and “The Agent Intellect” includes a kind of love song for her (and named after her), sung from the point of view of his deceased father, with the repeated line “I will wait.” Somehow, the song is not sentimental. It doesn’t do you that disservice.Advertisement
