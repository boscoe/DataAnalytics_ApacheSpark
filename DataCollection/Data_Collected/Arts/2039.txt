Taylor Swift had the best-selling album of 2014, and she is starting off the new year on top, as her hit “1989” notches an eighth week as Billboard’s No. 1 album.The album, from Big Machine, sold 172,000 copies last week, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and also had robust sales of individual tracks. (Late last year, SoundScan and Billboard tweaked how they compile the chart, counting sales of full albums as well as streams and downloads of songs.)But 2015 brings the end of a different chart run for Ms. Swift. Her song “Blank Space,” which had dominated the singles chart for seven weeks at the end of last year, has been bumped from No. 1 by Mark Ronson’s new “Uptown Funk,” which features Bruno Mars. “Blank Space” falls this week to No. 2.Also this week, Nicki Minaj’s latest album, “The Pinkprint” (Young Money/Cash Money/Republic), holds at No. 2 in its third week out; Ed Sheeran’s “x” (Atlantic) rises four spots to No. 3; and Sam Smith’s “In the Lonely Hour” (Capitol) is No. 4.The latest chart covers sales made in the week after Christmas, when they typically drop; this year, album sales declined 47 percent from the week before. But the post-holiday period also usually includes sales made with iTunes gift cards, and one common beneficiary is film soundtracks. Disney’s album for its film “Guardians of the Galaxy,” full of 1970s pop and soft-rock, rose four spots to No. 5. Unavailable for streaming, the album — now nearly six months old — sold 70,000 copies.Down the chart just a bit are two other hit Disney soundtracks. “Into the Woods,” which opened in most theaters on Dec. 25, rose nine spots to No. 8. And the 58-week-old “Frozen” album, which contended with Ms. Swift’s “1989” as last year’s most popular album, holds at No. 11.
