They started late, but the equipment they were setting up looked promising, so I stuck around.Along with the guitars there were turntables, electronics, all sorts of hand percussion and an accordion. The band was Centavrvs, from Mexico City, and as the V-­laced spelling of its name suggests, it owes something to Mexico’s long­-running and still innovative Café Tacvba.Reports from the South by Southwest conference and festival in Austin.Centavrvs plays upbeat Mexican pop, rooted in cumbias and rancheras and, often, praising the pleasures of romance. But it sets those familiar ideas in an electronic domain — not just programmed drums but clouds of sustained harmony, bursts of twitchy double time and sudden blips and swooshes, deliberately defamiliarizing the lilt of the pop songs. Perhaps it was a visions of 21st-century romance, still proceeding as our many devices ping and buzz with other things to notice.SPOTIFY PLAYLIST
