For the past two weeks, Farizwan Fajari, a 35-year-old Singaporean artist who uses the name Speak Cryptic, has been creating a 20-meter-long street-art-style mural at the Palais de Tokyo, the modern art museum in Paris.Mr. Fajari, who has been invited as part of “Secret Archipelago” — an exhibition on contemporary Southeast Asian art that opens on Thursday in Paris — has used bold black-and-white graphics to mix iconography and patterns from Malay culture with those of the punk-rock subculture he loves.“The work, ‘Present Condition,’ depicts my struggle with my identity, both past and present, visually narrating my impression of being a Malay of Boyanese descent raised in Singapore,” he said in an email interview, referring to one of the ethnic groups.As Singapore mourns the death of its founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who led the country to international prominence, it is also highlighting a rising global profile in the arts with a major presence in France.Advertisement“Secret Archipelago” opens the Singapore in France festival, a three-month-long cultural showcase funded with 6 million Singapore dollars, or about $4.4 million, and organized by Singapore government agencies along with the Institut Français, France’s center for international arts and cultural projects. Spread over seven French cities, the festival will promote artists from Singapore and is part of the city-state’s celebration of 50 years as an independent nation.“The artistic focus of the festival is to portray Singapore as a city that is always looking toward the future, that is finding new ways, new possibilities, new cracks in between, to find itself,” said Tan Boon Hui, the director of programs at the National Heritage Board in Singapore and artistic director of the festival.AdvertisementThe festival, Mr. Tan said, is the largest presentation of art and culture that Singapore has introduced outside the country, with 25 core events conceived by organizers and 45 by participating partners. In addition to the Palais de Tokyo show, highlights include an exhibition of interactive works by Singapore artists at Lille Art Garden and a 50-year retrospective of Singapore cinema at the Cinémathèque française in Paris.One of the most prominent partner events is the Art Paris Art Fair 2015, at the Grand Palais from Thursday to Sunday, where Singapore and Southeast Asia are the “guests of honor.”Singapore is “a springboard and at the crossroads of what is a booming and increasingly influential art emerging in the region,” said Guillaume Piens, the fair’s director. Many government-led initiatives, including the establishment of the Gillman Barracks gallery district and the Singapore Biennale,  have “contributed to building international awareness of the visual brilliance of Southeast Asian contemporary art,” he added.Eight Singapore-based galleries will be taking part in the fair in a special platform, with an additional video presentation dedicated to the region and curated by Iola Lenzi, while a number of international galleries will also feature artists from Southeast Asia.Asian collectors have taken note of the region’s emerging cultural weight. Art Stage Singapore, an annual international art fair held in January, hosted 51,000 visitors and 158 galleries this year, up from 32,000 visitors and 121 galleries in 2011. An Art Week built around the fair offered more than 100 art-related activities. Last year, Singapore hosted eight other art fairs, some organized by international players like Milan Image Art Fair.Southeast Asian artists have long been somewhat eclipsed by the focus on China’s art scene, but Singapore-based galleries, buoyed by the attention they have received at these new art fairs, are now hoping that Western collectors will take note.Advertisement“We feel that it is time to present the work of our Singapore artists on the global stage,” said Helina Chan, founder of iPreciation, a Singapore gallery taking part in the Art Paris Art Fair. “Despite the economic issues in Europe, Paris is still a very important place of art and Europe has many important and prominent collectors.”The fair, which showcases more than 140 galleries from around 20 countries, will have a strong showing of art from the region, including a program of talks and video screenings.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Harsono recently received the inaugural Joseph Balestier Award for the Freedom of Art presented by Art Stage and the United States Embassy in Singapore to recognize an artist committed to the ideal of freedom and expressing it through his or her work.Visitors to the Paris fair will be greeted by a monumental installation outside the Grand Palais. Looking like two elegant seashells, the work, by the Singaporean artist Hua Kuan Sai, is called “Listening.”“The visitor is drawn in and the piece engages all the senses, plunging us into a feeling of peace in which time, sound and the sense of space are all at play,” said Mr. Piens, the fair director. “This is emblematic of the practice of many artists of the region, whose work often solicits all the senses and includes the public space.”A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2015, in The International New York Times.
