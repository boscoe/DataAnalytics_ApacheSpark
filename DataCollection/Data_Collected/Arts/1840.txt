AdvertisementSupported byThe frantic merriment of New Year’s Eve is a night-life bonanza. Jam bands, electronic dance music laptop jockeys, jazz groups, rockers, rappers, Latin bands, cabaret crooners and comedians are all booked to get their fans through the calendar change. It’s a night when, it seems, every place with a sound system brings in live performers; it’s also a night with premium prices to match the sense of occasion. And it’s a good reason for musicians to come to New York and stick around, playing additional gigs before or after the big night. Here, writers for The New York Times explore the possibilities. JON PARELESAnnaleigh Ashford This saucy Broadway spitfire belongs to a proud lineage of fearless vaudevillian entertainers who seem born to conquer. Her cabaret alter ego, a wised-up kook whose zany antics camouflage a heart of tarnished gold, is a comedic showgirl in the tradition of Jean Harlow, Judy Holliday and Cyndi Lauper. Ms. Ashford recently won a Tony for best featured actress in the play “You Can’t Take It With You.” Earlier, the Broadway diva Marin Mazzie will reprise her hit show, “Make Your Own Kind of Music,” a humorous history of her musical tastes from bubblegum to growling guitar heroes. Feinstein’s/54 Below, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan; 646-476-3551, 54below.com; Ms. Ashford’s 11 p.m. show, $330 to $350 remaining; Ms. Mazzie’s 7 p.m. show, $90 to $155, with $45 food and drinks minimum. (Stephen Holden)The Bad Plus This trio, with the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer Dave King, was promising from the start, 15 years ago — and yet its success still seems unlikely. It’s a smart-oddball band, always surprising and slightly funny, never sounding at pains to prove its fluency in current jazz language or overserious about its practice of playing other material, from Blondie to Ornette Coleman. But it found a cohesive and original style and ended up at the center of things, influential and almost institutional. You can hear this on the group’s recent collaborative album, “The Bad Plus Joshua Redman,” and you’ll hear it in its festive New Year’s Eve shows. At the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village; tickets are $150 through villagevanguard.com, including two sets at 9 and 11 p.m. and snacks. (Ben Ratliff)Sandra Bernhard: Feel the BernhardThis brash comedian returns to Joe’s Pub for another New Year’s Eve residency, offering an hour of sharp politically minded cabaret comedy that’s also “a revolution, Sandy style.” At 9 and 11 p.m., 425 Lafayette Street, Astor Place, East Village; 212-967-7555; joespub.com; $150 plus a two-drink or $12 food minimum for the early show, $200 plus two-drink or $12 food minimum for the late show. (Elise Czajkowski)Mykki Blanco, Cakes Da Killa, MikeQ Here’s an electric bill that spans widely across the spectrum of the New York area’s queer musical underground. Mykki Blanco is a kinetic and sometimes confounding rapper, singer and performance artist. Cakes Da Killa is a wry, limber and assertive rapper. And the producer and D.J. MikeQ is the leading figure of the Qween Beat crew, which over the last two years has done wonders to invigorate the vogue scene and ballroom house music. At 9 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side; 800-745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com; $30. (Jon Caramanica)Richard Bona Group The irrepressible electric bassist and vocalist Richard Bona, originally from Cameroon, is a co-owner of Club Bonafide, a new world-jazz and global-fusion supper club in Midtown. (Its aesthetic, like its name, reflects his influence; his most recent album was titled “Bonafied.”) This stand will double as a christening, with Mr. Bona leading his band in two sets, followed by an after-midnight shift featuring Davi Vieira and the Bonafide Brazilian Band. At 7 and 10 p.m., 212 East 52nd Street; 646-918-6189, clubbonafide.com; $50 for the early set, $70 for the late set. (Nate Chinen)Chris Botti Every year for more than a decade now, the trumpeter Chris Botti has brought his smoldering gaze and jazz-pop gleam to the Blue Note for an extended holiday run. New Year’s Eve may be just another night on the job for him and his high-achieving band, but Mr. Botti is nothing if not an engine of fan service who can make a special occasion feel even more so. At 7 and 10 p.m., 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village; 212-475-8592, bluenote.net; $155 at tables, $85 at the bar for the early set; tables sold out, $95 at the bar for the late set. Includes champagne toast, hats and noisemakers. (Chinen)Jimmy Buffett, Huey Lewis and the NewsCountry music on a tropical beach, warm sand underfoot, margarita in hand: That’s the fantasy Jimmy Buffett has parlayed into a career of working hard to seem mighty relaxed, leading his Coral Reefer Band. He shares the bill with Huey Lewis and the News, still riding their string of good-natured 1980s hits like “The Heart of Rock & Roll” and what could well be the band’s credo, “Hip to Be Square.” At 9 p.m., Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn; 917-618-6700, barclayscenter.com; $65 to $550. (Pareles)The Chainsmokers, Nicky Romero, Travis Scott Sometimes New Year’s Eve demands a commitment to dopey-ness, and if that’s your quest, enjoy the Chainsmokers, among the dimmest breakthrough acts of the recent dance-music explosion. They’ll be joined here by the Dutch D.J. Nicky Romero and the rapper Travis Scott, who puts on one of hip-hop’s most energetic live shows. At Pier 94, 711 12th Avenue, at 55th Street, Clinton; pachanyc.com; $95 to $250 for varying levels of access and open-bar privileges. (Caramanica)Deer TickJohn McCauley’s songs for Deer Tick are perfectly suited to his scraped-up voice and the band’s lean, rootsy rock; they’re full of long-suffering but stubborn narrators, rattled by hard luck and drug troubles, who pick themselves up and keep going. At 9 p.m., Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, at North 11th Street, Williamsburg; 718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com/brooklyn; $50. Also Wednesday at 8:30; $30. (Pareles)Dej Loaf It’s been a tremendous year for the diminutively sized and even more diminutively-voiced Dej Loaf. Thanks to her keen sense of melody and her willingness to taunt aggressively, she’s become the first truly viable post-Nicki Minaj female rap star, a steady font of hits that are both sneaky and sweet. At 8 p.m., Amazura, 91-12 144th Place, Jamaica, Queens; 347-765-0162, amazuranye.com; $30 to $500, depending on how soon you buy (note: men pay more than women for early-bird tickets), how much open-bar access you would like and how close you would like to be to the night’s star. (Caramanica)The Dictators The proto-punk New York band, with the original members Handsome Dick Manitoba and Ross Friedman, a.k.a. the Boss — a kind of link between the grand gestures of the MC5 and the small, jokey gestures of the Ramones — are still at it, 40 years after their first album, for the occasional tour and special event. (They’ve got a couple of new songs out, their first in over a decade: an original called “Supply and Demand,” and a cover of the MC5’s “Kick Out the Jams.”) With the Battery Electric, Liquor Store and Moral Panic. At 8 p.m., Bowery Electric, 327 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village; 212-228-0228, theboweryelectric.com; $30. (Ratliff)Disco BiscuitsOpen-ended grooves are at the core of both jam bands and electronic dance music. The Disco Biscuits, from Philadelphia, were forward-looking enough to fuse both impulses when they got started back in 1995, and they’re still cruising through songs that move smoothly from funk to jazz-rock to trance, with bubbling synthesizers and human-powered beats. At 9 p.m., PlayStation Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street; 212-930-1940, playstationtheaterd.com; $69.50. Also Wednesday, next Friday and Jan. 2 at 11 p.m.; $39.50 to $45. (Pareles)Future and RudimentalA bit of a mismatched bill here. Future is hip-hop’s current catharsis king, all guttural exhales and sad boasts. His brand of excitement is serrate — and great. He’s performing alongside Rudimental, the toothless British drum-and-bass band. Its brand of excitement is smooth — and dull. At 8 p.m., Pier 36, 299 South Street, Lower Manhattan; 212-209-7500, pachanyc.com; $80 to $250 for varying levels of access and open-bar privileges. (Caramanica)Gogol Bordello, Chicano BatmanThe oompah of Gypsy dances, the revved-up tempos of punk and the irrepressible growl of Gogol Bordello’s Ukrainian-born bandleader, Eugene Hutz, are the makings of rowdy, accelerating party music that tucks in some messages about wanderlust, border crossings and cultural hybridization. Another cross-cultural party band, the psychedelia-tinged Latin alternative band Chicano Batman, opens the shows. At 10 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Manhattan; 212-260-4700, terminal5nyc.com; $35. Also Wednesday at 7 p.m.; $35. (Pareles)Gov’t Mule Warren Haynes, who has played guitar in both the Allman Brothers Band and the Dead, has also led Gov’t Mule for two decades. His own songs are lean, dark and sinewy: Southern rock infused with grunge fatalism and the steadfastness of reggae, with plenty of room for Mr. Haynes’s bluesy solos. At 9 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street; 212-465-6500, beacontheatre.com; $65 to $89.50. Also Wednesday at 8 p.m.; $50 to $75. (Pareles)Milford Graves, Marc Ribot, John Zorn These three musicians — drummer, guitarist, alto saxophonist, ages 74, 61 and 62 — are imposing and fearless New York wild cards, important to the last half-century of music in this city. They all honor a tradition of free improvising, but they don’t get hung up on genre; they’ll give you some courage to last into the New Year. At 11:30 p.m., their ad hoc trio is the final of a three-act bill; they’re preceded by the noise-rock power trio Trigger, at 10 p.m., playing some of Mr. Zorn’s new works in a series of compositions called Bagatelles; and at 8 p.m., a nine-piece improvisation session led by Mr. Zorn, including Cyro Baptista on percussion, Okkyung Lee on cello and others. At the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village; thestonenyc.com; $20 for 8 and 10 p.m. sets, $40 for the 11:30 p.m. set, no advance ticket sales. (Ratliff)Macy GrayThere has always been a streak of jazz in Macy Gray’s scratchy-voiced soul songs: a grounding in the blues and Billie Holiday, a willingness to toy with rhythm, a knowing wink behind her professions of love and lust. At Iridium, a jazz club, listeners should have a chance to hear even more of the nuances. At Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street; 212-582-2121, theiridium.com, $95, and 10 p.m., including dinner and an escort into Times Square to watch the ball drop, $550 to $750. (Pareles)Hard Lonely & Vicious Peggy O’Leary and Lucas Connolly present a special edition of their regular monthly show, which mixes drinking games and stand-up comedy. Performers include the inventive Nick Turner and Erik Bergstrom, a master of the one-liners. At 9 p.m., the Creek and the Cave, 10-93 Jackson Avenue, at 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; 718-706-8783, creeklic.com; $10, which includes a champagne toast. (Czajkowski)Craig Harris A jazz trombonist whose career describes an exalted arc through the post-1960s avant-garde — he recorded with Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor, Muhal Richard Abrams and David Murray, among many others — Craig Harris has recently explored compositional ideas related to historic preachers’ cadences in African-American churches. At 10:30 p.m., Sistas’ Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Brooklyn; 718-398-1766, sistasplace.org; $50, includes champagne toast and buffet. (Chinen)Here’s What I Would Say With Jenn & Jay: New Year’s Eve Spectacular Jenn Welch and Jay Malsky host this “evening of comedy, song, and unsolicited advice,” featuring live performances (of stand-up, improv and music), a dance party, prizes and anything else that fits the mood. At 8 p.m., Peoples Improv Theater, 123 East 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-563-7488, thepit-nyc.com; $10. (Czajkowski)Justice, Gesaffelstein The French duo Justice was specializing in arena-size dance music long before modern-day D.J.-producers took it as a given that the scale of their music (and its popularity) should be grand. It’s been a couple of years since Justice D.J.’ed here, and the two are returning for a show at a yet-to-be-revealed warehouse in Brooklyn. Also playing is Gesaffelstein, the Bromance-crew producer who inherited industrial pomp from Justice but then aerated it, as if revealing the skeleton lurking inside the body. With Bob Moses. At 8 p.m., jukely.com/nye2016; $115 to $170. (Caramanica)The Liar’s Show Andy Christie hosts a special edition of his storytelling show, in which four raconteurs tell short personal stories — but one of them is lying. Audience members interrogate the performers to try to determine the fibber; the person who figures it out wins a T-shirt. This evening’s storytellers are Peter Aguero, Leslie Goshko, Michaela Murphy and Gastor Almonte. At 6 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, at Bleecker Street, West Village; 212-989-9319; corneliastreetcafe.com; $25, which includes champagne. (Czajkowski)Marilyn Maye Ms. Maye, who is 87 going on 40, can outperform most singers half her age and sing almost any standard you can name. On New Year’s Eve, there are two editions of what is billed as “The Biggest Party Ever” at 7:30 and 10 p.m. at the Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; 212-206-0440, metropolitanroom.com; $55 to $145 for the early show; $199 to $299 for the late show. (Holden)Mingus Big Band Since the early 1990s, with changing personnel, this band has played the music of Charles Mingus in regular residencies at New York clubs, making the essence of the bassist’s work rise up on a regular basis. Under the artistic direction of Mingus’s widow, Sue Mingus, the band delivers the technical and emotional curves of the music with authority. Its 14 members include the pianist Helen Sung, the trombonist Ku-umba Frank Lacy and the drummer Adam Cruz. At the Jazz Standard, the group’s regular Monday night home, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan; 212-576-2232. Seating is first-come, first-serve, and tickets are still available for the 7:30 p.m. set at $135 through jazzstandard.com; the 10:30 p.m. set is sold out. (Ratliff)New Year’s Eve at the Comedy Cellar Perhaps the most respected name in stand-up in New York City, the Comedy Cellar is hosting more than a dozen performers at its two Greenwich Village locations on New Year’s Eve. The scheduled stand-ups include Dave Attell, Todd Barry, Michael Che, Keith Robinson, Michelle Wolf, Greg Rogell, Kevin Brennan, Dov Davidoff, Ardie Fuqua and Liza Treyger. At 8 and 10:15 p.m., Comedy Cellar, 117 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village; 8:15 and 10:30 p.m., Comedy Cellar at the Village Underground, 130 West Third Street, Greenwich Village; $40, with a two-item minimum for the early shows, $80 with a two-item minimum for the late shows; 212-254-3480, comedycellar.com. (Czajkowski)New Year’s Eve at the Stand This beloved newbie of the Manhattan stand-up scene hosts a talented lineup, with performances from Dave Attell, Bonnie McFarlane, Big Jay Oakerson, Judah Friedlander, Rich Vos, Todd Barry and Dan St. Germain. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., the Stand, 239 Third Avenue, at East 20th Street, Manhattan; 212-677-2600, thestandnyc.com; $50 to $150; V.I.P. packages available. (Czajkowski)Johnny O’Neal TrioA musician’s musician and a regular performer at various clubs, including Smoke and Smalls, Mr. O’Neal is an ark of jazz knowledge, a pianist and singer in his late 50s with total recall of standards and styles. His gigs can stretch in any direction: He’ll scat-sing at rapid speed and tell stories, pouring gusto into the moment whether the crowd is large or small. He’ll play with his trio, including the bassist Luke Sellick and drummer Charles Goold, at Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, near Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village; 10 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.; reserved seats in the intimate room are $100, available at mezzrow.com and good for the night, including the 8 p.m. set by the pianist Spike Wilner. (Ratliff)Eddie Palmieri Salsa Orchestra, T-Vice, CarimiThe pianist Eddie Palmieri is a titan of salsa: a two-fisted player who splashes modern jazz into his dance music and the leader of hard-driving bands including his big, brassy Salsa Orchestra. After midnight, the music turns Haitian, as the midtempo lilt of the konpa (or compas) gets modern updates — bilingual lyrics, electronic effects, touches of R&B and salsa — from two bands, T-Vice and Carimi. At 8 p.m., S.O.B.’s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village; 212-243-4940, sobs.com; packages are from $50 to $200. (Pareles)PhishThe tradition resumes: Phish is back at Madison Square Garden for a sold-out string of New Year’s concerts. The psychedelic-country-jazz-funk-prog jam band from Vermont is in town for four nights, with the New Year’s Eve show as the capstone: three sets and, no doubt, a stage stunt that will be a closely guarded secret. The four shows are also being webcast at livephish.com. At 8 p.m., 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue; 866-858-0008, phish.com; $80. Also Wednesday, next Friday and Jan. 2 at 7:30 p.m.; $70. (Pareles)Matana Roberts Few improvising artists today are as multichannel as the alto saxophonist and composer Matana Roberts, whose work functions not only as music but also as fever-dream historiography and a form of durational art. She’ll perform a site-specific piece inspired by the Whitney Museum of American Art’s new building — its character, spatial flow and collection — with an ensemble she calls the New Year’s Eve Back Room 12tet, whose roster includes the violinist Mazz Swift, the trombonist Steve Swell, the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the bassist Meshell Ndegeocello. At 9 p.m., Whitney Museum of American Art, 99 Gansevoort Street, at Washington Street, Manhattan; 212-570-3600, whitney.org; $50 ($45 for members, students and seniors). (Chinen)Pete Rock, Statik Selektah, Tony Touch Ring in 2016 with the hip-hop of 1996 (or thereabouts). The D. J.s at this party include Pete Rock, one of the most soul-fluent hip-hop producers of the 1990s; the 1990s mixtape icon Tony Touch; and Statik Selektah, a producer keeping the spirit of 1990s New York boom-bap rap alive. With Brian Coxx and Les Carbonell playing house and disco. At 10 p.m., Club Remix, 27 Park Place, near Church Street, TriBeCa; nye2016castroeventbrite.com; $33. (Caramanica)Nile Rodgers and Chic You may have heard that Chic was recently passed over for the 10th time by the voting board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That’s ludicrous, but Nile Rodgers’s band isn’t and never was an underdog in popular culture; it is the sophisticated center, a compass for disco and post-punk and a wave of new hits four decades later. At 10 p.m., the Standard Hotel’s Top of the Standard, 848 Washington Street, near 13th Street, Manhattan, 212-645-7600, standardhotels.com. This is a night for barons and hedge-fund grandees, with tickets at $250 to $6,000, depending on the size of the party and the direction of the views. (From the prime tables, you’ll see the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.) If you can’t afford it, buy the second album, “C’est Chic,” for $8.99 on iTunes, and listen to it several times in a row. (Ratliff)Nicky Siano In the early 1970s, Nicky Siano was a D.J. at the Gallery, the Round Table, Studio 54 and more, one of the scene-makers who set the table for New York’s disco-era night-life tsunami. He’ll be recapturing at least a small part of that era’s grandeur at this Coney Island landmark, a bumper car attraction with a sound system designed by Mr. Siano’s contemporary Richard Long. This show will feature appearances by the disco- and soul-era stalwarts Rochelle Fleming (of First Choice), Melba Moore and D.C. LaRue. At 10 p.m., Eldorado Auto Skooter, 1216 Surf Avenue, Coney Island, Brooklyn, 718-339-3464, nickysiano.com; $75, $100 to $125 at the door. (Caramanica)Snarky PuppyAn instrumental jam band that’s fond of the 1970s, Snarky Puppy reaches back to that era’s jazz-funk fusion, with slinky horn lines, wah-wah guitar and infusions of Latin music and Afrobeat. At 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square; 212-777-6800, irvingplaza.com; $50. (Pareles)They Might Be GiantsThe ever-prolific songwriting partnership of John Flansburgh and John Linnell released two studio albums this year, “Glean” in April and “Why?” in November. These pop-rock miniaturists pack a lot into songs that uphold the virtues of new wave — melody, momentum, succinctness — while pondering topics like cybernetics, paranoia, family, books and animals (real and mythical). And they don’t stop; They Might Be Giants still release a song a week on Dial-a-Song, which started in the 1980s as an answering machine and has evolved into a website, dialasong.com. At 11 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn; 718-486-5400, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $35 in advance, $40 day of show. Also next Friday and Jan. 2, 8 p.m.; $25. (Pareles)Trombone Shorty & Orleans Avenue Trombone Shorty, the New Orleans funk dynamo, recently flirted with EDM on “Hold Up, Wait a Minute,” a track by the producer Zhu. For this show, the musician born Troy Andrews will mostly hunker down with his homegrown style, dividing his energies between trumpet, trombone, vocals and crowd-hyping. The groove-minded organ trio Soulive will open the show. At 9 p.m., Capitol Theater, 149 Westchester Avenue, Port Chester, N.Y.; 914-937-4126, thecapitoltheatre.com; $59.50 and $160. (Chinen)2016 New Year Bash at Stand Up NY This Upper West Side staple presents a top-notch lineup for its big bash, with performers including Judah Friedlander, Kurt Metzger, Jared Freid, Mark Normand and Dante Nero. At 6:30, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Stand Up NY, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan; 212-595-0850, standupny.com; $30 plus two-drink minimum for the early show, $45 plus two-drink minimum for the middle show, $60 plus two-drink minimum for the late show; V.I.P. packages available. (Czajkowski)Wiki, Show Me the Body, Lee Bannon, Jaguar PyramidsWiki, the charismatic rapper from Ratking, has just released a solo album, “Lil Me,” a reminder that he’s a serpentine, flinty rapper full of swing and angst. This bill also includes the wide-ranging producer Lee Bannon, the happily shambolic band Show Me the Body, the caustic rappers of Jaguar Pyramids and more. At 8 p.m., Aviv, 496 Morgan Avenue, Brooklyn, ticketfly.com; $12. (Caramanica)Advertisement
