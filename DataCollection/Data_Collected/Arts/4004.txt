A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events.Ballet Hispanico  (Tuesday through April 26) This ardent company returns to the Joyce Theater with works by Spanish and Latin American choreographers, spanning four programs. The lineup includes a world premiere by the Mexican choreographer Miguel Mancillas and the New York premiere of Rosie Herrera’s “Show.Girl.,” a look at Latina identity through the lens of Cuban cabaret. The troupe revives some of its pithiest choreography with Gustavo Ramírez Sansano’s flirtatious “El Beso,” from last year, and Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s popular “Sombrerísimo,” for six men in bowler hats. Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m.; April 19 at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Siobhan Burke)★ Soledad Barrio and Noche Flamenca  (Friday) Some dance makes sense in big halls; some thrives in intimate environs. Flamenco is one that comes alive in the cozy, charged energy of a nightclub; hence it’s perfect for Joe’s Pub. And Soledad Barrio, one of the great flamenco dancers of the day, is a treat to see up close. She has returned with the vigorous dancers Juan Ogalla and Marina Elana, along with a team of excellent musicians. At 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com. (Brian Schaefer)Laurie Berg  (Thursday through April 18) In “The Mineralogy of Objects,” Ms. Berg draws inspiration from “Variétés de Minéralogie: Object,” a shadow box constructed by the artist Joseph Cornell in 1939. Through the structure and mechanics of that artifact, she illuminates relationships between objects and moving bodies. Of her dancers Jodi Bender, Bessie McDonough-Thayer and Jillian Sweeney, she writes, “We are a unison machine, a string of beads, an energetic force rejecting our own objectification in the refusal to stay still.” At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Burke)★ Dance Theater of Harlem  (Friday and Saturday) For its New York season, Dance Theater of Harlem brings two programs, a spring bouquet filled with its signature mix of neoclassical gems, contemplative drama and zesty spirit. Examples of each include George Balanchine’s seminal “Agon”; the company premiere of Nacho Duato’s “Coming Together”; and Robert Garland’s “Return,” set to music by Aretha Franklin and James Brown. But it’s that last type of dance in which this company, rebooted in 2012, really shines. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Schaefer)E-Moves: ‘Celebrating James Baldwin and Billie Holiday’  (Friday through April 18) This annual series, presented by Harlem Stage, dedicates its 16th edition to James Baldwin and Billie Holiday, commemorating what would have been his 90th birthday and her 100th. More streamlined than in past years, the program includes new works by André M. Zachery, Brinae Ali, Malcolm Low and the duo Nia Love and Marjani Forte, who respond in movement to Baldwin’s prose and Holiday’s music. The culminating “Harlem Stage Takeover” (April 18) features nine artists in performances dispersed throughout the building. Fridays and Saturdays at 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, 212-281-9240, harlemstage.org. (Burke)★ Beth Gill, Laurie Anderson and Deborah Hay  (Wednesday) Live Ideas, an interdisciplinary festival at New York Live Arts, returns for a third year with the pioneering multimedia artist Laurie Anderson as its curator. On opening night, Beth Gill offers “Portrait Study,” departing from her generally meticulous choreographic methods to create something more improvisatory for nine marvelous dancers. She shares a bill with Ms. Anderson and another illustrious postmodernist, Deborah Hay, who offer a preview of their new collaboration for Cullberg Ballet. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077, newyorklivearts.org. (Burke)Raja Feather Kelly  (Friday through April 25) What would “A Chorus Line” look like if Andy Warhol had choreographed his own version? In “Andy Warhol’s 15 (Color Me, Warhol),” the adventurous Raja Feather Kelly and his company, the Feath3r Theory, try to answer that question, using unabashedly jazzy choreography and other sneakier tactics. Marilyn Monroe wigs and multicolored face paint may be involved. Fridays and Saturdays at 7 p.m., Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets, Lower East Side, 212-219-0736, dixonplace.org. (Burke)Heidi Latsky Dance  (Thursday through April 19) Known for her thoughtful work with dancers of many body types and abilities, Ms. Latsky unveils “Triptych,” a new suite encompassing two live pieces and a dance film. Still performing at 56 — no small feat in the physically demanding life of a dancer — she addresses age, individuality and forms of beauty that don’t immediately meet the eye. Thursday and next Friday at 7:30 p.m.; April 18 at 8 p.m.; April 19 at 3 p.m.; Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., 973-655-5112, peakperfs.org. (Burke)★ David Neumann/Advanced Beginner Group  (Wednesday through April 25) Mr. Neumann has weathered a number of storms in recent years, personal and meteorological. In “I Understand Everything Better,” he reflects on the deaths of his parents, which bookended Superstorm Sandy. Techniques from Japanese Noh theater, along with his characteristic wit, provide grounding and leavening forces. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 212-352-3101, abronsartscenter.org. (Burke)Olga Pericet  (Friday through April 26) A rising star in Spain, the flamenco dancer Olga Pericet brings her new show, “Flamenco sin título” (“Flamenco Untitled”), to Manhattan, delivering the simple, profound and intricate pleasures of solo dancing to live music. Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Thursdays at 7 p.m.; Sundays at 2:30 p.m.; April 20 and 22 at 11 a.m.; some performances are sold out; Repertorio Español at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-225-9999, repertorio.org. (Burke)★ Stephen Petronio Company  (through Sunday) As a young choreographer, Stephen Petronio was the rock star of the dance world, his work shaped by the ethos of “sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll.” Three decades later, it has matured but is still driven by a hunger for constant motion. To celebrate his company’s 30th anniversary, Mr. Petronio is introducing “Bloodlines,” a five-year initiative to present postmodern dance classics. On this program, that includes Merce Cunningham’s bewitching 1968 dance “RainForest,” which is paired with new work by Mr. Petronio. Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Schaefer)Shwe Man Thabin  (Friday and Saturday) This troupe from Myanmar makes a rare international appearance, its first in the United States, in conjunction with Asia Society’s exhibition “Buddhist Art of Myanmar.” Eighteen of the company’s 75 performers will offer an abbreviated version of Pat Zwe, an all-night celebration featuring dancers, drummers and comedians, blending ancient traditions with contemporary themes. At 8 p.m., Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, 212-517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Burke)Gillian Walsh (through Saturday) Some artists celebrate the freedom of the body and the unexpected results of spontaneity in dance; Gillian Walsh is not interested in that. In “Scenario: Script to Perform,” Ms. Walsh uses a written score comprising numerical systems and codes to keep her dancers in line and focused on a complex series of instructions. Though it sounds dry, the method reveals appealing patterns and an intriguing underlying structure, devoid of dance artifice. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Schaefer)‘Work Up’ (through Saturday) Gibney Dance is making good use of its new downtown performance space, introducing another series to support the work of emerging artists. “Work Up” identifies performers who take risks and address relevant issues. The work includes dance by Abigail Levine, inspired by the paintings of Robert Motherwell; by Chafin Seymour, who tackles race with the help of Chopin and the Notorious B.I.G.; and by Sophie Sotsky, who celebrates strong, athletic women but struggles with dance’s demand for softness. At 7:30 p.m., Gibney Dance Performing Arts Center, 280 Broadway, near Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org. (Schaefer)Work Up 1.2  (Thursday through April 18) Gibney Dance Center continues its inaugural spring series for emerging choreographers with three new works by Evvie Allison, Ayano Elson and Alex Romania. Some of the topics include “love, pornography and feminist masculinity,” in Mr. Romania’s “CBT,” and “choreography as queered baptism,” in Ms. Allison’s “Dance Nun.” At 7:30 p.m., Gibney Dance Performing Arts Center, 280 Broadway, near Chambers Street, Lower Manhattan, 646-837-6809, gibneydance.org. (Burke)Ann Liv Young  (Wednesday through May 20) The irreverent Ms. Young presents “Elektra Cabaret” at Joe’s Pub, casting in a compassionate light a character who’s often portrayed as wicked. In this reimagined version of her full-length “Elektra,” she is joined by Marissa Mickelberg (chorus), Bailey Nolan (Klytemnestra), Charley Parden (Orestes) and Vanessa Soudan (Chrysothemis). Wednesdays (except April 29) and April 27 at 9:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com. (Burke)Advertisement
