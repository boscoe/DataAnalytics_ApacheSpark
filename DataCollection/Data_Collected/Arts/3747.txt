“People are religious or not, but Bach makes you believe in something, and for sure,” Lisa Batiashvili, the Georgian star violinist, said in a recent interview. A frequent guest soloist with the New York Philharmonic, she is the orchestra’s artist in residence this season. The run of concerts, conducted by Alan Gilbert, that begins on April 8 has a special significance for her. It features the music of Bach, which she only recently recorded after a long period of awe-struck distance, and brings her together, in Bach’s gorgeous Concerto for Violin and Oboe, with her husband, the marvelous oboist François Leleux.Ms. Batiashvili’s New York recital debut on Monday at Alice Tully Hall promises to be just as special: Teaming up with the wonderfully poetic pianist Paul Lewis, she will play chamber works by Schubert and Beethoven and the rarely performed Fantasia No. 4 in D for solo violin by Telemann.(Monday at Alice Tully Hall at 7:30 p.m.; lcgreatperformers.org. April 8-11 at Avery Fisher Hall; nyphil.org.)A version of this article appears in print on March 29, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Classical: A Worshiper at Bach’s Altar.
