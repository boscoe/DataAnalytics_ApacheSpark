Marion Knight, the former Death Row Records chief executive known as Suge, was rushed directly from a Los Angeles courtroom to the hospital on Tuesday morning after pleading not guilty to murder charges stemming from a hit-and-run last week, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said.Mr. Knight needed “some type of medical attention” after complaining of “chest pains,” said Deputy Kelvin Moody, a spokesman for the department.The hip-hop mogul had just been arraigned in Los Angeles County Superior Court, where he was charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit-and-run. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Mr. Knight struck two men with his truck in a fast-food parking lot on Friday, killing one, following a dispute on a set for the rap biopic “Straight Outta Compton.”Mr. Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is considered a flight risk and faces the possibility of enhanced sentencing under the three-strikes rule if convicted because of two previous violent felonies, the district attorney’s office said. He is being held without bail and faces up to life in prison.James Blatt, Mr. Knight’s lawyer, said his client “was in fear for his life” when he accelerated and hit the victims during a physical altercation with four men. “He did not have any knowledge that he hit anyone,” Mr. Blatt said.Mr. Knight is due back in court for a bail review hearing on Feb. 9.A version of this article appears in print on 02/04/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Former Hip-Hop Mogul Pleads Not Guilty to Murder.
