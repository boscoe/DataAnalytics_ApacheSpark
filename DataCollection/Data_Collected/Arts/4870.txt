It’s less than a minute long, it shows few moments from the movie, and it offers only a glimpse of its subject. And yet the first look at “Steve Jobs,” the forthcoming biopic about the Apple co-founder, manages to effectively do what a teaser trailer should: fuel curiosity and build anticipation. The film’s distributor, Universal Pictures, probably hopes the film, due in October, will receive better reviews than did the 2013 film that covered similar ground and starred Ashton Kutcher.Here, Danny Boyle is at the helm, with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and a lead performance from Michael Fassbender. Much was revealed about the film’s bumpy journey to the big screen in studio emails made public during the hacking of Sony,  where the project was first set up. But this first look suggests the film may have weathered the storm.The teaser is mostly a shot from behind  Mr. Jobs, standing in an empty theater as pointed, Sorkinistic dialogue runs in voice-over.“You can’t write code; you are not an engineer. What do you DO?” asks Steve Wozniak, the other Apple co-founder, played by Seth Rogen. As a majestic score begins to swell, Mr. Jobs responds: “The musicians play the instruments. I play the orchestra.” We see Mr. Fassbender from the front, in Mr. Jobs’s signature black turtleneck, at the end, giving us only a glimmer of his  performance.The last bit of dialogue in the teaser directed at Mr. Jobs — “no one sees the world the same way you do” — signals a weighty portrait, but also seems to be courting the Oscars right out of the gate.
