In October, Marvel Comics introduced readers to a new hero: a female Thor. Since then, the identity of the woman wielding Thor’s mighty hammer has been a secret. But that ends on Wednesday when issue No. 8 of the Thor series, written by Jason Aaron and illustrated by Russell Dauterman, goes on sale in comic book stores and digitally. The story reveals the new heroine to be Dr. Jane Foster, a former girlfriend of the hero who has been battling breast cancer. “Jane Foster has been part of the Thor comics and the Thor mythology from almost the very beginning,” Mr. Aaron said. “The very act of picking up this hammer, of becoming Thor, is killing her. Where we go from here is the real story.” The new series has been a Top 10 book for Marvel. “Most of the new readers seem to be women and young girls, which is great,” Mr. Aaron said. “You’re seeing more and more comics that appeal to that audience.” The popularity of the new Thor has also increased his recognition with non-comics fans.  “Usually when I say I write comics for a living, I kind of get blank stares,” Mr. Aaron said. “Now, when I say I write Thor, they say, ‘You’re the lady Thor guy?’ Yup. That’s me.”
