After a period of turmoil over the fate of its architecture school, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation has selected Aaron Betsky as its new dean. Mr. Betsky, who last year stepped down as the director of the Cincinnati Art Museum, said he would start next month, succeeding Victor Sidy, who has led the school since 2005. “The school does have to grow, not just in terms of student numbers, but also in terms of its capacity and its academic excellence,” Mr. Betsky said in a telephone interview. “We have to keep proving that this is the best experimental-architecture school in the world.” Facing the loss of its accreditation, the foundation in October approved a possible path toward independent incorporation of its architecture school — provided fund-raising targets are met. Mr. Betsky, who has taught and written extensively about architecture, said he was undaunted, having raised more than $80 million in his eight years at the Cincinnati Art Museum. The architecture school’s main campus is in Scottsdale, Ariz., with a campus for summer terms in Spring Green, Wis.A version of this brief appears in print on January 27, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Wright Foundation Names Architecture Dean.
