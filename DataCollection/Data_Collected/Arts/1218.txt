It’s too bad more of them don’t have the resilience of “Unforgettable,” a good crime show that keeps finding ways to stay on the air. For its fourth season, which begins Friday, Nov. 27, that has meant moving to a new network, A&E.The show stars Poppy Montgomery as Carrie Wells, a New York detective whose unusual gift, total recall, helps her and her partner (Dylan Walsh) solve crimes. Back-to-back episodes start off the new, 13-episode season, the first with Skeet Ulrich guest starring, the second with Rachel Dratch.The series, introduced in September 2011, performed decently for CBS in Season 1 but wasn’t renewed. Then the network had a change of heart, bringing it back for two more seasons before canceling it again.But A&E picked it up for another round, which will include some new faces: Alani Anthony, Kathy Najimy and E.J. Bonilla.Advertisement
