THE Lower East Side was once frontier territory, where new immigrants settled alongside poets and artists, punk musicians and anarchists, everyone needing rock-bottom rent. In the 1980s, the neighborhood soaked up some of the limelight trained on the East Village art scene, and began the slow creep toward gentrification. A decade or so ago, when art dealers started to set up shop below East Houston Street, a vague hope beat in the hearts of some observers that the neighborhood might be an alternative, in art and attitude alike, to Chelsea. I doubt anyone harbors that hope today. Mostly, the Lower East Side gallery scene is Chelsea with more storefronts and cheaper retail. Still, it has a certain margin of flexibility, and sometimes it uses it. And that’s good to see.I doubt, for example, that many Chelsea galleries would be willing or able to turn their spaces into a full-time rehearsal hall for Baroque opera. But that’s what the nonprofit Whitebox Art Center is doing. Through April 27, the young director R. B. Schlather is using the gallery to stage a production of George Frideric Handel’s 1733 “Orlando” with daily public rehearsals during gallery hours, a dress rehearsal on April 24, and performances on April 26 and 27. You can take the rehearsals for what they are or as a species of performance art; either way, they’re fascinating. You see art shaped, quite perceptibly, right before your eyes.“Orlando” is not the only ongoing performance work around. When I visited the Y Gallery, the artist Oliver Bulas, who moves between Brazil and Germany, was presenting a piece called “Spooky Action at a Distance and How to Escape This Dangerous Age. A Filmset.” I entered the gallery; he greeted me with a scripted but personable introduction, led me through a series of verbal adventures, then out of the gallery and onto the street. I won’t say more except to note that Lower East Side streets are still vital, lived-in, anything-can-happen terrain, as those in the Chelsea art mall are not. (Work by another performance-based artist, Irvin Morazan, is now at Y Gallery.)
            Holland Cotter's walk through the neighborhood.        One big advantage to the neighborhood’s tiny storefronts is that it doesn’t take much to materially transform them, as the artist Tony Feher has done here. He’s covered the front windows with allover mosaiclike patterns made from pieces of blue translucent tape. Sunlight turns the interior into a pool of aqueous blue. The effect is lovely and creates an appropriately Romantic environment for a group of tiny pencil drawings by the British painter Tom Fairs (1925-2007), all done in Hampstead Heath, where John Keats was in the habit of taking the air.Drawings by June Leaf at Steven Harvey are, on the average, even smaller than Mr. Fairs’s, more intensively worked, and in an entirely different emotional key. Most are of tiny figures painted on photographs or drawn over and over on paper until they seem to vibrate. All seem to be embedded in unexplained narratives, and even when images are meant to be wry or comedic, as in studies for sculptures, there’s a charge of violence around them. This is especially strong in her drawings and paintings on photographs, where she seems to be digging and boring into the surface of the print. Ms. Leaf, in her 80s, is extraordinary, and her show, which stretches over decades, is one of the best on the Lower East Side.AdvertisementLothar Osterburg specializes in an antique form of photographic reproduction, photogravure, and he creates his own subjects for his work: tabletop models of fictional cities and landscapes, which he shoots, then prints, with results that have a shadowed, theatrical look. There are several prints in his solo show here, but the most interesting piece is a giant version of one of his models, a spiraling tower-shaped sculpture called “Tower of Babel” built entirely from old books. Mostly we see their bindings, but printed pages in various languages are visible. Like some of the prints, there’s something a bit too winsome about the piece — it brings to mind a Victorian dollhouse — until you notice little dirigibles floating, as dark as sharks, near the tower’s top. (The show closes on Sunday.)Babel is not a bad reference to keep in mind when approaching Pieter Schoolwerth’s zany, visually polyphonic solo, which spread over both of Miguel Abreu’s two spaces. I recommend starting with the video at 36 Orchard Street, which sets up the somewhat abstruse idea that the entire, quite elaborate show was inspired by a malfunctioning home vacuum cleaner, the mechanical failure of which got Mr. Schoolwerth reflecting on — well, read the news release yourself, which the artist wrote. Then dive into the painting installation at 88 Eldridge Street which, if it’s vacuous idea-wise (and I’m just saying “if”) it is so in such a physically dense, loquacious, ingenious way as to feel quite substantial.Talkative is certainly one way to describe painting these days, or at least a lot of the painting in this part of town, and you get a fair sense of this in the group show “Third Heat” here. The four artists — Gina Beavers, Brian Belott, Annie Pearlman, Torey Thornton — work in different styles but have in common a love of what you might call the language of paint: building up surfaces, piling on colors, mixing modes (figurative, abstract). It looks like fun to do; beyond that passing impression, it interests me not at all, Ms. Beavers’s work being the exception: Her political wit and willingness to be gross hold great promise. (She makes a valuable contribution to another group, that one on view in the venerable Abrons Arts Center at the Henry Street Settlement.)There’s more painting all over this part of town, but only a few things stay in mind, among them two pictures from the mid-1980s by David Wojnarowicz in a group show here. One is of a kind of monster-man head, the other is an image of snakes surrounding a frog, painted on a metal trash can lid. Mr. Wojnarowicz was one of the signature figures in the brief East Village art boom. Some of his early work was silly and half-baked, the way much Lower East Side painting, however highly polished, is now. But from the start, his art had a moral spine running through it, a hot wire of outrage, that refined it into shape once he found his true subjects — death and social injustice — in the AIDS crisis of the Reagan years. The Lower East Side that this artist experienced no longer exists, though there are traces of it. It’s nice to find something of its spirit alive in the work of younger artists in the Fuentes show, like Darja Bajagic, Lizzi Bougatsos and, particularly, Renaud Jerez, whose life-size bionic zombies — there are examples in the current New Museum Triennial — are assembled from street junk of a kind (webcams, satellite TV cable) Mr. Wojnarowicz, who died in 1992, may never have known.This nonprofit community-oriented cultural center opened in 1980 in what was largely a working class Puerto Rican neighborhood and remains in operation in its original, ultrafunky quarters. which house an art gallery, a zine library, a public darkroom and computer lab. The center still presents weekly hard-core punk concerts and has a nourish group show, “Purloined Letters,” on view now – How long the building will survive as visual evocation of the area’s past is a question. A fund-raising campaign to revamp it is underway.This more recent nonprofit, tucked into a corner of the Essex Street Market, has a show that’s basically about urban preservation. Called “Shifting Impressions,” it’s a collaboration between the artists Liene Bosquê and Nicole Seisler, who lead public walks on the Lower East Side, during which participants make clay impressions of the urban landscape they pass through: cracks in sidewalks, embossed hubcap patterns, ornamental carvings surrounding tenement doorways. Dozens of such impressions, from New York and other cities, are displayed in the gallery, which is itself part of a changing, still-vanishing part of town. The Essex Street Market, which opened in 1940, is scheduled for “redevelopment.”At CALLICOON FINE ARTS, 49 Delancey Street, at Eldridge Street, a collaborative show by Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh and Hesam Rahmanian, Iranian artists (two of them brothers) living in Dubai; “Teeth Gnash Tennessee,” a large rotating group show at INVISIBLE-EXPORTS, 89 Eldridge Street, at Grand Street, that’s showing only two works at a time for two days; and at STEVEN HARVEY FINE ART PROJECTS’ second space, at 237 Eldridge Street, paintings by Robert Harms.Advertisement151  This subterranean former dive bar space now feels like a clandestine 1950s drinking den. There are two menus — one brief, one long — depending on how much variety you want. It’s that kind of bar: low-fi or high-end, depending on your needs. There are several tasty variations on the Old-Fashioned: whiskey, brandy, tequila. 151 Rivington Street, near Suffolk Street. No phone, 151nyc.com. Nearby is ATTABOY, just as small and dark, but above ground. If you’re lucky, you’ll catch Sam Ross or Michael McIlroy, the owners, behind the bar. Ask Mr. Ross for a Penicillin, Mr. McIlroy for a Greenpoint; they invented those modern classics. 134 Eldridge Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side. No phone.
