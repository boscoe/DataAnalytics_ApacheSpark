Friday’s show was the opening of her follow-up engagement. Backing her were Alex Rybeck on piano, Jered Egan on bass and Dan Gross on drums.Ms. Kind, 64, made her New York nightclub debut in the Persian Room at the Plaza Hotel in 1969. Now as then, she is an exponent of the grand style of Judy Garland and Ms. Streisand.Romantic ballads, delivered with a swooning intensity, were interspersed with up-tempo numbers like “I Can Cook, Too” and “All That Jazz” that brought out Ms. Kind’s inner red-hot mama. Ms. Kind good-humoredly displayed the unflattering cover of her debut album on RCA, recorded when she was 17, and sang one of its songs, “It’s a Beautiful Day.”Her endearing stage personality and fervent audience support helped distract from two overriding problems: a taste for cringe-inducing material like the curdled humor of “If He Were Straight and I Were Young,” by Ronny Whyte and Francesca Blumenthal, and greeting-card piffle like Ann Hampton Callaway’s “Perfect”; and off-pitch singing that worsened whenever Ms. Kind pushed too hard, especially in her rendition of “So Many Stars.”Not all the choices were so unfortunate. The happiest discovery was an obscure Burt Bacharach-Hal David love song, “I Just Have to Breathe,” which Ms. Kind carried off without a hitch.Advertisement
