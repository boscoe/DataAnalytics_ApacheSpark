It’s good to be king (or queen).“The King and I,” the sumptuous Lincoln Center Theater production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic, last week grossed $1 million for the first time, as audiences have continued to build for the Tony-nominated revival, which stars Kelli O’Hara and Ken Watanabe.And “The Audience,” with Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II, had its best week yet (and all of its weeks have been good), bringing in $1.2 million in seven (instead of the typical-for-Broadway eight) performances. Over all, the week ending May 17 was a good one for Broadway theaters, which grossed $28.1 million, up from $26.5 million the previous week. The current season, which ends on Sunday, is running ahead of last year in both grosses and attendance. Some shows are still struggling, most conspicuously “The Visit,” which, despite being nominated for a Tony for best musical, played to 55 percent capacity houses and brought in $211,430, which is just 28 percent of its potential gross. “Airline Highway,” the Manhattan Theater Club’s production of  Lisa D’Amour’s  play set in New Orleans, is also having a tough time, bringing in $180,476, or 37 percent of its potential gross; that show is closing a week early, on June 7. Among the other nominees for the best musical Tony, “An American in Paris” continued to bring in the most money, but dipped slightly last week, while “Something Rotten!” had its best week yet, and “Fun Home,” playing in a smaller theater, boasted the highest capacity audiences of any show other than “The Book of Mormon.”Meanwhile, the first show of the next season, “An Act of God,” is performing strongly in previews before its May 28 opening. The comedy, written by David Javerbaum and featuring the television star Jim Parsons, grossed $738,682 last week.
