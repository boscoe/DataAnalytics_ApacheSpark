As radio stations that were once straight-ahead hip-hop begin to lower their walls to pop influence, hip-hop won’t necessarily change, but it will morph. That creates room for a whole new class of rappers who have never considered life outside of the club. Take Kid Ink: He’s from Los Angeles, but where he really lives is on the radio, in saccharine party anthems full of dubious gender politics and toothless rapping.In February, he released his second major-label album, “Full Speed” (Tha Alumni Music Group/88 Classic/RCA). He’s an unremarkable technician and often coasts on his collaborators, but over the last couple of years, as sprightly party-rap has become a staple, his lightness has been an asset. And moving forward, as walls that once seemed impermeable continue to crumble, maybe it will become a template, too.
