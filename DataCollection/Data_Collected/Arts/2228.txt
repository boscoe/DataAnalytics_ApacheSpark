PARIS — Joel and Ethan Coen will preside over the jury of the 68th annual Cannes International Film Festival in May, the festival announced on Tuesday.“We look forward to returning to Cannes this year,” the filmmaker brothers said in a statement, adding that the festival had been important to them since the start of their careers.The brothers, who are both writers and directors, will be the first to serve as co-presidents of the jury. They won the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or, in 1991 for their movie “Barton Fink,” and the best director prizes for “Fargo” in 1996 and “The Man Who Wasn’t There” in 2001. In 2013, their “Inside Llewyn Davis” won the festival’s Grand Prix.“Presiding over the jury is a special honor, since we have never heretofore been president of anything,” they said. “We will issue further proclamations at the appropriate time.”The festival will run May 13 to 24. The film selection and jury are expected to be announced in mid-April.The Coen brothers are currently filming “Hail Caesar!” starring George Clooney, Christopher Lambert, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Josh Brolin and Channing Tatum.
