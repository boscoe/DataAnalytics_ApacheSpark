In The New York Times Book Review, Janet Napolitano, former secretary of homeland security, reviews Masha Gessen’s “The Brothers.” The book chronicles the lives of the Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Ms. Napolitano writes:Gessen finds no single point in the brothers’ lives at which they were radicalized. Instead, she presents twists and turns that offer vantage points where we can pause and ask, What if? Consider Tamerlan. According to Gessen, Tamerlan’s parents possessed high — perhaps inflated — expectations for him. He failed to meet those expectations, despite glimmers of hope. Once considered an Olympic boxing prospect, Tamerlan was denied the opportunity to compete at nationals because he was not a citizen. He dropped out of community college, married and fathered a daughter. He delivered pizza, drove a van for a nursing home and began dealing pot. There was no American dream for him. Nor was there an American dream for his sisters, both of whom dropped out of high school, entered into bad marriages and were saddled with children as teenagers.On this week’s podcast, Ms. Gessen discusses “The Brothers”; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; Gretchen Rubin talks about “Better Than Before”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Pamela Paul is the host.
