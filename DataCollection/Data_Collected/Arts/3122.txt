Bruce Willis will make his Broadway debut this fall as the bedridden novelist in a stage adaption of “Misery,” best known from the 1990 film thriller that starred James Caan and, in an Oscar-winning performance, Kathy Bates as the psychotic fan who holds the writer hostage. Mr. Willis will play the Caan character and the New York theater star Elizabeth Marvel (“Other Desert Cities,” “Fifty Words”) will play Annie Wilkes, the Bates character, the producers said on Wednesday in announcing the show. The play is by William Goldman, who wrote the screenplay for “Misery” (based on the Stephen King novel) and won Academy Awards for his film scripts for “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” and “All the President’s Men.” Will Frears will direct the play; he staged a world premiere of the stage version in 2012 at Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa. Performance dates and a Broadway theater will be announced later. “Misery” will be produced by Warner Bros. Theater Ventures, Castle Rock Entertainment, and Raymond Wu. The production was first disclosed by The Hollywood Reporter.
