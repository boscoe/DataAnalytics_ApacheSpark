This concert series, presented by the association’s New York chapter on four consecutive Fridays in October, will feature avant-garde titans like the trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith and the drummer Thurman Barker, who each leads a group at 8 p.m. this Friday. At the Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street, Manhattan, 800-838-3006, aacmnyc50th.bpt.me. (Nate Chinen)Ignacio Berroa Celebrates Dizzy Gillespie  (Wednesday) Mr. Berroa is an authoritative Cuban drummer who worked steadily with Dizzy Gillespie during the last dozen years of that trumpeter’s life and career. For this tribute to his former mentor, in the club that bears his name, Mr. Berroa joins forces with the trumpeter Jon Faddis, perhaps the world’s most devoted Gillespieologist. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)★ BRIC JazzFest  (Friday) The finale of this first BRIC JazzFest, at the BRIC House complex in Downtown Brooklyn, is a marathon of overlapping sets by artists including the organist Dr. Lonnie Smith, with his ensemble Evolution; the trumpeter and keyboardist Nicholas Payton, with his trio; the James Carter Organ Trio, led by Mr. Carter, a saxophonist; and Thumbscrew, consisting of the guitarist Mary Halvorson, the bassist Michael Formanek and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. Beginning at 7:30 p.m., 647 Fulton Street, at Rockwell Place, Fort Greene, 866-811-4111, bricartsmedia.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementAlan Broadbent-Putter Smith Duo  (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Broadbent is a pianist who favors a romantic and even courtly harmonic sophistication, which has helped make him an essential partner to figures like Charlie Haden and Diana Krall. He has a longtime bond with Mr. Smith, an unassuming, rock-solid bassist. At 9:30 and 11 p.m., Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementGeorge Colligan Trio  (Tuesday) The pianist George Colligan has done some smart and energetic work in the acoustic trio format recently, and for this one-nighter he enlists two experienced partners, the bassist Vicente Archer and the drummer E.J. Strickland. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Dezron Douglas Black Lion Quartet  (Thursday) A bassist with a deep and soulful sound, Dezron Douglas has started making his name as a bandleader. In the Black Lion Quartet, Mr. Douglas enlists the alto saxophonist Lummie Spann, the pianist Willerm Delisfort and the drummer Jeremy (Bean) Clemons. At 9:30 p.m., Ginny’s Supper Club, 310 Lenox Avenue, near 125th Street, Harlem, 212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com. (Chinen)★ Kurt Elling  (Friday and Saturday) “Passion World,” the new album by the singer Kurt Elling, puts a high-concept gloss on the love song, drawing broadly from a pop repertory and enlisting a global assortment of guests. For his debut engagement at the Café Carlyle, titled “Elling Swings Sinatra,” Mr. Elling offers a centennial salute to a master of the form, with an ace band that includes Troy Roberts on tenor saxophone, John McLean on guitar and Gary Versace on piano. Friday 8:45 p.m., Saturday at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m., 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com. (Chinen)Shane Endsley  (Saturday) Mr. Endsley is a trumpeter and composer whose most prominent post is with Kneebody, which plays a form of intricate chamber-jazz with heavy grooves. As a bandleader on his own, he often moves in more shadowy realms, which raises some intrigue for a performance with Nate Radley on pedal steel and electric guitars, Uri Caine on piano, Matt Clohesy on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ An Evening of Talent Deserving Wider Recognition  (Sunday) Allen Lowe, a saxophonist, composer, music historian and outsider-sage, rallies a range of collaborators for this concert. Stretching seven hours, it features just as many groups, each with a different angle of attack. (One will consist of Mr. Lowe, the clarinetist Ken Peplowski, the pianist Ursula Oppens and the bassist Kevin Ray.) The music is all Mr. Lowe’s, including a grand finale for large ensemble, tentatively titled “The Five Stages of Grief/Meditations on Disintegration.” Starting at 3 p.m., IBeam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Chinen)Román Filiú Ouroboros  (Friday) The alto saxophonist Román Filiú has kept exalted company in and out of his homeland of Cuba — he apprenticed with both the pianist Chucho Valdés and the saxophonist David Murray — and he has recently been blazing his own trail through the New York scene. In his group Ouroboros, he plays in a front line alongside Jonathan Finlayson on trumpet and Maria Grand on tenor saxophone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, jazzgallery.org, 646-494-3625. (Chinen)Frank Sinatra at 100  (Saturday) Among the many celebratory gestures around Sinatra’s centenary, this marathon concert — divided into three 180-minute segments — harbors perhaps the most potential for the unexpected. Hosted by the songbook savant and radio personality Jonathan Schwartz, it will feature a varied roster of artists, including singers like Marilyn Maye, Tierney Sutton, Kate Davis and Peter Cincotti. At 2, 5 and 8 p.m., Peter Jay Sharp Theater at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Tom Harrell  (through Sunday) Mr. Harrell, a trumpeter and fluegelhorn player of prominence since the 1970s, has also been a beacon of small-group bandleading in recent years, working with a regular stable of sidemen. A few of them — the saxophonist Wayne Escoffery, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the pianist Danny Grissett — join him at the Village Vanguard. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

(Mr. Roditi appears Friday; for the rest of the run, the trumpeter will be Terell Stafford.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)★ Fred Hersch  (through Oct. 25) Mr. Hersch, a pianist and composer, turns 60 in the coming week and will celebrate in a state of busy creativity. He’s currently presiding over an ambitious new multimedia work — “Rooms of Light,” a song cycle inspired by the medium of photography, and created with the poet Mary Jo Salter — at Montclair State University (Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Kasser Theater, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, 973-655-5112, peakperfs.org). On Tuesday, Mr. Hersch settles in for a week at the Village Vanguard with his excellent working trio, featuring John Hébert on bass and Eric McPherson on drums (through Oct. 25 at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, villagevanguard.com, 212-255-4037). (Chinen)★ Julian Lage Trio  (Saturday) The guitarist Julian Lage is one of jazz’s breezier virtuosos, possessed of an unflappable technical facility and a seemingly boundless curiosity. He demonstrates this gift on a new solo acoustic album, “World’s Fair” — as he’s no less likely to do with his recently formed trio, featuring Scott Colley on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Chinen)Nilson Matta’s Brazilian Voyage  (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Matta, a bassist best known for his work with Trio da Paz, presides over a flexible ensemble dedicated to the music of his native Brazil. His fellow travelers are the pianist Helen Sung, the saxophonist Craig Handy, the drummer Mauricio Zottarelli and the vocalist and percussionist Fabiana Masili. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)★ Brad Mehldau  (Thursday) In his justly celebrated solo concerts, the pianist Brad Mehldau often spirals outward from a theme, forming complex structures on the fly, with or without a clear tether to the given melody. This digressive, rhapsodic, trancelike approach illuminates the diverse body of music on “10 Years Solo Live,” a new boxed set culled from a decade of European concert recordings, released initially on eight LPs. It will likewise animate this concert, which includes the world premiere of “Three Pieces After Bach,” a commission inspired by J.S. Bach’s “Well-Tempered Clavier.” At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Chinen)★ Roscoe Mitchell  (Friday) Mr. Mitchell, a saxophonist and composer of rigorous disposition, has lately been busy commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, to which he has belonged from the beginning. This concert — a subsidiary part of those festivities, presented by Pioneer Works — will feature his music for a quintet with the baritone Thomas Buckner, the multi-reedist Scott Robinson and the drummers Tani Tabbal and Gerald Cleaver. At 8 p.m., Pioneer Works, 159 Pioneer Street, between Imlay and Conover Streets, Red Hook, Brooklyn, 718-596-3001, pioneerworks.org. (Chinen)★ Jane Monheit  (through Saturday) When she arrived on the scene 15 years ago, Jane Monheit was both praised and criticized for her fealty to the style of Ella Fitzgerald, her chief jazz-vocal influence. A lot has happened for Ms. Monheit since, as an artist and a person, and it seems likely she’ll bring an unforced maturity, along with a deep reserve of affection, to this tribute, titled “The Songbook Sessions: The Music of Ella Fitzgerald.” At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ Arturo O’Farrill and the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra  (Saturday) Last year the pianist and composer Arturo O’Farrill made a pilgrimage to Cuba, his father’s homeland, with the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, his flagship band. “Cuba: The Conversation Continued” — a powerfully ambitious album recorded in Havana — will provide most of the substance for this concert, featuring the orchestra along with the Cuban vocalist Bobby Carcassés, the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, the pianist Michele Rosewoman and others. At 7:30 p.m., Hostos Center for the Arts and Culture, 450 Grand Concourse, at 149th Street, Mott Haven, the Bronx, 718-518-4455, hostos.cuny.edu/culturearts. (Chinen)AdvertisementOne for All  (Friday through Monday) Drawing partly from its most recent studio album, “Incorrigible,” this hard-bop collective benefits greatly from the lean proficiency of its roster: Jim Rotondi on trumpet, Eric Alexander on tenor saxophone, Steve Davis on trombone, David Hazeltine on piano, John Webber on bass and Joe Farnsworth on drums. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m. (no 10:30 set on Monday), Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ John Scofield-Joe Lovano Quartet  (through Sunday) “Past Present,” the excellent new album by the guitarist John Scofield, documents a welcome reunion of his quartet of the early-to-mid 1990s: an elastic, swinging group featuring Joe Lovano on tenor saxophone and Bill Stewart on drums. Larry Grenadier is the bassist on the album, replaced by Ben Street here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ Kamasi Washington (Friday) One of the breakout stories of this year in music is Mr. Washington, a tenor saxophonist from Los Angeles with a burly, beseeching sound and an impressive working band. He draws from his aptly titled triple album, “The Epic,” for a CMJ Music Marathon showcase that also includes Mark Guiliana’s Beat Music and Lakecia Benjamin & Soul Squad. At 6:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, 212-505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com.
