SXSW is recognizably more safety­-conscious this year after a deadly incident in 2014, when a drunken driver crashed through a barrier and killed four people waiting in line on the street outside a club, and injured others. There are more barricades, more police officers  and more streets closed to traffic. Reports from the South by Southwest conference and festival in Austin.Clubs are determinedly keeping waiting lines on sidewalks and off the streets. But they are also more worried than ever about possibly exceeding capacity, which leads to more people waiting outside — a recipe for frustration as a band’s half­-hour set goes by and fans are still outside. On Tuesday night, I also walked into many clubs that had been declared full only to see plenty of empty space on the floor.SXSW has long been what the concert business calls an underplay — acts that can draw big audiences playing in small spaces, for bragging rights, buzz and potential online video. But for an underplay in one club, tickets sell out, while there are thousands of SXSW badges and wristbands theoretically eligible for every tiny show. SXSW has a long-term overcrowding problem that seems worse than ever this year, particularly at free parties presented by sponsors that collect RSVPs from far more people than can possibly attend, but also at the festival’s own showcases, where paying customers are left standing outside. Feelings get ugly. The festival needs to come up with a solution — Limiting badges and wristbands? Curbing sponsor RSVPs? Old­-fashioned tickets for some showcases? — before it’s eligible for a Yogi Berra-­ism: “Nobody goes there anymore. It’s too crowded.”SPOTIFY PLAYLIST
