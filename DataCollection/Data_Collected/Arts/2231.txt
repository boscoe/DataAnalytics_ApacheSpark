The Roundabout Theater Company will continue its emphasis on musical revivals in its 50th anniversary season, announcing Monday a new Broadway production of “She Loves Me,” opening next spring. This 1963 musical romance, written by Joe Masteroff, Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, will be directed by Scott Ellis and star Josh Radnor (TV’s “How I Met Your Mother”) and Laura Benanti (a Tony Award winner for “Gypsy”).This new production will bring Roundabout full circle: The 1993 revival of “She Loves Me,” directed by Mr. Ellis, was the first Broadway musical in the company’s history and would go on to receive 10 Tony nominations. Since then, Roundabout has presented “Nine” (which featured Ms. Benanti); the current star-studded “Cabaret,” and “On The Twentieth Century,” opening this spring and also directed by Mr. Ellis.Mr. Ellis’s interest in “She Loves Me” was reignited after Roundabout produced a one-off reading in 2011, starring Mr. Radnor (currently on Broadway in “Disgraced”) as Georg.“I fell in love with it all over again,” Mr. Ellis said. “I thought, ‘I’m older, I’ve experienced more things.’ It’s a beautiful musical that should be introduced to a new generation, 20-some odd years later.”Casting Ms. Benanti as Amalia helped seal the deal, he added. “The list of women who can do that role is very, very short,” Mr. Ellis said. “I said, ‘I will do this only if I can get someone like Laura.’ If you don’t have that, there’s no reason to do it.” Roundabout officials on Monday did not specify which of the company’s Broadway theaters would house “She Loves Me.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/20/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Casting Announced for u2018She Loves Meu2019.
