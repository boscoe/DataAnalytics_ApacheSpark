London — Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, Cai Guo Qiang, Jenny Holzer, Takashi Murakami, Richard Serra and Luc Tuymans are among the 17 major artists who have donated works for auction to benefit 1 in 11, a new campaign to improve education for children.The campaign is a joint effort between Unicef, the FC Barcelona Foundation and Reach Out to Asia, and will be spearheaded by the soccer star Lionel Messi, Barcelona’s captain, and the tennis champion Serena Williams. Three pilot projects will be geared towards children’s education in Nepal, Bangladesh and Indonesia.While the auction, which will take place at Sotheby’s in London on Feb. 12, features mostly older works by the artists — including Mr. Koons’s “Donkey” from 1999, Mr. Cai’s “Small Pine Tree” and Mr. Tuymans’s “Model,” both from 2012 — Mr. Murakami has created a new artwork showing Mr. Messi among the artist’s signature multi-hued flowers. Mr. Murakami, who created a logo for the campaign, also contributed a flower-bedecked, signed soccer ball.
