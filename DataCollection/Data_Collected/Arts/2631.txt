Built near Nero’s onetime pleasure palace by the emperor Vespasian as a symbol of Roman military might, the amphitheater (capacity: 50,000 or so) boasted gladiators, wild beasts, crucifixions and elaborately staged Greek myths that often didn’t end well for the performers, as when criminals were catapulted above the arena to recreate Icarus’s flight toward the sun. The pièce de résistance might be a mock sea battle, the better for mass drownings, in which the amphitheater would be flooded in the morning and drained in time for the afternoon mayhem. But how, exactly, was all this achieved? With a labyrinthine system of underground pulleys, lifts and trap doors to rival the most elaborate Broadway show, says Heinz-Jürgen Beste of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome. In “Colosseum: Roman Death Trap,” the first installment of “Building Wonders” on “Nova,” Wednesdays on PBS, Mr. Beste proves his point, recreating an ancient lifting machine to release a wolf into the arena.
