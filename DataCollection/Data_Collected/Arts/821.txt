To lure the Foo Fighters to his hometown, Cesena, in northern Italy, Fabio Zaffagnini organized 1,000 musicians to play one of their hit songs, recording a video that was widely shared online in July.It caught the band’s attention, and Dave Grohl, the frontman, promised to visit. On Monday, the Italian town got its wish.“The whole world saw what you did,” Mr. Grohl said at the concert, which was not originally scheduled on the band’s current European tour. “Millions and millions of people saw what you did. It’s a beautiful thing.”The band played 27 songs, at one point inviting one of the drummers from the video onto the stage to perform. They began the concert with “Learn to Fly,” the band’s 1999 hit and the same song the 1,000 artists had recorded.Mr. Zaffagnini said the idea to recruit the Foo Fighters began as a joke. But over a year, he and a group of organizers raised $50,000, most of it through crowdfunding, and selected 1,000 musicians based on 2,000 videos that potential performers had submitted. They recorded the video on July 26, it was posted on July 30, and he flew to Walla Walla, Washington, on Aug. 14 to meet Mr. Grohl.AdvertisementAbout 3,000 people attended the “intimate” concert, Mr. Zaffagnini said, most of whom were donors or musicians in the effort. “It was just like a party among friends,” he said in a Skype interview.At one point, he was crowdsurfed to the stage. He looked back at the crowd, which was chanting his name. “Everyone looked so happy, and singing and jumping,” he said. “It was the perfect happy ending.”AdvertisementThough Mr. Zaffagnini said asking 1,000 musicians to work for free likely won’t work again, the organizers plan to do more events, with hopes of putting on a large concert in New York City. He said he plans to begin recruiting musicians worldwide soon.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
