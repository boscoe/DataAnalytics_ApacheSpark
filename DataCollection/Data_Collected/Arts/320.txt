Hanya Yanagihara, Ta-Nehisi Coates and Pam Muñoz Ryan were honored on Thursday at the second annual Kirkus Prizes ceremony in Austin, Tex. Each prize comes with an award of $50,000.Ms. Yanagihara won the fiction prize for “A Little Life,” a novel about four male friends in New York City, one of whom has been left deeply traumatized by a lifetime of abuse. The book was also shortlisted for the National Book Award, the winner of which will be announced on Nov. 18, and for the Man Booker Prize, which was awarded to Marlon James on Tuesday.The nonfiction prize was awarded to Mr. Coates for “Between the World and Me,” his best-selling, conversation-generating book about what it means to be black in America today. The Kirkus judges said that the book’s “refusal to appease readers by offering simplistic answers underscores the writer’s uncommon journalistic and literary courage.”Ms. Muñoz Ryan took home the prize for young readers’ literature for “Echo,” the story of the role a harmonica plays in the difficult lives of three children. In The New York Times Book Review, John Stephens wrote: “Long before the three stories came together in the book’s last, triumphant section, I’d been won over by the complex, largehearted characters Muñoz Ryan has created and the virtues — bravery, tolerance, kindness — that the novel espouses.”
