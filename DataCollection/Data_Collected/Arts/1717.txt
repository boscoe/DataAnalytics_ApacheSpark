Is Broadway ready for Margaritaville? A group of producers is determined to find out. They announced Thursday that they have begun developing a new musical featuring songs from the Jimmy Buffett catalog, with Mr. Buffett’s cooperation. A workshop will be held Friday in New York.The musical, which would have an initial production at a theater outside New York in 2017, is being written by Greg Garcia, the creator of the television comedy “My Name Is Earl,” and the comic actor and writer Mike O’Malley. Christopher Ashley, the artistic director of La Jolla Playhouse will direct. The producers are Frank Marshall, Mindy Rich, Anita Waxman and Beth Williams.Mr. Buffett (who is slated to play at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on New Year’s Eve) had one previous, and unsuccessful, attempt at a musical: a 1990s collaboration with Herman Wouk on a show called “Don’t Stop the Carnival.” And he has invested in two Broadway flops: he was a producer of “Dr. Zhivago” this year and “Big Fish” in 2013.But his enthusiasm for theater is apparently undiminished. In a news release, he said: “We have found our crew and I am happy to sail with them to Margaritaville. It’s going to be a fun voyage.”
