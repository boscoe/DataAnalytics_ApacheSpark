When the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art began its $305 million expansion three years ago, it made the surprising decision not to open a temporary exhibition space elsewhere for fear of draining resources. Now its budget-driven, single-minded focus seems to be paying off, as the museum’s director, Neal Benezra, has announced that it has reached its long-stated fund-raising goal of $610 million and will be opening on schedule, on May 14.The money covers construction costs for the expansion, which consists of an addition by the firm Snohetta to the original Mario Botta building that doubles its square footage, and provides an endowment of $245 million, three times the institution’s previous reserves. The money came from about 500 donors, including prominent trustees like Charles Schwab as well as new contributors making donations as small as $50.“We have never wanted the expansion just to be the act of a few families,” Mr. Benezra said. “What’s happened in the last year or so is that it’s become more of a community project.”The museum has also received about 3,000 works of promised art from some 200 donors. Highlights on view next year, he said, include paintings by modern masters like Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner and Francis Bacon; sculpture by California artists such as Charles Ray; and a gallery’s worth of photographs by Diane Arbus. Visitors next year will also see over 250 artworks from the vast collection of Don and Doris Fisher, including colorful stabiles by Alexander Calder and postwar paintings by Sigmar Polke and Anselm Kiefer. Many are monumental in size. The Fisher collection was given to the museum on a 100-year loan in 2009, prompting plans for the expansion.The museum will be free to those 18 and under.  As for adult general admission, Mr. Benezra said the fee hasn’t been finalized.A version of this article appears in print on 10/22/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: San Francisco Modern Expansion Is on Track.
