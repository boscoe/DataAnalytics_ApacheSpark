In a freedom of speech case, South Carolina’s Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Sue Summer, a reporter for The Newberry Observer, could publish the diary of a woman recently recognized as the wife of the singer James Brown. Ms. Summer had published excerpts from the diary as part of her coverage of the continuing dispute over the distribution of Mr. Brown’s estate.In a two-paragraph decision, the court said a lower court judge’s temporary restraining order, preventing Mrs. Summer from publishing the diary she received anonymously, “clearly violates petitioner’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.”The ruling is likely to have no direct impact on the judge’s January decision that Tommie Rae Hynie Brown is the widow of the singer, who died on Christmas Day 2006.  For several years, Ms. Summer has been covering the dispute over Mr. Brown’s estate, which has been valued as high as $100 million. “The Supreme Court made the correct legal decision,” says Louis Levenson, an Atlanta lawyer who represents four of Mr. Brown’s children. “First Amendment rights predominate, and there’ll be no restriction on publication.”One passage in Mrs. Brown’s diary suggests she questioned her status as the singer’s wife. “I want to be married,” she wrote before he died.  But the lower court has ruled that Mrs. Brown was indeed married to the Godfather of Soul. It rejected contentions that the marriage was invalid because she had been previously married to another man. That earlier marriage was itself not legal, the court ruled.The Supreme Court continues to review other aspects of the estate case and has ordered the lower court to halt all proceedings while it considers further action.
