From hiking through avalanche conditions on Oregon’s Steens Mountain to rappelling into a 500-foot sinkhole in Cañón Río la Venta in Mexico, these daredevils seemingly know no bounds — or fear — as they teeter on ridges, wedge themselves into crevasses (did “127 Hours” teach them nothing?) and bodysurf down glaciers while filming their adventures, which typically burn 10,000 calories a day, and refueling at prearranged food drops every 25 miles.But you know what they say about Mother Nature and plans.Advertisement
