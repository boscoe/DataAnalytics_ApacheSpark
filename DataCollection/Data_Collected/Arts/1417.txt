In another sign that the Minnesota Orchestra is continuing to put the discord of its recent 16-month lockout behind it, its musicians have announced that they are donating $250,000 to the orchestra — money that they earned and raised while playing self-produced concerts during the labor dispute with the orchestra’s former management.Kathryn Nettleman, the orchestra’s acting associate principal bass, who served as president of the nonprofit organization the musicians set up in 2013 during the lockout, called the gift a “powerful symbol” of the new spirit of collaboration between the orchestra’s musicians, administration and board of directors. The money will be used to establish a musician-led fund to support education and community programming.“It represents our committed ongoing investment in the mighty Minnesota Orchestra,” she said in a statement. “We are proud of all that the orchestra has accomplished — collaborating as a unified team, in concert with our greater community — and we know that our orchestra will continue to shine brightly far into the future.”Since the lockout came to an end in early 2014, when the musicians agreed to 15 percent pay cuts, things have turned around. The orchestra’s beloved music director, Osmo Vanska, returned after resigning during the lockout. A new president, Kevin Smith, took over and worked to repair damaged relationships and the orchestra named a new chairman, Warren Mack.In May, when the orchestra returned from a groundbreaking tour of Cuba, it announced that it had reached a new contract agreement nearly two years ahead of schedule that would give raises to the musicians and ease some of the concessions they agreed to when the lockout ended.Mr. Mack, the chairman, said at Wednesday’s annual meeting that the orchestra had ended the fiscal year with a $15,000 surplus on a budget of $31.1 million. He said it had raised $18.1 million in contributions from more than 7,000 donors and earned revenue totaling $8.5 million, while drawing 5 percent from its endowments.In March the orchestra and Mr. Vanska, will play their widely celebrated Sibelius at Carnegie Hall — rescheduling a date that had to be canceled during the lockout.A version of this article appears in print on 12/05/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Musicians Donate to Minnesota Orchestra.
