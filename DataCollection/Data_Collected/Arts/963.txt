It looks like Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr still have one more duel ahead of them.The Tony Awards administration committee on Thursday ruled that both Lin-Manuel Miranda, who plays Hamilton, and Leslie Odom, Jr., who plays Burr, will be eligible for best actor nominations in next year’s award ceremony. That means that the two rivals in this season’s big hit musical, “Hamilton,” are likely to face off yet again; it is widely expected that both actors will be nominated for the honor.The awards committee, in a brief and disagreement-free meeting, issued eligibility rulings affecting the first 10 shows that opened this Broadway season, which began in May and runs through next April.Among the other key decisions: Phillipa Soo, who plays Eliza Hamilton in “Hamilton,” will be eligible for a best actress nomination. Other notable actors in the show, including Daveed Diggs, Renée Elise Goldsberry, Jonathan Groff and Christopher Jackson, would therefore be eligible for nominations in the featured role categories.The committee said that Austin P. McKenzie, a hearing actor who plays Melchior, and Sandra Mae Frank, a deaf actress who plays Wendla, would be eligible for best acting nominations in the Deaf West Theater revival of “Spring Awakening” — meaning that Daniel N. Durant, the deaf actor playing Moritz, would be eligible for a featured role nomination.The committee deemed “Thérèse Raquin,” which is an adaptation of a novel by Émile Zola, to be a new play, and credited the British playwright Helen Edmundson, who wrote the adaptation, as its writer. There are very few plays by women that make it to Broadway; the only other new play by a woman that has thus far been announced for this season is “Eclipsed,” scheduled to open in March, which was written by Danai Gurira (best known as a television actress in “The Walking Dead”).Three shows that are being staged for the first time on Broadway this season, but have been repeatedly performed elsewhere in the past, were deemed to be revivals: the musical “Dames at Sea” and the plays “Fool for Love” and “Sylvia.”This season’s Tony Awards ceremony is to be broadcast on June 5; shows must open by April 26 to be eligible for awards. The awards are overseen by two theater industry organizations, the American Theater Wing and the Broadway League.
