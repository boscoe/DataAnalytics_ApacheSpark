Carnegie HallEvgeny Kissin has an encore problem. Since his 2007 recital at Carnegie Hall ended with 12 of them, audiences have come to expect that the listed program will be just the beginning of an evening. Despite an almost universal standing ovation, one that seemed to demand more, there were only three encores on Saturday.I didn’t mind — this was a frustrating concert. Of course, by any objective standard, Mr. Kissin’s playing remains unbeatable, a wonder that continues to draw crowds enough that, on this occasion, the hall added five rows of stage seating. (During his Perspectives series next season, Mr. Kissin will become the first pianist since the 1970s to repeat a recital in the Stern Auditorium.)So it was no shock that his control was sovereign in three Chopin Nocturnes, each slight shift in dynamics minutely calibrated, each step in his arpeggios individual but melting seductively into the others. In Prokofiev’s Fourth Sonata his touch was confounding, precise at speed and exacting in color. Liszt’s “Rákóczi-Marsch,” one of the “Hungarian Rhapsodies,” was a bravura closer of cannon-fire double octaves.But even with Mr. Kissin’s supreme rhythmic and melodic command, a set of six Chopin mazurkas turned tedious, with little to connect among them and few surprises within them. And his supremacy over his instrument made any drama, any spontaneity, in Beethoven’s “Waldstein” Sonata seem manufactured, prepackaged. A sense of the necessity of development, of argument in Beethoven’s music, was as elusive as an indication of a broader, more cohesive view.A version of this review appears in print on May 18, 2015, on Page C6 of the New York edition with the headline: Evgeny Kissin.
