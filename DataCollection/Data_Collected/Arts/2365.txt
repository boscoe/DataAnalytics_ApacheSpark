The shows are going on. With this week’s snowstorm a bust (at least in most of New York City), Broadway producers and theater owners announced that most plays and musicals would hold their regularly scheduled Tuesday evening performances. Disney’s two Broadway musicals, “The Lion King” and “Aladdin,” have been canceled, a decision producers made on Monday amid grim weather forecasts and the state of emergency declared by government officials. Both shows are offering refunds for Tuesday night’s shows.Off Broadway stages like the Public Theater will hold performances Tuesday as well, though All for One Theater has canceled its Tuesday performance of “Devil in a Box” at the Wild Project as well as a post-show panel discussion.The Metropolitan Opera was also back in business, and said that its Tuesday evening performance of Offenbach’s “Les Contes d’Hoffmann” would proceed as scheduled. After city and state officials shut down most modes of transportation on Monday night the company was forced to cancel Monday night’s premiere of its new production of a double bill of Tchaikovsky’s “Iolanta,” starring Anna Netrebko, and Bartok’s “Bluebeard’s Castle.”Some theaters in New England were hit harder by the storm. Long Wharf Theater in New Haven has canceled the Tuesday night and Wednesday matinee performances of its new play “Forever,” while also canceling rehearsal for its  production of the play “Bad Jews.” At Yale Rep, technical rehearsals for the world premiere of Danai Gurira’s play “Familiar” have been canceled for Tuesday, as were rehearsals for “Lysistrata” at Connecticut Repertory Theater, in Storrs. New Repertory Theater in Watertown, Mass., delayed its new season announcement for subscribers until next week and canceled some board committee meetings and productions meetings. The economic impact of the storm is likely to be minimal for Broadway and Off Broadway, at least, because so few shows hold performances on Monday nights.
