A bounty of Tony Award nominations helped give “Fun Home” its biggest week at the Broadway box office to date. And “Something Rotten!” is vying to join “An American in Paris” and “Finding Neverland” among audience-pleasing new musicals, according to figures released by the Broadway League on Monday.The Tony nods, announced last Tuesday, didn’t immediately mint a clear-cut new hit, though “An American in Paris,” which received 12 nominations, including best musical, is looking like one. The dance-heavy adaptation of the Oscar-winning movie, directed by Christopher Wheeldon, brought in more than $1.2 million at the box office for the week ending May 3.That total was slightly down from the week before, yet still robust. But for “Fun Home” — the acclaimed musical adaptation of Alison Bechdel’s cartoon memoir, which also received 12 nominations, including best musical — the boost was immediate: the show grossed $531,985, an increase of more than $95,000 from the week before.The Tonys weren’t so beneficial to another best musical nominee, “The Visit,” with music by John Kander and Fred Ebb and starring Chita Rivera: Despite five nominations, the show grossed $194,145, only 25 percent of its maximum potential.The Shakespeare spoof “Something Rotten!,” the other contender for best musical,   was looking up, grossing $801,033, an increase of $84,440 from the week before.Among the new shows limping at the box office: the revival of “Gigi” and the musical “It Shoulda Been You,” which had only one Tony nomination between them and played, roughly, to 60 percent capacity each.
