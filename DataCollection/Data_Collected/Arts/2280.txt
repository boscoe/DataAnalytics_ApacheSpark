In The New York Times Book Review, Jennifer Gonnerman reviews Jill Leovy’s “Ghettoside: A True Story of Murder in America.” Ms. Gonnerman writes:This is a world that most journalists never cover, and most of America never sees. Leovy, a reporter for The Los Angeles Times, argues that as a nation we have grown far too accepting of our high rate of homicide — all the yellow crime-scene tape and sidewalk candle memorials — in large part because the media has paid too little attention. In response, she started a blog at her newspaper in late 2006 called The Homicide Report, in which she attempted to cover every murder in Los Angeles County in a single year. It was a radical idea — at the time, her paper reported on only about 10 percent of homicides — and also a near-impossible task: In a 2008 article, Leovy acknowledged that the report “has merely skimmed a problem whose true depths couldn’t be conveyed.”In “Ghettoside,” she tackles this “plague of murders,” as she calls it, with a book-length narrative that enables her to write about it with all the context and complexity it deserves. Her protagonist is John Skaggs, a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, whom she portrays as both compassionate and relentless.On this week’s podcast, Ms. Leovy discusses “Ghettoside”; Patton Oswalt talks about his memoir “Silver Screen Fiend”; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; Anita Shapira discusses “Ben-Gurion: Father of Modern Israel”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
