But in papers filed in a civil case in Manhattan, the office said that Mr. Homsi had sold the sculptures, worth about $500,000, between June 2012 and May 2013. The accusations were first reported by DNAinfo.The most expensive of the artifacts is a 13th-century gilt bronze statue of a Buddhist deity that the court papers say was stolen in 1983 from a temple in Katmandu, in Nepal, and sold for $370,000.  No one responded to a request for comment left with Mr. Homsi’s gallery.
