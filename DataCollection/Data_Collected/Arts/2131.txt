Björk, the singular Icelandic experimentalist, will release her ninth studio album in March, she announced on Tuesday night in a handwritten note on her website.“It is called: ‘Vulnicura,’” she wrote, and will include songs titled “Stonemilker,” “Lionsong,” “History of Touches,” “Black Lake,” “Family,” “Notget,” “Atom Dance,” “Mouth Mantra” and “Quicksand.”Production work was contributed by the Haxan Cloak and by Arca, the Venezuelan producer known for his work on Kanye West’s “Yeezus”; with string arrangements handled by Björk.“I do hope you will enjoy it!!” the singer added, signing the note with “warmthness.”“Vulnicura” is Björk’s first album since “Biophilia” in 2011, and will coincide with a retrospective of her work at the Museum of Modern Art. The show, organized by Klaus Biesenbach, the museum’s chief curator at large, will run from March 8 through June 7, and will include video, visual art, costumes, and text described as “both biographical and imaginatively fictitious.”Björk is also scheduled to perform at this summer’s Governors Ball in New York City, which will run June 5 through 7.A version of this article appears in print on 01/15/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Björk Album for March.
