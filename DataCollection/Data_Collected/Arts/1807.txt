The Museum of Modern Art has announced one of the largest monetary gifts in its history, a $40 million unrestricted donation from the Chicago hedge-fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, whose name will now adorn one of the museum’s best-known buildings, the 1964 black steel-and-glass East Wing, designed by Philip Johnson.Mr. Griffin, the founder and chief executive of Citadel, is a noted collector and has been extremely active in recent years in giving to educational institutions and to museums, primarily in Chicago. He also serves on the board of the Whitney Museum of American Art, whose lobby in its new building in the Meatpacking District is named for him.This will be the first time that the Philip Johnson wing has been given the name of a patron. In a statement, Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, said that Mr. Griffin’s “commitment to our mission and vision is truly extraordinary.” Mr. Griffin said of the donation, his first substantial gift to the museum: “It is my hope that visitors, artists and students from around the world will experience all that MoMA has to offer for generations to come.”The museum, which is in the process of an expansion that has included tearing down its next-door neighbor on West 53rd Street, the former home of the American Folk Art Museum, has received a number of sizable gifts over the last several years to enlarge its endowment and programming, including a $100 million pledge in 2005 from David C. Rockefeller, the emeritus chairman of its board.
