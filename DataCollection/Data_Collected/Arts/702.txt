He was 89.The cause was heart failure, said his son, Murphy III.Born in Asheville, N.C., on July 9, 1926, Mr. Anderson began drawing professionally in 1944 for Fiction House, a pulp publisher that had entered the comics field in the late 1930s. He followed that with a two-year stint, from 1947 to 1949, on a “Buck Rogers” newspaper strip before landing at what became his longtime home, DC Comics, which was known at the time as National Comics.Mr. Anderson would pencil or ink nearly every major series the company published, including Superman, Hawkman and The Brave and the Bold, which introduced the Justice League of America. He also worked closely on a multitude of cover drawings with Julius Schwartz, the editor who revitalized DC’s superheroes in the mid-1950s.With the writer Gardner Fox, Mr. Anderson in 1964 created the sorceress Zatanna, the daughter of a hero magician who had appeared in the first issue of Action Comics (1938). Zatanna has been seen on various animated television series and in the live-action series “Smallville,” about Superman’s formative years.The comic book historian Mark Evanier noted that at DC, which was often fussy about the style in which celebrated characters like Superman or Batman were rendered, Mr. Anderson was the go-to artist because he could reliably draw them “on model.”Perhaps his best-known drawing was done outside the comic book industry, for the cover of the first issue of Ms. magazine, in 1972: a striking image of Wonder Woman under the headline “Wonder Woman for President.”In addition to his son, Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife of 67 years, Helen, of Martinsville, N.J.; two daughters, Sophie Robicheau and Mary Anderson; two grandchildren; and a brother, Kenneth.Advertisement
