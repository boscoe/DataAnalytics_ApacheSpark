He was 74.   The cause was cancer, his wife, Nancy, said.   Born in Detroit, Mr. Abrams was the first person hired by Berry Gordy Jr., the founder of Motown, before the company officially existed. He promoted records to Detroit disc jockeys and went on to direct media relations at the label, working with artists including Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Miracles and the Supremes.     Nancy Abrams said her husband came up with Motown’s slogan, “The Sound of Young America,” because “he wanted to push diversity” and was “colorblind.”  During a Motown tour through the Southern United States, she said, Smokey Robinson of the Miracles came to visit Mr. Abrams at a hotel where blacks were not allowed to stay.   The hotel manager was tipped off, came to Mr. Abrams’s door and asked if a black person was in his room, Nancy Abrams recalled. He replied that it wasn’t “a black person,” it was Smokey Robinson, and both men were kicked out.   “Al went back with Smokey and stayed in the black boardinghouse,” she said. “After that, he never stayed in a hotel again.”    Mr. Abrams left Motown in 1967 to start his own public relations firm. His clients included Stax Records and James Brown.   Mr. Abrams, who was also a journalist and author, was a writer for a musical, “Memories of Motown,” which was staged in Berlin in 2009.   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter and two grandchildren.  Advertisement
