Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago announced on Wednesday that two notable world premieres would be part of its 2015-16 season: a new play by Tracy Letts, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “August: Osage County,” and a new adaptation of John Steinbeck’s “East of Eden” by members of the Steppenwolf team who won acclaim for an earlier staging of Steinbeck’s “Grapes of Wrath.”“East of Eden” will open the season, with performances beginning Sept. 17. The play is adapted by Frank Galati, who received Tonys for best play and best director in 1990 for “Grapes of Wrath” after it transferred from Steppenwolf to Broadway. Mr. Galati’s “East of Eden” will focus mostly on the Trask family, whose story is driven in large part by the sibling rivalry between twin boys. The production will be directed by Terry Kinney, who was nominated for a Tony as a cast member in “Grapes of Wrath.” The play is scheduled to run through Nov. 15.Mr. Letts’s new play, “Mary Page Marlowe,” centers on a complicated woman who leads a seemingly ordinary life as an accountant from Ohio. In addition to the Pulitzer Prize for drama, Mr. Letts won the best play Tony for “August,” and also won a Tony for best actor for the 2012 Broadway revival of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (which also originated at Steppenwolf). “Mary Page Marlowe” is scheduled to run March 31-May 29, 2016; the director will be announced later.The Steppenwolf season, which will be the first under its new artistic director, the Tony-winning director Anna D. Shapiro, will also include productions of “Domesticated,” written and directed by Bruce Norris; Annie Baker’s play “The Flick,” the 2014 winner of the drama Pulitzer; and “Between Riverside and Crazy,” by Stephen Adly Guirgis.A version of this article appears in print on 03/07/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Tracy Letts Play To Steppenwolf Theater.
