In a neat reversal of the sophomore slump cliché, the second season of “The Leftovers,” which wraps up on Sunday, has added the series to the conversation about the best dramas on television.Of course, as a former show runner of “Lost,” Mr. Lindelof is used to seesawing appraisals of his work. That series was at the leading edge of a transition that saw some TV audiences go from passive viewers to passionately engaged — and occasionally demanding — fans.Mr. Lindelof has also written films, including “Star Trek Into Darkness,” “Prometheus” and “Tomorrowland.” Please leave questions for him in the comments. We will post his responses to some of them next week.Previously we heard from Scott M. Gimple of “The Walking Dead”; Noah Hawley of “Fargo”; and Sarah Treem of “The Affair.”Advertisement
