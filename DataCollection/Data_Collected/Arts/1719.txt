An invitation by the Public Theater for auditions by transgender actors prompted 130 submissions, and has led to the casting of two transgender performers in a bluegrass musical being staged at the Off Broadway theater this winter.The Public announced Thursday that it had chosen Donnie Cianciotto, a transgender man from Arizona, and Aneesh Sheth, a transgender woman from New York, in the production of “Southern Comfort,” which is an adaptation of a 2001 documentary film, by Kate Davis, about  transgender people coming together to support a dying friend. The production will star Annette O’Toole and Jeff McCarthy, who appeared in previous stagings of the musical at Barrington Stage Company and at CAP21 Theater Company.The show, which will begin previews on Feb. 23, features music by Julianne Wick Davis, with book and lyrics by Dan Collins. It will be directed by Thomas Caruso. A version of this article appears in print on 12/18/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Public Theater Casts Two Transgender Actors.
