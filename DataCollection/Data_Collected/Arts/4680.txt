Lovers of great orchestras, opera singers and pianists may want to claim a seat at Carnegie Hall for three consecutive nights this week. On Thursday, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the superb young music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, brings that storied ensemble to the hall for Nico Muhly’s “Mixed Messages,” Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto (with the eminent Emanuel Ax as soloist) and Rachmaninoff’s rhapsodic Third Symphony. (8 p.m., Thursday, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org.)The next day (8 p.m., Friday), the formidable mezzo-soprano Stephanie Blythe, who has also shown affinity for cabaret songs and show music, touches all the bases in a recital with the pianist Warren Jones. She sings mid-20th-century works by Poulenc, Jacques Brel, Léo Ferré, Britten and Noël Coward.Then the stunning Russian virtuoso pianist Evgeny Kissin takes the Carnegie stage (8 p.m., Saturday) for a typically demanding program. He opens with Beethoven’s “Waldstein” Sonata, followed by Prokofiev’s Fourth Sonata, a large selection of Chopin nocturnes and mazurkas, and Liszt’s dazzling Hungarian Rhapsody No. 15.A version of this article appears in print on May 10, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Classical; A Good Week to Be Inside.
