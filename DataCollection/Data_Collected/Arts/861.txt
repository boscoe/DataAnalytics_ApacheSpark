Set)(Thursday) This British down-tempo electronic D.J.-producer (whose less simian real name is Simon Green) takes a boyish glee in his evocations of the primal world; his first two knotty, trip-hop-influenced albums were called “Animal Magic” and “Dial ‘M’ for Monkey.” Mr. Green often performs with a full band, placing his own bass work at center stage; he pares down the ensemble show for this spinning set. At 10 p.m., Output, 74 Wythe Avenue, at North 12th Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, outputclub.com. (Stacey Anderson)Richard Buckner(Saturday) After two decades of releasing superb alt-country discs and receiving only modest reception, this Brooklyn singer-songwriter fully embraced his solitary cachet in 2011 on “Our Blood,” a wintry account of aimless travels and eroding resolutions. He returned in 2013 with “Surrounded,” a tempestuous, lush song cycle. With Vincent Cross. At 8 p.m., Union Hall, 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, 718-638-4400, unionhallny.com. (Anderson)Alberta Cross(Wednesday) The term “Southern U.K. rock” may need to be coined for Alberta Cross, a gaggle of soulful guitar wailers who spit Kentucky-style riffs despite their British upbringings. Now based in Brooklyn, the group supports its newest, eponymous album with an overdue installment of its cathartic live show. With Dicey Hollow and Heaven’s Jail. At 8 p.m., Cameo, 93 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-302-1180, cameony.net. (Anderson)DIIV(Sunday) Swampy psych-rockers who initially called themselves Dive, in tribute to a Nirvana song, these Williamsburg, Brooklyn, musicians have a ramshackle stage presence, watertight melodies and frequently inscrutable lyrics. They’ve been preparing a second album for some time, now reportedly out this fall after several delays; it follows their breakthrough, “Oshin,” from 2012. With No Joy and Sunflower Bean. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 212-353-1600, websterhall.com/events. (Anderson)Django Django(Saturday) Django Django borrows heavily from the Zombies’ airy, psychedelic vocals, churning them through electronic processing alongside embellished Britpop rock progressions and synthetic effects. Few other young bands have combined disparate genres with such grace. The group headlines a top showcase of the Brooklyn Electronic Music Festival. At 7 p.m., Verboten, 54 North 11th Street, between Wythe and Kent Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, verbotennewyork.com. (Anderson)Ellie Goulding(Wednesday) Her breakout hit, “Lights,” defined this singer as a dance-ready pop star, though her other efforts can veer toward ruminative, singer-songwriter fare. Her sky-high soprano is a much bigger sensation in her native Britain, where she performed at the wedding reception of Prince William and Kate Middleton; she releases a new pop-heavy album, “Delirium,” in the week of this show. At 8 p.m., Manhattan Center Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, 212-279-7740, mcstudios.com. (Anderson)Buddy Guy(Monday and Tuesday) This Chess Records session player who became a Chicago blues pioneer counts Jimi Hendrix and Keith Richards among his stylistic pupils. He traversed several decades of his role in music history in “When I Left Home: My Story,” an autobiography released in 2012, and remains a vivacious stage presence with his six strings. With Tom Hambridge. At 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, bbkingblues.com. (Anderson)Carly Rae Jepsen(Wednesday) A perky pop singer still best known for her earworm “Call Me Maybe,” Ms. Jepsen turns to ’80s synth-pop in the vein of Dev Hynes on “Emotion,” her satisfying third album, which Mr. Hynes helped produce. The openhearted sheen remains on its lead single, “I Really Like You.” With K. Flay. At 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, 212-777-6800, venue.irvingplaza.com. ( Anderson)Lera Lynn(Wednesday and Thursday) Aside from Colin Farrell’s highly emotive mustache, the highlight of the second season of the HBO series “True Detective” were the smoky noir-country musical interludes by Ms. Lynn. The Nashville-based singer-songwriter, who performed several times in the antiheroes’ dive bar of choice, also performed the soundtrack for the program’s trailer. Her brooding second album, “The Avenues,” was released last year. At 7:30 p.m., Joe’s Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com. (Anderson)Marina & the Diamonds(Monday and Tuesday) Much like Time magazine, which ceremoniously anointed You, the reader, as the Person of the Year in 2006, the Welsh singer-songwriter Marina Diamandis maintains that the Diamonds in her act are not the backing band but, instead, her fans. The discordant dance-pop of her 2012 album, “Electra Heart,” hit No. 1 in Britain; the follow-up, “Froot,” landed in the spring and cracked the Top 10 stateside. With Christine and the Queens. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Steve Miller Band(Saturday) This “Gangster of Love” mugs for the classic-rock set with heady Chicago blues riffs and down-home panache. After a 17-year studio absence, he and his band released “Bingo!” in 2010 and “Let Your Hair Down” in 2011; those happily mussed songs will likely be paired with “Fly Like an Eagle,” “Living in the U.S.A.” and Mr. Miller’s other well-trod heartland hits. With Don Felder. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret Many big guns of cabaret have lined up with new shows to carry Manhattan’s fall season through the Thanksgiving holidays. Leading the list are John Pizzarelli and Jessica Molaskey with “My Generation,” at Café Carlyle through Nov. 28 (35 East 76th Street, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com). At Feinstein/54 Below, Randy Graff, Cady Huffman and Judy Kaye perform “The Songs of Cy Coleman” Wednesday through next Friday. They are followed by the cabaret legend Andrea Marcovicci on Nov. 18 and 19; Julia Murney, an alumnus of “Wicked,” Nov. 19 through 21; Ann Hampton Callaway, celebrating women songwriters, begins the first of seven performances on Nov. 22; and the red-hot Broadway star Lena Hall (“Kinky Boots,” “Hedwig and the Angry Inch”) has the first of 10 performances of her new show, “The Villa Satori: Growing Up Haight Ashbury,” on Nov. 28. (254 West 54th Street, 646-476-3551, 54below.com.) At Birdland, the Tony Award-winning actress Christine Ebersole and the Grammy-winning musician Billy Stritch reunite Nov. 23 through 26. (315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com.) At the Italian restaurant and bar Pangea, the singer-pianist Eric Comstock performs Tuesdays evenings and the ethereal vocal phenomenon Carol Lipnik on Sundays (178 Second Avenue, East Village, 212-995-0900, pangeanyc.com). And Melissa Errico will debut her autobiographical show, “Sing the Silence,” on Nov. 18 and 19 at Joe’s Pub (425 Lafayette Street, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com). (Stephen Holden)★ Shakey Graves(Wednesday) Although he is occasionally given the artless “hobo folk” handle for his scraped howl and twangy guitar fingerpicking, the singer-songwriter Alejandro Rose-Garcia transcends that label with his lo-fi Americana. Performing under the name Shakey Graves, this musician and actor from Austin, Tex., is worldly but not jaded for his 20-something years, and energetic yet minimally produced, with many aching riffs. His most recent EP, “Nobody’s Fool,” packs in freak-folk moments that beg for further exploration. With the Oh Hellos and Those Darlins. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Jake Shimabukuro(Tuesday) This ukulele virtuoso from Hawaii suffuses psychedelic decadence into his stereotypically fey instrument of choice; his slick four-string renditions of rock anthems, including the Beatles’ “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” course along on a deft musicianship that evades mere novelty. At 7:30 p.m., New York Society for Ethical Culture Concert Hall, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, 877-987-6487, ticketfly.com. (Anderson)Shura(Friday) A New-Wave vocalist of winking entreaties and feathery coos, this British singer captures the same deft dance pulse as Solange and Sky Ferreira. Her breakthrough single, “Touch,” is a steady hit in her homeland; she aims to drum up support at the newest experimental arts enclave in Brooklyn, National Sawdust. At 11:30 p.m., 80 North Sixth Street, at Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, 646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org. (Anderson)★ Patti Smith(Tuesday) The patron saint of philosophical punk rock pays homage to “Horses,” her first studio album, on the exact day of its 40th anniversary. In its brash downtown spirit and a passionate blend of dactylic spoken word and proto-New Wave experimentalism, Ms. Smith’s debut continues to inspire; it’s an outcome she seemed to predict from the start, if her steely, sure-footed gaze in the cover photo (shot by Robert Mapplethorp) is any indication. Two members of her original band, Lenny Kaye and Jay Dee Daugherty, join her in this performance. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, 800-745-3000, beacontheatre.com. (Anderson)The Weeknd(Wednesday) The clarion-voiced Canadian R&B singer and producer of the sinuous summer electro-R&B hit “Can’t Feel My Face” also paired with Disclosure on “Nocturnal,” a floorshaker on that band’s new disc “Caracal.” He’s reached such cultural ubiquity, even Tom Cruise shimmies to his beat; the actor recently lip-synced along to his croons on “The Tonight Show.” With Banks and Travis Scott. At 7:30 p.m., Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry Street, Newark, 800-745-3000, prucenter.com. (Anderson)Advertisement
