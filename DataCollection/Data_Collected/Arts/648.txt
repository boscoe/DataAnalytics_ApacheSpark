Performers from Chile, Belgium, France, Japan and Rwanda will join North American theater makers in the Public Theater’s next annual Under the Radar Festival.The festival, from Jan. 6-17, seeks to introduce local theatergoers to contemporary global troupes, and to provide emerging performers from around the world access to American audiences.Several of this year’s performers will explore violence. The Royal Osiris Karaoke Ensemble, an American company, will present a work titled “The Art of Luv (Part 1): Elliot,” based on last year’s mass shooting in Santa Barbara, Calif. Dorothée Munyaneza, raised in Rwanda and France, will perform “Samedi Détente,” which is set against the backdrop of the Rwandan genocide of 1994. And Guillermo Calderón, from Chile, will perform “Escuela,” about attempts to overthrow the Pinochet regime in that country.Other performers will tackle identity issues — a common theme for contemporary theater artists. DarkMatter, described as “a trans South Asian performance art duo,” will explore “a queer apocalypse” in “#ItGetsBitter.”The festival will also include a return of the Brooklyn-based company 600 Highwaymen, performing “Employee of the Year,” with child actors describing what happens to a woman whose house burns down.The full list of performances is here.A version of this article appears in print on 10/30/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Under the Radar Lineup Has Global Concerns.
