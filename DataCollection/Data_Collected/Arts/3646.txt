The surprise release last week of Kendrick Lamar’s new album, “To Pimp a Butterfly,” made him the toast of the Internet, racking up critical accolades and generating more streams on Spotify than any album has had in a single day.So it comes as no surprise that “To Pimp a Butterfly” (TDE/Aftermath/Interscope) opens at No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart this week, with 324,000 sales and nearly 39 million streams, according to Nielsen Music. It is Mr. Lamar’s first No. 1, and the album had the second-best opening for any title so far this year, behind Drake’s mixtape “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late,” which had 495,000 sales when it came out in February.Also this week, Mark Ronson’s song “Uptown Funk,” featuring Bruno Mars, marks its 12th week at No. 1 on Billboard’s singles chart, with 187,000 downloads and 19.1 million streams. Its run at No. 1 is the longest since Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines” in the summer of 2013.The soundtrack to Fox’s hit TV show “Empire” (Columbia), which opened at the top of the album chart last week after a tight race against Madonna, fell one spot this week to No. 2. But it held on to strong numbers, with 89,000 sales — down just 19 percent — and 5.6 million streams. (Madonna’s album, “Rebel Heart,” fell 19 spots this week to No. 21.)Modest Mouse, the alternative band from Issaquah, Wash., that had big crossover success in the mid-2000s, opened at No. 3 with 73,000 sales of “Strangers to Ourselves” (Epic), its first new album in eight years. The “Fifty Shades of Grey” soundtrack holds at No. 4, and Taylor Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine) is also unchanged at No. 5.
