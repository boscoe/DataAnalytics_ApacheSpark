        Federal law enforcement authorities in New York announced Tuesday that they had returned to Italy two pieces of that country’s cultural heritage stolen decades ago before being brought to the United States: a painting attributed to the 18th-century artist Giambattista Tiepolo and an ancient Etruscan bronze statuette of Herakles.During a morning ceremony at the Manhattan United States Attorney’s Office, the artwork – Mr. Tiepolo’s “The Holy Trinity Appearing to Saint Clement” and the statuette, dating back to the fifth or sixth century B.C. – were handed over to a warrant officer for the branch of Italy’s military police responsible for fighting art and antiquities crimes. “For decades, two significant pieces of Italian heritage have been on the run,”  Diego Rodriguez, an assistant director for the F.B.I., said in a statement. “Elusive. And out of reach, until today.”The painting by Mr. Tiepolo had been reported stolen from a home in Turin, Italy, around Aug. 24, 1982, according to a court order and joint statement from the Attorney’s Office and the F.B.I. For more than 30 years, it was not known where the piece was until it was put up for auction in New York early last year.The statuette and several other valuable items were reported stolen from the Oliveriano Archaeological Museum in Pesaro 51 years ago last month. Documents said that the statuette was found in 2012 by the Italian authorities when it was offered for sale by a Manhattan auction house. Then, last year, the Italian government asked the United States for help.Federal officials said the owners of the painting and the statuette had agreed to the seizures after being shown evidence that they had been stolen.
