Meghan Trainor’s first single, “All About That Bass,” the cheeky ’50s-style self-empowerment anthem, spent eight weeks in all at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart last year. (That’s more weeks than Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” spent at number one — an astonishing statistic — but fewer weeks than Lorde’s “Royals” or Pharrell’s “Happy.”) And much about the story is odd: Ms. Trainor, now 21, is a young songwriter from Nantucket with no pop star training, but an apprenticeship in Nashville writing songs for Rascal Flatts, Sabrina Carpenter, and others.The New York Times music critics talk each week about the latest pop music news.

Our music reporter Joe Coscarelli recently interviewed Ms. Trainor and wrote a story for Arts and Leisure about her development and sudden ascension, as well as her full-length record, “Title,” which comes out next week. (It’s not her first album: she’d already recorded and self-released two others, a normal pre-career profile for smart young singers who are looking for publishing deals, aren’t already acting on TV shows, and who don’t really dance.) On this week’s Popcast, we talk about Ms. Trainor as surprise, as a formula, as contrivance, as a product of Nantucket, hip-hop, and Nashville; about her authenticity, her island-music identity, and her strangely significant connection to NRBQ, the bar-band of the gods.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
