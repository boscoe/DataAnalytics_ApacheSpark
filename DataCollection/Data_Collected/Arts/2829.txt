In January, Amazon Studios, the online retail giant’s television production wing, posted 10 original pilots for viewers to watch and vote on. This morning, five of them were ordered to series: “The Man in the High Castle,” based on the Philip K. Dick novel that imagines an alternate reality in which the Axis powers won World War II; “Mad Dogs,” a dark comedy executive produced by Shawn Ryan (“The Shield,” “Terriers”); “The New Yorker Presents,” a docu-series overseen by Alex Gibney (“Taxi To the Dark Side,” “We Steal Secrets”); and the kids series “Just Add Magic” and “The Stinky & Dirty Show.”The shows arise from Amazon’s latest pilot season, in which the first episodes of multiple shows are made available for all to watch and vote on before being whittled down to a select few. (“Transparent,” last year’s critically acclaimed series starring Jeffrey Tambor, is the most prominent series to emerge from this process.) Amazon also announced this morning that “Mozart in the Jungle,” a comedy starring Gael García Bernal and set in New York City’s classical music scene, has been greenlighted for a second season.A version of this article appears in print on 02/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Five Series Coming From Amazon Studios.
