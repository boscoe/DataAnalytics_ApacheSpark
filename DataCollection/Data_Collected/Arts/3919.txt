Five emerging artists will receive stipends totaling $300,000 from the Leonore Annenberg Fellowship Fund for the Performing and Visual Arts.The awards, to be announced Tuesday, will go to Julia Bullock, a soprano who won the 2014 Naumburg International Vocal Competition and the 2012 Young Concert Artists International Auditions; Sean Chen, the third-place finisher in the 2013 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition; Caitlin Cherry, a visual artist whose work was on view in a solo show at the Brooklyn Museum in 2013; McKenzie Chinn, an actress, writer and filmmaker who has appeared in productions at the Goodman Theater and the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago; and Joseph Gorak, a soloist with American Ballet Theater. Mr. Chen will receive a two-year award of $100,000. Each of the four other recipients will receive one-year awards of $50,000. Including the current group, the Annenberg fund, which is directed by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, has paid or pledged more than $5 million over the last eight years for career-development grants to artists.The money is intended to help the recipients create work, receive training, travel to performances, develop studios, buy materials, pay for living expenses and health care, pay down student debt, or otherwise develop their talents.Mr. Chen, for example, said that he plans to make a down payment on a piano with part of his award. Ms. Cherry said that she would use part of her fellowship to collaborate with tech specialists in the fields of artificial intelligence, diamond cutting and lasers.The artists are selected in consultation with partner organizations including the Yale School of Drama, the Juilliard School and American Ballet Theater. They then work under the guidance of mentors chosen by the partners and the fund.A version of this article appears in print on 04/07/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Help for Artists From Annenberg Fund.
