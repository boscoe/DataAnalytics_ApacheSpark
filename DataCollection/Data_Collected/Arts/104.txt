The Grateful Dead had no trouble selling tickets this year: The group broke attendance records at Chicago’s Soldier Field over the summer when it played what were billed as its last-ever shows, a series of concerts called Fare Thee Well. Now fans will get the chance to see the band — well, most of it — free. A regrouped version of the Dead called Dead & Company has added a third concert to a fall Madison Square Garden run and is giving away 10,000 free tickets to the Nov. 7 performance.The band’s other two shows at the Garden, on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, are already sold out. The online sweepstakes for the third show began on Monday morning. Dead & Company includes the Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, along with the singer and guitarist John Mayer. The odd man out is the bassist Phil Lesh, who will hold court in Port Chester, N.Y., with a series of shows from Oct. 30 to Nov. 7.Dead & Company’s Nov. 7 concert will be streamed live globally, with footage directed by Brett Ratner (“X-Men,” “Rush Hour”).
