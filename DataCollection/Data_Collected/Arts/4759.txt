Almost half of the €3.9 million, or $4.4 million, budget for this online project, the Opera Platform, comes from the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.Nicholas Payne, Opera Europa’s director, said in an interview that opera had to adapt to an Internet era in which people use Google, rather than an encyclopedia, to find information.“If we don’t swim with that tide, we will become dinosaurs,” he said.At the same time, Mr. Payne, a former general director of the English National Opera, argued that opera was not only adjusting to new technology, but also tapping into it to create “a point of contact” with a new audience that otherwise may never have listened to opera, particularly younger people. Even if their initial interest is limited to watching the online trailer for a Wagner opera, he suggested, they could eventually want to take in a four-hour performance.“The starting point is always to give people a taste of something,” he said.Similarly, Mr. Payne, 70, rejected the idea that opera had somehow remained far more elitist than other forms of art, recalling that he discovered many operas when he was young by listening to radio broadcasts.“More people are listening to opera today than ever in the past, whether in an actual theater, cinemas or through broadcast media,” he said. “If you look back at the time of Mozart and the great composers, it was a tiny audience who went to opera.”“La Traviata” was the first in a full program of live online broadcasts from the stages of 15 European opera companies in 12 countries. To mark the occasion, Verdi’s opera was also shown on a giant screen outside the Teatro Real, as well as broadcast in a handful of theaters across Spain.The website will keep transmissions available for viewing for six months after their initial posting with subtitles provided in six languages: English, German, French, Italian, Polish and Spanish. The website will also offer documentaries and other opera-related information.Mr. Payne said the 15 companies were selected to represent “a real cross-section of European opera,” in part also to secure the platform’s European Union funding.“I didn’t want it to be just the five or six most famous opera companies, even if that might have been commercially easier,” he said.The Opera Platform also chose a wide range of works, from “La Traviata” and other classics to more obscure or contemporary music. The next online broadcasts are Karol Szymanowski’s “Krol Roger,” from the Royal Opera at Covent Garden in London on Saturday, followed by Jean Sibelius’s “Kullervo,” performed at the Finnish National Opera in Helsinki on May 23. The month will close with the Latvian National Opera in Riga performing Arturs Maskats’s “Valentina.”“This scheme features a lot of new and original opera that is very bold and helps counter the myth that opera is somehow stuck in the 19th century,” said David Pountney, artistic director of the Welsh National Opera. “It is like building up a library, so you want to have some balance, the kind any sophisticated collector would choose.”Several houses, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York and the Teatro Real, already provide online transmissions of their performances, but generally on a pay-per-view basis. Some have also generated significant additional income by beaming their performances to movie theaters, particularly the Met, which started live-to-cinema broadcasts in late 2006. Some of Europe’s largest opera houses have followed suit, including Covent Garden, La Scala in Milan and the Opéra Bastille in Paris.Mr. Payne predicted that making content available online and free would not reduce opera’s other sources of revenue, whether from theater ticket sales or cinema broadcasts.“The flexibility of being able to watch on a screen,” he said, “is a quite different thing from dressing up and then being given a glass of cava,” or sparkling wine.Still, Ignacio García-Belenguer, the Teatro Real’s director general, said opera’s push into audiovisual technology “forces us all to become a lot more professional.” The camera, and online viewers, can focus on details that are barely visible to many of those seated at the opera, such as the suffering face of the dying Violetta in the last act of “La Traviata.”“It’s clear there will have to be more and better acting, as well as more focus on scenery and aspects like makeup, because of all the close-ups,” Mr. García-Belenguer said.Arte said that 45,000 people watched “La Traviata” through the Opera Platform on Friday. Another 18,000 watched it through the Teatro Real’s online service, made available for free for the occasion.The online project was officially started during a two-day conference here, in which about 300 European opera executives discussed issues ranging from technology developments to staffing costs, at a time when the euro debt crisis has forced deep cuts in government cultural subsidies in most countries.Some executives acknowledged that Europe’s opera sector had recently been forced to raise its game not only in terms of production technology but also financial planning and discipline.In Madrid, the Teatro Real has had to attract more corporate sponsorships to offset a major cut in public subsidies since the start of the financial crisis, from 60 percent of its budget in 2008 to about 30 percent this year, or €13.1 million.At a time of financial squeezing, taking part in the online platform “also helps justify our public subsidies,” Mr. García-Belenguer said, adding, “It shows our aim is to make opera less exclusive and available to a lot more people.”Advertisement
