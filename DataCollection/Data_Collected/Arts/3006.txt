In The New York Times Book Review, Tom Bissell reviews Elliot Ackerman’s first novel, “Green on Blue.” Mr. Ackerman served five tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his novel is told through the eyes of Aziz, a young Afghan. Mr. Bissell writes:One can already imagine the response from critics beholden to the imperatives of identity politics: In imagining Aziz’s story, Ackerman has committed an act of cultural appropriation. When it comes to judging creative work, identity politics is the revenge of the intellect upon the imagination — the perfect lens for someone who knows everything about art except what it’s for. Virtually every artist interested in what’s beyond our “tiny skull-sized kingdoms” (to use David Foster Wallace’s phrase) is guilty of appropriation. Would that it happened more often; if Ackerman’s novel is any indication, there would be fewer wars if it did.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Bissell discusses “Green on Blue”; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; John Hooper talks about “The Italians”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
