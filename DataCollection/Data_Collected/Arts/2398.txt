Thomas W. Lentz, who directed the Harvard Art Museums for more than a decade and shepherded them through a long and sometimes contentious $350 million renovation and expansion that was completed last November, has announced that he will step down on July 1, the university announced.In a statement, Mr. Lentz, 63, gave no reason for the decision, other than to say: “After more than a decade of hard, but rewarding work, I look forward to taking some time off before I take on the next challenge.” He added of the rebuilding project, designed by Renzo Piano: “The museums have been taken apart and put back together again to create a new kind of teaching facility that is already realizing its potential, so in large part our goal has been accomplished.”Harvard’s president, Drew Gilpin Faust, in a statement to The Harvard Gazette, the university’s official news outlet, said: “Tom never faltered in his dedication to this project, overcoming organizational, financial, and myriad other challenges with unrelenting — and quietly understated, yet compelling — zeal. Describing the museums’ transformation into a “teaching machine,” Ms. Faust added: “He leaves a legacy that will benefit us all for decades to come.”Daron J. Manoogian, a spokesman for the Harvard Museums, said in an interview that Mr. Lentz had been thinking about stepping down “for a while,” and that it was “a very personal decision for him.” He added: “This is about him taking the next step in his career.” The university said that a search for a successor would begin immediately.A version of this article appears in print on 01/30/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Harvard Art Museums Will Need New Leader.
