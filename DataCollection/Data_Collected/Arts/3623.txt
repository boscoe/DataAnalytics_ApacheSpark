LONDON — “Family Life,” by the New York-based novelist Akhil Sharma, won the second annual Folio Prize for fiction at a ceremony held here Monday evening.A panel of five writers led by William Fiennes chose Mr. Sharma, who will receive an award of 40,000 pounds, or almost $60,000. In a succinct acceptance speech, Mr. Sharma thanked his wife and his editor. “The fact that I got this prize doesn’t mean that I wrote the best book,” he said, “it just means that I got this prize.”“Family Life,” Mr. Sharma’s semiautobiographical second novel, tracks the Mishra family, who migrate to Queens from Delhi in the 1970s, but whose life slowly unravels when one son suffers a freakish accident. The New York Times Book Review named the work one of the 10 best books of 2014.The Folio Prize, established in 2014, aims to provide a headier alternative to Britain’s book award behemoth, the Man Booker Prize. An academy that includes some of fiction’s biggest names (such as Claire Messud, J. M. Coetzee, Salman Rushdie and Eleanor Catton) chooses the large part of Folio’s longlist, from which the judges select a shortlist and then the winner. The prize, which is open to any English-language book published in Britain, went last year to George Saunders’s soaring, oddball short-story collection “Tenth of December.”This year’s nominees included “10:04” by Ben Lerner, “All My Puny Sorrows” by Miriam Toews, “Dept. of Speculation” by Jenny Offill, “Dust” by Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor and “Outline” by Rachel Cusk. “How to Be Both” by Ali Smith and “Nora Webster” by Colm Toibin, also nominated, had been considered the night’s likely winners, largely because of their authors’ well-rooted reputations.
