What art can teach/What human voice can reach/The sacred organ’s praise?/Notes inspiring holy love/Notes that wing their heavenly ways/To join the choirs above.” The aria seems a fitting inclusion in a program in Lincoln Center’s White Light Festival, which explores the concept of spirituality through different artistic mediums.The rich-voiced soprano Christine Brewer and the organist Paul Jacobs join forces for this concert, called “Prayer,” which also features Bach’s “Bist du bei Mir,” Lili Boulanger’s “Pie Jesu,” Puccini’s “Salve del Ciel Regina” and Franck’s “Panis Angelicus.” Mr. Jacobs, who has spoken about the need for organists to take a more passionate and less academic approach to the repertory, will also demonstrate his chops in the Toccata from Widor’s Symphony No. 5 and “Three Pieces for organ solo” by Nadia Boulanger.
