Agins/The New York TimesTwo of Broadway’s biggest stars, Patti LuPone and Christine Ebersole, will portray competing cosmetics industry executives in a new musical, “War Paint,” scheduled to premiere in Chicago next summer.Ms. LuPone, who won Tony awards for her performances in “Gypsy” and “Evita,” will play Helena Rubinstein, and Ms. Ebersole, who won Tony awards for “Grey Gardens” and “42nd Street,” will portray Elizabeth Arden in the show, which depicts the businesswomen’s “ascent and arch-rivalry,” according to the nonprofit Goodman Theater, which will stage the production starting June 28.“War Paint” will reunite a part of the creative team behind “Grey Gardens,” featuring music by Scott Frankel, lyrics by Michael Korie, book by Doug Wright, and direction by Michael Greif. The musical is inspired by a book with the same title, “War Paint,” written by Lindy Woodhead, as well as a documentary film, “The Powder & the Glory,” by Ann Carol Grossman and Arnie Reisman.  Because of the star power of its performers and its creative team the show has been anticipated within the theater industry for a possible future commercial run on Broadway, but that will probably depend on how the Chicago run is received.A version of this article appears in print on 11/13/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: LuPone and Ebersole to Star in New Musical.
