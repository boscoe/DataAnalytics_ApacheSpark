One of the great bargains in New York is coming back: Paul Taylor’s newly reconstituted dance company, Paul Taylor’s American Modern Dance, is planning a March 10 performance at the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center where all tickets will be two for $15.The specially priced evening — the company said there would be no additional facility or convenience charges — will put the cost of a night of dance for two at Lincoln Center below the cost of a pair of double ShackBurgers at Shake Shack. (For the rest of the New York season, tickets will be $10 to $175 a piece.)Mr. Taylor recently reinvented his company to perform the works of other modern choreographers as well as his own, but the dances that will be featured on the bargain night will be his own: “Arden Court,” “Big Bertha,” “Troilus and Cressida (reduced),” and “Syzygy.”Tickets will go on sale Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. at the Koch Theater box office, online at www.ptamd.org/tickets and at 212-496-0600.A version of this article appears in print on 02/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Dance Bargain Leaves Money for Burgers, Too.
