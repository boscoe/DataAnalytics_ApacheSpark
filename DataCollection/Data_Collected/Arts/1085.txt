The International Center of Photography, which is in the process of reinventing itself in a new home scheduled to open next year on the Bowery, has received a $750,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that will be used to create what the organization calls a Center for Visual Culture, a specialized program focusing on how photographic imagery functions in 21st-century life.The grant, which will be given over three years, will be used to create new public programming, to help the center establish partnerships with other art and academic institutions and to help it better use its own world-class collection of photographs.The International Center of Photography, founded in 1974 by the photographer Cornell Capa, left its longtime home in Midtown this year when its lease expired and, after considering moves to Chelsea or Brooklyn, decided on a glassy street-level space at 250 Bowery, near the New Museum. The center’s director, Mark Lubell, has said he plans to push the center’s programming much more aggressively into exploring how the web, smartphones and social media have revolutionized the way photographic images – proliferating at the rate of two billion a day – are disseminated and consumed.The new visual culture center “is really going to look at some of the biggest issues of the day,” Mr. Lubell said in a phone interview on Tuesday. He offered examples such as the way images have propelled movements like Black Lives Matter, the recent controversy over student sexting and ISIS’s use of social media to “propagate incredible terror.”A version of this article appears in print on 11/18/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Mellon Foundation Grant for Photography Center.
