Ms. Tharp said on Monday that she plans to take 12 dancers on the road performing a program of new works set to music by Bach, Henry Butler, Steven Bernstein and John Zorn. The tour is to open in Dallas on Sept. 18, and will include stops in Beverly Hills, Calif.; Chicago; Denver; and Washington — with stops in at least 15 cities total — before wrapping up at Lincoln Center on Nov. 22. A detailed schedule has yet to be announced.Over the past five decades, Ms. Tharp has choreographed more than 160 works, including 12 television specials, six movies, four Broadway shows and two figure-skating routines. She has received two Emmy Awards, one Tony, the 2004 National Medal of the Arts and a 2008 Kennedy Center honor. In October she was named the Joyce Theater Foundation’s 2014-16 artist-in-residence.A version of this article appears in print on 02/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Tharp to Celebrate With National Tour.
