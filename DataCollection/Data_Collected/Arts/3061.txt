Marina Abramovic has never been shy about exposing herself for the sake of art. She’s stretched out naked on the floor under a model skeleton in one piece of performance art, shivered nude on a block of ice in another, and lived on a platform for 12 days in a Chelsea gallery, where visitors watched her bathe, sleep and go to the bathroom.Now, she’s baring everything in a memoir. Crown Archetype will publish Ms. Abramovic’s memoir in the fall of 2016, to coincide with the artist’s 70th birthday. The book will chronicle her childhood growing up in the former Yugoslavia, where her father served as a commander during World War II and her mother was a major in the army. It will also describe her evolution as an artist as she tested the limits of her physical and mental endurance, burning, cutting, starving and whipping herself in some of her more challenging works.In a statement, Molly Stern, the senior vice president and publisher of Crown Archetype, called Ms. Abramovic “a born storyteller with a unique voice and original point of view.”In recent years, Ms. Abramovic has taken steps to solidify her legacy. In 2013, she announced plans to build a performance art institute in Hudson, N.Y. She was the subject of a major retrospective of her work at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010. With her memoir, she’ll be adding her own voice to her already well documented life. Ms. Abramovic has inspired a biography, an opera, a documentary and even a video game.“My experiences have always been a big part of my work — they’re the source of everything I do, they’re my inspiration,” Ms. Abramovic said in a statement released by her publisher. “I hope that by sharing my story, I can give people the courage to do the things they’re afraid to do in their own lives.”
