A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.★ AACM50  (Tuesday and Wednesday) Part of this year’s anniversary festivities for the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, these concerts will feature the S.E.M. Ensemble — and members of Ostravska banda, a chamber orchestra from the Czech Republic — playing works by the association members Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, Roscoe Mitchell and Henry Threadgill (as well as by Christian Wolff and John Cage). Several of the composers will also perform; Wednesday’s program includes a blue-chip trio, with Mr. Abrams on piano, Mr. Mitchell on saxophones and flute and Mr. Lewis on electronics and trombone. At 8 p.m. Bohemian National Hall, 321 East 73rd Street, bohemiannationalhall.com. (Nate Chinen)Joey Alexander Trio  (Thursday) A prepossessing jazz pianist from Indonesia whose groundswell of public and critical interest has been inextricable from his age — he’s 11 — Joey Alexander is about to release his debut album, “My Favorite Things,” on the Motéma label. Drawing partly from that release, he leads a trio with the bassist Russell Hall and the drummer Sammy Miller. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jalc.org. (Chinen)Ben Allison/Steve Cardenas/Ted Nash  (Friday) This low-key repertory tribute — featuring the music of the multi-reedist Jimmy Giuffre and the guitarist Jim Hall, who worked together in an influential chamber-jazz trio of the late 1950s — will feature musicians well attuned to that spirit of economy and openness. On guitar is Mr. Cardenas; joining him are Mr. Nash, a saxophonist, and the group’s bassist and director, Mr. Allison. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Chinen)Peter and Will Anderson  (Friday, and Tuesday through May 7) The upstanding young torchbearers Peter and Will Anderson — also clarinetists, saxophonists, Juilliard alumni and identical twins — draw from their new album, “Déjà Vu,” on Friday with the guitarist Alex Wintz. On Tuesday, they begin a limited run with the unfortunate title “The Joy of Sax,” though the lineup is more promising: Harry Allen on tenor saxophone, Pat Bianchi on Hammond B-3 organ and Kenny Washington on drums. Friday at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Room, 34 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, 212-206-0440, metropolitanroom.com. Tuesday through Thursday at 7 p.m.; May 1 at 8 p.m.; May 2 at 5 and 8 p.m.; May 3 at 3 p.m.; 59E59 Theaters, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org. (Chinen)★ The Bad Plus  (Tuesday through May 3) The new album by the Bad Plus, due out next month, will be a collaboration with the saxophonist Joshua Redman, a kindred spirit and a member of the same jazz generation. This weeklong run features just the original band lineup (Reid Anderson on bass, Ethan Iverson on piano, David King on drums), which can deliver a gut punch one moment and turn delicate as a snowflake in the next. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Gary Bartz Quintet  (Thursday through May 3) An alto and soprano saxophonist whose career has taken him through postbop, jazz-funk and free jazz, Gary Bartz, 74, continues to draw connections in his music. His quartet includes the guitarist Paul Bollenback, the pianist Larry Willis, the bassist James King and the drummer Greg Bandy. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Matt Bauder and Day in Pictures (Wednesday) Mr. Bauder is a tenor saxophonist of adventurous disposition, along with the sort of versatility that allows for a touring gig with Arcade Fire. His most recent album, “Nightshades,” features Day in Pictures, a sharp band consisting of Mr. Bauder, Nate Wooley on trumpet, Kris Davis on piano, Jason Ajemian on bass, and Tomas Fujiwara on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band  (Saturday) The warmth and elasticity of this ensemble suggest a modern amalgam of rustic Americana, from gospel to jazz to folk to country. Along with the drummer Brian Blade, one of the most unaffectedly charismatic musicians in jazz, the band features Jon Cowherd on piano, Chris Thomas on bass, and Melvin Butler and Myron Walden on saxophones. At 9 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, carnegiehall.org. (Chinen)Michel Camilo Three + Three  (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Camilo, a fastidiously percussive Dominican pianist, has ample history with the bassist Lincoln Goines and the drummer Cliff Almond, who make up his working trio. As the title of this engagement suggests, he’s augmenting that rhythm section with several guests: the trumpeter Michael Philip Mossman, the trombonist Conrad Herwig and the saxophonist Ralph Bowen. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival  (Through May 17) This homegrown festival, now in its 16th season, celebrates the borough. Among the highlights in the coming week are the New Cookers, appearing on Friday at 9:30 p.m. at BAMCafé, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene; the Patience Higgins Band, on Sunday in a 3 p.m. jazz vespers service at the First Baptist Church of Crown Heights, 450 Eastern Parkway, at Rodgers Avenue; and the Williamsburg Salsa Orchestra, playing a free concert on Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Brooklyn Public Library-Central Library, Dweck Center, Grand Army Plaza at Flatbush Avenue and Eastern Parkway. More information is at cbjcjazz.org. (Chinen)★ Gerald Clayton Trio  (Tuesday) Gerald Clayton, a pianist of great touch and soulful exposition, has been expanding his horizons of late: He can be heard on the expeditionary new album by the veteran saxophonist and flutist Charles Lloyd. And while Mr. Clayton’s main outlet continues to be the acoustic trio, he doesn’t typically work with the veteran rhythm aces surfacing here: John Patitucci on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jalc.org. (Chinen)Pedro Giraudo Big Band  (Tuesday) This large ensemble — led by Pedro Giraudo, an Argentine bassist with strong ideas about rhythm and orchestration — has a new album, “Cuentos,” that explores themes connected to Latin American folk life. Mr. Giraudo celebrates the album’s release, shining a spotlight on not only the new music but also on dynamic soloists like the trumpeter Jonathan Powell and the saxophonist Todd Bashore. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Barry Harris Trio  (Friday through Sunday) The pianist Barry Harris belongs to a generation that carried bebop’s torch into an uncertain future. A figure of twinkly erudition, a natural pedagogue as well as an artist, he has deep history with his trio mates, Chuck Israels on bass and Leroy Williams on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Kevin Hays  (Sunday) Mr. Hays is a little unusual among elite post-bop pianists, in that he has a direct and unabashed relationship to melody. Next week he’ll release “New Day” — a groove-oriented album featuring his playing on acoustic, Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes pianos, and his Bill Withers-esque vocals on a few tracks — but first he offers a preview with this one-nighter. At 9:45 p.m., Rockwood Music Hall, 196 Allen Street, between Stanton and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, 212-477-4155, rockwoodmusichall.com. (Chinen)Vincent Herring Quintet  (Friday through Sunday) The alto saxophonist Vincent Herring, who has led a steady if unflashy solo career over the last 25 years, celebrates the release of “Night and Day” in the same fine company as on that album: the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the pianist Mike LeDonne, the bassist Brandi Disterheft and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Vijay Iyer Trio (through Sunday) The furiously productive pianist Vijay Iyer recently released another superlative album, “Break Stuff,” which confirms his stature in jazz’s contemporary vanguard — along with the dynamic excellence of his working trio, with the bassist Stephan Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Jazz & Colors: The Full Spectrum Edition  (Friday) This year, Jazz & Colors, which has twice presented a bounty of jazz ensembles at picturesque locations around Central Park, made its debut at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The experiment worked well enough to justify this sequel, featuring 10 ensembles interpreting the same two sets of standards. Among the performers are the cornetist Kirk Knuffke, with his current trio; the tenor saxophonist J.D. Allen, with a quartet; the cellist Marika Hughes, also with a quartet; and a group led by the soprano saxophonist Sam Newsome and the violinist Meg Okura. Sets at 6 and 7:30 p.m., 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org; free with museum admission. (Chinen)Lage Lund 4  (Friday) Lage Lund is a guitarist who balances his abundant proficiencies with an aesthetic of gleaming calm. Drawing partly from his assured most recent album, “Idlewild,” he leads a quartet with Aaron Parks on piano, Orlando le Fleming on bass and Craig Weinrib on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Open Loose  (Saturday) Mark Helias is a bassist equally committed to the causes of momentum and texture, and, in that sense, he has a very good thing in Open Loose, a band with Tony Malaby on tenor saxophone and Tom Rainey on drums. The band has a new album, “The Signal Maker,” which should provide some of the material here. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Enrico Pieranunzi Quartet  (Tuesday through May 3) Enrico Pieranunzi is one of the leading jazz pianists in Italy, a careful rhapsodist with a more than casual appreciation of the Bill Evans style. He works often with American partners, and has a good crew for this engagement: the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Clarence Penn. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Mike Pride’s I Hate Work  (Wednesday) Mr. Pride is a drummer of strong build and forceful attack, qualities he honed partly in settings like MDC, the long-running, politically charged hardcore band. I Hate Work, appearing here on the Sound It Out series, is his attempt to translate that music into a piano-trio setting: a quixotic notion made less so by his choice of partners, the pianist Jamie Saft and the bassist Brad Jones. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)Ricky Rodriguez Group  (Thursday) A bassist with roots in his native Puerto Rico but a set of interests that stretches toward streamlined post-bop, Ricky Rodriguez features his own compositions in this engagement, with Ben Wendel on saxophones, Fabian Almazan on acoustic and Fender Rhodes pianos, and Henry Cole on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)‘John Scofield & Taj Mahal Celebrate Muddy Waters’  (Friday and Saturday) John Scofield and Taj Mahal are both guitarists with a strong foothold in the blues, though neither abides by any genre-driven rules of style. They meet for the first time on common ground, celebrating one of the greatest blues men and a mutual hero. At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-721-6500, jalc.org. (Chinen)★ Wadada Leo Smith: 44 Years: A Retrospective  (through Sunday) Mr. Smith, a blazingly creative trumpeter and composer, has approached his weeklong residency at the Stone with an intense seriousness of purpose. He’ll draw from music developed over his career, with highlights including a quintet with Bill Laswell on bass and Brandon Ross on guitar (Friday at 10 p.m.); his Golden Quartet, playing music from the acclaimed recent album “Ten Freedom Summers” (Saturday at 10 p.m.); and the Bell, a collaboration with the pianist Aruán Ortiz, the bassist William Parker and the percussionist Adam Rudolph (Sunday at 8 p.m.). A full schedule is at thestonenyc.com. At 8 and 10 p.m., with a 7 p.m. discussion on Sunday, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village. (Chinen)Manuel Valera Trio  (Wednesday) Manuel Valera has been one of a handful of Cuban pianists at the heart of the new Latin jazz, and on his dynamic new album, “Live at Firehouse 12,” he leads the same trio heard here, with Hans Glawischnig on bass and E. J. Strickland on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Greg Ward Quintet  (Sunday) A versatile young saxophonist with a full plate of sideman activity, Greg Ward fills his work with nods to electronic music, postrock and other modern enticements. His quintet, playing new music, will feature Ben Wendel on tenor saxophone, Glenn Zaleski on piano, Rashaan Carter on bass and Kenneth Salters on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Andrew White III  (Saturday) Few figures in jazz have as idiosyncratic a profile as Andrew White III: a saxophonist, erstwhile oboist and electric bassist, transcriber, archivist, author and entrepreneur. (His authority in all things John Coltrane is the stuff of legend.) A native of Washington, he’s making his first official appearance as a leader here in nearly 20 years, in the company of longtime associates: the pianist Wade Beach, the bassist Steve Novesel and the drummer Nasar Abadey. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Advertisement
