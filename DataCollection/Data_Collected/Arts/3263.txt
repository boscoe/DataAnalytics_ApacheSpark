Instead of 3-D glasses, the Tribeca Film Festival will add blindfolds to its movie accessory list. At least that’s the case with one interactive documentary project that is part of the innovation programming the festival announced Tuesday. The project is called “Door Into the Dark,” and uses audio and locative technology to take blindfolded participants through an immersive experience of feeling lost. The project is one of five in the festival’s Storyscapes program, which employs virtual reality and other means to tell cinematic stories in unusual ways.The project “The Enemy,” created by Karim Ben Khelifa, places viewers, through virtual reality, between Israeli and Palestinian combatants. “The Machine to Be Another” is a series of “embodied narratives” in which participants are given the experience of inhabiting the life and body of another person.The app project “Karen” involves a digital life coach who asks users questions and provides advice. And “Do Not Track,” from Brett Gaylor, is a personalized documentary about privacy online that gathers digital information on its viewers while they watch. These projects will all be presented in a new creative hub for the festival, the 10,000-square-foot space Spring Studios, which will hold regular events and screenings during the festival, which runs April 15-26.
