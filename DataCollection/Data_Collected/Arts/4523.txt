The rapturously received “Hamilton” on Monday was named the best musical of the New York theater season by the New York Drama Critics’ Circle. And “Between Riverside and Crazy,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a retired policeman facing eviction, was named the best play. Neither show was on Broadway, so their selections — the first of several awards to be bestowed by various theater groups this spring — have no predictive value for the Tony Awards, which are to be announced on June 7, and which recognize only Broadway shows. “Between Riverside and Crazy” was written by Stephen Adly Guirgis, and has run Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company and Second Stage Theater. “Hamilton,” written by, and starring, Lin-Manuel Miranda, has just concluded its Off Broadway run at the Public Theater. It is scheduled to transfer this summer to Broadway. The Drama Critics’ Circle is made up of 23 New York-area theater critics. The New York Times’s theater critics are not members of the organization.Last year, the critics named “Fun Home,” which made its premiere at the Public Theater, as the best musical; it is now running on Broadway and is one of four contenders for this year’s Tony for best musical.
