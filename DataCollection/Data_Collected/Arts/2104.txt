Stephen Colbert can pick up his keys to the Ed Sullivan Theater any time before Labor Day: he will begin hosting “Late Show,” CBS’s flagship late-night program, on Sept. 8, the network announced on Monday. Mr. Colbert, whose Comedy Central show, “The Colbert Report,” ended Dec. 18, is succeeding the longtime host David Letterman, who previously said he was retiring after more than three decades in late-night television. His last night at the “Late Show” desk will be May 20. Mr. Colbert, who brought a sharp, news-savvy wit to “The Colbert Report,” will keep the  “Late Show” at its customary home at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York, but is dropping his self-important “Stephen Colbert” pundit character. As for any other segments that Mr. Colbert might abandon, retain or invent, the network said in a statement that “specific creative elements and producers of the Colbert-hosted ‘Late Show’ will be announced at a later date.” Mr. Colbert said in a statement: “I have nine months to make a show, just like a baby. So first, I should find out how you make a baby.”
