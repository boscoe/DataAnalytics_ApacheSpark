Calixto Bieito, the daring Catalan theater and opera director, will make his Metropolitan Opera debut in the 2017-18 season with a new production of Verdi’s “La Forza del Destino” that is to be conducted by James Levine, company officials announced Wednesday.With the hiring of Mr. Bieito, whose iconoclastic opera productions have shocked some audiences, the Met is continuing its efforts to draw innovative international opera directors to New York. The roster includes Willy Decker, whose production of Verdi’s “La Traviata” has become a house staple; Dmitri Tcherniakov, who directed Borodin’s “Prince Igor” to acclaim last season; and Stefan Herheim, whose production of Wagner’s “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” from the Salzburg Festival is scheduled to come to the Met for the 2019-20 season.The news emerged by way of an operatic bank shot: English National Opera unveiled its coming opera season on Wednesday morning and announced that it would feature a new “Forza” by Mr. Bieito next season that is a co-production with the Met. So the Met announced some details of its plans to stage the opera the following season, with a cast that includes Sondra Radvanovsky, Aleksandrs Antonenko, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Ferruccio Furlanetto.Some of Mr. Bieito’s early productions gained notoriety in the opera world, including a sexually graphic 2004 production of Mozart’s “Abduction From the Seraglio” in Berlin, and a production of Verdi’s “Masked Ball” in Barcelona that set one scene in a grimy men’s room. Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said he expected that the new Bieito production of “Forza” would “stimulate audiences, not shock them.”“I think he’s one of the most brilliant directors around in terms of narrative storytelling and visual presentation,” Mr. Gelb said, adding that the work would be set in the Spanish Civil War period. The San Francisco Opera is planning to stage a production of Bizet’s “Carmen” by Mr. Bieito next season.
