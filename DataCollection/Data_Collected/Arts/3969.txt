Succeeding Malcolm Rogers, who served for 19 years, Matthew Teitelbaum will become the next director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the museum announced Thursday. Mr. Teitelbaum, currently the director and chief executive of the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, will take over when Mr. Rogers retires in August. “What in the end really hooked me was the extraordinary collections, the staff who take care of them and the opportunity to work with an institutional collection of world cultures — to be thinking about how a collection can animate a community,” Mr. Teitelbaum said in a telephone interview. “It was a rekindling of a lot of what brought me into the profession in the first place.”Mr. Teitelbaum — who becomes the 11th director in the museum’s 145-year history – has been the director of the Ontario art gallery since 1998, where he oversaw the institution’s $306 million expansion and renovation of its Beaux-Arts building by the architect Frank Gehry. The Toronto museum, while large, is not as big an institution as the Boston museum, whose attendance tops 1 million visitors a year. “We really see the mission as building on the legacy of Malcolm Rogers,” said Lisbeth Tarlow, the museum’s chairwoman. “We have to bring in other voices.”
