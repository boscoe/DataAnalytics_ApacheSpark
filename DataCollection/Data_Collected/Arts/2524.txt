“Twelfth Night, Or what you will” is the full name of the dark comedy by Shakespeare that is simply called “Twelfth Night” in most productions, like the hit revival on Broadway last season. And that four-word subtitle will be put to inventive use this spring by Bedlam, the critically acclaimed Off Broadway troupe that recently mounted innovative stagings of “Sense & Sensibility” and “The Seagull.”Bedlam announced Wednesday that it would present two versions of “Twelfth Night” in repertory. The original Shakespeare script will be used, and both plays will feature the same five actors in the many roles, but the versions will have different thematic emphases, aesthetics, and approaches by the performers to their characters.“The version we’re calling, ‘Twelfth Night or What You Will’ centers around the theme that love can be difficult and extremely hard, but in the end also very magical and rewarding,” wrote Eric Tucker, the artistic director of Bedlam, in an email. “Our other version, which we’re calling ‘What You Will, or Twelfth Night’ centers around the theme that love is absolutely maddening and doesn’t always turn out ok in the end but it’s a wild ride.”The eight-week run of the plays is to begin performances on March 11 at the Dorothy Strelsin Theater in Manhattan, on West 36th Street near Eighth Avenue.
