In the latest weekend box office, the singing ladies of “Pitch Perfect 2” clobbered a classic guy movie, “Mad Max: Fury Road.” That pattern has now repeated itself in music, as “Pitch Perfect 2” becomes the latest soundtrack to top the album chart, beating out Mumford & Sons and David Guetta.The “Pitch Perfect 2” soundtrack, released by Universal Music Enterprises and featuring songs by the Barden Bellas — that’s the fictional a cappella group in the film – along with guests like Snoop Dogg and Pentatonix, opened at No. 1 with 92,000 sales and 3.3 million streams, according to Nielsen. So far this year soundtracks to “Furious 7” and the Fox TV drama “Empire” have also gone to No. 1. By one measure, Disney’s “Frozen” was last year’s most popular album (Taylor Swift’s “1989” beat it by sales alone).Two other soundtracks placed high this week: “Fifty Shades of Grey” (Republic), a hit since February, rises three spots to No. 3, and “Furious 7” (Atlantic) is No. 5. Last week’s No. 1, Mumford & Sons’ “Wilder Mind” (Glassnote), falls to No. 2 in its second week out, and “Listen” (Parlophone), the latest by Mr. Guetta, the star French D.J., jumped 26 spots to No. 4 after the Google Play store put it on sale last week for 99 cents.Also this week, Wiz Khalifa’s song “See You Again,” from the “Furious 7” soundtrack, holds its place as the No. 1 single for a sixth straight week.A version of this article appears in print on 05/21/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Pitch Perfect 2’ Proves Perfect on Chart.
