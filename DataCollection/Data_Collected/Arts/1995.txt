A simple biography of the film critic Roger Ebert would have made for a full documentary, but the director Steve James set the bar much higher with “Life Itself.” The film, receiving its television premiere Sunday night on CNN, covers the life and career of Mr. Ebert, who died in 2013, but it also chronicles the final months of his battle with cancer, his philosophy of criticism, the influence he had on filmmakers and more.His disease cost him much of his jaw, and Mr. James is not reluctant to show his struggles, but the film is inspirational not just because of Mr. Ebert’s determination to stay active despite illness. It shows the tremendous reach one life can have. Mr. Ebert’s wife, Chaz, is a forthright guide to the film’s personal parts. The couple’s story — he was 50 when they wed — deepens the tale of his professional accomplishments. Geoffrey O’Brien, in a review in The New York Times, called it “a work of deftness and delicacy, by turns a film about illness and death, about writing, about cinema and, finally, and very movingly a film about love.”A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Television: ‘Life Itself,’ a Documentary.
