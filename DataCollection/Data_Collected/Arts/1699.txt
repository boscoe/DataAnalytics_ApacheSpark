The Prado museum has settled a long-simmering duel with a new royal museum in Madrid over the rights to its most famous paintings, including  “The Garden of Earthly Delights” by Hieronymus Bosch and the 15th-century depiction of the descent of Christ from the cross by Rogier van der Weyden.In an accord signed Wednesday at the Royal Palace in Madrid, the leaders of the Prado and the Patrimonio Nacional, the agency that administers all royal holdings from palaces to artworks, agreed that four major paintings would remain permanently on display at the Prado and that the two institutions would cooperate in the future.“Peace reigns,” José Pedro Pérez-Llorca, the president of the board of the Prado, said later in the day. “No it’s stronger than that. You can say it’s just like a love affair.” The dispute dates to 2014 when the new Museum of Royal Collections developed plans for its opening and laid claim to the paintings, including another by Bosch and a Tintoretto. The demands were pressed by José Rodríguez-Spiteri, a former diplomat and the president of the Patrimonio Nacional.The paintings, which are some of the top draws at the Prado, were moved almost 80 years ago from the royal San Lorenzo de El Escorial monastery and placed for safekeeping with the Prado by the government authorities during the Spanish Civil War.The heritage agency wanted them back for display at its new museum, which has not opened yet. Furious Prado officials successfully blocked the plan and Mr. Rodríguez-Spiteri resigned last summer. Mr.  Pérez-Llorca, the Prado’s president, said that the key to the resolution of the quarrel was the appointment of a new leader of the heritage agency, Alfredo Pérez de Armiñán. He added that the two institutions were already discussing new projects, perhaps cooperating to organize some traveling exhibitions of Spanish art abroad.
