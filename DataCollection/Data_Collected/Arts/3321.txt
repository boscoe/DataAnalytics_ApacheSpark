In The New York Times Book Review, Teddy Wayne reviews Daniel Torday’s first novel, “The Last Flight of Poxl West.” Mr. Wayne writes:The novel is impeccably researched, with, yes, precisely observed details as Poxl and his memoir hurtle from his hometown in Czechoslovakia, where his father runs a leather factory and his stifled mother roams outside their marriage; to Rotterdam, where he falls in love with Françoise, a Dutch prostitute/nightclub singer; and most lengthily to London, where he becomes engaged to a British nurse, Glynnis, and joins the war effort, first as a mobile canteen driver and rescuer in the Blitz, later as a pilot; and points beyond. Meanwhile, Hitler tightens his grip on Europe and characters close to Poxl die or are left behind. There doesn’t seem to be a germane subject for which the author hasn’t done his homework, from the leather trade to the cockpit controls of military aircraft to the kabbalah (Torday won the 2012 National Jewish Book Award for debut fiction for his novella, “The Sensualist”).And all of this is rendered in Torday’s unobtrusively lyrical prose, superb Rothian sentences that glide over the page as smoothly as a Spitfire across a cloudless sky.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Torday discusses his novel; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; Frank Bruni talks about Barney Frank’s new memoir; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Pamela Paul is the host.
