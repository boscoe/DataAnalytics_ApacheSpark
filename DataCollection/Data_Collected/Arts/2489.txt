CreditBenjamin Norman for The New York Times        Here’s an image I won’t forget: the saxophonist Lakecia Benjamin and her band Soulsquad blasting out the romantic anguish of Ornette Coleman’s “Lonely Woman” in front of Emanuel Leutze’s painting “Washington Crossing the Delaware.” You know that painting — a dozen men in a rowboat breaking through the ice floes, the general facing left in the breaking light.Not a reproduction but the painting itself, 21 feet wide, gilt-framed. This was in Gallery 760 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Friday evening during Jazz & Colors, an experiment in kaleidoscopic concert staging that has previously happened twice, in Central Park in 2012 and 2013.The Jazz & Colors idea is to set up many jazz bands in small places within a big place, playing the same set list of standards and near-standards. It’s a transitory aesthetic experience: You walk through a performance area, graze with eyes and ears, and move on. At its best, a visit can bring you into new relationships with a certain band, a certain song and a certain public space. Its impresario, Peter Shapiro, brought the event indoors this year for Jazz & Colors: The Masterworks Edition, booking 15 bands and placing them around the Met’s first and second floors, for two hourlong sets with a 30-minute intermission. (It is scheduled to happen again at the Met on April 24.)There was no explicit educational mission here, as sometimes happens when music is played in museums. It wasn’t generally clear why certain bands were put in certain spaces, other than perhaps for sonic reasons: the great vertical space in the Lehman Court to accommodate Amir ElSaffar’s trumpet sound, the wide and busy Medieval Sculpture Hall for the slow, atmospheric spread of vibraphone and guitar tones in the quartet the Cellar and Point. The common set list varied, too, in style and disposition — meditative blues by Miles Davis and Alice Coltrane (“All Blues” and “Blue Nile”), Lee Morgan’s boogaloo “Sidewinder,” the swing standards “Stompin’ at the Savoy” and “Take the A Train.” Given the assignment, a band could go to unexpected places. (I hadn’t heard Mr. ElSaffar play standards before; I was impressed by Linda Oh’s total rearrangement of “A Train.”)AdvertisementBut sometimes the music really aligned with the art, and what Ms. Benjamin was doing with “Lonely Woman” complemented Leutze’s picture so well it felt as if the room would explode: a team working in loose and heroic unison, the underlying drone chords like the river, the crashing cymbals like the boat breaking through the ice.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I heard parts of it without a rhythm section, as played by Ethel, the string quartet, on the Great Hall balcony; as played by the harpist Brandee Younger’s quartet in a large room of Chinese Buddhist art; and by the bassist Ben Williams, putting the low end out front with his quintet, in the Astor Court. The best way to receive this happening was to relax and float through it. It wasn’t really about pleasant overload, seeing a lot of art or even hearing a lot of bands. (How long does it take you to get the measure of a band? If your answer is 20 minutes, you could have had four of those experiences on Friday, maximum.) It was a good reason to walk around the Met. I tried to see everything. I don’t recommend that.A park surrounds you with sky and leaves and grass; in Central Park, your mind could latch on more to the music. (Also, the time span there was twice as long: four hours.) The Met’s atmosphere surrounds the event with much more specific cultural meaning. The brain seeks affinities between sound and visuals. Even in one room of the Met, that’s a lot. In 15 rooms, that’s more than a lot. I wondered what Marvin Sewell’s group was thinking as it played “Body and Soul,” slowly and beautifully, in the big Arms and Armor Court, around all the helmets and chain mail — the armor of the heart? I had a pretty good moment watching the keyboardist Matt Mitchell and the drummer Ches Smith — with one snare drum and one small cymbal — playing Max Roach’s “Freedom Day” in front of David Hockney’s collapsed-perspective painting “Large Interior, Los Angeles.” Collapsed perspective: That’s what Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Smith do.AdvertisementThere was a feeling, at closing time, of not having gotten even a fraction of what there was to get. If you’re lucky to have Jazz & Colors happening in your vicinity, go, when it returns in April. But set your limits.A version of this review appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Exalting Tunes on a Big Canvas.
