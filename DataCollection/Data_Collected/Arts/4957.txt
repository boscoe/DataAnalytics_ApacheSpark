In The New York Times Book Review, Alan Riding reviews two new books about Shakespeare’s women characters and personal life: Tina Packer’s “Women of Will: Following the Feminine in Shakespeare’s Plays” and Chris Laoutaris’s “Shakespeare and the Countess: The Battle That Gave Birth to the Globe.” Mr. Riding writes:One of the appeals of Packer’s writing is that she has no time for the academic standbys of “surely he would have,”  “might have” or “could have.” She bangs out her opinions — and on the identity of the Dark Lady, she doesn’t hesitate. It is Aemilia Bassano, a former mistress of the lord chamberlain (whose theater company Shakespeare later joined), “a musician, poet, and one of the first women to declare herself a feminist.” It was thanks to his love for Bassano, Packer argues, that, in his narrative poem “Venus and Adonis,” “for the first time, Shakespeare allowed his imagination to explore feminine desire.” And thanks to “his own experience of erotic love,” the young author of Kate’s humbling submission to the miso­gynistic Petruchio in “The Taming of the Shrew” felt free to show men and women as equals in “Romeo and Juliet” and later, still more dramatically, in “Antony and Cleopatra.”On this week’s podcast, Mr. Riding discusses those two books; Parul Sehgal and John Williams have news from the literary world; Michelle Orange talks about five new essay collections; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Pamela Paul is the host.
