The Roundabout Theater Company will bring two playwrights with current New York hits on board for its 2016-17 season. Stephen Karam, whose Thanksgiving-centered “The Humans” is now Off Broadway at the Laura Pels Theater, will have his adaptation of Chekhov’s “The Cherry Orchard” staged in September on Broadway at the American Airlines Theater. Starting the same month, Mike Bartlett, who wrote “King Charles III,” now on Broadway, will bring “Love, Love, Love” to the Laura Pels for its New York premiere.Mr. Karam has an extensive working relationship with the Roundabout: his two commissioned plays there, “The Humans” and “Sons of the Prophet,” were  critically acclaimed. He will now tackle Chekhov’s last play, from 1904, which follows a struggling Russian aristocrat returning to her family estate. Simon Godwin will direct. Next year looks to be a Chekhov-centric one for Mr. Karam, as his film adaptation of “The Seagull,” starring Annette Bening and Elisabeth Moss, is also slated for release. “King Charles III,” which Ben Brantley called “flat-out brilliant” in The New York Times, runs on Broadway through January. Mr. Bartlett’s earlier “Love, Love, Love” debuted on tour in Britain in 2010 and had a run in London in 2012. It follows a baby boomer relationship over 40 years. Michael Mayer will direct in his sixth Roundabout production. Roundabout is celebrating its 50th season. More information can be found at roundabouttheatre.org.
