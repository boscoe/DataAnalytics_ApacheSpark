There was the book, then the movie, then the television show, and now … the musical? An unauthorized stage adaptation of “Friday Night Lights” is in the works, according to Variety. The Los Angeles project, slated for 2016, will star Scott Porter, who played Jason Street in the television show, and be produced by Lindsey Rosin and Jordan Ross, producers behind musical spoofs of “Cruel Intentions” and “The O.C.”“Friday Night Lights” depicts high school football culture in a small Texas town, and has been critically acclaimed in each of its iterations.  (“Lord, is ‘Friday Night Lights’ good,” goes the first sentence of Virginia Heffernan’s review of the television show in The New York Times.) Mr. Porter is no stranger to musicals: he starred in the 2005 Off Broadway musical “Altar Boyz,” and sang in “Bandslam” (2009) and “Music and Lyrics” (2007). And while he was the injured quarterback in a wheelchair in the television series, in this production, he’ll be Coach Eric Taylor.A theater and date have yet to be determined. According to Variety, Ms. Rosin said that the initial run would be for one night or one weekend.
