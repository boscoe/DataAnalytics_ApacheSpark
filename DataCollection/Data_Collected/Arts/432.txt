Right from the top on Saturday afternoon, Katie Monks was gleefully sloppy. After her band, Dilly Dally, completed the first of several thick, rowdy, shambolic (but not quite) songs, she told the guy manning the soundboard at the Brooklyn venue Baby’s All Right, “I’m going to take a whole lot more of everything in my monitor.”The thrill of this Toronto band, which mainlines the pugnacity of late ’80s and early ’90s alternative rock, is its internal tug-of-war. Ms. Monks — indebted to Kim Deal but also any number of throaty metal singers — is a swaggering, jubilantly gritty vocalist, forever seeming as if she might slip off the rails. But her band — which also includes the guitarist Liz Ball, the bassist Jimmy Tony and the drummer Ben Reinhartz — never lets her.At this showcase organized by the website Brooklyn Vegan (the third of the band’s four CMJ bookings), Ms. Monks was even more slippery than on the band’s outstanding just-released debut album, “Sore” (Partisan). But time and again, the lava-thick backdrop, especially Mr. Tony’s sturdy bass playing, kept her upright.Dilly Dally songs tackle and play with expectations around female sexuality, be it the menstruation narrative on “Snake Head” or the playfully rendered sexual fantasy on “Gender Role” and “Desire.”For all its intensity, though, the band remains appealingly wry, almost funny. As Ms. Monks drags her words out past comprehensibility and teeters all over the stage, she’s electric and jester-sharp. And when she applied that approach to a roaring cover of “Know Yourself” by her fellow Torontonian Drake, she brought a winking new pathos to the act of “running through the 6 with my woes.”A version of this article appears in print on October 19, 2015, on Page C2 of the New York edition with the headline: Rocking Out Without Keeling Over.
