A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.★ The Afro Latin Jazz Alliance Presents an Evening with Lionel Loueke  (Friday and Saturday) The Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, led by the pianist Arturo O’Farrill, has always worked smartly with featured guests, and this pair of concerts — a showcase for the West African guitarist and singer Lionel Loueke, playing large-ensemble arrangements of his compositions — should be no exception. (Friday’s concert will be preceded, at 7 p.m., by the music historian Ned Sublette moderating a discussion — probably touching on Cuba, where the band just recorded an album.) At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Nate Chinen)Howard Alden-Warren Vaché Duo  (Thursday) Mr. Alden, a nimble guitarist, has made a subspecialty out of duo interplay, as has Mr. Vaché, an assertive cornetist. Both musicians are trustworthy stewards of swing, and their history together runs deep. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com. (Chinen)★ Tim Berne’s Snakeoil/Russ Lossing Quartet (Tuesday) Mr. Berne, an alto saxophonist and composer of granite conviction, has had a superb recent outlet in Snakeoil, a chamber-improv quartet with the clarinetist Oscar Noriega, the pianist Matt Mitchell and the drummer Ches Smith. The group plays a 10:30 p.m. set in the Konceptions series; an earlier set, at 9 p.m., will feature a quartet led by the perceptive pianist Russ Lossing, with Adam Kolker on saxophone, Masa Kamaguchi on bass and Billy Mintz on drums. Korzo, 667 Fifth Avenue, at 20th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, konceptionsmusicseries.wordpress.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementJustin Brown’s NYEUSI  (Saturday) A drummer as well versed in state-of-the-art gospel as he is in modern jazz, Justin Brown has been making his mark as a sideman with peers like the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire and the pianist Gerald Clayton. His band NYEUSI has Fabian Almazan and Jason Lindner on keyboards, and Burniss Travis on bass. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementOtis Brown III: ‘The Thought of You’  (Wednesday and Thursday) A fierce and flowing agent of rhythm, the drummer Otis Brown III jammed a lot of ideas into his recent debut album, “The Thought of You.” Among them is the sinuous flexibility of his band, which in this two-nighter will feature Jean Baylor on vocals, Keyon Harrold on trumpet, John Ellis on saxophones, Raymond Angry on piano and Alan Hampton on bass. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Bill Charlap Trio  (Friday through Sunday) The pianist Bill Charlap has become a trusted docent of the American songbook through his decade-long programming role at the 92nd Street Y. But his interaction with jazz standards finds no clearer or more illuminating results than in this spruce trio, with Peter Washington on bass and Kenny Washington (no relation) on drums. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Ravi Coltrane Quintet  (Tuesday through Feb. 8) A tenor and soprano saxophonist with a dry tone and a sleek but undemonstrative style, Ravi Coltrane has lately cycled through a few iterations of his band; this one might just be too good to keep together on a regular basis. Along with one of his closest musical partners, the trumpeter Ralph Alessi, it includes Aaron Parks on piano, and a rhythm team with a lot of mileage in the rearview mirror: Bob Hurst on bass and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an 11:45 p.m. set next Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Mike DiRubbo Quartet (Saturday) The energetic and bop-literate alto saxophonist Mike DiRubbo has a recent album, “Threshold,” that features the same rhythm team found here: Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Rudy Royston on drums. Rounding out the group on piano is Anthony Wonsey. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Wayne Escoffery Quartet  (Tuesday through Feb. 8) Wayne Escoffery, a tenor saxophonist with an engaging and assertive style, brings an appealingly bullish rhythm section with him to this weeklong Village Vanguard engagement: David Kikoski on piano, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Ralph Peterson on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Jon Irabagon Trio  (Saturday) Jon Irabagon, a saxophonist of frisky temperament and formidable technique, has long been heard to strong effect in a trio format; his partners in this one are the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Rudy Royston. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com. (Chinen)★ Jazz & Colors: The Masterworks Edition  (Friday) This festival, which has twice presented a bounty of jazz ensembles at picturesque locations all over Central Park, is moving indoors this year, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among the 15 groups performing simultaneously, at locations throughout the museum’s galleries, are the Don Byron Quartet; the Amir ElSaffar Quintet; the Matt Mitchell-Ches Smith Duo; Ben Williams and Sound Effect; and Jenny Scheinman’s In the Museum, a special-edition quartet featuring the guitarist Marc Ribot. Each group will tackle the same set list, with jazz standards including Lee Morgan’s “The Sidewinder” and Cole Porter’s “Night and Day.” At 6 and 7:30 p.m., 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org; free with museum admission.

As such, he appears here on the Monk in Motion series, with his own band, which may soon be heard more regularly in these parts; it features Christopher McBride on alto saxophone, Justin Thomas on vibraphone, Joshua Ramos on bass and Makaya McCraven on drums. At 7:30 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, near Greenwich Street, 212-220-1460, tribecapac.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementMike Moreno Quartet  (Thursday) A guitarist-composer drawn to mystery and euphony, Mike Moreno leads a band with several like-minded souls: the pianist Jon Cowherd, the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Clarence Penn. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Tivon Pennicott Sound Quartet  (Saturday) A self-assured tenor saxophonist originally from Georgia, Mr. Pennicott recently released his debut album, “Lover of Nature,” made with the Sound Quartet, which rejoins him here.

(Chinen)★ Chris Potter Underground Orchestra  (Friday and Saturday) “Imaginary Cities,” just out on ECM, is the vaulting new album by the saxophonist Chris Potter, featuring a beefed-up version of Underground, his flagship band. The additions include Scott Colley on acoustic bass, Steve Nelson on marimba and vibraphone, and a string quartet made up of seasoned improvisers like the violinist Mark Feldman — all of whom rejoin him for this engagement. At 7:30, 10 and 11:45 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Matana Roberts ‘Coin Coin’ (Tuesday) Ms. Roberts, an alto saxophonist and composer, has devoted herself to a corpus of work she calls “Coin Coin,” sifting through layers of folklore, family history and reconstructed memory in search of one or another form of revelation. She performs her third installment — “river run thee,” due out as an album on Tuesday — in this show, which also includes sets by Rain Machine, the solo electronic project of Kyp Malone, and the collaborative noise trio of Ryan Sawyer, Nate Wooley and C. Spencer Yeh. At 9 p.m., Union Pool, 484 Union Avenue, at Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-609-0484, union-pool.com. (Chinen)Scott Robinson Quartet  (Friday) Scott Robinson is a saxophonist and flutist with esoteric interests but a mainstream profile, thanks to his longtime role in the Maria Schneider Orchestra. He has put together a first-rate rhythm section for this one-nighter, with Helen Sung on piano, Martin Wind on bass and Tim Horner on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Pharoah Sanders (through Sunday) The tenor saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, one of the most significant survivors of 1960s free jazz, has never stopped imbuing his performances with the tone of a spiritual quest. He leads a quartet with William Henderson on piano, Nat Reeves on bass and Joe Farnsworth on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Christian Scott  (through Sunday) The declarative mode comes easily to Mr. Scott, a fiendishly gifted young trumpeter born and raised in New Orleans. His current band, appearing this week with a new book of music, includes Braxton Cook on alto saxophone, Elena Pinderhughes on flute, Warren Wolf on vibraphone, Lawrence Fields on piano, Kris Funn on bass and Corey Fonville and Joe Dyson on drums. (Mr. Scott’s wife, Isadora Mendez-Scott, will join as a guest vocalist.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Colin Stranahan’s Pacemaker  (Friday) An alert and sensitive drummer, Mr. Stranahan has been making strides as a bandleader and composer — notably with Pacemaker, featuring André Matos on guitar, Pete Rende on piano, Joe Martin on bass and Mark Turner on saxophone. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Sun Ra Arkestra  (Saturday) Led by the irrepressible alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, who is 90, this repertory outfit carries on the cosmic avant-gardism of its namesake with all necessary gusto. The band plays two sets beginning at 7 p.m. at Sugarcube, the pop-up space at South Street Seaport, courtesy of the Brooklyn avant-garde label Northern Spy. At 7 p.m., Sugarcube at South Street Seaport, Fulton and Front Streets, Lower Manhattan, 212-732-7678, sugarcube.nyc; free, but online registration is required. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Vanguard Jazz Orchestra  (through Monday) Typically this big band holds court only on Monday nights, but this week it has been celebrating its 49th anniversary, drawing from a repertory fortified by some of the smartest composer-arrangers ever to ply the form. (Case in point: Its current album, “OverTime: The Music of Bob Brookmeyer,” which is nominated for a Grammy Award.) The long run is welcome, because it presents the musicians with a chance to really settle in — and also for the simple reason that hearing this band, in this room, is one of the irreducible New York pleasures. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com.
