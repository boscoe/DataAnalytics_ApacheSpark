Long before the movies learned to talk, people began gathering in classrooms to talk about movies. This weekend the Columbia University Film Festival will mark the 100th anniversary of what appears to have been the first academic film-studies class — a Columbia adult-extension course called Photoplay Composition, offered beginning in 1915 in East Hall (now Maison Française), and including classroom study of dramatic structure and visits to local motion picture companies. The magazine Writer’s Monthly noted approvingly, “In offering this new course Columbia University shows that recognition is being given to one of the most popular literary forms in the history of authorship.” Film studies has been a growth field in the century since — Columbia now has about 25 full-time faculty members in that discipline, not to mention its film festival, now in its 28th year, which will run from Friday through Thursday at various Upper West Side locations. But the changes digital technologies have wrought in how we discover, watch and think about movies have raised questions about the futures of film scholarship and serious criticism. Those questions will be addressed at 3 p.m. Saturday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center in a panel discussion, “One Hundred Years: Film Studies in the Past, Present and Future,” featuring the writers Peter Biskind and Molly Haskell and the filmmaker and critic Paul Schrader. “Over the course of the 100 years since that first film course was taught at Columbia, we have seen the death of cinema predicted many times and yet it survives,” said Ira Deutchman, chairman of the Columbia film program. “Film scholarship has played an important part in that survival and thus is perhaps more vital than ever.”Panel-goers who want to honor the 100th anniversary of Photoplay Composition can bring their unpublished screenplays as paper manuscripts, preferably in big envelopes that tie with strings.A version of this article appears in print on 04/29/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Columbia to Celebrate Film-Studies Anniversary.
