(Nate Chinen)★ The Bad Plus (Tuesday through Jan. 3) An acoustic piano trio with a collectivist heart, the Bad Plus holds fast to the idea of a group identity, essential and inviolable. This year the band released an excellent album with a respectful interloper, the saxophonist Joshua Redman, but for this annual booking, which includes a New Year’s Eve gig, the lineup will strictly feature core members: the pianist Ethan Iverson, the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer Dave King. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; at 9 p.m. only on Thursday, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Kenny Barron Quartet (through Sunday) Mr. Barron is the leading practitioner of an elegant, economical and sure-footed piano style that thrives in any mainstream setting. For this engagement, he has his trustworthy rhythm team — the bassist Kiyoshi Kitagawa and the drummer Johnathan Blake — along with the impressive young flutist Elena Pinderhughes and the deftly intuitive vibraphonist Steve Nelson. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Chris Botti (through Jan. 10) Mr. Botti, whose adult-pop savvy and controlled but brooding trumpet sound have made him a global superstar, descends on the Blue Note every year around this time for an extended stay. This year, his 11th, the engagement began in mid-December and will stretch into the new year, with the usual array of unannounced guests and some special flair on New Year’s Eve. At 8 and 10:30 p.m.; at 7 and 10 p.m. on Thursday, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Freddy Cole Quartet with Harry Allen (through Saturday) A charismatic and urbane vocalist, Mr. Cole treats the standard songbook with easygoing grace. He also plays piano in his quartet, with the guitarist Randy Napoleon, the bassist Elias Bailey and the drummer Curtis Boyd. Their featured guest is Mr. Allen, a tenor saxophonist of mellifluous charm. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Paquito D’Rivera: Pan-American Fiesta (Thursday) Pan-Americanism is more than a casual notion for Paquito D’Rivera, the masterly Cuban clarinetist, alto saxophonist and composer-bandleader. He just won best Latin jazz album at the Latin Grammy Awards for a playfully revisionary repertory effort, “Jazz Meets the Classics,” which features most of his whip-smart younger partners here. At 7:30 and 11 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)Duchess (Tuesday and Wednesday) This jazz vocal trio — a knowing update of the Boswell Sisters sound, featuring Amy Cervini, Hilary Gardner and Melissa Stylianou — draws from its self-titled debut, with help from, among others, the saxophonist and clarinetist Jeff Lederer. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Sheila Jordan and Cameron Brown (Thursday) Ms. Jordan is an accomplished and exploratory jazz singer — a few years ago, at 83, she was anointed a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts — whose approach to jazz skews nearly kaleidoscopic. In a cozy booking by New Year’s Eve standards, she engages with a longtime partner, the bassist Cameron Brown, who just celebrated his 70th birthday in this room. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Mingus Big Band (Thursday) This well-stocked repertory band, which plays the ruggedly inventive music of Charles Mingus, has held a Monday-night residency here for years. The last time it set up shop in the club on New Year’s Eve, the resulting album, “Live at Jazz Standard,” won a Grammy Award. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)Nilson Matta’s Samba Meets Jazz (Thursday) Mr. Matta, a bassist best known for his work with Trio da Paz, presides over a flexible ensemble dedicated to the music of his native Brazil. His partners are the vocalist Fabiana Masili, the saxophonist and flutist Don Braden, the pianist Vitor Gonçalves and the drummer Vince Cherico. At 9 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Houston Person Quartet (Saturday and Sunday) The latest dip into the standard songbook for the tenor saxophonist Houston Person is “Something Personal,” which like this engagement features a rhythm section spearheaded by his trusted pianist, John di Martino. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Chris Potter Trio (Saturday through Tuesday) Thinking big has rarely been an obstacle for Chris Potter, a saxophonist of inquisitive temperament and superhuman technique. “Imaginary Cities,” the rather slept-on album he released early this year, featured his compositions for an 11-piece orchestra — but it would be a mistake to assume he’ll work with less vaulting ambitions during this trio run, starting out with the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Adam Cruz (Saturday and Sunday) and finishing up with the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Johnathan Blake (Monday and Tuesday). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)Tom Rainey Trio (Wednesday) Tom Rainey, a precisely off-kilter drummer, has broken into bandleading of late, often with the partners in this trio: Ingrid Laubrock, a tenor and soprano saxophonist of exploratory instincts, and Mary Halvorson, a guitarist with a sharp-splintered but flexible attack. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Colin Stranahan Trio (Thursday) An alert and sensitive drummer, Colin Stranahan has worked for a number of years in a sleek collective trio with the pianist Glenn Zaleski and the bassist Rick Rosato. The group reconvenes under Mr. Stranahan’s designated leadership, for an intimate pair of New Year’s Eve sets. At 8:15 and 11 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com. (Chinen)★ John Zorn Improv Night (Tuesday through Jan. 3) Anything goes, musically speaking, at a John Zorn improv party, which can feature any number of intrepid and open-minded musicians. This weeklong edition — as always, a benefit for Mr. Zorn’s nonprofit performance space, the Stone — will feature inspired collaborators like the cellist Okkyung Lee, the pianist Craig Taborn and the trombonist George Lewis. (Check the schedule for details.) At 8 p.m., Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com. (Nate Chinen)Advertisement
