In The New York Times Book Review, Eric Schlosser reviews “One of Us,” the Norwegian journalist Asne Seierstad’s account of the life and crimes of Anders Behring Breivik, a mass murderer who killed 77 people, most of them teenagers. Mr. Schlosser writes:“One of Us” has the feel of a nonfiction novel. Like Norman Mailer’s “The Executioner’s Song” and Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood,” it has an omniscient narrator who tells the story of brutal murders and, by implication, sheds light on the society partly responsible for them. Although those two books are beautifully written, I found “One of Us” to be more powerful and compelling. For Capote and Mailer, the murderer loomed as an antihero, a tragic figure defying the conventions and expectations of mainstream America. Capote became infatuated with one of the killers in his book, while Mailer had remarkably little interest in the people whom Gary Gilmore robbed and killed for a few hundred dollars. As Seierstad weaves the stories of Utoya’s campers with her central narrative about Breivik — revealing the mundane details of their family lives, their youthful ambitions, idealism and naïveté — the book attains an almost unbearable weight. This tragedy isn’t literary and symbolic; it’s the real thing.On this week’s podcast, Mr. Schlosser discusses “One of Us”; Alexandra Alter has news from the literary world; Meghan O’Rourke talks about Elizabeth Alexander’s “The Light of the World”; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news.
