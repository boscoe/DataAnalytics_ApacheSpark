Dormeshia Sumbry-Edwards, Derick K. Grant and Jason Samuels Smith will explore the legacy of tap dance. Wendy Whelan will team up again with Brian Brooks for an evening of new solos and duets to music played by Brooklyn Rider. And troupes from around the world — including the Bereishit Dance Company of South Korea, Che Malambo of Argentina and Compagnie Hervé Koubi of France — will come to the Berkshires to dance. These are among the highlights of the 84th annual Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, which will run from June 18 through Aug. 28 in Becket, Mass. The festival, which said it enjoyed record-breaking attendance last summer, is in a time of transition: early next year its board of directors plans to name a successor to Ella Baff, who recently stepped down as executive and artistic director after 17 years. A wide variety of troupes and styles will be represented in the 2016 festival, including BalletX; Flexn, which was created by Reggie Gray, the Flex pioneer known as Regg Roc, and the director Peter Sellars; Juan Siddi Flamenco Santa Fe; Pam Tanowitz Dance; and Pacific Northwest Ballet.
