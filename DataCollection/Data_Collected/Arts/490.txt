Sometimes, all the elements that go into making an astonishing musical performance come together. That happened on Wednesday night at Carnegie Hall, when Andris Nelsons conducted the inspired players of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and a terrific cast in a blazing and brilliant  concert performance of Strauss’s “Elektra.” This was the second of three Carnegie programs, which began on Tuesday with music of Sebastian Currier, Beethoven and Brahms, and ends on Thursday with works by Prokofiev and Rachmaninoff. This Boston Symphony series in New York should reveal much about how Mr. Nelsons, in his second season as music director, is faring overall. I’ll have more to say, including about “Elektra,” in a review to be posted on Friday.  Still, I can’t put off reporting that on Wednesday news was made in the classical music world with this stunning “Elektra.” The American soprano Christine Goerke, who over two decades has grown from an exceptional singer best suited to Mozart and Gluck roles into one of the most formidable dramatic sopranos before the public today, gave a vocally fearless, dramatically chilling and psychologically raw account of the daunting title role. She sent Elektra’s outbursts – sometimes defiant, sometimes demented – soaring over the orchestra even during moments of searing orchestral power. Ms. Goerke now owns this role. I have to go back to early teenage memories of a frenzied ovation for Renata Tebaldi’s Desdemona in Verdi’s “Otello” at the Metropolitan Opera to recall an ovation as ecstatic as the one Ms. Goerke received on this night from the Carnegie Hall audience. Again, a full report is coming up.
