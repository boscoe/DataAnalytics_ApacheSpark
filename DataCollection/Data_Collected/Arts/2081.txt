Credit2014 Estate of Horace Poolaw        A 2001 exhibition called “Spirit Capture: Native Americans and the Photographic Image,” at the National Museum of the American Indian in Lower Manhattan, remains one of the most moving photography shows I’ve seen in New York in two decades. Culled from the museum’s permanent collection, it wasn’t about formal perfection or a singular sensibility. It was an archival look at a group of people as they were historically portrayed through a visual medium they didn’t invent and, until recently, rarely used. Indeed, it was a show about how that medium invented and used them, or rather stereotyped images of them — the recalcitrant savage, the timeless primitive, the vanishing race — to create an official American saga from a victor’s point of view.Many of the pictures dated back almost a century and were taken by non-Indian ethnologists, missionaries and surveyors. A few, though, were by a Kiowa photographer named Horace Poolaw (1906-1984), and what a difference there was. No more savage, no more timeless, no more vanishing. Instead, we saw Native American life from the inside, people inventively fusing a complex cultural past with equally complex modern present. The perspective, so refreshing to find years ago, is now expanded and deepened in the museum’s current show “For a Love of His People: The Photography of Horace Poolaw.” It’s an instant candidate for the long-term memory bank.Mr. Poolaw was born in a close-knit Kiowa community in rural Oklahoma on the cusp of major changes in both Native and American life. Terrible things had happened. The Wounded Knee massacre was in the recent past when Mr. Poolaw was young. Chiricahua Apaches were still held as prisoners of war at Fort Sill in Oklahoma. The United States government had sliced up reservations in an effort to break down tribal cohesiveness and force Indians to assimilate into mainstream American society, which had stresses of its own with a changing economy, waves of immigration and European war not far in the future.Assimilation was happening, though not necessarily as the government planned. It was taking place on Native American schedules and terms. Mr. Poolaw’s father was a United States Army scout at Fort Sill, but he also assumed the roles of medicine man and tribal historian for the Kiowa. The merging of worlds, at a grass-roots level, became the coincidental subject of Mr. Poolaw’s photographs.AdvertisementIt’s evident in his many portraits. In one from around 1944, Mr. Poolaw’s son Jerry, on furlough from the Navy, poses, a tepee behind him, in an enlisted man’s “crackerjack” uniform and an eagle-feather warrior headdress. From the 1930s comes a picture of two Kiowa women, Sindy and Hannah Keahbone, mother and daughter, wearing traditional buckskin gowns but very different hairstyles: The mother’s hair is long and braided, the daughter’s cut in a Clara Bow bob. And while, in a third photograph, a young man standing outdoors in ceremonial regalia might be from any era, a two-toned sedan parked in the distance puts him firmly in the 1950s.Family, which extended to a multitribal kinship network, was always Mr. Poolaw’s primary subject, and he was rarely far away from it. An exception was during World War II, when he was in the Army studying and teaching aerial photography. After his stint, he started a farm near the small city of Anadarko, where he documented the ceremonial side of daily life, including weddings and funerals.One section of the show is given over almost entirely to pictures taken during the years of war in Europe, Korea and Vietnam. In its images of Native American soldiers going off to or returning from military service, we see generations pass. In a 1950s shot, Pascal Cleatus Poolaw Sr., one of this country’s most decorated American Indian soldiers and Horace Poolaw’s nephew, stands in an Army uniform beside his young son, who’s dressed up as a warrior for an Indian fair. In 1965, we see the son, now an adult and in the Army, being given a tribal send-off as he leaves for Vietnam, where his father will fight and die. And we spot him again two years later, back home at his father’s funeral.AdvertisementSuch images of small-town patriotism and loss could have been from almost anywhere in America at the time. But these particular photographs were of people who, less than a century earlier, had been targets of warfare on American turf. As politically neutral as Mr. Poolaw seems to be, he is in touch with this history of alienation, and that comes out in his pictures of Indian fairs in Oklahoma and elsewhere.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The fairs were valuable. They fortified tribal identity and attracted tourist dollars. And Mr. Poolaw, in his pictures, seems to take an insider’s delight in their pageantry.Yet he also positions himself just far enough on the outside to catch everything that’s really going on. In a 1950s picture of children in war bonnets dancing at the Anadarko expo, he pulls way back, to take in the dancers and their grandstand audience as well as a crowd of non-Indian photographers bunched on the edge of the performing space to capture the version of Native American life that is being staged for them.Critical commentary, pointed or casual, is built into Mr. Poolaw’s view of modern Indian culture, though over all his approach is closer to appreciation, full-hearted without nostalgia. His image of a line of pallbearers straining to carry a coffin at a Kiowa funeral has the solemn grace of an ancient Greek frieze. And an early picture, from around 1928, of his younger sister Trecil Poolaw Unap carrying a little pet dog is as tender and loving an American portrait as I ever hope to see.Mr. Poolaw’s photography itself inspires love. Since the late 1980s, his daughter, Linda Poolaw (Kiowa/Delaware), who appears in several pictures and still lives near Anadarko, has researched, documented and promoted his work. And since 2008, the exhibition’s organizers — Nancy Marie Mithlo (Chiricahua Apache), chairwoman of American Indian studies at the Autry National Center, and Tom Jones (Ho-Chunk), a professor of photography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison — have painstakingly restored Mr. Poolaw’s fragile black-and-white negatives and made prints. That was something he rarely did because of the expense, except to make postcards for sale, stamped with the words: “A Poolaw Photo; Pictures by an Indian.”He was among the first Native Americans to be able to make that professional claim. For this reason alone, his work is innovative. And it is a reminder that innovation — an impulse for change, an appetite for newness — is itself a tradition in Native American culture, one that permitted Mr. Poolaw to spend his life in one place and make art that always feels fresh and in motion.It’s been said that America itself will never be at rest, socially or spiritually, until it has fully acknowledged and begun to repair the damage done to its first people, including damage inflicted through image-making. But Mr. Poolaw’s work, and the work of the artists who have succeeded him, clearly show that Native Americans are not waiting around for that. They’re shaping their own restorative images of both Native and American, doing for America what America cannot, or will not, do for itself.“For a Love of His People: The Photography of Horace Poolaw” continues through Feb. 15 at the National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan; 212-514-3700, nmai.si.edu.
