LONDON — The graffiti artist Banksy unveiled his latest artworks on Friday — immigration-themed murals that he  painted onto public spaces in and around the “jungle,” a refugee camp near Calais, France.The main image in the new series, posted on Banksy’s home page, is a portrait of the Apple co-founder and former chief executive Steve Jobs, whose father immigrated to the United States from Syria.In a statement provided by a spokeswoman Banksy said: “We’re often led to believe migration is a drain on the country’s resources, but Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant. Apple is the world’s most profitable company, it pays over $7 billion a year in taxes — and it only exists because they allowed in a young man from Homs.”The artist created four artworks in and around Calais. He scrawled the words “Maybe this whole situation will just sort itself out” on a wall in the “jungle.” In the city of Calais he created a parody version of Théodore Géricault’s painting “The Raft of the Medusa.” Banksy’s version shows immigrants crowded onto a raft, reaching out to a passing cruise ship. At a nearby beach he painted an image of a child holding a telescope with a vulture perched on top of it.In September, Banksy announced that he would send materials from his parody pop-up theme park Dismaland to the camp, which is home to several thousand migrants and refugees. The lumber from the park is being used to build shelters there.
