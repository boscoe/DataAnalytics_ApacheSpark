There’s no shortage of books about David Lynch, from studies of his films like “David Lynch Decoded” and an oral history of “Twin Peaks” (his twisted, trippy television show) to “Catching the Big Fish,” a book Mr. Lynch wrote about transcendental meditation.But Mr. Lynch apparently feels his story hasn’t been fully told. So he’s publishing a book with Grand Central Publishing called “Life & Work” that will be part memoir, part biography.“I want to get all the right information in one place,” Mr. Lynch said in a statement released through his publisher, “so if someone wants to know something, they can find it here.”The hybrid memoir-biography will be written by Mr. Lynch and Kristine McKenna, a journalist who has written about his work since the late 1970s. Mr. Lynch’s sections will describe his friendships, his artistic development and his creative struggles. The biographical sections by Ms. McKenna will be based on interviews with about 90 of Mr. Lynch’s friends, family members, former wives and artistic collaborators, including actors, agents and musicians. It will trace his rise as a screenwriter and director of idiosyncratic films like “Eraserhead,” “Blue Velvet” and “Lost Highway.”“His approach to this book is as unique as I would have hoped it to be, and I am fascinated to see where it goes,” Ben Greenberg, the executive editor of Grand Central Publishing, said in a statement.The book is tentatively scheduled to be published in 2017.
