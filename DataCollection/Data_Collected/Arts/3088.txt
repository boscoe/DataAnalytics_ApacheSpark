It was one of the hottest opera tickets of the year. With Jonas Kaufmann, the star tenor, scheduled to sing only two performances this season at the Metropolitan Opera — and in one of the most popular operas in the repertoire, Bizet’s “Carmen” — both sold out fast.Jonasmania was so strong that by Monday morning, online ticket brokers were offering seats in the Grand Tier for his performance Wedneday night for $999.75 each, several times what the Met sells them for. But now it is unlikely that they will fetch anywhere near that.The Met announced Monday morning that Mr. Kaufmann had canceled his first scheduled performance as Don José on Wednesday because he was suffering from the flu and had been unable to travel to New York as scheduled on Sunday.  He will be replaced by Yonghoon Lee, who will be singing the title role in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” later this month.The Met said that Mr. Kaufmann hoped to recover in time to fly to New York later this week so he could perform as scheduled at the Saturday matinee. What the uncertainty means for the secondary-ticket market for scalpers and online brokers remains to be seen.
