The pop star’s “1989” (Big Machine) climbed back to No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart, selling 71,000 copies of the full release and another 302,000 downloads of individual tracks, enough for a 10th week on top, according to Nielsen Music.

(The full album was released after the qualifying deadline and will be eligible for next year’s awards.)In a low-selling week over all, Ed Sheeran’s “x” (Atlantic), which is nominated for album of the year, the Grammys’ top honor, jumped to No. 2 from No. 4, selling 74,000 album equivalent units. (Beginning late last year, the Billboard charts have counted album sales, streams and track downloads to determine rankings.) Meghan Trainor’s “Title” (Epic) held at No. 3, with 68,000 units, while Sam Smith, who has a leading six Grammy nominations, jumped five spots to No. 4 with “In the Lonely Hour” (Capitol). Ne-Yo’s “Non-Fiction” (Motown) debuted at No. 5.On the Hot 100 singles chart, “Uptown Funk” by Mark Ronson, featuring Bruno Mars, scored its fifth week at No. 1, with another 365,000 downloads sold.
