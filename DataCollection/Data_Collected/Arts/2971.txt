The offbeat reinvention of Lady Gaga continues to confound.After releasing “Cheek to Cheek,” an album of jazz standards with Tony Bennett, 88, and slaying a medley from “The Sound of Music” at the Academy Awards, the dance-pop queen will star in the fifth season of “American Horror Story,” she announced on Wednesday. Lady Gaga teased the project in a brief trailer, titled “American Horror Story: Hotel,” posted to her Twitter account, which shows the singer removing an ornate black mask not out of step with her elaborate red carpet costumes. “Make your reservation now,” she wrote to her 44.5 million followers. The latest chapter in the campy anthology series, created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk of “Glee,” will premiere in October.Make your reservation now. #GagaAHSHotel

In addition to her mini-movie music videos, the pop star has appeared briefly in films including “Machete Kills” and “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.” Previous seasons of “American Horror Story” have featured Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. The show’s fourth season premiere in October was the most-watched program in FX history.
