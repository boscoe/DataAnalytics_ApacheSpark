Alan Gilbert will not step down as music director of the New York Philharmonic until 2017, and has yet to announce what he plans to play at his farewell concert. But data released on Thursday by the orchestra’s Leon Levy Digital Archive makes it easier than ever to see what his predecessors played for their final concerts, and even to read copies of their farewell programs.Lorin Maazel went big, choosing Mahler’s massive Symphony No. 8, for his farewell in 2009. Kurt Masur chose a night of Beethoven. Zubin Mehta conducted Schoenberg’s “Gurrelieder,” and Pierre Boulez led “The Damnation of Faust,” by Berlioz. Leonard Bernstein said goodbye with Mahler’s Symphony No. 3. And Arturo Toscanini’s farewell concert in 1936 featured Wagner excerpts, and Jascha Heifetz playing the Beethoven Violin Concerto.The programs for those farewells are among the 10,000 that have been added to the orchestra’s searchable digital archive, which now has a total of 13,300 programs dating to the orchestra’s founding in 1842. Now people can see the programs for concerts including the 1865 memorial for Abraham Lincoln and the 1928 premiere of Gershwin’s “An American in Paris.”The orchestra is making its data open to scholars, developers and the public, said Barbara Haws, the orchestra’s archivist. One area that will fascinate anyone with an interest in Gilded Age New York is searchable set of the orchestra’s subscribers from 1883 to 1907 — including entries for Rockefeller, J.D., and Vanderbilt, Mrs.In some of the programs, the ads are as fascinating as the notes. An ad from Columbia Records in the program for Bernstein’s final concert read “Leonard Bernstein believes it’s time you started getting familiar with these composers,” over pictures of Mahler, Nielsen and Ives.
