He was recently named assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, a prime steppingstone to a major career. On Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall, he leads his superlative youth orchestra in Beethoven’s Violin Concerto (with Elena Urioste as soloist) and Rimsky-Korsakov’s colorful “Scheherazade.” The concert was also supposed to feature the premiere of Jonas Tarm’s “Marsh U Nebuttya,” but it was removed from the program when the orechestra discovered that it quoted a Nazi anthem. (2 p.m., 212-247-7800, nyyouthsymphony.org.)The next night, the dazzling pianist Kirill Gerstein arrives at Carnegie’s downstairs Zankel Hall with a characteristically daunting set of works that were all originally intended, at least nominally, as exercises. The program includes selections from Bartok’s “Mikrokosmos,” Bach’s Three-Part Inventions and, in a rare feat, all of Liszt’s devilishly difficult “Transcendental Études.” (7:30 p.m. Monday, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org.)Advertisement
