A photo posted by PRINCESTAGRAM (@prince) on Oct 22, 2015 at 6:33pm PDTPrince is still playing the Internet hot and cold.The always enigmatic, occasionally technophobic singer turned his attention to Instagram over the weekend, starting an account dubbed “Princestagram” — a term that began as a 2013 Jimmy Fallon gag — and posting more than 80 archival photos and Prince-centric memes, heavy on the color purple with splashes of self-awareness. (Here, for instance, is Dave Chappelle as Prince, overlaid with text that says, “This bores me.”)Long wary of how his image and work are used online, Prince has gone from demanding that any and all unauthorized content be removed to feeding the machine himself, experimenting with a Twitter account (@Prince3EG) and releasing a new album, “HITNRUN,” exclusively through Jay Z’s streaming service Tidal in September.Not that the thaw always lasts: Prince has gone back and forth, deleting and reinstating accounts on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube; he previously gave Instagram a shot last year before going dark again.This time around, the Princestagram page has collected more than 60,000 followers in 48 hours, although fans should not expect a “like” back — his account is following zero people.In 2010, Prince declared: “The Internet’s like MTV. At one time MTV was hip and suddenly it became outdated.” But five years later, upon the release of his digital album on Tidal, he admitted to being fickle and noted that he prefers not to be quoted at all, lest he change his mind. “Remember what I said about the Internet?” he said.A version of this article appears in print on 10/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: And Now, Princestagram.
