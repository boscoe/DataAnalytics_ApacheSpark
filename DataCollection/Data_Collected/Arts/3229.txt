Longevity can assume a different order of magnitude in the jazz realm, where wisdom and experience are revered, and no one ever seems to retire. Still, there’s something singular about the staying power of the redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes, who will turn 90 on Friday, celebrating the occasion on the bandstand at the Blue Note.Mr. Haynes has a history that stretches past the birth of bebop, and he has endured, as a drummer and a bandleader, through every successive epoch in the music. At some point, longevity became his calling card: He calls his nimble quartet, featuring younger dynamos like the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, the Fountain of Youth Band.On Friday, the group has heavyweight reinforcements: the guitarist Pat Metheny and the bassist Christian McBride, who have toured and recorded with Mr. Haynes. Saturday’s guest is the trumpeter Roy Hargrove. And on Sunday, Mr. Haynes will match wits and cadences with the tap dancer Savion Glover, a kinetic force and a kindred spirit.
