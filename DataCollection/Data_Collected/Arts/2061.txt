Graham W. J. Beal, one of the most battle-scarred directors in recent American museum history, announced plans to retire in June after leading the Detroit Institute of Arts through an unprecedented threat to its world-class collection during Detroit’s federal bankruptcy.The collection, which some of the city’s creditors demanded be sold to help pay municipal debts, was saved late last year in an agreement, known as the “grand bargain,” in which foundations, private donors, the State of Michigan and the museum itself agreed to raise the equivalent of more than $800 million. The money was pledged help shore up public workers’ pensions, in exchange for the protection of the museum and a transfer of its ownership from the city to an independent charitable trust.The museum, which has struggled financially for decades, achieved operational stability during Mr. Beal’s tenure with the passage in 2012 of a three-county property tax dedicated to the museum’s budget. In almost 16 years as director, Mr. Beal also oversaw a $158 million renovation of the museum’s Beaux-Arts building and a comprehensive reinstallation of its galleries, completed in 2007, that has proved popular with visitors. (Attendance has increased significantly over the past several years, to more than 700,000 last year.)“It has certainly been quite a ride, with some amazing highs far outweighing the other kind, said Mr. Beal, 67, in a statement, adding a wry thanks to the museum’s staff and board for “success in so many different areas: among them artistic, scholarly, pedagogical, political and legal.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/09/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Detroit Institute Director To Step Down From Post.
