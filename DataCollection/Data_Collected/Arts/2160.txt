Their celebrated onstage rendering of Status Quo’s “Pictures of Matchstick Men” is a no-holds-barred take on one of the best, most succinct riffs in 1960s rock. They perform with their frequent tour mates Cracker. At 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 800-745-3000, bbkingblues.com. (Stacey Anderson)★ Dig Deeper With Billy Prince (Saturday) Each month this cult-hit soul party invites veteran musicians to share their original hits with young audiences, leaving all involved with full hearts and sore feet. This installment boasts a rare area set by Billy Prince, the former lead singer of the lovely Detroit doo-wop group the Precisions, whose breakthrough single, “If This Is Love (I’d Rather Be Lonely),” is a fine entry point to an impassioned, underrated catalog. At 9 p.m., Littlefield, 622 Degraw Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 877-987-6487, littlefieldnyc.com. (Anderson)Dr. Dog (Friday and Saturday) With the release this month of its sprawling first live album, “Live at a Flamingo Hotel,” Dr. Dog furthers its bid to become the new Grateful Dead. The band stretched its 1960s-style pop melodicism, tumultuous rock guitars and sylvan textures into a sprawling, lengthy performance, and the effect was hearty if unflagging in tempo. The group is nearing the end of its two-week, eight-show run in the city. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, boweryballroom.com. (Anderson)Steve Earle (Mondays, through Jan. 26) This Texas singer has received a second career wind thanks to TV showrunners who aspire to his grittiness. He’s appeared either in person or through song on “The Wire,” “Longmire,” “Treme,” and most recently, “True Detective.” And like that newest series, Mr. Earle’s music is entrenched in the backwater past: bluesy slide guitars, lo-fi vocals, plenty of heart and fury. He continues his monthlong winter residency at City Winery. At 8 p.m., 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, 212-608-0555, citywinery.com. (Andrew R. Chow)Fleetwood Mac (Thursday) The most famous exes in ’70s rock, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, continue to tour with their “Rumours”-era bandmates — including the keyboardist-singer Christine McVie, whose recent reincorporation into the lineup was a watershed moment for fans. As with their mostly placid last outing, they’ll rely on their arsenal of bewitching radio hits, including “Rhiannon,” “Go Your Own Way” and “Landslide.” At 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 866-858-0008, thegarden.com. (Anderson)Dillon Francis (Friday through Sunday) One of the leading pioneers of moombahton — that hybrid of house, reggae and drummy techno — Mr. Francis is a mainstay of the festival circuit and a popular party D.J. in his native Los Angeles. His debut studio album, “Money Sucks, Friends Rule,” bordered on self-parody with constant rallying cries and walloping beat drops. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, 800-745-3000, terminal5nyc.com. (Anderson)Jackie Greene (Friday) This countrified roots-rocker pulled a tidy trick on “Till the Light Comes” in 2010, melding pop with the twang and horizon-gazing spiritual balladry of his past efforts. The result was a set of unhurried jams that recalled the work of his occasional collaborator, the Grateful Dead member Phil Lesh. In 2013, he joined the Black Crowes as that band’s lead guitarist. At 7 and 10 p.m., City Winery, 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, 212-608-0555, citywinery.com. (Anderson)Nick Hakim (Tuesdays, through Jan. 27) A lot of young artists are putting out minimalist R&B these days, but Mr. Hakim is not just another face in the crowd — his delicate guitar work and hazy harmonies make him a singular and vital presence in the genre. His 2014 EPs (“Where Will We Go,” Parts 1 and 2) have been exercises in restraint, drenched in liquor and physicality. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Jan. 27 at 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com. (Chow)Lydia Lunch (Thursday) This no-wave singer-poet supposedly earned her surname by stealing food from local punk musicians in the 1970s. She remains avant-garde and acerbic, and now performs often in a career retrospective project with Weasel Walter, Bob Bert and Tim Dahl. She flies solo on this night, however, for the Sally Can’t Dance party. With Handsome Dick Manitoba and others. At 10 p.m., Bowery Electric, 327 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, 866-777-8932, theboweryelectric.com. (Anderson)The Month in Cabaret: Christine Ebersole and Cheyenne Jackson (through Jan. 31) Among this month’s high points are the return of Christine Ebersole to 54 Below in her tart semi-autobiographical show, “Big Noise From Winnetka.” Wednesday through Jan. 24 and Jan. 28 to 31 at 7 p.m., 54 Below, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, 646-476-3551, 54below.com. Other highlights include the Broadway heartthrob Cheyenne Jackson’s debut (Friday and Tuesday through next Friday at 8:45 p.m., Saturday and Jan. 24 at 8:45 and 10:45 p.m.) at the Café Carlyle, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, 212-744-1600, thecarlyle.com; and the jazz diva Jane Monheit’s show “Hello Bluebird” (Friday and Saturday at 8:30 and 11 p.m.), at Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Stephen Holden)Psychedelic Furs (Sunday) Cult heroes of the early 1980s British rock scene — with a hauteur that nodded to the previous decade’s glam rock, and sulky guitars that were progenitors of post-rock — the Psychedelic Furs cut a stern impression onstage. The band, however, still elicits squeals from American audiences during the opening chords of “Pretty in Pink,” the song that inspired the John Hughes coming-of-age comedy of the same name. With Royston Langdon. At 8 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com. (Anderson)‘Round-Up With Sufjan Stevens’ (Tuesday through Jan. 25) This ambitious baroque-pop singer-songwriter once vowed to write an album about every state in the country; he eventually abandoned this musical manifest destiny after releasing albums about Michigan and Illinois. For this new project, commissioned by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, he has composed the score for a slow-motion portrait of bull riders and calf ropers at a rodeo, titled “Round-Up.” He will perform the work alongside the new-music ensemble Yarn/Wire, and the result, in his hands, should be gentle splendor. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Anderson)Savages (Saturday, Monday and Wednesday) The singer of this British postpunk quartet, Jehnny Beth, remains the heir apparent to the Joy Division frontman, Ian Curtis — she possesses the same androgynous beauty and cagey charisma. This all-female band whipped a furious lather on “Silence Yourself,” one of the best debuts of 2013 — not least for its fractious anthem “Husbands,” which should be screeched at all contentious divorce hearings. Over the course of nine area shows this month — all sold out — the band plans to debut new material. Saturday at 8 p.m., Saint Vitus, 1120 Manhattan Avenue, at Clay Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, saintvitusbar.com. Monday at 8 p.m., Baby’s All Right, 146 Broadway, near Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, babysallright.com. Wednesday at 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, mercuryloungenyc.com. (Anderson)The Ting Tings (Tuesday) “Sounds From Nowheresville,” this British duo’s second studio album, was fairly immodest, with yelping, rambunctious dance-punk that mingled with arena-friendly rock and new wave. On the song “Guggenheim,” the singer Katie White pined for the love of a beautiful art snob, forcefully singing “I’m gonna paint my face at the Guggenheim!” Last year’s follow-up album, “Super Critical,” consisted of less colorful dance tracks. At 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, 800-745-3000, boweryballroom.com. (Anderson)★ The Vaselines (Friday) A favorite group of Kurt Cobain’s — though probably less preferred by chauvinists who heard their castrating cover of Divine’s “You Think You’re a Man” — the Vaselines enjoyed modest acclaim in their native Scotland before disbanding in the late 1980s. Reunited in 2008, they have since offered taut tracks on their most recent dispatches: “Sex With an X,” from 2010, and “V for Vaselines,” released last year. At 9 p.m., the Bell House, 149 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 718-643-6510, thebellhouseny.com. (Anderson)Wussy (Saturday) The purveyors of such ingenious lines as “I finally got your letter/And your punctuation hit me like a truck” (from the song “Little Paper Birds”) continue touring in support of their fifth record of new material, “Attica!” On it, these mindful drone-rockers from Ohio, led by the singers Lisa Walker and Chuck Cleaver, are alternately terse and liquiform in all the right places. With Sam Haiman Band. At 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, 866-777-8932, websterhall.com/events. (Anderson)Advertisement
