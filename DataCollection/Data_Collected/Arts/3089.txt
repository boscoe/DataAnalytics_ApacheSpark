PARIS — French investigators are searching for 15 gold and bronze artworks stolen from the Château de Fontainebleau in an early morning break-in on Sunday. The target was a crown that once belonged to the king of Siam.The burglary took place after 6 a.m., according to the museum officials, and the thieves were in and out of the castle, southeast of Paris, in about seven minutes – the time from when the alarm was set off to when the police arrived.Fleur Pellerin, France’s minister of culture and communications, said in a statement that among the missing pieces were treasures from the 18th century and a ritual symbol, a mandala, from Tibet. The crown, made of gold, precious stones and pearls, and with a distinct tall peak, was presented to Napoleon III in 1861 by the ambassador from Siam.The works were stolen from the Chinese wing of the castle, which contains works collected by the Empress Eugenie, Napoleon III’s wife. Museum officials, who characterized the theft as “professional,” did not provide an estimate of the value of the items, describing them as unique and priceless.In 1995, 15 works were stolen from Fontainebleau; nine were recovered. Sunday’s heist is being investigated by the Central Office for the Fight Against Trafficking of Cultural Goods,   or O.C.B.C., a special French unit that tracks stolen works of art and cultural objects.A version of this article appears in print on 03/03/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Fontainebleau Museum Is Burglarized.
