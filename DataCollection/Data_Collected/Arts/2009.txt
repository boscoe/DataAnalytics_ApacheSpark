Leon Wieseltier, the former literary editor of The New Republic, will be joining The Atlantic as a contributing editor and critic, writing for both the print magazine and the website on “his customary wide range of subjects,” according to a news release.Mr. Wieseltier, who joined The New Republic in 1983, left the magazine last month in concert with its editor, Franklin Foer, over differences with the magazine’s publisher, Chris Hughes, and new chief executive, Guy Vidra. Much of the staff followed, and the magazine suspended print publication until February. In a statement, James Bennet, editor of The Atlantic, praised Mr. Wieseltier, who is known for his ferociously learned literary style. “For a generation of editors and writers, Leon has helped define the standards for piercing criticism of culture and society,” Mr. Bennet said. “There is no writer better equipped — by dint of erudition, wit, and forcefulness — to fill the role of critic for The Atlantic.”Reached by telephone, Mr. Wieseltier, who threw out the first pitch at a Washington Nationals game in September in connection with The New Republic’s centennial, declined to reach for a pungent crosstown rivalry metaphor to describe his change of teams.“I’ve always regarded the old New Republic and The Atlantic as cousins,” he said. “There was always a genuinely cordial and friendly relationship between the two magazines. It will be an honor to pursue my causes at such an intellectually distinguished home.”A version of this article appears in print on 01/06/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Wieseltier to Write for The Atlantic.
