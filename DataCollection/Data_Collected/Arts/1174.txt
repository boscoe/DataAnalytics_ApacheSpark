A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.★ Darcy James Argue’s ‘Real Enemies’ (through Sunday) Conspiracy theories and American postwar paranoia form the broad subject matter for this new multimedia opus by Mr. Argue, a serious-minded young composer. Featuring his Secret Society big band, it’s a stylish collaboration with the writer-director Isaac Butler and the filmmaker Peter Nigrini — presented as part of the Brooklyn Academy of Music’s Next Wave festival, which also commissioned Mr. Argue’s previous work, “Brooklyn Babylon.” Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Nate Chinen)Black Art Collective (Friday through Sunday) Though its name suggests a link to the poet Amiri Baraka’s Black Arts movement, this ensemble is bound by less contentious aims. The group upholds a vision of jazz derived partly from the heritage of its all-star roster: the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, the tenor saxophonist Wayne Escoffery, the trombonist James Burton, the pianist Xavier Davis, the bassist Gerald Cannon and the drummer Johnathan Blake. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Johnathan Blake Group (Monday) A smart, propulsive drummer who has lately proved himself an equally resourceful bandleader, Johnathan Blake convenes only first-rate talent in this quartet: the saxophonist John Ellis, the bassist Gregg August and the drummer Joe Dyson. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Dave Douglas Quintet (through Sunday) The trumpeter-composer Dave Douglas and this dynamic quintet have released three fine albums, the newest of which is “Brazen Heart,” his focus here. As on the album, he’ll feature original compositions tailored to the considerable strengths of his personnel: the saxophonist Jon Irabagon, the pianist Matt Mitchell, the bassist Linda Oh and the drummer Rudy Royston. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)AdvertisementGeorge Garzone (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Garzone is a tenor saxophonist revered for his mastery of the Coltrane language, and for embracing the freer possibilities of improvisation. On Friday he leads a young group slyly billed as the Sons of George Garzone, with the tenor saxophonist Kenny Brooks, the guitarist Chris Crocco, the bassist Peter Slavov and the drummer Ian Froman. Saturday’s shows will feature the Fringe, an open-ended trio in which Mr. Garzone has played since the early ’70s, now with John Lockwood on bass and Bob Gullotti on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Wycliffe Gordon & Friends (Tuesday and Wednesday, Nov. 27 and 28) Mr. Gordon, a trombonist, trumpeter, singer and one-man jubilation engine, settles in for a Thanksgiving-week engagement at his second home. He’ll be in good company, with the pianist Ehud Asherie, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Alvin Atkinson Jr. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola; Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)★ Roy Haynes (Tuesday and Wednesday) At 90, Mr. Haynes has lost remarkably little of his crisp pugnacity as a drummer, even less of his cavalier swagger as a bandleader and virtually none of his sartorial flash. He appears, as usual, with diligent musicians many years his junior. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)Aaron Irwin Quartet (Tuesday) Aaron Irwin is a young multi-reedist drawn to lilting melody and autumnal mood. Here as on his new album, “A Room Forever,” he presents music inspired by the short fiction of the West Virginia author Breece D’J Pancake, for a quartet with Matt McDonald on trombone, Thomson Kneeland on bass and Pete McCann on guitar. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Its lineup, all present here, features Matt Vashlishan on alto saxophone and flute, Bobby Avey on piano and keyboards, Tony Marino on bass and Alex Ritz on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery; 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Jason Moran and the Bandwagon (Tuesday through Nov. 29) Mr. Moran, the pianist and composer, has been even busier than usual in recent weeks: presenting new work at the Venice Biennale; programming events at the Kennedy Center; touring with several projects; unveiling a new label. The Bandwagon, his trio with the bassist Tarus Mateen and the drummer Nasheet Waits, still represents his baseline, which isn’t at all to imply that it has stopped pushing boundaries or taking risks. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Adam O’Farrill’s Stranger Days (Friday) Mr. O’Farrill, a sharp-minded trumpeter in his early 20s, appears on two of this year’s most acclaimed jazz albums: “Bird Calls,” by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa; and “Cuba: The Conversation Continues,” by the Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra, led by his father, Arturo O’Farrill. Stepping out here, the younger Mr. O’Farrill enlists his brother Zack, a drummer, along with the bassist Walter Stinson and the saxophonist Chad Lefkowitz-Brown. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery; 1160 Broadway at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Django Reinhardt NY Festival (through Sunday) Dorado Schmitt, a French guitarist with the roguish charisma and pencil-thin mustache required of any Gypsy jazz paragon, is the inexorable star of the Django Reinhardt Festival. He’ll be joined by his son Amati, also a guitarist, and the accordionist Ludovic Beier, among others; guests include the saxophonist Joel Frahm (Friday), the cellist Borislav Strulev (Saturday) and the singer Cyrille Aimée (Sunday). Friday and Saturday at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m.; Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementAdam Rudolph’s Go: Organic Guitar Orchestra (Monday) The percussionist and composer Adam Rudolph has had an endlessly pliable outlet in the Go: Organic Orchestra, a large ensemble trained to execute his ideas. For this concert, as on a new album, “Turning Towards the Light,” he’ll conduct an all-guitar edition whose ranks include elite improvisers like Nels Cline, David Gilmore and Liberty Ellman. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)★ Maria Schneider Orchestra (Tuesday and Wednesday, Nov. 27 through 29) Led by Ms. Schneider, a composer and orchestrator of penetrating insight, this group has an ambitiously realized new album — “The Thompson Fields,” its first release in eight years — that underscores its stature as the pre-eminent large ensemble of our time. The music from the album, much of it inspired by nature, will be a primary focus in this annual Thanksgiving-week engagement, an institution in and of itself. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ Tyshawn Sorey Trio (through Sunday) Mr. Sorey, a powerfully inventive drummer who has applied most of his recent focus to composition, presents the trio that can be heard on his latest album, “Alloy.” Featuring the pianist Cory Smythe and the bassist Christopher Tordini, it’s a chamberesque unit that works as much with new-music protocols as with any jazz dialect — and it counts as an unexpected booking at the Village Vanguard, one worth bolstering with a show of support. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Tri-Centric Orchestra (Sunday) Established by the visionary composer Anthony Braxton, the Tri-Centric Orchestra is a new-music outfit conducted by Taylor Ho Bynum. This concert will feature the premiere of four works newly commissioned for the ensemble: “From the Angel,” by Michaël Attias; “Agora,” by Dan Blake; “Rivers We Have Crossed,” by Joseph Daley; and “When the World Changes Around You,” by Jessica Pavone. At 7 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org.
