Give the kids some TV candy with “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” then steal “Boyhood” for yourself. And for the price of a Ben Franklin, you can curl up with old-school Bond, James Bond, in the privacy of your home and leave the “Spectre” lines to everyone else.SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Like it or not, Donald Trump takes the stage as host.CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005) 1:30 p.m. on ABC Family. In lieu of sweets, give the kids Tim Burton’s sugar-rush adaptation of this Roald Dahl book. Johnny Depp plays the oddly sinister candy maker; Freddie Highmore is the boy who wants nothing more than to swim in chocolate. Never mind the psychological balderdash. “There is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonka’s world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. (Image: Mr. Depp)BOYHOOD (2014) 2 p.m. on TMC. With the kids occupied, sneak off and watch Richard Linklater’s chronicle of 12 years in the life of a boy (Ellar Coltrane), his sister and their parents. Siblings argue. A mother struggles with men and bills. A father roars through in a 1968 GTO. A child grows up. It’s Patricia Arquette’s Oscar. Mr. Linklater “isn’t fighting time but embracing it in all its glorious and agonizingly fleeting beauty,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. (Image: Mr. Coltrane)UNFINISHED BUSINESS (2015) 8 p.m. on HBO. Vince Vaughn is an executive turned museum exhibit. Sienna Miller is his former boss, a girl named Chuck. Their fight for a big contract takes them to Germany. (Translation: Oktoberfest, a G-8 meeting and bizarre sexual predilections.) It’s slick and innocuous, but “don’t expect impressive profit margins,” Andy Webster wrote in The Times.THE ESSENTIALS: NORMA RAE (1979) 8 p.m. on TCM. The gift that kept giving: Along with the film, you’ll see Sally Field telling why her Oscar-winning performance in it as a pro-union worker changed her life. (Image: Ms. Field)DOCTOR WHO 9 p.m. on BBC America. Shapeshifting Zygons attack Britain, leaving it up to the Doctor to determine who’s friend and who’s foe.THE RETURNED 10 p.m. on Sundance. The deceased open their housing complex to some new arrivals.WHAT’S STREAMING NOWRACE, SEX & MONEY on Tribeca Shortlist.
