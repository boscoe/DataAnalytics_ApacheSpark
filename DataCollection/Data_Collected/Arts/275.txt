An exhibition exploring the impact of new technology on fashion – and how designers are reconciling the handmade and the machine-made — will be the Costume Institute’s spring 2016 exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art announced Tuesday.The show, “manus x machina: fashion in an age of technology,” will be on view from May 5 through August 14. It will follow the Costume Institute Benefit — or Met Gala — on May 2, which this year will be led by the pop star Taylor Swift; the actor Idris Elba, Apple’s chief design officer, Jony Ive, and Anna Wintour, the Vogue editor-in-chief for whom the Costume Center is named.Andrew Bolton, who last month was named curator in charge of the museum’s Costume Institute, will present more than 100 examples of haute couture and avant-garde ready-to-wear — from an 1880s Worth gown to a 2015 Chanel suit. The exhibition, which will be sponsored by Apple, will look at the founding of the haute couture houses in the 19th century, when the sewing machine was invented and the onset of industrialization and mass production. Designers in the exhibition will include those from fashion houses like Burberry, Alexander McQueen, Lanvin, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.“Traditionally, the distinction between the haute couture and prêt-à-porter was based on the handmade and the machine-made, but recently this distinction has become increasingly blurred as both disciplines have embraced the practices and techniques of the other,” Mr. Bolton said in a statement.A series of “in process” workshops will be presented in the Anna Wintour Costume Center galleries, including one in which visitors can watch the creation of 3-D-printed garments.The topic suddenly seems to be all the rage. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston recently announced its upcoming show, “#techstyle,” which opens in March and will explore how technology is changing how designers approach fashion and the way people interact with their clothing.A version of this article appears in print on 10/14/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Met Gala Theme Nods to New Technology.
