LONDON — Kasper Holten, the director of opera at the Royal Opera House here, will leave his position at the end of March 2017, the opera announced Wednesday. In a letter to his colleagues, the Danish-born Mr. Holten, 42, said that “after much soul-searching,” he and his partner had decided they wanted to raise their children in Copenhagen, and that he had rejected the offer of a five-year extension to his current contract.Antonio Pappano, the music director of the Royal Opera, said that Mr. Holten had demonstrated “an uncanny energy, perseverance and vision for the future of our great institution,” and that his departure would be a major loss for the company.Mr. Holten, who became director of the Royal Danish Opera at 27, has had a somewhat bumpy ride since joining the Royal Opera House in his current post in 2011. Critics took issue with his choices of directors and productions, and a rape scene in Damiano Michieletto’s staging of Rossini’s “Guillaume Tell” in June was greeted with outrage and boos from the audience.The Royal Opera House said the search for Mr. Holten’s successor would begin in the new year.A version of this article appears in print on 12/11/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Director Leaving Royal Opera.
