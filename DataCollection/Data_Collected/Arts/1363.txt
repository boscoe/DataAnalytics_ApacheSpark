Patient fans of AMC’s “The Walking Dead” were treated to something special last night. Those who waited until after the first commercial break of “Into the Badlands,” the show that follows “The Walking Dead,” were given a glimpse of what is coming in the second half of Season 6, which begins Feb. 14. It can be summed up in one word: Negan. [Recap: ‘The Walking Dead’ Midseason Finale]As “Walking Dead” devotees know, the comic book source material and the TV series don’t always line up. But the name Negan is sure to send shivers of excitement and fear into fans of the comic. Viewers of the television series who do not want to learn about the character and potentially have future episodes spoiled should stop now. Seriously. (This is your final warning.)Negan made his first appearance in the 100th issue of “The Walking Dead,” which was released in July 2012. He is a despot and the leader of the Saviors, a group that runs a protection racket, offering small communities security in exchange for supplies. Negan is smart and violent, and he has a strange moral code. He prevents one woman from being raped, yet he keeps a harem. His weapon of choice is Lucille, a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. When Negan meets Rick and a group of his allies, he plays a perverse game of “duck, duck, goose” which ends fatally for Glenn.Negan’s appearance kicks off a tense story line in the comic, with some surprising turns. The least of them are Negan’s connection with Carl and a wickedly inspired way to use the zombies in warfare.Fun fact: Charlie Adlard, the artist of “The Walking Dead,” is said to have based Negan’s appearance on the brawny actor and musician Henry Rollins. But the role in the series is going to Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is no stranger to comic book adaptions. He played the Comedian in “Watchmen” and he is playing Thomas Wayne, whose son becomes the caped crusader, in next year’s “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.”
