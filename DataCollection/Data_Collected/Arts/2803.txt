Princeton University has announced the largest gift in its history: a trove of rare books valued at nearly $300 million, including a Gutenberg Bible, an original printing of the Declaration of Independence, all four of Shakespeare’s Folios and significant musical manuscripts written by Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert and Wagner.The Scheide Library, named for the family of the philanthropist and scholar William H. Scheide, has been housed in a special room in Princeton’s Firestone Library since 1959, when Mr. Scheide, who died last November at age 100, moved it there from his family home in Titusville, Pa. The bequest makes Princeton the permanent home of what the university’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, called “one of the greatest collections of rare books and manuscripts in the world today.”The roughly 2,500-item collection originated with Mr. Scheide’s grandfather, an oil executive who began amassing material in 1865. Mr. Scheide, a musicologist and founder of the Bach Aria Group who, among many other philanthropic activities, was a leading financer of the NAACP’s Brown vs. Board of Education lawsuit, continued adding to the collection until shortly before his death.The Scheide collection, which is being digitized, will remain a distinct collection within Firestone Library, where it will be relocated to a new space as part of the library’s current renovation. That new space will retain the original furniture, rugs and leaded-glass windows from the family library in Titusville, if not necessary the original space’s more elusive sensory aspects. In a 2011 interview with the Princeton Alumni Weekly, Mr. Scheide said he sometimes smelled the books. “It’s one way of getting acquainted,” he said.
