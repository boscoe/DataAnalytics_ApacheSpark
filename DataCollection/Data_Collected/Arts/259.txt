Hip-hop and R&B occupy the top five spots on this week’s Billboard album chart, where Janet Jackson’s “Unbreakable,” a relatively chaste return for the singer, is No. 1.The album — Ms. Jackson’s first since 2008 and her seventh No. 1 over all — opened with 109,000 albums sold and 3.9 million streams, according to Nielsen. “Unbreakable” marks the first No. 1 for the music publishing company BMG, which has existed in its current form since 2008 and released Ms. Jackson’s independently distributed album in a partnership with her own Rhythm Nation label.The chart victory also makes Ms. Jackson only the third artist to score a top-selling album in each of the last four decades, according to Billboard. (The other two: Barbra Streisand and Bruce Springsteen.)The Weeknd’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” (XO/Republic) jumped back up to the No. 2 spot with 73,000 album equivalent units, scoring another strong streaming week with more than 34 million plays, while “The Hills” held a fourth week as the No. 1 single.“What a Time to Be Alive” (Cash Money/Epic), the commercial mixtape from Drake and Future, is No. 3 on the album chart with 65,000 units (including a chart-leading 45 million streams), while Fetty Wap’s self-titled debut, last week’s No. 1, fell to No. 4. Tamar Braxton, the R&B singer and star of WEtv’s “Braxton Family Values,” debuts at No. 5 with “Calling All Lovers” (Epic).Just outside of the top five, at No. 6, is Taylor Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine), which is now in its 50th week on the chart, having never fallen out of the top 10.
