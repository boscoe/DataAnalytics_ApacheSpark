Even today at auction, the Napoleonic finial stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston about 25 years ago would not likely fetch more than $10,000, experts say.But that didn’t stop the museum on Tuesday from offering a big new $100,000 reward for the recovery of the 10-inch, gilded bronze eagle, one of 13 works of art taken from the museum during its infamous 1990 break-in.Museum officials say they have not gone flighty. They hope a jumbo reward might persuade someone to study their finial and see if it looks like the one taken from the Gardner, which was affixed to the top of a flagpole of the First Regiment of Grenadiers of Foot in Napoleon’s Imperial Guard.“The possibility exists that someone who might have it in their possession might not realize its importance,” said Anthony M. Amore, the museum’s security chief. He said the offer was part of an effort to “develop as many new leads as possible” in the heist.The new reward is separate, Mr. Amore said, from the museum’s $5 million reward for the recovery of all 13 works “in good condition.” Those items include three Rembrandts, a Manet and a Vermeer.No one can be charged in the thefts at this point, officials have said, because the statute of limitations has expired.The Gardner’s finial dates to 1813-14. It has a distinctive No. 1 on its metal base. Mr. Amore said the museum had information that would help it rule out replicas.A version of this article appears in print on 05/15/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Reward for Item In Gardner Museum Heist.
