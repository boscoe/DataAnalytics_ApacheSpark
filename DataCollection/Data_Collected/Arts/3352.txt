Charles Ray’s “Baled Truck” is a machine-milled, stainless-steel rendering of a truck that was compacted into a 10-foot-long box shape weighing 13 tons. It’s the only object occupying the gallery’s main showroom, which has been constructed into a cruciform layout like that of a minimalist church interior. The sculpture sits at the intersection of transept and nave like a coffin. It’s conceptually interesting, but visually inert.What you see are crumpled auto-body parts, bent wheels, twisted tires, dented tubes, nut-and-bolt-studded structural parts, cables and all the rest, which have been transformed into shiny, silvery metal. What you can’t see is that it’s solid on the inside, which accounts for its extraordinary weight.You might read it as an allegory about the art of sculpture: To sculpt is to compress as much as possible into a desired shape. Actually, though, it was only the original truck that was transformed by compression. The sculpture is a high-tech copy produced not by compression but by machine-carving steel blocks that were subsequently assembled into the final product. The relationship between illusion and fact is less magically exciting than it has been in many of Mr. Ray’s past works. That’s true of another piece that’s hanging on the wall in a space the size of a walk-in closet: “Girl on a Pony,” a 492-pound, stainless-steel relief depicting a nearly life-size girl in profile sitting woodenly in a saddle. Mr. Ray is one of the most inventive sculptors alive, but with the two pieces here, the payoff from his technological investments is disappointing.Matthew Marks 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea Through April 18 A version of this review appears in print on March 13, 2015, on Page C24 of the New York edition.
