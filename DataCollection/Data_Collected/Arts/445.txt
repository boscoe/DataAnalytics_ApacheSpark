Britain has barred the export of Rembrandt’s 1657 “Portrait of Catrina Hooghsaet” until February in an effort to find a Britain-based buyer to keep the work in that country.In a statement on a government website and on Twitter, Ed Vaizey, Britain’s culture minister, said, “I hope that the temporary export bar I have put in place will result in a U.K. buyer coming forward to buy the Rembrandt painting to save it for the nation.”The painting, which has been owned since 1860 by the Douglas Pennant family, was sold privately through Sotheby’s in early June to an overseas buyer for £35 million (about $54 million).  Before it could leave the country, a committee that reviews potential export of works of art and objects of cultural interest for the Arts Council England recommended that an export license be delayed to give someone in Britain an opportunity to match the asking price.The announcement comes weeks after the French businessman Éric de Rothschild sold two early Rembrandt portraits in a joint purchase by the Louvre in Paris and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam for a record-breaking €160 million (about $181 million). “It would be a tragedy if it did leave the country,” Johnny van Haeften, the leading British dealer of Dutch old master paintings, said. “It’s a fantastic painting, and one of the best Rembrandts still in private hands. I don’t think the price is outrageous.” He said that the most likely scenario was that two British arts institutions could come together to buy it for public collections.“Catrina Hooghsaet,” a rare Rembrandt portrait to be commissioned by a female sitter, depicts an eccentric 17th-century heiress who was known for her love of parrots — one is depicted with her. The work was on public display in Penrhyn Castle in Wales from 1949 until 2013, and has been on loan to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, the National Gallery of Wales.
