American fans of the pianist Evgeny Kissin are about to go from feast to famine. This season Mr. Kissin seems ubiquitous at some of the country’s leading concert halls, but after May he does not plan to perform in the United States again until 2018, his representatives said.Mr. Kissin, 44, will continue to play concerts in Europe, but will take a break from playing in the United States and Asia during that time, his manager, Linda Petrikova, said in a brief telephone interview. She did not specify why, attributing it to “artistic reasons.” His plans were announced at a concert in Washington.But New Yorkers will have plenty of opportunities to hear him before he leaves to focus on Europe. He opened, and will close, the season at Carnegie Hall, at which he is also the focus of a season-long “Perspectives” series featuring him in a variety of concerts. Mr. Kissin will pull off a rare feat at Carnegie this week: He will play the same program on Tuesday and Friday. Carnegie officials said he would be the first pianist to repeat a recital program at the hall within a week since Vladimir Horowitz in the 1970s.A version of this article appears in print on 11/02/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Evgeny Kissin to Take A Break From the U.S..
