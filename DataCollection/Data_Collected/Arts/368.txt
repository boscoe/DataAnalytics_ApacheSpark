KahnThe upholstery conservator Leroy Graves, who has worked at Colonial Williamsburg for 48 years, has devised authoritative methods for safeguarding padded antiques without damaging furniture frames that have been punctured by innumerable nails over the years. Mr. Graves, 71, creates rigid, lightweight, removable upholstery components and protective coverings out of copper, plastic foam, plexiglass, nylon netting and Velcro.This month he published his first book, “Early Seating Upholstery: Reading the Evidence” (Colonial Williamsburg), with a chapter devoted to “the Graves approach for nonintrusive upholstery conservation.” It also analyzes historic cushioning techniques that called for recycled grain sacks and willow tree oils, among other surprising ingredients.About an armchair made for George Washington’s mother, Mary, around 1750, Mr. Graves writes that the original stuffing contained Spanish moss, wool from different sheep species, “ox hair, cotton, tow, flax, small clippings of fabric, a sliver of bone, and other trash — in other words, it appears to be composed of the sweepings from the shop floor.”Microscopes, ultraviolet light and X-rays can reveal ghosts of past upholstery — even on frames that have been stripped — and detect fake tack holes that forgers applied to make new parts look old. Where the original upholsterers made mistakes or cut corners, Mr. Graves has found telltale signs of collapsing cushions and cracked chair legs.Mr. Graves said in an interview that he had been planning to retire, but “wonderful stuff is still coming in,” to analyze and protect.Advertisement
