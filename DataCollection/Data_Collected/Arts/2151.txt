 “Motown: The Musical,” which ends its Broadway run on Sunday, recouped its $18 investment at the end of last year, its producers announced Friday. The show began performances at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in March 2013. Only about 25 percent of shows on Broadway earn back their capitalization and turn a profit each year.      The musical tells the story of Berry Gordy and the rise of Motown Records, with a parade of hit songs originally recorded by groups like the Supremes, the Miracles, the Temptations and the Four Tops.           “Motown” paid off at almost exactly the same pace as the still-running “Matilda,” which began previews at the Shubert Theater one week earlier than “Motown” and earned back its $16 million investment in December. “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” recouped its $13 million investment less than 10 months after opening at the Stephen Sondheim Theater in January 2013, becoming the season’s first new musical to pay back investors.               “Motown” will return to Broadway in the summer of 2016 at a Nederlander Theater to be announced. “Finding Neverland,” a musical based on the film about J. M. Barrie and the creation of “Peter Pan,” begins previews at the Lunt-Fontanne in March and is to open April 8.A version of this article appears in print on 01/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Motownu2019 Recoups $18 Million Investment.
