The French economist Thomas Piketty, the poet Claudia Rankine and the novelists Marilynne Robinson and Chang rae-Lee are among the 30 finalists for the National Book Critics Circle awards for the best books of 2014. The prize, which is given in six categories –– autobiography, biography, criticism, fiction, nonfiction and poetry – is one of the most prestigious American literary awards, and is judged by a panel of critics and book review editors.Ms. Rankine’s book of poetry, “Citizen: An American Lyric,” was nominated in two categories, poetry and criticism, the first time since the awards were created around 40 years ago that a single book has received two nominations. A lifetime achievement award will be presented to the novelist Toni Morrison. Phil Klay, whose short story collection, “Redeployment,” won the National Book Award in November, will receive the John Leonard prize for the best debut book.The five fiction finalists are Chang-rae Lee’s eerie dystopian novel “On Such a Full Sea;” Marlon James’s novel “A Brief History of Seven Killings,” which centers on the 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley; Rabih Alameddine’s “An Unnecessary Woman,” a novel about a reclusive Beirut woman; Marilynne Robinson’s “Lila,” the final book in her trilogy set in the fictional town of Gilead, Iowa, and Lily King’s “Euphoria,” which was based on the life and work of the anthropologist Margaret Mead.Nonfiction finalists include Mr. Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” a surprise best-seller about the widening wealth gap; Elizabeth Kolbert’s “The Sixth Extinction,” about the mass extinction of species; and Hector Tobar’s “Deep Down Dark,” a narrative detailing the ordeals of 33 Chilean miners who were trapped underground.The awards will be presented on March 12 at the New School in a free ceremony that is open to the public.
