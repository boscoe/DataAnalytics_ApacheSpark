The National Endowment for the Arts has named Gary Burton, Pharoah Sanders, Archie Shepp and Wendy Oxenhorn the recipients of the 2016 Jazz Masters award. Mr. Burton is a vibraphonist renowned for his innovations in technique and musical style: he pioneered the four-mallet technique and delved into fusion jazz along with Chick Corea and Steve Swallow in the 1970s. Mr. Sanders, a saxophonist, emerged out of John Coltraneâ€™s avant-garde groups in the 1960s to forge his own hard-edge sound, infusing his playing with mysticism and spirituality. Saxophonist Archie Shepp is acclaimed both for his work on the bandstand and in the classroom; his passionate studies of Afrocentric music helped bring those traditions into American jazz and music education. Ms. Oxenhorn, who is receiving the 2016 A.B. Spellman NEA Jazz Masters Award for Jazz Advocacy, is the executive director and vice chairman of the Jazz Foundation of America, which has been assisting struggling musicians since 1989. All three musicians have been actively performing over the last few years. The honorees will each receive a $25,000 cash award and perform a free concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on April 4 that will be streamed live on arts.gov. Related panel discussions, listening parties and other events will take place around Washington, D.C. from April 2-5.  The 2015 recipients included Carla Bley, George Coleman, Charles Lloyd and Joe Segal.A version of this article appears in print on 10/23/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Burton, Sanders and Shepp Are Named Jazz Masters.
