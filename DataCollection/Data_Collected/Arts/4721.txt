Avant-garde work has long been a specialty of the New York Film Festival, and its next edition, in the fall, will continue that tradition: organizers announced Tuesday that they will mount a special dual retrospective of the experimental filmmakers Nathaniel Dorsky and Jerome Hiler.Mr. Dorsky and Mr. Hiler, “partners in life and in cinema,” as a festival statement put it, each began making films in the early 1960s, first in the New York area and later in San Francisco. They have continued to use 16-millimeter film ever since — never video.  Mr. Dorsky’s work especially has been seen before at the festival, including “Triste” in 1996 and “Song” and “Spring” in 2013. That year, Mr. Hiler’s “Misplacement” was also shown with his partner’s work under the title “Momentary Light and Seasonal Songs.” The Times critic A.O. Scott wrote at the time of the three films’ “fleeting, fungible pleasures, the transitory impressions and perishable sensations that a movie camera, in the right hands, is uniquely equipped to capture.” The retrospective will include 33 films by Mr. Dorsky, including the world premiere of “Intimations,” and six by Mr. Hiler.
