Fredric M. Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, has abruptly resigned.In a statement, the chapter said Mr. Bell “has offered, and the organization’s board of directors has accepted, his immediate resignation. An interim executive director will be named next week and a search to find a new executive director will also begin at that time.”Mr. Bell could not be reached for comment.Trained as an architect and appointed executive director in June 2001, Mr. Bell was instrumental in the effort to create the institute’s storefront Center for Architecture, a hub for  architectural exhibitions and discussions in the city. He also weighed in on several controversial projects, including the Museum of Modern Art’s decision to demolish the American Folk Art Museum building and the Frick’s plans to eliminate a garden to make ways for its expansion.
