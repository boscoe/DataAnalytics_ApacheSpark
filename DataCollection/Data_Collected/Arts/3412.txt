PARIS – An original Astérix comic book page fetched 150,000 euros, or about $160,000, at a sale at Christie’s here, with all the proceeds going to the families of those killed in the attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper in January, according to the auction house.Albert Uderzo, a co-creator of the widely popular Astérix comic book series, donated the black-and-white storyboard from “Astérix and the Laurel Wreath,” first published in 1971, for the sale on Saturday.On Jan. 7, two gunmen burst into Charlie Hebdo offices, killing 12, including the newspaper’s top editor; several prominent cartoonists; and two police officers. One cartoonist, Jean Cabut, known as Cabu, was a  friend of Mr. Uderzo.Both Christie’s and the Galerie Daniel Maghen, which helped organize the auction, agreed to forgo their commissions on the sale.The identity of the buyer is confidential, but the storyboard will be autographed by Mr. Uderzo, according to Christie’s. The page depicts Astérix and Obelix, the Gallic warriors who star in the comic books, as they arrive before Caesar’s palace and discuss plans to sneak in and steal the Roman emperor’s laurels.The artist, now 87 and retired, told Europe 1 radio two days after the attack that he was devastated by the deaths of fellow cartoonists. He showed a drawing that he had penned to pay tribute to them, in which Astérix punches an unseen character into the air and says “I too am a Charlie.”“Charlie Hebdo and Astérix are obviously completely different,” Mr. Uderzo told Europe 1. “I just want to show my friendship for these cartoonists who paid with their lives.”The artwork was sold at an auction devoted entirely to comic books.
