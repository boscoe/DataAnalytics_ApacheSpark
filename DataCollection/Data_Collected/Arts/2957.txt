Netflix, the company that in short order has progressed from a mail-order DVD rental service to a streaming site to a producer of original television content (“House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black), announced Tuesday that it would  distribute a new film starring Paul Reubens as the memorable 1980s TV character Pee-wee Herman.Produced by Judd Apatow, the writer-director of comedic films like “Knocked Up” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” the film, “Pee-wee’s Big Holiday,” has been in the works for several years. (Mr. Reubens talked about it as early as 2010.) It will be directed by John Lee, a first-time movie director who has worked primarily on television shows for Adult Swim (“Delocated,” “The Heart, She Holler”) and Comedy Central (“Broad City,” “Inside Amy Schumer.”)Production on the film, which does not yet have a release date, will begin in March. Later this year Netflix will roll out the first title in its push into original movie production — “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon II: The Green Legend,” a sequel to the 2000 martial-arts film. The company has also entered into deals with the movie star Adam Sandler and the Duplass Brothers, indie film directors,  to produce and distribute four new movies each.A version of this article appears in print on 02/25/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Netflix to Offer New Pee-wee Herman Film.
