This was the decade, shading into the 1970s, whose architects created the Relaxation Cube, the walk-in Knowledge Box, inflatable Instant Cities and Microhouses for the masses. The Canadian designer Evelyn Roth crocheted heat-repelling car covers from discarded videotape film; the Italian Ettore Sottsass cooked up a tabletop dispenser for incense, LSD, opium and laughing gas.It was the era of 3-D magazines (subscriptions came in boxes, which freaked out the United States Postal Service), underground newspapers and a huge psychedelic poster culture. Much of all this — along with liquid light shows, proto-computer technology and fashion — was produced by collectives, including Ant Farm and Archigram, and by performance groups like the Cockettes. If you want a zap of zeitgeist, check out photos of the Cockettes in their “acid drag” heyday. “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?” was a protest song of the time. “Where Has All the Genius Gone?” could be the theme song for this show.
