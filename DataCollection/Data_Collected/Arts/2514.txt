Justin Peck does not lack for causes of anxiety. As the resident choreographer for New York City Ballet, the 27-year-old is perpetually auditioning for the role of rightful heir to George Balanchine. So imagine what Mr. Peck must have felt when he learned that Andrew Veyette, one of the lead dancers in his “Rodeo: Four Dance Episodes” was injured and could not perform on Wednesday evening at its premiere at the David H. Koch Theater. Who would step in to save Mr. Peck’s ballet? None other than Mr. Peck.Last-minute injuries aren’t uncommon in ballet. What is rare is for a choreographer to appear in his or her own work along with fellow members of the same troupe (though Mr. Peck, who is still an active dancer with City Ballet, has been known to perform in someone else’s piece on the same program as one of his choreographic debuts). Just now, Mr. Peck is under extra scrutiny, as “Ballet 422,” a documentary about him and his artistic process, is set to come to theaters on Friday. And he’s put more pressure on himself, soliciting further comparisons with the storied past by setting  his latest work to Aaron Copland’s “Rodeo,” a score associated with Agnes de Mille’s career-making ballet of 1942.Last night, he came out before his premiere, explained the injury situation and announced that he and Sean Suozzi would be splitting Mr. Veyette’s part. “Wish us luck,” he said. And the show went on.
