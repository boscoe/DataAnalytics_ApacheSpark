A well-reviewed Broadway revival of “The Heidi Chronicles,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Wendy Wasserstein, will close on May 3, after a lackluster showing at the box office.Jeffrey Richards, the lead producer, informed the cast of the news Tuesday night and confirmed it in an interview afterward.“We were very well reviewed, and the performances were remarkable, but people didn’t come to see it,” Mr. Richards said. “Whether it was how crazy busy it was at this time of year or the consumer being asked to choose between so many shows, ‘Heidi Chronicles’ was not at the top of their list.”The revival, directed by Pam MacKinnon, stars Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olson on “Mad Men”) as an art historian, Heidi Holland; and Jason Biggs (“Orange Is the New Black”) and Bryce Pinkham (“A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder”) as longtime friends.The producers’ decision to announce the closing just before Tony Award nominations are to be announced was unusual. “The Heidi Chronicles” has a solid chance for attention in several categories, including best revival of a play and best actress, though those prizes don’t typically make a significant difference at the box office.The play was praised, both when first staged and again this year, for its depiction of the struggles that women face balancing careers and families. It won the Tony Award for best play, as well as the Pulitzer Prize for drama, in 1989, and has been widely produced in other cities since then.The original Broadway production of “The Heidi Chronicles” ran for 630 performances in 1989 and 1990. The revival, which opened on March 19 at the Music Box Theater and which had been selling tickets through Aug. 9, will have run for 80 performances when it closes.The revival cost between $3.5 million and $4 million to mount, Mr. Richards said; that money is now lost. It had grossed $2,565,125 as of Sunday, according to the Broadway League; last week, it played to half-empty theaters and grossed $311,933.
