The lottery is coming to Pride Rock.After 18 years of ruling over Broadway with high grosses and few discounts, Disney on Monday is starting an online lottery for $30 tickets to “The Lion King,” joining a trend that is sweeping the industry as producers seek ways to make more low-priced seats available for what has become a high-priced form of entertainment.“The Lion King,” which won the Tony Award for best musical in 1998, remains the industry leader in many ways — most weeks it is the highest-grossing show on Broadway, it is now the third-longest-running show in Broadway history, and Disney says its cumulative worldwide grosses (there are currently nine productions around the world) are higher than those of any other entertainment title, including films.The show, which celebrates its 18th anniversary Friday, is also expensive to see. Last week its average ticket price was $130.40, and Disney said it had never sent tickets for the show to TKTS, which is the discount ticket booth in Times Square.Disney said its past efforts to discount tickets had been hampered by profiteering by scalpers — an issue all hot shows struggle with.“For many years we have explored ways to make more affordable tickets to The Lion King available to the public,” Andrew Flatt, a senior vice president at Disney Theatrical Productions, said in a statement. “But when we’ve tried a student rush in the past, some ticket brokers purchased the tickets at the rush price and resold them for much more than their face value.”The show’s digital lottery will work like this: entries will be accepted at lionking.com/lottery starting the day before a performance (the time will vary), and until 9 a.m. the day of the performance. Winners will be notified immediately and will have one hour to pay online.The tickets will be available only for pickup by people presenting identification in the final 30 minutes before the performance begins. This is a low-tech anti-scalping effort, similar to that being used by the nonprofit New York Theater Workshop (which has several much-in-demand shows upcoming), with the hope being that reducing the time window for resale will cut down on scalping.Digital lotteries are increasingly prevalent in the theater industry — just over the last few days the Off Broadway nonprofit Playwrights Horizons announced a digital lottery for its next play, “Marjorie Prime,” and the commercial producer Jeffrey Richards announced a digital lottery for a recently opened Broadway play, “Sylvia”; many other shows have done the same. And multiple other shows, including Disney’s “Aladdin,” still have the more traditional in-person lotteries.Disney said seat locations and the number of seats available through “The Lion King” digital lottery would vary by performance.
