LevereAs the Americans who are at least 5 years old and speak a language other than English at home now exceed 20 percent of the population, museums across the country are responding with bilingual and non-English educational programs for all ages.Offered in languages including Spanish,Russian, Mandarin and Persian, the programs are at a wide variety of institutions, including art, children’s and natural history museums. They do everything from celebrating holidays like the Day of the Dead, observed by many Latinos, to teaching technology and crafts to adults who have not mastered English.“To succeed in the 21st century, a museum needs to be responsive to its audience and align its programs to the audience’s needs, rather than sit in a conference room and hypothesize about what the visitor needs,” said Lisa Abia-Smith, director of education at the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at the University of Oregon in Eugene.The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which began offering Spanish-language educational programming in 1992, suspended that effort in 2012 when it concluded that it was not drawing its target audience. But the Cloisters, the Washington Heights branch of the Met specializing in medieval art, still offers monthly bilingual family programs for the predominantly Hispanic residents nearby. To cater to non-English-speaking visitors, museum staff members help arrange a fall fiesta, in English and Spanish, celebrating Latin American cultures, and a winter Lunar New Year festival in Mandarin and Korean. The Nolen Library at the main museum gives families access to more than 250 picture books in nine languages.Festival visitors can “choose their own path — make art, hop to a performance a grandparent wants to hear,” said Jacqueline Terrassa, who runs the museum’s gallery and studio education programs.Ms. Abia-Smith’s museum in western Oregon, a region with a growing Latino population, offers free twice-monthly art workshops in Spanish for women. The workshops include free child care and activities for the children.Ms. Abia-Smith said participants “love the place for social interaction,” while the art making “becomes a way for the mothers to tell their stories.” Like the Metropolitan, the Schnitzer also holds festivals, including a bilingual Day of the Dead.In January the Children’s Discovery Museum of San Jose, in California, celebrates Three Kings Day, a celebration of the Epiphany in Hispanic cultures, with a special weekend that draws 5,000 visitors; it also holds a Children of the Dragon festival in the spring and a Lantern Festival in the fall for local visitors of Vietnamese descent. Jenni Martin, director of education at the museum, said that first-generation Vietnamese immigrants would “gravitate to opportunities for their children to experience something from the homeland,” like a marketplace at the spring festival.Esther Netter, chief executive of the Zimmer Children’s Museum in Los Angeles, said it had significantly increased its bilingual programming in response to requests from visitors from a range of ethnic groups. It now offers courses for children in languages including Spanish, Japanese and Persian.“Teaching and speaking a language is not only about learning the language — it can also teach children about culture, tradition and history,” she said.The American Museum of Natural History in New York has free bilingual workshops and activities, in Spanish and English, for families living in public housing in the city. A Family Science Program funded by the City Council since last fall is allowing Housing Authority residents with children ages 4 to 10 to visit the museum free through May.Museums also cater to older students. In the city’s most ethnically diverse borough, the Queens Museum has offered a New New Yorkers program since 2005 in collaboration with the Queens Library to people age 18 and older in languages that have included Tibetan, Hindi, Bengali, Turkish, Sinhalese, Arabic, Russian, Croatian and Portuguese. Courses are currently available in Spanish, Mandarin and Korean.More than 2,800 students have participated in this free program since its inception, taking courses in painting, book making, crafts, digital photography, video editing, performance, graphic design, web design, computer literacy and English. Five different courses are taught at a time in the fall, spring and summer.Jason Yoon, director of education at the Queens Museum, said the program exposed visitors to bilingual artists and ways of making art and allowed them to express themselves, helping the museum fulfill its “general mission of openness.”What is more, he said, it encourages immigrants from different cultures to interact, “making connections that would not happen otherwise.”Advertisement
