Noah Hawley answered the questions here.Noah Hawley, the show runner of FX’s “Fargo,” is taking questions from Times readers.The list of series adapted from movies is long and mostly undistinguished, so Mr. Hawley has pulled off the improbable with “Fargo.”The first season, which starred Martin Freeman as an overmatched insurance salesman and Billy Bob Thornton as an icy killer, won praise from critics and the Emmy for best mini-series. True to its anthology format, “Fargo” abandoned almost everything from its 2014 run on its return earlier this month. The show introduced a new set of characters (played by Kirsten Dunst, Patrick Wilson and Ted Danson, among others) and a new time frame, unfolding in the twilight of the Carter Administration. (Ronald Reagan, played by Bruce Campbell, will make an appearance later in the run.)Mr. Hawley has said that the two seasons and the 1996 Coen brothers film that inspired them exist in the same universe. But so far, aside from occasional cross-references, the only consistency (other than the Solverson family in both seasons of the series) is the small-town Upper Midwest setting and an atmospheric tone that blends pitch-black comedy with random acts of crime, thuggery and graphic violence.Before “Fargo,” Mr. Hawley was a writer on “Bones,” and he also created two short-lived series: “The Unusuals” and “My Generation.” He is also the author of four novels. Please leave questions for him in the comments. We will post his responses to some of them soon.Coming soon: Scott M. Gimple, the show runner for “The Walking Dead,” responds to questions from Times readers.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
