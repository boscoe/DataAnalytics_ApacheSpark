We all know how to make a documentary about a serial-murder case: Structure it around interviews with prosecutors and police investigators, who reconstruct the crimes and the pursuit of the suspect. Well, someone forgot to explain that formula to Nick Broomfield.His “Tales of the Grim Sleeper,” on Monday night at 9 on HBO, explores the so-called Grim Sleeper case, in which women were killed in South Los Angeles over a period of more than 20 years. In 2010 the authorities charged Lonnie D. Franklin Jr. with 10 murders, and he is suspected of others, but don’t expect to see a lot of law enforcement figures here. The film is more interested in examining the complaint that the crimes were given little attention by the police because the neighborhood is poor and black.Mr. Broomfield, who is white and British, could not seem more out of place, yet he gains the confidence of friends of Mr. Franklin and others. One resident, a former prostitute named Pam Brooks, becomes his lively guide to the streets and helps him secure interviews with women who had encounters with Mr. Franklin, as well as with Mr. Franklin’s son.A version of this article appears in print on April 26, 2015, on Page AR8 of the New York edition with the headline: Television: A New Angle in a Murder Case.
