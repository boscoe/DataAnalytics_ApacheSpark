“Do I Hear a Waltz?,” a musical by Richard Rodgers and Stephen Sondheim, which played 220 performances on Broadway in 1965 and hasn’t been seen in a major New York production since, is coming back — for a long weekend, at least. The show, a romance set in Venice, with a book by Arthur Laurents based on his play “The Time of the Cuckoo,” will close out the 2015-16 Encores! season at City Center.Encores! officials on Sunday offered other details about the season, which as usual offers brief, concert-style runs of shows rarely seen in full stagings. It will open in February with the 1940 gospel-inflected  musical “Cabin in the Sky,” featuring a restoration of Vernon Duke’s original score, Feb. 10-14. Up next (and timed to a presidential election year) is “1776,” with music and lyrics by Sherman Edwards and a book by Peter Stone. It will run March 30 to April 3.In a statement, Jack Viertel, the artistic director of Encores!, said “1776” had been on the list of possible productions for a long time. “With Lin-Manuel Miranda’s ‘Hamilton’ on Broadway and dealing with many of the same story elements in a completely different way, we felt it would be an especially enjoyable moment to look at this wonderful show,” he said. “Do I Hear a Waltz?,” the only collaboration between Rodgers and Mr. Sondheim, will run May 11-15. Writing in The New York Times in 1965, Howard Taubman concluded that while “not a great musical,” the show “has the courage to abjure garishness and stridency.”  He added, “It is faithful to the sentimental tale that is its source.”  A version of this article appears in print on 05/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Encores! Season to End With a Rodgers-Sondheim.
