City Center Encores!, the program that stages revivals of rarely seen but beloved Broadway shows, is partnering with the Jerome L. Greene Space at WNYC to create a new talk show about musical theater.The series, “City Center Encores! Unscripted,” will consist of three talks and performances at the Greene Space that will be streamed live online, and later made available as videos and podcasts. Among the guests are bold-faced names of Broadway like Sheldon Harnick (“Fiddler on the Roof”), Jason Robert Brown (“Parade”) and Leslie Odom Jr. (“Hamilton”).Hosted by Jack Viertel, the artistic director of Encores!, the series begins Dec. 14 with the talk “Sexism. Racism. Show Tunes. Discuss,” an unsentimental look at Broadway’s Golden Age and its conflicting heritage of innocence and what would now be considered offensive attitude toward sex and race. Mr. Harnick will take part, along with Jeanine Tesori, the composer of “Fun Home,” and Ruben Santiago-Hudson from the coming Encores! revival of “Cabin in the Sky.”Next is “Keeping Score,” about musical theater composers, posterity and restoring lost compositions. (Encores! began in the 1990s as a program to uncover and breathe new life into rarely heard scores.) Speakers include the orchestrator Jonathan Tunick (“A Chorus Line”), the Encores! music director Rob Berman and Mr. Brown, who began his career writing musical arrangements.The series concludes March 14 with a talk about musical theater as a form of biography, “Who Tells Their Stories?: Historical Narratives on Broadway.” The coming season of Encores! includes a production of “1776,” whose cast members will be present for the talk. Michael Friedman, composer of “Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,” will also be there, along with Mr. Odom, who plays Aaron Burr in “Hamilton.”Tickets are available at the Greene Space’s website.A version of this article appears in print on 11/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Talk Show About Musical Theater.
