The show was bound for New York before the United States and Cuba renewed diplomatic ties, but that news should only bolster its feel-good spirit, as embodied by the exceptional dancers of Ballet Rakatan and the live music of the Cuban son band Turquino. Before Wednesday’s performance, a panel of Cuban and Cuban-American artists — including Eduardo Vilaro, the artistic director of Ballet Hispanico — will discuss the countries’ shifting political and cultural relations. Tango and flamenco are also on the festival lineup, with Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s “Milonga,” a conversation between Argentine and contemporary dance forms (Feb. 26 through March 1), and the popular Spanish troupe Ballet Flamenco Sara Baras (March 4 through 7).(Wednesday through next Sunday, 212-581-1212.)
