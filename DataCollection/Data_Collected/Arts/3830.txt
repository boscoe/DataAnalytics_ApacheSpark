Matthew Warchus will direct.Messrs. Warchus, Minchin, Darling and Howell all worked on “Matilda,” which won four Tony Awards and a special honor for the girls playing the title role. “Matilda” has been playing on Broadway since 2013.“Groundhog Day,” which will be produced by Whistle Pig Productions, Scott Rudin and Columbia Live Stage, hasn’t announced a Broadway theater, but does have an opening date: March 9, 2017, which would put it out of the running for next season’s Tonys derby.Closer on the calendar, the producer Jeffrey Richards announced on Thursday that “China Doll,” a new play by David Mamet and starring Al Pacino, will begin performances on Oct. 20 at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, and will open on Nov. 19.A version of this article appears in print on 04/03/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: It’s Opening Night, Every Night.
