When musicians withdraw from performances, the word “indisposed” can be useful — since it can either mean “unwell” or “unwilling.” But when the pianist Kirill Gerstein pulled out of a performance of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” in its original jazz band arrangement  with Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks on Tuesday night, the opening of the 92nd Street Y’s 2015-16 season, he did not avail himself of it — and instead cited “irreconcilable artistic differences.”Of course, that raised questions too. Were there disputes over what tempo to play? Cadenza issues? Differences of interpretation with the conductor, Maurice Peress?Mr. Gerstein said in a telephone interview that he did not want to elaborate on his reasons for withdrawing. “I think I’m too honest to say ‘I’m sick,’ ” he said. “This would have been the easiest, and some people would have liked me to say, look — flash food poisoning, can’t play. Very easy. Story finished. I think that that’s not honest, so that’s not what was done.”The 92nd Street Y scrambled and found a last-minute substitute: Ted Rosenthal, a respected jazz pianist.So how was the concert? Listeners can judge for themselves online. Video of the concert was streamed for free at 92 Y on Demand. Those curious about Mr. Gerstein’s approach can see him playing the piece in the jazz band arrangement at Berklee College of Music.
