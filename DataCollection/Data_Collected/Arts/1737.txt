Lead Belly Fest, a tribute concert to the folk and blues musician Lead Belly, is heading to Carnegie Hall on Feb. 4 after a sold-out performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.The New York iteration of the event will feature the guitarist Buddy Guy; Eric Burdon of the Animals; Tom Chapin; Nick Moss with Michael Ledbetter; and Laurence Jones, among others. Tom Paley of the New Lost City Ramblers, who performed with Lead Belly at Carnegie Hall in 1949, will also take the stage.Following New York, Lead Belly Fest will travel to the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville on June 16; the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood, in the summer; and the Sydney Opera House in Australia, at the end of 2016, Paul Puccioni, the concert’s organizer, said.“There are so many people who want to pay tribute to Lead Belly,” Mr. Puccioni said, adding that each concert would be a blend of local talent and marquee names. “Great rock and rollers from around the world have been influenced by Lead Belly and they want to participate. Even the legends have heroes and Lead Belly was theirs.”Lead Belly, born Huddie Ledbetter in 1888, has influenced performers from Bob Dylan to Kurt Cobain, and his image and marketing, which relied on his history as a criminal, became a prototype for musicians decades after his death. In the early 1930s, the musicologists John and Alan Lomax visited Lead Belly while he was in the infamous Angola prison in Louisiana and made his first recordings, creating what was thought at the time to be the first authentic American folk album. He died in 1949 of A.L.S., or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Proceeds from the concert will go to the Association to Benefit Children and Project A.L.S.Tickets can be bought at carnegiehall.org.A version of this article appears in print on 12/21/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Tribute to Lead Belly Planned at Carnegie Hall.
