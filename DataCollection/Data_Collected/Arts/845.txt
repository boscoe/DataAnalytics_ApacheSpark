Whereas the Taubman collection on the block Wednesday night had been widely described as patchy in quality, the material in Thursday’s sale was considered more blue-chip across the board. Over all, the 47 scheduled lots brought in $306.7 million with fees, above the low estimate of $275.6 million.Among the evening’s stars were Picasso’s “La Gommeuse,” which sold for $67.5 million (over the $60 million low estimate). The canvas came from the collection of William I. Koch, the billionaire businessman.And a pastoral Arles landscape by Van Gogh, “Paysage Sous Un Ciel Mouvementé,” brought $54 million to a single bidder on an estimate of $50 million to $70 million.“It was a very successful sale,” the dealer David Nash said as he left the salesroom. “A lot of vigorous bidding on fresh property.”Most of the works sold at or above their low estimates, including another trophy from the Koch collection, Monet’s 1908 “Nympheas,” which sold for $33.8 million, just above the low estimate of $30 million.About a dozen lots failed to sell, including five Picassos, a Cézanne, a Sisley and a Pissarro.But Sotheby’s was upbeat, if perhaps relieved. The auction house has been on tenterhooks this week, having extended itself by $500 million to secure the collection of A. Alfred Taubman, its former chairman.After two sales, representing 90 percent of the collection’s value, the Taubman cache had raised $419.7 million with fees, based on which the auction house told shareholders on Thursday that it would earn back its hefty guarantee.In its post-sale comments to the press — a ritual, incidentally, that the auction house skipped after the first Taubman sale the night before — Sotheby’s specialists sounded downright celebratory.“We were all very happy with the sales,” said Elizabeth Gorayeb, Sotheby’s director of research in Impressionist and modern art. “We were greatly surprised at just how ferocious the competition was for these works.”Henry Wyndham, the evening’s auctioneer and the chairman of Sotheby’s Europe, said: “There was a lot of bidding all over. I thought it felt very good.”David Norman, the co-chairman of Impressionist and modern art, joked, “Anybody with a Van Gogh, you know who to call.”On Thursday night, the pieces that were expected to do well generally delivered.“Nu Aux Jambes Croisées,” a Picasso nude pastel from 1903, sold for its high estimate of $12 million to an Asian bidder. The hunched woman with a grim expression captures the melancholy of the artist’s Blue Period, which was characterized by shades of blue and inspired in part by the suicide of Picasso’s close friend Carlos Casagemas in 1901.A Kazimir Malevich oil on canvas, “Mystic Suprematism,” sold for $37.8 million to one of two bidders, having been estimated at $35 million to $45 million. The piece had what Sotheby’s calls an irrevocable bid — a contractual agreement with a buyer to purchase a work for an undisclosed sum.The painting — which embodies the “new world order” promoted by the Suprematist movement — resided at Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum before being returned to the artist’s heirs in 2008.The evening also produced a few surprises. “Les Poissardes Melancoliques,” by the Belgian painter James Ensor, sold for $7 million, well over the $5 million high estimate.The auction house was also buoyed by its day sale of Taubman Modern and Contemporary Art, which totaled $42.7 million with fees, in which more than half of the lots sold above their high estimates. At that sale, a Richard Gerstl portrait bought for the Neue Galerie by Ronald Lauder sold for $3.7 million, four times the high estimate.Based on the day sale, in combination with Wednesday night’s $377 million — and the value of unsold items that Sotheby’s expects to sell and a few pieces that will be in other sales (including a 3,000-year-old monumental Egyptian figure of Sekhmet that formerly belonged to John Lennon) — Sotheby’s is projecting it will cover its guarantee.Whether the auction house can meet this goal — much less hope to make any profit — remains to be seen. But Simon Shaw, Sotheby’s co-head of Impressionist and Modern Art Worldwide, said Thursday’s sale “puts us absolutely on target.”Advertisement
