The lights at the Kit Kat Club will dim for good this spring, but at least one of the beautiful people is sticking around slightly longer than expected. Producers are set to announce on Monday that the Roundabout Theater’s production of “Cabaret” at Studio 54 will close March 29, a little more than a year after it opened for an initial 24-week engagement. Additionally, Emma Stone will continue her role as Sally Bowles through Feb. 15, extending her run by two weeks.The closing date corresponds with Alan Cumming’s commitment to the role as M.C. The Cumming-Stone combination has brought in the best ticket sales since the show opened March 21, breaking the million-dollar mark for the first time over Christmas. Since Ms. Stone took over the role from Michelle Williams in November, audience capacity has averaged more than 95 percent. Ms. Stone’s replacement is expected to be announced within the next few weeks. A version of this article appears in print on 01/06/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Cabaret’ to Close At End of March.
