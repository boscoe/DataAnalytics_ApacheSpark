The Italian police have exposed what they say is a scam at the Fiumicino airport in Rome, and charged two workers with stealing valuable paintings.The airport employees were accused of pilfering two works by Ugo Attardi and Renato Guttuso – both well-known 20th-century Italian painters – valued at more than 50,000 euros, or about $55,000. But initial investigations hint at a much bigger operation involving several employees at Rome’s main hub bent on stealing artworks to sell on the black market.The paintings were taken when they were checked through the oversize-baggage area.“Dressed in the uniforms they normally wore to work in the airport, they easily convinced people that they were providing a genuine service and managed to dupe them,” the police said in a statement. The airport police said airport employees – including cleaners and customer service workers – were involved in what they described as a “well-structured system” to defraud passengers.Indeed, other paintings were found in the possession of members of the airport’s cleaning staff, and investigations are underway “to track down the legitimate owners,” the police said. “We are re-examining past reports of missing objects,” Tiziano Vetro, the director of Fiumicino’s airport police, added.
