The number of Tony Award nominations for Broadway actors, directors and choreographers is set to grow under rules changes approved on Thursday, according to a statement released by the Tony administration committee that oversees the annual theater honors. The committee is made up of many Broadway producers, theater owners and artists who could benefit from the additional nominations.Most notably, as many as seven performers could now be nominated in a single acting category, instead of five performers, the number in recent years. The changes will benefit actors when there are tie votes during the nomination process.Tony nominations are decided each year by secret ballot during a closed-door meeting of a special panel of writers, designers, actors and other theater veterans. At the 2014 meeting, there were reportedly a number of ties for the fifth nomination in acting categories, leading to more rounds of voting.According to the administration committee’s statement on Thursday, in the event of a two-way or three-way tie for the last slot of nominations in any acting category, both or all three of the tied actors or actresses will receive nominations.The committee also decided that if there are at least seven eligible candidates for nominations for best direction of a play or best direction of a musical, the number of nominees will increase to five from four. Similarly, if there are at least seven eligible contenders for best choreography, the numbers of nominees will rise to five from four. Most theater seasons have at least seven directors and choreographers who are eligible for nominations in their respective categories.The rules changes take effect with the current 2014-15 season.Most of the administration committee’s members are currently working on Broadway and will have financial and artistic stakes in additional Tony nominations. Producers, for example, may benefit because they tend to trumpet their tallies of nominations on their theater marquees and advertising campaigns, which can help generate ticket sales.At the same time, the rules change for acting nominations provides flexibility so that no actor loses out on a nomination because of a tie vote.The committee’s statement did not provide the reasoning behind the rules changes or indicate whether there were split votes within the panel. Several committee members did not immediately return phone messages on Thursday.In other rules, the committee decided that Erin Davie and Emily Padgett, who starred as conjoined twin sisters in the recent musical revival of “Side Show,” would each be eligible for a best actress nomination. For the original production of “Side Show,” during the 1997-98 season, Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner received a joint nomination for best actress for playing the sisters.The Tony nominations will be announced on April 28; the winners will be revealed at the nationally broadcast Tonys ceremony on June 7.A version of this article appears in print on 01/17/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Changes May Swell Tony Nominations.
