Don’t think of it as losing an Elina. Think of it as gaining an Anna.Elina Garanca, the Latvian mezzo-soprano, has withdrawn from a concert she planned to sing Sunday with the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, citing illness, the Met announced Thursday. But the Met has found a high-wattage substitute: Anna Netrebko, the Russian diva.Ms. Netrebko will sing the “Song to the Moon” from Dvořák’s “Rusalka” and Richard Strauss’s “Cäcilie,” rather than the originally planned “Seven Early Songs” by Berg. The rest of the program, which is to be conducted by James Levine, will remain unchanged: Beethoven’s Symphony No. 2, Carter’s “Three Illusions,” and Schumann’s Symphony No. 2.Ms. Garanca plans to sing the title role in Bizet’s “Carmen” on Friday night as scheduled, but the Met said that she had been unable to take on the additional commitment of rehearsing and performing in this weekend’s concert because she had been recovering from the flu.Ms. Netrebko is currently at the Met singing the title role in Tchaikovsky’s “Iolanta,” where her curtain call at the premiere performance was interrupted by a pro-Ukrainian protester who jumped on the stage with a sign criticizing her and the conductor, Valery Gergiev, for their ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.A version of this article appears in print on 02/06/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Quite a Pinch-Singer Coming Off the Bench.
