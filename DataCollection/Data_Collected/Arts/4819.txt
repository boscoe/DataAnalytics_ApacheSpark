PARIS — What do Victor Hugo, Saul Steinberg of New Yorker cover fame and Kiki Smith, the American feminist artist, have in common?All three have drawings on display at the Halle Saint Pierre, a museum on the southern slope of Montmartre that is celebrating the art of drawing by 67 artists, illustrators, cartoonists and virtual unknowns from different eras, cultures, walks of life and states of mental health.Called “Les Cahiers Dessinés,” or Drawing Notebooks, the exhibition, which comprises about 600 works and runs until Aug. 14,  sweeps through the multiple worlds of people, famous and obscure, who expressed themselves with whatever means they had on hand — pen, pencil, ink, paint, and even a mix of soot and saliva, in the case of the American artist James Castle,  born deaf and maybe autistic, who drew haunting scenes from his Idaho childhood.Frédéric Pajak,  a publisher and the curator of the exhibit, said he believed that everyone knows how to draw, or at least they did as children before they turned to other forms of communication. His goal, he said, is to show how artists find a language to describe their reality.Advertisement“There are as many ways to draw as there are people who draw,” he said in an interview in the museum cafe.AdvertisementSpread over two levels of a museum that was once a covered market, the collection starts on the ground floor with Hugo — whose rarely seen drawings range from evocative scenes of rural France to satirical caricatures — and ends on the mezzanine with a tribute to 20th-century cartoons.Although cartoonists from the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo (and its predecessor Hara-Kiri)  are represented, Mr. Pajak avoided the “opportunism” of a last-minute addition of works by those murdered in the Jan. 7 terror attack that made the newspaper famous worldwide.Other cartoonists include Sempé, a French institution with his Thurber-like characters and empty urban landscapes; Siné, with his raunchy women; the Swiss artist Noyau with his gentle mockery of museumgoers; and El Roto, famous for his daily cartoons in El País, the Spanish newspaper.But it is in the darkness of the ground-floor gallery where visitors can explore the methods and the vision of such well-known artists as Hugo, Steinberg and Ms. Smith, as well as the Belgian painter Pierre Alechinsky,  who wrote with his right hand and drew semi-abstract figures with his left; the Polish-Jewish writer and artist Bruno Schulz,  murdered by the Nazis in 1942, whose tortured dreams provided him with scenes of idolatry and fetishism; and the French artist Roland Topor,  who let his imagination loose on the human body.Then there are drawings by artists who lived on the edge of society and, in some cases, of sanity. Their presence here is in keeping with the “art brut,” or outsider art, that has put the Halle Saint Pierre on the map of the Paris art scene. There are examples of the fantastical hybrid creatures that inhabited the world of Unica Zürn, who was born in Germany and moved to Paris in the 1950s and mingled with Surrealist artists between bouts at a psychiatric hospital before committing suicide in 1970.And there are the minutely drawn etchings of the French cathedral town of Bourges by Marcel Bascoulard,  a “clochard” who lived on the street and dressed in women’s clothes until his murder by unknown assailants in 1978. Bascoulard’s virtuoso work — which includes streetscapes empty of cars and people — won wider recognition only last year in a book published by Mr. Pajak.“The myth of ‘outsider art’ is that these artists are cut off from the world,” said Martine Lusardy,  the director of the Halle Saint Pierre. “But they are not cut off. Their illness made them see the world in a different way.”What struck Raphaèle Bernard-Bacot,  a Parisian artist visiting the museum, was “the power and the freedom” that drove many of the artists to “throw themselves body and soul into their drawing with the simple tools of a schoolchild.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
