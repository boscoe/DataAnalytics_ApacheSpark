The philosopher Isaiah Berlin once described David Hume’s idea of the self as a pure fiction, “a name for the concatenation of experiences out of which human personality and human history were formed, simply a kind of string which held together the onions, except that there was no string.” For decades, the artist and filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson has been playing with this un-string, which technology has rendered all the more evanescent. Starting Thursday, a broad sweep of her unsettling work will inaugurate Bridget Donahue, a new gallery on the Lower East Side being opened by a longtime director at Gavin Brown’s Enterprise, the West Village gallery. Ms. Donahue said she had been drawn to Ms. Hershman Leeson as a kind of prophet of “our cybernetic condition,” through early interactive works that delved into artificial intelligence and surveillance and yearslong performances that blurred the line between acting and life. The show, “Origins of the Species,” through April 5, will span from the late 1960s to recent work exploring the implications of genetic manipulation.
