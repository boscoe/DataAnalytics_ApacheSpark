Two of the country’s most significant summer jazz festivals have announced their lineups: the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival.The New Orleans festival, which has long been only partly focused on jazz per se, alongside pop, gospel, and the deep Louisiana culture of brass bands, zydeco and R&B, will run across two non-repeating weekends on April 24-26 and April 30-May 3. Its headliners include Elton John, the Who, the new partnership of Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, No Doubt, Keith Urban, Widespread Panic, Alison Krauss  and Union Station, John Legend, Jerry Lee Lewis and Pitbull. Further down the card are the jazz singers Cassandra Wilson and Cécile McLorin Salvant, the saxophonist Charles Lloyd’s quartet, the new electric band led by the trumpeter Terence Blanchard, the gospel singers John P. Kee and Kierra Sheard, and dozens more. See nojazzfest.com for more information and tickets.The Newport Festival lineup was announced by its longtime producer, George Wein. It will take place July 31 to August 2, at its usual spot in Fort Adams State Park. Following the successful example set by its 60th edition last year, it will devote much of the first day to what the festival calls emerging artists, including Matana Roberts, Kneebody, John Hollenbeck, Johnathan Blake, and Peter Evans. The rest of the weekend’s highlights include Ms. Wilson and Ms. Salvant, as well as the singers Jose James and Jamie Cullum; Dr. John; Arturo O’Farrill’s Latin Jazz Orchestra, with the saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa as guest soloist; and new repertory projects by the saxophonist James Carter (about the music of Don Byas) and the trombonist Conrad Herwig (about the music of Horace Silver, with a group including the pianist Michel Camilo.)
