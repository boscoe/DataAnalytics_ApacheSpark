Even before Dewey Finn, the slovenly but well-intentioned substitute music teacher of “School of Rock,” arrives on Broadway, Andrew Lloyd Webber is giving students the opportunity to bring him to their theaters and auditoriums. On Monday, Mr. Lloyd Webber, the composer of the coming stage show based on that 2003 Jack Black movie comedy, and the licensing company R&H Theatricals, said that they would take the unusual step of granting rights for youth performances of the “School of Rock” musical prior to its Broadway opening later this year.“This musical is entirely about empowering kids to rock out, so what better way to herald its arrival and celebrate its themes than to allow youth performances from coast to coast,” Mr. Lloyd Webber said in a statement. “This will allow young fans to engage with the material in a much deeper way, and we think will only heighten enthusiasm for our Broadway premiere.”“School of Rock” tells the story of a struggling musician who becomes an unexpected source of inspiration to a class of overscheduled prep-school students. The Broadway musical (which is directed by Laurence Connor, and has lyrics by Glenn Slater and a book by Julian Fellowes) stars Alex Brightman as Dewey Finn and features a cast of student musicians. It is scheduled to begin previews at the Winter Garden Theater on Nov. 9 and open Dec. 6.Press representatives for “School of Rock” said in a news release that applications for youth performances would be accepted immediately, and that scripts and musical scores for these productions would be sent out in January.A version of this article appears in print on 10/13/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: School Kids Can Rock With u2018School of Rocku2019.
