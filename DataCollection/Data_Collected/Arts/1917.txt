The director Michael Haneke will shoot “Happy End,” a new movie that grapples with immigration issues, this spring in the Calais region of northern France, Agence France-Presse reported Wednesday.The area in and around Calais has become a flashpoint in the refugee crisis, in large part because of a sizable refugee camp there known as ‘‘the jungle.”The local paper La Voix du Nord first reported news of the film. A spokeswoman for the organization Pictanovo, which helps finance locally shot movies, confirmed it to A.F.P. on Wednesday. The Pictanovo spokeswoman told Agence France-Presse that immigration was not the main subject of the film, but that the issue was “evoked” and “integrated” into the film’s plot.Mr. Haneke’s 2005 film “Caché” focuses on the relationship between a bourgeois Parisian couple and Majid, an acquaintance of Algerian descent, who they believe is leaving threatening surveillance tapes at their home. His 2012 film, “Amour,” about an aging French couple reckoning with their mortality, won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film.A version of this article appears in print on 12/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Haneke Shooting Film in French Refugee Zone.
