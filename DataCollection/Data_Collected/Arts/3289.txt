The San Diego Opera, which is reinventing itself as a streamlined, more affordable company after nearly folding last year because of  money troubles, announced Wednesday that its next general director would be someone who has shown that opera can succeed on a smaller scale: David Bennett, the executive director of Gotham Chamber Opera in New York.In announcing Mr. Bennett’s appointment, the San Diego Opera said that while it would continue to present grand opera at the Civic Theater, it would also explore offering smaller works in unique venues around San Diego — much as Gotham Chamber Opera has done in New York, where it has staged operas in museums, a botanic garden, a planetarium and a nightclub. It will be a new direction for San Diego, whose old model of mounting large-scale productions with big stars grew expensive in an era of struggles attracting audiences and donors.Mr. Bennett said in a statement that he was eager “to build upon the company’s tradition of presenting grand opera, while exploring new ways to increase its impact within the San Diego region and beyond.”Gotham Chamber Opera, whose next production — “The Tempest Songbook,” combining songs by Kaija Saariaho from 2004 with 17th-century music attributed to Henry Purcell — will have its premiere March 27 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said that it would conduct a nationwide search to replace Mr. Bennett, who has been with the company since 2006.A version of this article appears in print on 03/13/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New General Director at San Diego Opera.
