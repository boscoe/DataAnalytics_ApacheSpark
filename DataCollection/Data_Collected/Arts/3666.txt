A sequel to the film “Super Troopers” is in the works, thanks to a highly successful crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo that hit its  $2 million goal in just over 24 hours. The original 2002 film was produced by the Broken Lizard comedy troupe and became a cult classic after its release. The film starred the five Broken Lizard members, including director Jay Chandrasekhar, as  freewheeling Vermont state troopers. Broken Lizard needed to raise $2 million in order to get the go ahead from Fox Searchlight Pictures. As of Thursday afternoon, the total was $2.5 million and rising. The group intends to start shooting this summer. “We always knew ‘Super Troopers’ had a pretty broad, grass-roots following,” said Broken Lizard member and “Super Troopers” actor Kevin Heffernan in a statement to The Times.  “I’ve officially started growing my mustache.”Last year, the “Veronica Mars” film began with $5.7 million raised in a record-breaking crowd-funded campaign on Kickstarter.
