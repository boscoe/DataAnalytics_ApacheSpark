Honoring a half-century of Grateful Dead music, the band’s four surviving members will reunite for three shows this summer in what is being billed as their final performance together.“Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of Grateful Dead” will take over Soldier Field in Chicago on July 3 through 5, featuring the core four — Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir — along with special guests including Trey Anastasio of Phish, the jazz keyboardist Jeff Chimenti and Bruce Hornsby on piano. In keeping with Grateful Dead’s tradition of maximizing the music, the band will perform two sets each night. The show also commemorates the 20th anniversary of the last Grateful Dead show featuring Jerry Garcia, which took place July 9, 1995, also at Soldier Field, before the bandleader’s death a month later. “It is with respect and gratitude that we reconvene the Dead one last time to celebrate — not merely the band’s legacy, but also the community that we’ve been playing to, and with, for 50 years,” Mr. Lesh, the band’s bass player, said in a statement. “Wave that flag, wave it wide and high.”Mr. Weir added, “Lookin’ forward to this one, oh boy, you bet.”As a throwback to the old days, tickets will be available first through the mail-order Grateful Dead Ticketing Service starting Jan. 20, with online sales to follow in February.
