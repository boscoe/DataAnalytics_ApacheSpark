Tris tripped on a glass slipper.Arriving in 3,875 locations in North America, including 356 Imax theaters, the post-apocalyptic sequel “The Divergent Series: Insurgent” — starring Shailene Woodley as the gun-wielding rebel Tris Prior — took in an estimated $54 million over the weekend, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. That total easily made “Insurgent” the No. 1 movie in the land.But the results came with a tinge of industry disappointment. Studios (and Wall Street) typically expect sequels to improve on the box-office performance of their series predecessors, and the opening for “Insurgent” was flat compared with the one for “Divergent” last year. Unlike the first movie, “Insurgent” was also released in 3-D, which should bolster grosses because those tickets cost more.Moreover, “Insurgent” was backed by a much-improved marketing campaign, analysts said, and cost about $25 million more to make than “Divergent.”The likely culprit was “Cinderella,” which went after a similar female audience. “Cinderella” (Disney) took in a strong $34.5 million in its second weekend, for a new domestic total of about $122 million. Analysts noted that “Insurgent” may also have battled some post-apocalyptic fatigue; the last “Hunger Games” movie, which has similar themes, also posted a lower-than-expected opening.The good news for Lionsgate: “Insurgent” took in an additional $47 million overseas, with many important markets delivering significant growth. Compared with the opening for “Divergent” last year, ticket sales for “Insurgent” soared in the Britain, Brazil, France and Mexico, among other countries.A version of this article appears in print on 03/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘Insurgent’ Easily Wins Box Office Weekend.
