LONDON — The Conservatives have won; David Cameron has been called to see the Queen before forming a new government. That happened on Friday morning here, and was to happen again onstage Friday evening in a hot-off-the-press new scene in “The Audience,” which offers a fictional account of the meetings between Queen Elizabeth II and her prime ministers over the 63 years of her reign.“In the same week as we opened ‘The Audience’ it’s been particularly interesting to have experienced such a dramatic general election,” the playwright, Peter Morgan, said in a statement. He added that Kristin Scott Thomas, who is playing the Queen, and Mark Dexter, playing Mr. Cameron, would be rehearsing the new dialogue in the afternoon. Ms. Scott Thomas told the BBC this week that the prospect of learning a new scene on the day of performance was “a little nerve-racking.”The original production, which opened in the West End in 2013, with Helen Mirren, who is currently starring in the show on Broadway, had already been modified for the new London run, Mr. Morgan said, with the character of James Callaghan replaced by Tony Blair.A version of this article appears in print on 05/09/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Art Imitates Life: New ‘Audience’ Scene.
