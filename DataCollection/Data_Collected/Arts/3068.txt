He doesn’t come to New York often, and he comes to Roulette this week with a special new group, the Renga Ensemble, playing from a careful, bracing, provocative album, “The Room Is” (Allos Documents). It’s a set of pieces written for six clarinetists in a circle, with no rhythm section; it was inspired by renga, a centuries-old Japanese form of collaborative poetry, with a protocol to weave together individual voices into a coherent whole. The musicians on the record, and in the concert on Wednesday, are high-powered improvisers: Aside from Mr. Falzone, there’s Ned Rothenberg, Ken Vandermark, Keefe Jackson, Jason Stein and Ben Goldberg. Within the design of the compositions, each will get his say. (8 p.m., 509 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn, roulette.org.) Advertisement
