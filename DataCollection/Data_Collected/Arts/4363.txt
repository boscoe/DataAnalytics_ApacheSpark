59E59 Theaters announced its next season’s lineup, which includes six new short plays adapted from Tennessee Williams short stories. Pulitzer Prize-winner Beth Henley, PEN/Laura Pels Award-winner Marcus Gardley, and other playwrights have signed on to adapt Williams’s works for productions starting in August. Among the stories being adapted are “The Resemblance Between a Violin Case and a Coffin” (Henley), “Oriflamme” (David Grimm), and “Portrait of a Girl in Glass” (John Guare), which Williams reworked into “The Glass Menagerie.” Three other plays were announced, including Yussef El Guindi’s “Threesome,” which will arrive in July after a run at Portland Center Stage in Oregon, and Lauren Gunderson’s “I and You,” which comes from Massachusetts’ Merrimack Repertory Theater and will begin in January 2016.Additional information can be found at 59e59.org.
