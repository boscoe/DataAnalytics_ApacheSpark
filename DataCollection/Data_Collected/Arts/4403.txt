The Marquis de Lafayette paid a call at the New-York Historical Society in 1824, as part of a triumphant return trip to the country he had first visited as a 19-year-old soldier eager to help with the cause of American independence.Now, some two centuries later, the “French founding father” will be making a second visit to the society, after a fashion, trailed by a full-scale, seaworthy replica of his trusted ship the Hermione. “Lafayette’s Return: The ‘Boy General,’ the American Revolution and the Hermione,” an exhibition that will be on view at the historical society from May 29 through Aug. 16, will commemorate the marquis’s contributions with a display of objects from the society’s collection as well as a number from La Grange, Lafayette’s chateau, that have never been displayed outside France. In conjunction, a replica of the Hermione that set sail from France on April 18 is scheduled to stop at Governors Island over the July 4 weekend, as part of a recreation of Lafayette’s two-month 3,819-mile journey to America in 1780, when he returned with crucial military aid. Objects in the show include the ceremonial sword Lafayette received from the Continental Congress, an invitation to one of his Paris dinner parties addressed to Benjamin Franklin, coded letters he shared  with George Washington and a 1774 letter in halting English from Lafayette’s daughter Anastasia, beginning: “Dear Washington, I hope that papa whill come back son here.  I am verry sorry for the loss of him,  but I am very glade for you self.” A smaller exhibition on Governors Island, organized by participants in the society’s student historians program, will highlight the island’s use by both British and Continental forces during the revolution.A version of this article appears in print on 05/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Historical Society To Offer Lafayette Show.
