AdvertisementSupported byDanceBy Jack AndersonAlthough only one of the two groups sharing the Joyce this week has “etc.” in its name, both Bodytraffic and Doug Elkins Choreography, Etc. could be called et cetera companies. In their productions, a range of dance and musical forms are added to one another in theatrically rich mixtures.Bodytraffic’s triple-bill includes Hofesh Shechter’s “Dust,” which unites modern dance with earthy movement; Victor Quijada’s “Once again, before you go,” which blends ballet and break dancing; and Richard Siegal’s jazzily nonchalant “The New 45.” Mr. Elkins offers “Hapless Bizarre,” an intersection of comedy, romance and vaudeville, and “Mo(or)town/Redux,” a commentary to Motown music on both “Othello” and José Limón’s “Moor’s Pavane,” a dance version of “Othello” that reduces Shakespeare’s cast to four dancers and a handkerchief. (Tuesday through Jan. 11; 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org.)Advertisement
