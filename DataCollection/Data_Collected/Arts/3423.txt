To honor that anniversary, Shen Wei Dance Arts returns to Durham, N.C., this summer to premiere “Untitled #12-2,” one of 11 commissions that compose the 82nd annual season of the festival, which runs from June 11 to July 25. Mr. Shen’s new work, inspired by his paintings at Art Basel Miami, is paired with a reimagined version of his 2005 work “Map” (June 11-13). Other headliners will include the festival staples Pilobolus, which will introduce “Thresh|Hold,” a world-premiere collaboration with the Venezuelan choreographer Javier de Frutos (June 18-20); and the newly renamed Paul Taylor’s American Modern Dance, bringing classics from Mr. Taylor’s six-decade career (July 2-4). As usual, the festival will feature work by North Carolina choreographers, like Kristen Jeppsen Groves and Karola Lüttringhaus, who are tackling political and social issues (June 25), and spotlight dance in cinema with the International Screendance Festival, on four consecutive Sundays, starting June 28.Advertisement
