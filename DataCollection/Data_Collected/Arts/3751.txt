That may also describe Liz Gerring’s “glacier,” as presented by her Liz Gerring Dance Company. Neither a choreographic travelogue nor a geological survey, Ms. Gerring’s abstract dance demands cool passion of its eight dancers, requiring them to move with unbroken stamina but often at a far from glacial pace. Although it has nothing to do with ice and snow, “glacier” may nonetheless convey a sense of an awesome territory. Ms. Gerring has said that one of her inspirations was a memory of a visit to the vast North Dakota prairie where her mother grew up. Michael J. Schumacher’s taped score combines instruments like guitar, harp, cello, clarinet, recorder and piano with natural sounds recorded during a residency at Glacier Lake in Colorado. (Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea; 212-242-0800, joyce.org.)Advertisement
