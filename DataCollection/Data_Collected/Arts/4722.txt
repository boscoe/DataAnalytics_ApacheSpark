Poorna Jagannathan, foreground, and Japjit Kaur in a scene from Yael Farber’s play in which Indian women describe their experiences of abuse. The show runs through Sunday at the Culture Project.This week’s video features an excerpt from Yael Farber’s “Nirbhaya,” a documentary drama that recounts of the story of Jyoti Singh Pandey, a 23-year-old Indian woman who was subjected to a brutal gang rape on a bus in New Delhi two years ago that subsequently led to her death. The show includes personal testimonies from the cast members — all of whom are survivors of sexual violence. In this scene, Japjit Kaur, rear, plays the deceased Pandey, as Poorna Jagannathan recalls the moments after she learned of the attack on the young woman.  “Nirbhaya,” Hindi for fearless and the name by which Ms. Pandey is best known, continues through Sunday at the Culture Project.Recent theater videos in this series include Peter Sarsgaard as the title character in “Hamlet,” and Renée Fleming and Douglas Sills in a scene from the comedy “Living on Love.”Coming soon: Songs from Sierra Boggess of “It Shoulda Been You” and Ruthie Ann Miles of “The King and I.”
