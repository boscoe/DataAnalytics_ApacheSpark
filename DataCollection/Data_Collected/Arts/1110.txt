The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Museum of Contemporary  Art in Chicago are to hold an extensive two-city exhibition, “Merce Cunningham: Common Time,” opening in February 2017, the museums announced on Tuesday. The Walker — which has all the sets and costumes that once belonged to the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, including items designed by Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol — is organizing both shows. It investigates Cunningham’s groundbreaking practice and multidisciplinary collaborations. The exhibitions will occur simultaneously in the museums, as parallel presentations. This corresponds to some of the Cunningham company’s Event performances in which audiences had to move about to see all the dancing on two or more different stages. Film and video installations by Charles Atlas, Nam June Paik, Stan VanDerBeek and Tacita Dean will play an important part; and Cunningham music (by David Behrman, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Takehisa Kosugi, Pauline Oliveros and David Tudor) will be played in listening rooms. Live performance will be another important element. Cunningham choreography will be danced by international touring companies, including France’s Ballet de Lorraine, and, in short-form in-gallery Cunningham Events, a small ensemble of former Cunningham dancers. Among them are Dylan Crossman, Silas Riener, Jamie Scott and Melissa Toogood. Related commissions will include new works by Rashaun Mitchell and Mr. Riener (both dancers who created roles in Cunningham’s final company) in collaboration with Charles Atlas; other new works will be by contemporary choreographers Beth Gill and Maria Hassabi. Fionn Meade, the Walker Art Center’s artistic director, is the lead curator; he is assisted by Philip Bither, director and senior curator of performing arts at the Walker.
