NBC’s television movie “Coat of Many Colors” drew 12.8 million viewers on Thursday night, lifting NBC to the highest viewership of any network for the night.TV movies have become something of an anachronism but this was an important pet project of Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC. The movie is about Dolly Parton as a young girl — and the back story to one of her most famous songs — and Mr. Greenblatt wanted the movie to air in December, part of a broader strategy for the network, which has placed an emphasis on holiday or family-centric specials for the month.There are signs that the strategy is working. “The Wiz Live!” brought in 11.5 million viewers last week, providing NBC its biggest non-football related viewership since September.  “Coat of Many Colors” represents NBC’s most-viewed scripted show since the “Saturday Night Live” 40th anniversary special in February.
