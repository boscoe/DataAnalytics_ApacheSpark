“Night and Fog,” a 1955 Holocaust documentary that caused an uproar at the Cannes Film Festival in 1956, has been released for the first time on DVD in Germany.The 30-minute film, by the French director Alain Resnais, blends color footage of abandoned concentration camps with archival film reels, tracking the rise of the Nazi Party and the liberation of the camps. Resnais used previously unseen footage from archives across Europe to create the movie. It features a voiceover that blends lyrical commentary with German history (the script was written by the French poet Jean Cayrol).Absolut Medien released the film on Oct. 30, in association with the Franco-German media group ARTE. The DVD is available on German Amazon.“Night and Fog” was originally slated to open as part of the Cannes Film Festival’s main program, but was removed from the competition lineup after the West German Embassy in France complained about its inclusion, citing fears that the work would tarnish viewers’ feelings about Germany. After the festival removed the movie from its lineup it was screened outside of the official competition.The decision to remove the movie caused an outcry over censorship in both the French and international press. It had a commercial release in Paris that year, and also appeared at the Berlin Film Festival. The movie has become a mainstay in German history classes, but has rarely been shown in German movie theaters, according to Der Spiegel.A version of this article appears in print on 11/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: 1955 Holocaust Film Gets DVD Release in Germany.
