Following a dispute that veered uncomfortably close to performance art, Jay Z and Marina Abramovic have settled their beef.The trouble between the rapper and the artist started when Ms. Abramovic told the art magazine Spike this week that her involvement in Jay Z’s 2013 video for “Picasso Baby,” an homage to her work “The Artist Is Present,” was “a one-way transaction.” (For his version of the piece, Jay Z performed the song, in which he raps about collecting contemporary art, for six hours straight at the Pace Gallery in Chelsea; Ms. Abramovic made a cameo.)Ms. Abramovic told Spike she was angry, “since he adapted my work only under one condition: that he would help my institute. Which he didn’t. Then he just completely used me. And that wasn’t fair.”But in a statement on Wednesday, the Marina Abramovic Institute in Hudson, N.Y., clarified that Jay Z had donated after all. “Marina Abramovic was not informed of Shawn ‘Jay Z’ Carter’s donation from two years ago when she recently did an interview with Spike Magazine in Brazil,” the statement said. “We are sincerely sorry to both Marina Abramovic and Shawn ‘Jay Z’ Carter for this, and since then we have taken to appropriate actions to reconcile this matter.”The apology came after Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn, a gallerist and art advisor for Jay Z, read his receipt from the Institute aloud over the phone to Artnet news, confirming a “generous” gift. “Thank you for your donation,” the receipt said.A version of this article appears in print on 05/22/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Jay Z and Abramovic: Everything Cool Now.
