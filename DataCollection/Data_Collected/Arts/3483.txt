“Hamilton,” the buzzy musical biography of an American founding father, is off to a strong start at the Broadway box office.The show, which concludes a sold-out Off Broadway run at the Public Theater on May 4, has sold $6.5 million worth of tickets in its first 11 days of Broadway availability, and has orders from groups for another $4 million worth of seats, according to Jeffrey Seller, its lead producer.Created by and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, the musical uses hip-hop music and a largely nonwhite cast to explore American history through a contemporary lens.It has broken box office records at the Public, where it began performances on Jan. 20, opened Feb. 17, and has been extended three times.But instead of rushing to Broadway before this season’s Tony Awards deadline, producers decided to wait and open in the summer, allowing time for the show to be revised but risking a loss of momentum.Whether the box office returns will quiet doubters, or simply demonstrate the passion of loyal theatergoers wanting to see a critically acclaimed show, remains to to be seen.But Mr. Seller knows what he thinks.“Every so often a show comes around that everybody wants to see,” Mr. Seller said. “This show is striking a chord.”“Hamilton” is scheduled to begin Broadway performances on July 13 at the Richard Rodgers Theater, and to open on Aug. 6.
