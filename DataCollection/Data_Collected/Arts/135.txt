LOS ANGELES â€” The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has delayed the planned opening of its movie museum until the spring of 2018, nearly a year later than expected, a spokeswoman for the museum confirmed on Wednesday. The delay was initially reported in The Hollywood Reporter. The delay was caused, in part, because the Academy spent months negotiating with a community group, Fix the City, over changes to plans for the museum, which will be built in the mid-Wilshire Blvd. area of Los Angeles. In early September, representatives for the Academy and Fix the City reached an agreement over traffic, signs and other issues. On Wednesday, the museum spokeswoman also confirmed that the Academy had increased its fund-raising goal for the museum to $388 million from $300 million. Much of the additional money is to be spent on exhibits and programming, The Hollywood Reporter said.A version of this article appears in print on 10/08/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Movie Academy Museum Delays Opening to 2018.
