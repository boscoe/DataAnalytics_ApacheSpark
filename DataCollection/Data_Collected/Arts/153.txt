Every year, the Armory Show — a giant, international art fair held along two West Side piers —  features a section on Pier 94 that spotlights a different geographical region. During this year’s fair, which runs from March 3 to March 6, the  so-called Armory Focus looks at art from a contemporary African perspective, highlighting the work of Kapwani Kiwanga as its 2016 Commissioned Artist.Appointed by the Focus curators, Julia Grosse and Yvette Mutumba, Ms. Kiwanga will produce an on-site commissioned project, help design the fair’s catalog and make a limited edition artwork with the proceeds going to the Museum of Modern Art.Born in Hamilton, Ontario, and based in Paris, Ms. Kiwanga is a trained anthropologist and social scientist who works in video, sound and performance. Her art explores subjects like Afrofuturism, the anticolonial struggle and African astronomy.On her “Afrogalactica” trilogy, which started in 2011 and is ongoing, Ms. Kiwanga invented and occupies the character of an anthropologist from the future who explores across vast fields of knowledge.In her solo exhibition “Maji Maji” at Jeu de Paume, Paris last year, Ms. Kiwanga revisited the historical account of the Maji Maji War (1905-1907), one of the largest uprisings in the 20th century on the African continent.A version of this article appears in print on 10/10/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Artist Named for Armory Show.
