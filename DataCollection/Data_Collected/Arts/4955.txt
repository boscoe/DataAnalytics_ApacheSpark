TLC has pulled the popular reality show “19 Kids and Counting” from its lineup, following allegations that one of the show’s stars, Josh Duggar, had previously been investigated on suspicion of molesting several minors. “We are deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and victims at this difficult time,” the network said in a statement. It was not immediately clear if the show, which has been on the air for seven years and is one of TLC’s top performers, was canceled or simply going on hiatus. The network declined to comment further. The magazine In Touch reported this week that Mr. Duggar, 27, had been accused of sexual molesting young girls going back several years.“Twelve years ago, as a young teenager I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret,” Mr. Duggar wrote in a Facebook message Thursday. “I hurt others, including my family and close friends.” Last year, another hit TLC show, “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,” was canceled after it was reported that the show’s matriarch, June Shannon, dated a registered sex offender who had served time in prison for child molestation. In canceling that show, TLC said in a statement that it was “faithfully committed to the children’s ongoing comfort and well-being.”A version of this article appears in print on 05/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: ‘19 Kids and Counting’ Is Removed From TLC.
