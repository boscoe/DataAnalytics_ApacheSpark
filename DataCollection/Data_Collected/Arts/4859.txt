They don’t make bands like TV on the Radio anymore — that’s a cliché, and true, and was equally true in the mid-2000s, when the group burst out of Williamsburg with a howl and a shriek and more clatter than all its neighborhood peers combined. The idea of this group as a going concern is looking increasingly slim — last year it released “Seeds,” its fifth studio album, though the members have been pursuing individual projects.But the one place you wouldn’t know that the band is a sometime thing is onstage, where Tunde Adebimpe shakes with savage energy and the rest of the group applies a 1970s sense of scale to microscopically detailed 2000s rock. TV on the Radio plays twice this week: Skip the Manhattan show Thursday at the unforgiving Terminal 5 and head to Brooklyn to see the group on a stage worthy of its ambition, on Wednesday at the recently renovated Kings Theater.(1027 Flatbush Avenue, 800-745-3000, kingstheatre.com; 610 West 56th Street, 212-582-6600, terminal5nyc.com.)A version of this article appears in print on May 17, 2015, on Page AR6 of the New York edition with the headline: Pop; Artisanal Rock, Locally Produced.
