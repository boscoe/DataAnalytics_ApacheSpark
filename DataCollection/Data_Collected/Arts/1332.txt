As New York mysteries go, it hardly competes with “Who’s buried in Grant’s tomb?” or “How many pigeons live in the five boroughs?” But for devotees of the New York Public Library, the question of how many books can be stored in the majestic central stacks on Fifth Avenue is far from academic. They say it goes to the heart of the library’s mission to keep as many research books as possible within arm’s reach of scholars.In just the past decade, vexingly different figures have been reported — 1.8 million in The New York Times in 2009,  four million by The Associated Press in 2013. The library and its current president, Anthony W. Marx, seemed content until two years ago to put the number at about three million, although the figure of 3.5 million had long been used, and appears in the lead paragraph of a Times article from Oct. 1, 1905. (Puzzlingly, the headline says 4.5 million.)So there were many raised eyebrows in March when the library put forth what it now views as the definitive tally of books long shelved in the 1911 building’s seven underground stories of steel stacks: 2.5 million. That figure was met with scorn by those most fiercely critical of the library’s leadership.“It has been very hard to get a handle on the real number of books because the library has never been clear or transparent,” said Charles D. Warren, an architect and president of the Committee to Save the New York Public Library. AdvertisementMr. Warren and fellow critics of the library’s management say the question of numbers has been deeply muddled since officials quietly removed all the research books from the central stacks in 2013. It was part of a plan, since abandoned, to tear out the famous shelving — which Mr. Marx and others had deemed outdated — and devote some of that space to new public amenities.AdvertisementThey say the actual number is most likely higher than 2.5 million, and that the library’s figure understates the capacity of the stacks, which, Mr. Warren added, “has been solidly asserted to be 3.5 million.”The library insists that there is no great mystery behind the 2.5 million number. It was calculated, officials say, as the books were inventoried and bar coded before being sent into temporary storage. Before that tally, they said, there had never been an exact count of the research books held in the central stacks, only estimates.“Shelving capacity varies greatly, due to the size of the materials shelved and the classification system used,” the library’s coordinator of collection assessment and humanities, Jason Baumann, said in an email. “The stacks had thousands of ‘triple-over-sized’ materials, books two feet high and taller, that greatly affected shelving capacity. Thanks to the bar coding project, we were able to have much more accurate counts of the collections than ever before.”
                We followed “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” as it journeyed through the New York Public Library system.            Library officials and critics like Mr. Warren have long been at loggerheads over the system’s future, so it is hardly surprising that they would disagree over how many books were removed from the old shelves. To skeptics, the secrecy with which the library operated when it removed the books and spent $9 million on an ill-fated architectural plan for the 42nd Street site, known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, continues to rankle.“The lack of transparency in the design and initial execution of the library plan was so blatant that it is difficult for those of us who oppose it to accept with equanimity the statistics about the books now being put forward,” said David Nasaw, a scholar and member of the committee. Mr. Nasaw said he worried that not all of the removed books would be returned once the library has finished expanding its storage annex beneath Bryant Park.Ken Weine, the library’s spokesman, responded that the library plans to return every book taken offsite in 2013. As for the 2.5 million figure, he added: “The library for decades did not have the benefit of a fully digitized catalog system. There is no back story here. It was a best guess.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

According to library officials, the system has a grand total of 45.2 million research items. Ten million of these are books, while 15.2 million are microforms, microfiches, photographs, music sheets, maps, programs, prints and the like.In addition, the main building has 66,000 linear feet of boxes filled with manuscripts, archival items and ephemera, like the papers of the author Tom Wolfe. The library calculates that the boxes hold 20 million items.AdvertisementOf the 10 million research books, half are kept permanently at the Research Collections and Preservation Consortium storage site at Princeton University. Level 1 of the Bryant Park storage annex, which opened in the late 1980s, holds 1.2 million books, library officials say, and 300,000 research books line the walls and vaults of the Schwarzman building. Once the 2.5 million books are installed in the new state-of-the art Level 2 of the storage annex in the spring, they say, the main library will hold some four million research books.Skeptics like Mr. Warren wonder, though, why the central stacks, with their capacity for perhaps 3.5 million books, are being mothballed. They say the stacks were considered suitable for books until two years ago, and they are dubious about the library’s argument that the shelves need a costly retrofit to meet modern preservation standards. The library has put the price of such work at $46.7 million, compared with $23 million to expand the annex beneath Bryant Park.”I have never doubted the need for improved climate control in the stacks,” Mr. Warren said. “I do, however, wonder at the very high cost that N.Y.P.L. has asserted.”Denise Hibay, the head of collection development for the library, said: “We know ideal preservation conditions for books are cool temperatures and relatively low humidity. These best preservation practices for long-term storage have evolved over the past 100 years, since the central stacks were first built.”As a result, library officials said, there should be little mystery about the number of books in the central stacks. For the time being, it will be zero.A version of this article appears in print on November 28, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: How Many Books in the Library?
