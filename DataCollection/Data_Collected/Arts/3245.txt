The Red Bull Music Academy, the traveling bonanza of cross-genre performance and education sponsored by the Austrian energy drink, will have its third annual extravaganza in New York in May: the Red Bull Music Academy New York.  The schedule, announced on Monday, includes events for nearly every day of the month, from May 1 to May 30. As usual, the scope will be wide and deep: current hip-hop and dancehall and electronic music, first-generation minimalism, disco, and noise, all presented within a curatorial and historical context. Included in the schedule are two ambitious performances by the English singer FKA twigs at Brooklyn Hangar in Sunset Park. A more elaborate version of a show she put on at the Roundhouse in London last month, the concert will include 10 dancers and costumes by Alexander McQueen.  There will also be a fifth-anniversary concert for the experimental electronic label Tri Angle, including its artists Evian Christ, Vessel and the Haxan Cloak; a past-to-present bill of dancehall from Jamaica and Brooklyn including Tifa, Spice, Prince Jammy and Assassin; public interviews with the funk visionary George Clinton, the young Harlem rapper ASAP Rocky and the New York minimalist composer LaMonte Young; a referendum on the current state of noise and aggressive electronics at the dance club Output, including Merzbow, Genesis P-Orridge, Aaron Dilloway, Marshstepper, Prurient and Pharmakon; a commissioned piece for 20 percussionists and singers by the drummer Kid Millions; and a tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music to the cellist-composer-singer Arthur Russell, whose work connected ‘80s dance music and the maverick compositional avant-garde. Other performances, parties and club nights in the series will explore the current state of African electronic music, early ‘90s New York techno and early ‘80s New York radio.
