For the family gathering for dinner in Stephen Karam’s play “The Humans,” Thanksgiving is fraught with secrets, sadness and tension. For the writer and creative team, however, the holiday brings good news: The drama, now playing Off Broadway in a Roundabout Theater Company production, will move to Broadway in January. The producers Scott Rudin and Barry Diller announced on Tuesday that they will transfer the Roundabout production, directed by Joe Mantello, with its cast intact. “The Humans” opened in October to excellent reviews ; its arrival will be the Broadway debut for  Mr.  Karam, the 35-year-old playwright, who has been nurtured by the Roundabout since his first New York production, “Speech & Debate,” in 2007. (“The Humans” had its premiere at the American Theater Company in Chicago, however.)“The Humans” will begin performances Jan. 23 and open on Feb. 18 at the Helen Hayes Theater, Broadway’s smallest. The house came open with news this week that “Dames at Sea” would close there on Jan. 3.
