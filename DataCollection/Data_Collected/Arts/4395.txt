The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra announced on Tuesday that its musicians would give a “free concert in support of our community” on Wednesday at noon outside its home at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, a short drive from some of the city’s worst looting.“It seems we could all use a little music in our lives right about now,’’ the orchestra posted on its Facebook page, adding the hashtag ‪#‎BSOPeace.The orchestra had postponed a children’s concert and a lecture that were scheduled for Tuesday, citing “safety concerns” connected to the unrest gripping Baltimore.An orchestra official said that a number of ensemble’s musicians had decided to donate their time to play music outside their hall, feeling the need to respond to the crisis in their hometown. The orchestra is considering other ways in which it can respond in the near future.Marin Alsop, the orchestra’s music director, wrote on Twitter and Facebook earlier on Tuesday that she was “heartbroken for our dear city.”“With so much need alongside so much possibility, I hope we can use any opportunities we get to set an example and inspire others to join us in trying to change the world,” she wrote. She posted a picture taken recently at OrchKids, a program she founded to teach music and foster social change, which now reaches 800 children in some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods.The orchestra ended its announcement of Wednesday’s free community concert with a quote from Leonard Bernstein: “This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.”
