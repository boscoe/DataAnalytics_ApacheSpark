Two examples, discussed with Mr. Pareles in this week’s Popcast:Sophie, the (male) English producer and songwriter who hasn’t publicly divulged his real name, makes bright, rubbery, synthetic, comedic songs with strange silences, using various female singers with possibly sped-up voices. (“They register as pop songs with giant holes blown in them,” Mr. Pareles says.) Sophie’s first full album, a collection of songs he’s released online over the last two years, is “Product.”And Grimes, a.k.a. Claire Boucher, the singer and producer who used to make a kind of arty synth-pop, has just released “Art Angels.” The record’s hard to parse: It seems as if it’s trying to destroy forever the boundary between indie and mainstream aesthetics, wobbling all over the map in terms of declaring what pop is and what kind of pop musician Grimes might be.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
