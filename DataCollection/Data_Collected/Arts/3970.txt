If the tribute that Eddie Murphy received at the “Saturday Night Live” 40th-anniversary special (or the tantalizingly short remarks he made at the end of it) wasn’t enough for you, he’ll soon be the recipient of another prestigious comedy honor.On Thursday the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts said that it would present its Mark Twain Prize for American Humor to Mr. Murphy, the star of films including “Beverly Hills Cop,” “The Nutty Professor” and “Dreamgirls,” at a ceremony this year.In a news release the Kennedy Center noted that the annual prize was named for “a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.”Deborah F. Rutter, the president of the Kennedy Center, said in a statement, “Through his appearances on ‘Saturday Night Live,’ groundbreaking stand-up comedy, and work as a movie star, Eddie Murphy has shown that like Mark Twain, he was years ahead of his time.”Previous winners of the award include Richard Pryor, Tina Fey, Carol Burnett and Ellen DeGeneres.Mr. Murphy, 54, said in a statement, “I am deeply honored to receive this recognition from the Kennedy Center and to join the distinguished list of past recipients of this award.”The Kennedy Center said that its gala honoring Mr. Murphy would be held Oct. 18 and recorded for broadcast. No guest performers were immediately announced, but let’s hope that Norm Macdonald is somehow involved, if only for the fascinating backstage stories he’ll tell afterward.
