CreditXanti Schawinsky Estate Zurich        How could an artist and designer as prolific, gifted and charismatic as Xanti Schawinsky — a central figure in mid-20th-century avant-garde circles in Europe and the United States — have come close to being forgotten?The theatrical productions designed by Schawinsky at the Bauhaus art and design school in Germany during the 1920s and at Black Mountain College in North Carolina in the late 1930s were important influences on postwar experimental theater and performance art. Born in Switzerland in 1904, he was at the heart of the progressive art and design scene in New York from the late 1930s until his death in 1979. Yet his work has seldom been seen publicly for the last 30 years because of a bitter legal battle over its ownership.After years of wrangling, Daniel Schawinsky, the artist’s youngest son, successfully regained control of his father’s archive in 2012, including the pioneering theater designs executed at the Bauhaus and Black Mountain. Those projects, together with his later paintings, are now on display in “Xanti Schawinsky,” at the Migros Museum in Zurich. Running through May 17, the exhibition is the most comprehensive survey of Schawinsky’s work to date.“Opening up such an important archive, after it had been lost for so long, was like discovering a treasure chest,” said Raphael Gygax, the curator at the Migros Museum who organized the show. “Schawinsky produced so much, and inspired so many people, from the composer John Cage and the choreographer Merce Cunningham, to young performance artists, who are fascinated by him.”AdvertisementThe Zurich show, which includes many works exhibited publicly for the first time, is the latest in a series of expositions to reassess the reputations of lesser-known members of the Bauhaus. There has never been a shortage of books and exhibitions about the school, not least because so many compelling figures were associated with it. Among them were the architects Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius; the artists Josef Albers, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee; and the visual theorist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.AdvertisementUntil recently, most Bauhaus surveys focused on such famous names. But in 2009, three German institutions — the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation and the Klassik Stiftung Weimar — collaborated on what is considered to be the largest Bauhaus retrospective ever, at Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin. It presented a more eclectic picture of the school in more than 1,000 exhibits, many of them pieces by previously neglected Bauhaus figures. Subsequent exhibitions have explored their work in greater depth, including a show of Schawinsky’s early-1940s drawings at the Drawing Center in New York last fall.The Migros retrospective addresses four periods of this designer’s career, starting at the Bauhaus. Schawinsky, who was born in Basel and originally intended to become an architect, joined the school in 1924 after hearing about it by chance from a tennis coach. A gregarious character, he cut a dynamic figure on the Bauhaus social scene, producing and designing plays and ballets, as well as acting and dancing in them, and leading the school band.The show opens with Schawinsky’s drawings of the sets, costumes and props he designed as a student and teacher at the Bauhaus in the 1920s, and during a nine-month interlude in 1926 and 1927 when he worked at a theater in eastern Germany. Their bold colors and forms reflect the Bauhaus love of Constructivism, and their surreally distorted bodies and fantastical settings evoke another Bauhaus favorite, Dadaism. Yet Schawinsky added an idiosyncratic element, introducing historical symbols like classical busts and columns that we now associate with the postmodern aesthetic of the 1970s.“One of the things that appeals most about Schawinsky is his energy,” said Catherine Ince, who organized a version of the Martin-Gropius-Bau retrospective at the Barbican Art Gallery in London. “He and his work teemed with zest and a passion for playful experimentation. And he was prolific in so many art forms that his legacy is truly Bauhausian.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As a Jewish artist linked to the avant-garde, he realized how dangerous it would be for him to stay in Germany. After Italy formalized its alliance with Germany in 1936, he moved to the United States, where Albers invited him to teach at Black Mountain College. There, Schawinsky conducted the theatrical experiments that form the second section of the Migros show.Many of the Black Mountain performances were developed in workshops with the actors, writers and musicians at the school. Schawinsky’s designs were characterized by dramatic visual contrasts and optical illusions created by lighting effects and projections inspired by Moholy-Nagy’s film experiments. He called these pieces Spectodrama. Closer to performance art than conventional theater, Spectodrama was cited as a precursor for happenings, the partly improvised art events staged by radical artists in the late 1950s and 1960s.In 1938 Schawinsky moved to New York, where he produced the drawings and paintings, many depicting faces, that appear in the third part of the show. The final section consists of the paintings he made from the early 1960s onward, when he divided his time between the United States, Switzerland and the Italian Alps.Schawinsky’s most powerful and innovative works were undoubtedly his experimental-theater designs, but the paintings exude vigor and ingenuity. Some were made by burning the canvas, others by dancing on it in paint-soaked shoes or by driving over it and leaving tire marks of paint.Advertisement“There is a performative element to many of the paintings,” Mr. Gygax said. “He often seems to have been more interested in the process than the finished work.”The exhibition ends on a poignant note, with images of a 1961 production of Prokofiev’s ballet “The Tale of the Stone Flower,” designed by Schawinsky in Basel. The sets and costumes include visual references to his work at the Bauhaus and Black Mountain, and to the later paintings of the Alps.“It’s impossible not to see the similarities,” Mr. Gygax said. “There was no retrospective of Schawinsky’s work in his lifetime. It’s as if he used the Prokofiev ballet to make one of his own.”A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page F2 of the New York edition with the headline: The Forgotten Man of Bauhaus, Almost.
