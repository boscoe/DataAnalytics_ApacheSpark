LONDON — A long-forgotten work by Dylan Thomas will be read at an undisclosed location in London on Friday, after it was found by chance on a page ripped from a 1942 magazine. The eight-verse poem, “A Dream of Winter,” was published in Lilliput, which folded before the end of World War II. Its archives were later sold to Paul Raymond, the owner of a soft-pornography magazine empire.The poem was discovered on a magazine page in a copy of an anthology of works by Thomas compiled by John Goodby, a professor at Swansea University in Wales, and given by Mr. Goodby to a former teacher. After the teacher’s death Mr. Goodby was contacted by one of his colleagues who asked why he had not included the poem in the anthology.  Mr. Goodby traced the poem back to Lilliput, eventually finding an original copy of the magazine.“It is amazing it went undiscovered for so long,” Mr. Goodby said in a BBC report, adding that at the time it was published it would not have been seen as significant as it is now. In the postwar years Thomas became a household name in Britain through radio programs that brought poems like “Under Milk Wood” and “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night” to a broad public. Although he went on to find success in a series of American tours in the early 1950s, he died at 39 from pneumonia, exacerbated by alcoholism.The actor Celyn Jones, who played Thomas in the film “Set Fire to the Stars” will read the poem to an invited audience at Friday’s gathering. “It’s the literary equivalent of a lost Beatles track,” Mr. Jones said in the BBC report. “It’s a beautiful poem and is full of the classic Dylan traits.”
