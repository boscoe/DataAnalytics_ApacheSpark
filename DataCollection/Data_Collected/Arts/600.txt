Women have made enormous inroads in most of the world’s leading orchestras when it comes to playing instruments, but when it comes to conducting many have found that the proverbial glass ceiling may be even stronger in the concert hall than it is in politics or business.But next summer’s Lucerne Festival, which will run Aug. 12 to Sept. 11, announced Monday that it plans to shine an all-too-rare spotlight on female conductors: it will feature 11 women leading orchestras from around the world.Emmanuelle Haïm will conduct the Vienna Philharmonic, which, more than any other top orchestra, has been criticized for its slow pace of adding women to its ranks. Marin Alsop will make her debut in Lucerne conducting the São Paulo Symphony Orchestra, and Barbara Hannigan will conduct the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. Susanna Mälkki will conduct a new work by Olga Neuwirth, the festival’s composer in residence.Riccardo Chailly, the festival’s new music director, will open the season leading the Lucerne Festival Orchestra in Mahler’s Eighth Symphony, and Bernard Haitink will mark the 50th anniversary of his debut at the festival with a series of concerts.The Lucerne Festival also announced that its Easter Festival, which runs March 12 to March 20, would feature Jordi Savall as its artist in residence, Mariss Jansons leading the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and concerts featuring William Christie and Sir John Eliot Gardiner.A version of this article appears in print on 10/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Lucerne to Feature11 Female Conductors.
