The entire 2016 graduate class of the University of Southern California’s Roski School of Art and Design has withdrawn from the university, protesting harmful administrative and curriculum changes.The class’s seven members released a statement on Friday blaming the administration for the program’s diminishing quality. “U.S.C. follows this trend of supporting a bloated administration with whom students have minimal contact,” the letter said. “We feel betrayed, exhausted, disrespected, and cheated by U.S.C. of our time, focus, and investment,” the statement continued.The students cited several changes to the program that had been made after they arrived on campus, notably the loss of studio visits and guaranteed teaching assistant positions. Several key faculty members, including Frances Stark, an art professor, and A.L. Steiner, director of the M.F.A. program, stepped down recently as well.“The U.S.C. Roski M.F.A. program remains one of the most generously funded programs in the country,” wrote Erica Muhl, dean of the program, in a statement responding to the students’ action. “These students would have received a financial package worth at least 90 percent of tuition costs in scholarships and teaching assistantships.”A version of this article appears in print on May 18, 2015, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S.C. Fine Arts Students Drop Out in Protest.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
