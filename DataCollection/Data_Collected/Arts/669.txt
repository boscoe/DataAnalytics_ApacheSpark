LONDON — Just a few weeks into rehearsals, the Menier Chocolate Factory has announced that its revival of “Funny Girl,” which broke the theater’s box-office records by selling out in 90 minutes, will transfer to the Savoy Theater in London’s West End on April 9 for 12 weeks.The production, starring the Olivier Award winner Sheridan Smith, is the first major London revival of the musical, which had its premiere on Broadway in 1964 but has not been produced there since. (A Broadway revival planned for 2011, which was to have starred Lauren Ambrose and be directed by Bartlett Sher, was scrapped after several producers pulled out.)Whereas other classic Broadway musicals with major original stars — such as Ethel Merman in “Gypsy” or Gertrude Lawrence in “The King and I” — have enjoyed successful revivals in both London and on Broadway, “Funny Girl” has remained indelibly linked to Barbra Streisand, who originated the role of Fanny Brice on Broadway at age 21 and repeated it on the London stage in 1966 and in the 1968 film version, winning an Oscar for best actress.The musical recounts the rise of an actress from working-class New York to film and Broadway stardom, and features such songs as “People” and “Don’t Rain on My Parade.” For the London production, the book by Isobel Lennart is being revised by the writer and actor Harvey Fierstein, though the producers are not releasing any details, or information on whether the original score (by Jule Styne, with lyrics by Bob Merrill) remains intact.Ms. Smith won an Olivier Award for her role in “Flare Path” in London in 2011 and has also starred in the West End in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Hedda Gabler” and “Legally Blonde.”  The new “Funny Girl” is directed by Michael Mayer, whose Broadway credits include “American Idiot’’ and “Spring Awakening”; and co-stars Darius Campbell as Brice’s ne’er-do-well husband, a role made famous by Omar Sharif in the film version.The Menier has had several productions move to the West End, and its revivals of “Sunday in the Park With George,” “A Little Night Music” and “La Cage aux Folles” transferred to Broadway.The sold-out production at the Menier Chocolate Factory will run Nov. 20 to March 5. The West End production will run April 9 to July 2, and tickets go on sale Nov. 16.A version of this article appears in print on 10/31/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: u2018Funny Girlu2019 Lands West End Before Opening.
