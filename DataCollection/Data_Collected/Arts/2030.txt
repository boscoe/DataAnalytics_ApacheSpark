What idiot forgets to buy charcoal for a barbecue but has a large sack of potato chips, another of nacho chips and, for some reason, another of marshmallows?You can’t stop to ponder such questions if you’re watching “Hack My Life,” an inconsequential but amusing series that begins on Tuesday on TruTV. You have to assume that some idiot somewhere has done just that, and instead focus on the main issue: Are potato chips, nachos or marshmallows the better substitute for charcoal in a barbecue emergency?The series, with Kevin Pereira and Brooke Van Poppelen as chirpy hosts, serves up assorted “life hacks”: improvised solutions to problems, a phrase that came out of computer programmers’ search for shortcuts. In the premiere, you’ll also learn whether a flip-flop or a squeegee does a better job of getting pet hair off a couch, several ways to get a cork out of a wine bottle without a corkscrew, and more.Fans of “MacGyver,” the old TV series that used this kind of problem-solving as its defining gimmick, might be amused, and for the truly hard core, there’s an audience-participation opportunity at the end of the premiere.As for those three charcoal alternatives, you’ll not read here which one actually works; that would be a spoiler. But if you’re going to do the experiment yourself, you’d be advised to have a fire extinguisher on hand, because one of the unconventional fuels is a little too flammable for the grill.Hack My LifeTruTV, Tuesday nights at 10:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 9:30, Central time.Produced by Sharp Entertainment.
