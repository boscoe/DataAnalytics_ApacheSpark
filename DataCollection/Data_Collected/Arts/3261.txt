Forget Connecticut. Ralph and Alice Kramden look as if they’ve decided to stay in New York.The producer of a new musical adaptation of “The Honeymooners,” the short-lived but much-imitated 1950s Jackie Gleason sitcom, has abruptly canceled a run of the show that had been slated to begin in September at Goodspeed Musicals in East Haddam, Conn. “Goodpeed has been told that the show is ready for Broadway,” the theater said in a statement Tuesday.The lead producer of the musical, Jeffrey Finn, directed questions to a spokesman, Matt Polk, who said, “We are not making an official announcement at this time but are very excited about the future prospects of ‘The Honeymooners.’”The musical adaptation of the TV show, which centers on the lives of two working-class couples living in the same building in Brooklyn, is being directed by John Rando, who won a Tony in 2002 for directing “Urinetown” and is currently represented on Broadway with “On the Town.” The show has a book written by Dusty Kay and Bill Nuss, music by Stephen Weiner and lyrics by Peter Mills. A workshop in November featured Michael McGrath and Leslie Kritzer as Ralph and Alice Kramden, and Hank Azaria and Megan Hilty as Ed and Trixie Norton, and the same actors were expected to play the roles at Goodspeed.​The Goodspeed cancellation marks the second time a production of “The Honeymooners” musical has been scrapped. In 2013, the show  was pulled from schedule at the The Old Globe in San Diego.
