Substituting ingenuous eagerness for egotism, the singer Darius de Haas turned it into a pop-jazz revelation.“Songs of the City” was the series’ second home run this season, the other being “A Good Thing Going,” its survey of the Stephen Sondheim-Harold Prince partnership. Propelled by Ms. Winer’s best script ever and a swinging band conducted from the piano by John Oddo, “Songs of the City,” directed by Mark Waldrop, was a triumph of casting and coordination that brought out the best in its six singers.The impeccable matches of singer to song included Klea Blackhurst’s bright, saucy “Way Out West,” Billy Stritch’s robust “New York State of Mind,” Leslie Kritzer’s restrained and touching “(I Stayed) Too Long at the Fair?” and La Tanya Hall’s elegant “Autumn in New York.” Jeffrey Schecter’s version of Christine Lavin’s “Waiting for the B Train,” a hilarious song about the uproar on a subway platform when riders mistook a wig on the tracks for a stray puppy, was imbued with just the right tone of wry affection. The guests found a perfect harmonic blend on “The Boy From New York City.”What carried the show to other peaks were Mr. de Haas’s tricky, semi-improvised “Sophisticated Lady” and his quietly euphoric “Spanish Harlem,” both buoyed by his unquenchable bonhomie.Advertisement
