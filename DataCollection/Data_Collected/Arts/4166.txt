A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events.Ballet Hispanico  (Sunday through April 26) This ardent company returns to the Joyce Theater with works by Spanish and Latin American choreographers, spanning four programs. The lineup includes a world premiere by the Mexican choreographer Miguel Mancillas and the New York premiere of Rosie Herrera’s “Show.Girl.,” a look at Latina identity through the lens of Cuban cabaret. The troupe revives some of its pithiest choreography with Gustavo Ramírez Sansano’s flirtatious “El Beso,” from last year, and Annabelle Lopez Ochoa’s popular “Sombrerísimo,” for six men in bowler hats. Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.; Thursday and April 24 at 8 p.m.; April 25 at 2 and 8 p.m.; April 26 at 2 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Siobhan Burke)Laurie Berg  (Friday and Saturday) In “The Mineralogy of Objects,” Ms. Berg draws inspiration from “Variétés de Minéralogie: Object,” a shadow box constructed by the artist Joseph Cornell in 1939. Through the structure and mechanics of that artifact, she illuminates relationships between objects and moving bodies. Of her dancers Jodi Bender, Bessie McDonough-Thayer and Jillian Sweeney, she writes, “We are a unison machine, a string of beads, an energetic force rejecting our own objectification in the refusal to stay still.” At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Burke)Michelle Boulé (Thursday through April 25) BioGeometry is the study of the energy of shapes and colors. It was invented in the 1970s by Ibrahim Karim, an architect, who describes it as “equally scientific and spiritual in essence.” It is also the theoretical foundation of Michelle Boulé’s new work, “White,” a trio for herself, Lauren Bakst and Lindsay Clark in which they try to become vessels for the energetic frequencies that otherwise cannot be seen or quantified. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark’s Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, 866-811-4111, danspaceproject.org. (Brian Schaefer)AdvertisementDallas Black Dance Theater (Friday and Saturday) For nearly 40 years, Dallas Black Dance Theater has explored the African-American experience through modern dance and community outreach in its hometown. Now under the guidance of a new artistic director, April Berry, a former principal with Alvin Ailey, the company returns to New York with works by Daniel Catanach, Bruce Wood, Elisa Monte and Troy Powell, the director of Ailey II. Much of the repertory is artistically bilingual, speaking in black and Hispanic gestures and rhythms, as well as with ballet and modern-dance vocabularies. At 7:30 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, 214-880-0202, dbdt.com. (Schaefer)AdvertisementE-Moves: ‘Celebrating James Baldwin and Billie Holiday’  (Friday and Saturday) This annual series, presented by Harlem Stage, dedicates its 16th edition to James Baldwin and Billie Holiday, commemorating what would have been his 90th birthday and her 100th. More streamlined than in past years, the program includes new works by André M. Zachery, Brinae Ali, Malcolm Low and the duo Nia Love and Marjani Forte, who respond in movement to Baldwin’s prose and Holiday’s music. The culminating “Harlem Stage Takeover” (Saturday) features nine artists in performances dispersed throughout the building. At 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, 212-281-9240, harlemstage.org. (Burke)★ Fridays at Noon: ‘Remembering Clark Center’ (Friday) In the second half of the 20th century, as modern dance hit adulthood, Clark Center for the Performing Arts nurtured a new — and more diverse — generation of artists. Founded in 1959 by Alvin Ailey at a Manhattan Y.W.C.A., it gave a boost to choreographers and companies like Eleo Pomare, Bill T. Jones, Dance Theater of Harlem and Ballet Hispanico. In “Remembering Clark Center,” guests look back on its 30 influential years through live performance, archival footage and a panel discussion. At noon, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, 212-415-5500, 92y.org. (Schaefer)Emily Johnson  (Thursday through April 26) Most choreographers interested in social connection try to spur their audiences into action. Emily Johnson makes it part of the program. “Shore,” the last work in a trilogy that questions the components of belonging while also seeking it, has four main ingredients: Volunteerism (with opportunities on Sunday and April 24), Story (Sunday), Performance (Thursday through April 25) and Feast (April 26). The radical cumulative statement is that dance can respond to, and be part of, the real world. Volunteer, story and feast locations are online at newyorklivearts.org. Performances begin at 7:30 p.m. at Public School 11, the William T. Harris School, 320 West 21st Street, Chelsea, and end at New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-924-0077. (Schaefer)Raja Feather Kelly  (through April 25) What would “A Chorus Line” look like if Andy Warhol had choreographed his own version? In “Andy Warhol’s 15 (Color Me, Warhol),” the adventurous Raja Feather Kelly and his company, the Feath3r Theory, try to answer that question, using unabashedly jazzy choreography and other sneakier tactics. Marilyn Monroe wigs and multicolored face paint may be involved. Fridays and Saturdays at 7 p.m., Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, between Rivington and Delancey Streets, Lower East Side, 212-219-0736, dixonplace.org.

Still performing at 56 — no small feat in the physically demanding life of a dancer — she addresses age, individuality and forms of beauty that don’t immediately meet the eye. Friday at 7:30 p.m.; Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, N.J., 973-655-5112, peakperfs.org.

Also new is “Whelm,” a world premiere set to Debussy, and “Pacific,” created for the San Francisco Ballet in 1995, which the Mark Morris dancers will perform in New York for the first time. Other works from the company’s repertory complete two distinct programs, performed to live music. Wednesday through April 25 at 7:30 p.m.; April 26 at 3 p.m.; Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Schaefer)★ David Neumann/Advanced Beginner Group  (through April 25) Mr. Neumann has weathered a number of storms in recent years, personal and meteorological. In “I Understand Everything Better,” he reflects on the deaths of his parents, which bookended Superstorm Sandy. Techniques from Japanese Noh theater, along with his characteristic wit, provide grounding and leavening forces. Friday and Saturday, and Wednesday through April 25, at 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, 212-352-3101, abronsartscenter.org.

(Burke)Advertisement★ ‘Rhythm in Motion’ (Wednesday through April 26) If you haven’t heard, tap is back — or at least being newly appreciated by those who previously dismissed it. The American Tap Dance Foundation has long championed innovation in the form, and its annual showcase puts that freshness on display. Michelle Dorrance, Derick K. Grant, Chloe Arnold — part of a modern “Tap Pack” — are contributing to two programs over five days, along with fellow tap entrepreneurs, musicians and singers.

(Burke)★ Works & Process (Sunday and Monday) Expect many celebrations of the 75th anniversary of American Ballet Theater in the coming year. But this three-part historical primer at the Guggenheim Museum is a great way to start. Each section focuses on a quarter-century span, from the company’s 1940 founding to the present day.
