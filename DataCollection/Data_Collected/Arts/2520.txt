LOS ANGELES – The movie adaptation of “Fifty Shades of Grey” is predictably shaping up like a box-office giant, but advance ticket sales are sizzling in part because of support from some unexpected places.Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Kentucky and Alabama lead the areas where advance ticket sales are significantly higher than expected for an R-rated movie, according to Fandango, the online ticket seller owned by Comcast, which in turn owns Universal Pictures, the studio releasing “Fifty Shades of Grey.”Another unexpectedly strong state: North Dakota.Fandango said that its findings were based on a state-by-state analysis of advance sales patterns. Nearly 60 percent of total Fandango sales on Tuesday were for “Fifty Shades of Grey,” which explores very raunchy sex, and arrives on Feb. 13. The movie is already the fastest-selling R-rated film in Fandango history.Box-office analysts unaffiliated with Fandango say the movie, adapted from the E L  James bestseller, is primarily attracting interest from women, many of whom plan to attend in groups – an attendance pattern that helped turn “Sex and the City” into a multiplex phenomenon in 2008.
