But what keeps TV percolating are the shows that fit neither profile; they’re just reliably good week after week, season after season. One of those, “Cougar Town,” has its final episode at 10:30 on Tuesday night on TBS. The show has lasted six seasons, a classic example of surviving by adapting. It began as a vehicle for its best-known star, Courteney Cox of “Friends,” who in the initial formulation was recently divorced, in her early 40s and looking for love with younger men — thus the title. But the show morphed fairly quickly into something else entirely: an ensemble-cast comedy about a group of friends on a cul-de-sac. The now anachronistic title has been a running gag on the series ever since. “Cougar Town” also adapted by switching networks, starting out on ABC but moving to TBS in 2013. Some traditions, though, remain true through the finale, which focuses on the birthday of Ms. Cox’s character. The giant wine glass that has been a series regular puts in another appearance. And the episode, like many of its predecessors, is named for a Tom Petty song. It’s called “Mary Jane’s Last Dance.” Advertisement
