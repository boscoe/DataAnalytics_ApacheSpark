David Hallberg, the American Ballet Theater principal dancer, is injured and will not perform during the company’s Metropolitan Opera House season, the company announced on Wednesday. Mr. Hallberg, who is also a principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet, had foot surgery last fall. “It is with great regret that I must cancel the A.B.T. spring season, but my complete recovery is of utmost importance,” Mr. Hallberg said in a statement. He will be replaced in some of his 13 scheduled performances by the Mariinsky principal Vladimir Shklyarov, in “Giselle,” and by Leonid Sarafanov, a principal dancer with the Mikhailovsky Ballet, in “La Bayadère” and “The Sleeping Beauty.” It will be Mr. Sarafanov’s debut with Ballet Theater.Although Mr. Hallberg won’t be dancing, he will present a program drawing on his experiences with companies worldwide as part of the Youth America Grand Prix program in April. “David Hallberg Presents: Legacy,” which will be performed on April 17 at the David H. Koch Theater, will include dancers from the Mariinsky Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet, the Australian Ballet and the Tokyo Ballet. “Every company has its own texture, vocabulary and singular place in dance history, and I have always wanted to share my perspective of these world renowned institutions,” Mr. Hallberg said.A version of this article appears in print on 03/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: American Ballet Theater Loses Hallberg to Injury.
