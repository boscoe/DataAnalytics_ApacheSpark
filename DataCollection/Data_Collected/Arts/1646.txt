Handel’s “Messiah” gets pigeonholed as a cozy holiday staple, capped by the rousing “Hallelujah” chorus. But it is also a seething, disturbingly deep reflection on faith and suffering, one that disorients with its perpetual, sudden shifts of tone.No New York performers capture the work’s vitality and strangeness quite like Julian Wachner and his incisive, passionate Trinity Church forces: the Choir of Trinity Wall Street, from which the vocal soloists are drawn, and the Trinity Baroque Orchestra.They enact it — in this case that’s really the right word — on Wednesday, Dec. 16, at the church (7:30 p.m., Broadway at Wall Street, trinitywallstreet.org) and on Thursday, Dec. 17, at Alice Tully Hall (7:30 p.m., lincolncenter.org), before returning to Trinity for a final go Dec. 26.A version of this article appears in print on December 13, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Handel’s ‘Messiah’? it’s Complicated.
