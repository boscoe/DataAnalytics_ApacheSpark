Turner, but Americans don’t need a passport to see his works in person. Below is a list of institutions in Manhattan or within a day’s journey from the city that own pieces prominently featured in Mike Leigh’s film “Mr. Turner,” followed by several museums with Turner’s work in their collections.FRICK COLLECTION The Frick owns five Turner paintings, including “The Harbor of Dieppe” (circa 1826), a work that the artist, played by Timothy Spall, is seen painting at his London studio early in the film, according to Jacqueline Riding, a historical consultant for the movie. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan; 212-288-0700, frick.org. (Roberta Smith says her favorite is “the very un-Turner-esque” “Mortlake Terrace: Early Summer Morning,” from 1826, a luminous view of the Thames and the estate of William Moffatt.)YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART The center is currently closed for renovations, but among the 14 paintings and 86 watercolors by Turner in this collection is “Staffa, Fingal’s Cave,” a Scottish island landscape from 1832 that was his first painting sent to the United States, in 1845. In “Mr. Turner,” it appears in a scene at the Royal Academy of Arts on Varnishing Day, the eve of an exhibition’s opening. In a feat of showmanship, Turner slaps white paint and blows a mysterious brown powder onto the canvas before a crowd of fellow academicians. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven; 877-274-8278, britishart.yale.edu.MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON The 1840 work “Slave Ship (Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, Typhoon Coming On)” appears in two scenes involving the art critic John Ruskin, who as a young man convinced his father to buy it from Turner. 465 Huntington Avenue; 617-267-9300, mfa.org.Other museums with Turner works:METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART The Met has three Turner works: “Whalers” (circa 1845), “Venice, From the Porch of Madonna della Salute” (circa 1835) and “Saltash With the Water Ferry, Cornwall”  (1811). 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org.NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY The exhibition “Sublime: The Prints of J.
