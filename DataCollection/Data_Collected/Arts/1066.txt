London  — A rare collection of 162 childhood drawings; 47 sketchbooks from the 1940s to 2011; and letters and book cover designs by the artist Lucian Freud, who died in 2011, have been given to Britain in lieu of 2.9 million British pounds, or $4.41 million in inheritance tax by the Freud estate. The archive, which has never previously been shown, will go to London’s National Portrait Gallery, which in 2012 held a highly successful Lucian Freud Portraits exhibition.The Acceptance in Lieu Scheme, as it is known, was created in 1910 and allows the donation of important cultural objects to the nation to offset such inheritance tax. The Freud estate has already given a Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot painting, “L’Italienne ou la Femme à la Manche Jaune,” and three Degas statues, in lieu of £2.34 million (or $3.56 million) in tax, as well as the artist’s collection of 40 drawings and paintings by Frank Auerbach in lieu of £16 million (or $24.33 million) in tax.The sketchbooks in the archive collection include studies for some of the artist’s major works, including a portrait of Arnold Goodman, a lawyer and political adviser, which is part of the National Portrait Gallery collection. In a statement, the National Portrait Gallery said these would “give added context” to its holdings.Perhaps most intriguing among the unseen works are the childhood drawings, which were created before the artist  — the grandson of Sigmund Freud — moved with his family from Germany to England in 1933, and were saved and dated by his mother, Lucie. Nicholas Cullinan, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, said that the archive was a “very important, extensive and generous gift to the nation” which would “in due course be made available to the public.”In a statement, the gallery said it hoped to display a selection of items from the archive early next summer.A version of this article appears in print on 11/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Talk Show About Musical Theater.
