The “Noche de Salseros in Concert,” on Oct. 17 at Lehman Center for the Performing Arts in the Bronx, could be one of those nights. The clear-voiced Charlie Aponte was one of three singers with El Gran Combo, the definitive band of Puerto Rican salsa, from 1973 until last year. These days he still sings the old, hard-driving salsa — the evidence is a new record, “Una Nueva Historia” — but you’ll be able to take his measure more directly. The singer José Alberto, known as El Canario, broke through in the late ’70s with the band Tipica 73, and became a solo star by the ’80s; he’s a virtuoso who can shift vocal tones between soft and burnished to hard and slicing. (His recent record, “No Quiero Llanto,” recorded partly in Cuba, pays tribute to the early ’50s Cuban singing duo Los Compadres.) Domingo Quiñones, a romantic salsa singer who came to prominence in the ’90s, joins them. (8 p.m., lehmancenter.org.)Advertisement
