In an ideal marriage of dazzle and camp, Mariah Carey will become the latest pop diva to bring her outsize presence to the Las Vegas Strip.Caesars Palace announced on Thursday that the singer will begin a residency at the Colosseum on May 6, following other established acts like Celine Dion, Shania Twain and Britney Spears to Las Vegas and the stability its stages offer.Ms. Carey’s show, dubbed “Mariah Carey #1’s,” will focus on her 18 No. 1 singles — a record for a solo artist — from “Vision of Love” in 1990 to “Touch My Body” in 2008, but promises “fan-favorite album cuts” as well.“Some of these songs I’m like, ‘Really, I’m gonna do that one again? O.K.,’” Ms. Carey said during an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” airing on Thursday. An updated version of Ms. Carey’s 1998 greatest hits album, “#1’s,” is due out later this year.“Revisiting these songs for the show, working on the updated compilation and creating new music has really let me reconnect with my songs and I hope my fans will enjoy the experience,” Ms. Carey said in a statement.Tickets to the first 18 performances in Las Vegas are on sale now at thecolosseum.com, with prices ranging from $55 to $250.A version of this article appears in print on 01/16/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Mariah Carey Joins The Vegas Party.
