Frank Sinatra and the New York Philharmonic have a bit of history: They performed together before 7,000 fans at Lewisohn Stadium in 1943. But a year later the Philharmonic’s music director, Artur Rodzinski, was quoted denigrating Sinatra’s youthful fans as “pitiful cases”; Sinatra replied that Rodzinski was “out of the groove.”Now Lincoln Center and the Philharmonic are returning to Sinatra to raise money to renovate the orchestra’s home, which was recently renamed David Geffen Hall. They are planning a gala fund-raiser on Dec. 3 with Alan Gilbert conducting the Philharmonic and featuring stars including Sting, Bernadette Peters, Christina Aguilera and Fantasia performing music associated with Sinatra to mark his centennial. Seth MacFarlane is to host and perform.Lincoln Center officials declined to say whether Mr. Geffen, an entertainment mogul, had helped line up talent for the gala. Mr. Geffen donated $100 million to the renovation project, which is expected to cost more than $500 million.A version of this article appears in print on 10/09/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Philharmonic Turns to Sinatra Tunes.
