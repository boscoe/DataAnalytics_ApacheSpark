A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Bishop/Cleaver/Flood  (Wednesday) For well over a decade, Andrew Bishop, a saxophonist and bass clarinetist, has led an exploratory group with the drummer Gerald Cleaver and the bassist Tim Flood. Celebrating the release of its second album — “De Profundis,” partly inspired by the Renaissance composer Josquin Des Prez — the trio works with focused abstraction and dynamic intrigue. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Nate Chinen)★ Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock  (Thursday) Mr. Corea and Mr. Hancock, two leading jazz pianists of our time, have history together onstage: In 1978, they embarked on a dual-piano concert tour that yielded a pair of well-regarded albums. They’re finally back at it, with a tour that began a few weeks ago, and they stop at this august address before heading to other cities around the county, and then to other continents. At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org. (Chinen)Kyle Eastwood  (Friday through Sunday) The bassist Kyle Eastwood hasn’t had an easy time establishing a name apart from his father’s (you know who that is), but as he shows on his new album, “Time Pieces,” he isn’t coasting. Drawing from the album, he leads a working band with the pianist Andrew McCormack, the tenor saxophonist Graeme Blevins, the trumpeter Quentin Collins and the drummer Martyn Kaine. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)AdvertisementEliane Elias  (Tuesday through April 11) A pianist and singer with achievements in a range of jazz and chamber-esque settings, Ms. Elias is never more sumptuously at home than when she turns to bossa nova: the subject of her new album, “Made in Brazil,” whose premise she revisits here. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)AdvertisementTia Fuller Quartet  (Friday through Sunday) The saxophonist Tia Fuller has come a ways since the dawn of her solo career, when she was best recognized for her work on tour with Beyoncé. She has kept largely the same musical counsel, though, including all the members of this band: her sister, the pianist Shamie Royston; Ms. Royston’s husband, the drummer Rudy Royston; and the bassist Mimi Jones. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Benito Gonzalez Jazz Quintet  (Friday and Saturday) An intensely dynamic pianist, Benito Gonzalez has made his mark in bands led by the saxophonists Kenny Garrett and Azar Lawrence. For this turn as a bandleader, he enlists Mr. Lawrence along with another saxophonist, Myron Walden; the bassist Essiet Okon Essiet; and the drummer Jeff (Tain) Watts. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., the Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)★ Tom Harrell: Something Gold, Something Blue  (through Sunday) Mr. Harrell, a trumpeter and fluegelhorn player of prominence since the 1970s, has also been a beacon of small-group bandleading in recent years, working with a regular stable of sidemen. Two of them, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Johnathan Blake, join him in this engagement — alongside a sharp young trumpeter, Ambrose Akinmusire, and a guitarist, Charles Altura. There’s new music for the band, and some high expectations. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ The Heath Brothers  (Tuesday through April 12) Jimmy Heath, a saxophonist and composer, and Albert Heath, better known as Tootie, a drummer, have been staples of the postbop landscape from the beginning. This group used to include another brother, the great bassist Percy Heath, who died a decade ago; its lineup, still sturdy, now typically includes David Wong on bass and Jeb Patton on piano (although Michael Weiss is the pianist for this engagement). At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)★ Sheila Jordan with the Steve Kuhn Trio  (Friday and Saturday) Ms. Jordan, 86, is an eminent and exploratory singer — she was recently anointed a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts — whose approach to jazz skews nearly kaleidoscopic. She has a good rapport with the pianist Steve Kuhn, who joins her here with his blue-chip trio. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)Jason Marsalis Vibes Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) The shift from drums to vibraphone began quietly for Jason Marsalis, about 15 years ago. By now, it’s complete; “The 21st Century Trad Band” is the second album to feature fully his Vibes Quartet, an agile, swinging unit with the pianist Austin Johnson, the bassist Will Goble and the drummer Dave Potter. At 8 and 10 p.m., Minton’s, 206 West 118th Street, Harlem, 212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com. (Chinen)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It also relies on the diligence of a lineup that includes stalwarts like the saxophonist Ron Blake, the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix and the trombonist Steve Davis. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Donny McCaslin Group  (Tuesday and Wednesday) Drawing from “Fast Future,” his determinedly plugged-in new album, the tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin regroups perhaps the best possible rhythm section for the task: Jason Lindner on piano and synthesizers, Tim Lefebvre on electric bass, and Mark Guiliana on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)AdvertisementBen Monder Trio  (Friday) Ben Monder, a guitarist known for his beguilingly fluid technique, mixes standards with originals in this one-nighter, backed by Eivind Opsvik on bass and Jochen Rueckert on drums. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com. (Chinen)Clarence Penn and Penn Station  (Friday and Saturday) On his most recent album, “Monk: The Lost Files,” the drummer Clarence Penn retrofits some Thelonious Monk tunes with new flourishes: stutter-step accents, gospel harmonies, hip-hop swagger. He’ll do something similar here with his band Penn Station: the trumpeter Mike Rodriguez, the saxophonist Chad Lefkowitz-Brown, the pianist Shai Maestro and the bassist Yasushi Nakamura. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Kojo Roney Residency  (Thursday through April 11) Kojo Roney is a drummer of evident promise, worth keeping an eye on for more than the novelty of his age. (He’s 10.) Next week he’ll appear for three nights in a group with his father, the tenor saxophonist Antoine Roney, and the bassist William Parker. They’ll be joined next Friday by the multi-instrumentalist Cooper-Moore, and on April 11 by Cooper-Moore and the trumpeter Nate Wooley. At 8 p.m., Jack, 505 1/2 Waverly Avenue, near Fulton Street, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, jackny.org. (Chinen)Marta Sánchez Quintet  (Sunday) Marta Sánchez is a young Spanish pianist whose new album, “Partenika,” also shows her to be an intriguing composer. She performs music from the album in a 7 p.m. set with her New York quintet, which includes Roman Filiu on alto saxophone, Jerome Sabbagh on tenor saxophone, Sam Anning on bass and Jason Burger on drums. (A later set, at 8:15 p.m., will feature the Stereography Project, a chamberlike group led by the Dutch alto saxophonist Marike van Dijk.) At ShapeShifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, near Carroll Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com. (Chinen)Sara Serpa and City Fragments (Saturday) A jazz singer of silvery poise and cosmopolitan outlook, Ms. Serpa sets out to map a new sort of relationship between vocals and instrumentals with City Fragments, a project featuring two other singers, Aubrey Johnson and Sofia Rei, alongside the guitarist André Matos, the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ SFJazz Collective  (Thursday through April 12) The SFJazz Collective divides its repertory each year between original music and the oeuvre of someone else, usually a postbop luminary. The tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson is a great fit, not least for the hint of Latin rhythm in much of his work — a driving interest for the collective’s saxophonists, David Sánchez and Miguel Zenón, and its pianist, Edward Simon. The rest of the roster, no less savvy about blending styles, features the trumpeter Avishai Cohen, the trombonist Robin Eubanks, the vibraphonist Warren Wolf, the bassist Matt Penman and the drummer Obed Calvaire. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an additional 11:45 p.m. set on April 10 and 11, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Lew Tabackin Trio  (Friday) As a tenor saxophonist, Lew Tabackin combines gut instincts with a broad command of jazz styles; as a flutist, he favors Eastern timbres and scales. He appears with the bassist David Wong and the drummer Mark Taylor. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)★ Randy Weston’s African Rhythms Sextet  (Through Sunday) Mr. Weston, the august pianist and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, has been one of the principal agents of an African jazz aesthetic since his first visit to Nigeria some 50 years ago. He works here with the saxophonists T.K. Blue and Billy Harper, the bassist Alex Blake, the percussionist Neil Clarke and the drummer Lewis Nash. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., with an additional 11:45 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)A jazz entry in the Listings pages on Friday about the Marta Sánchez Quintet at ShapeShifter Lab in Brooklyn on Sunday, using information from the club, reversed the times of the quintet’s set and one featuring the Stereography Project. The quintet will perform at 7 p.m., and the other set will be at 8:15 p.m., not vice versa.A version of this schedule appears in print on April 3, 2015, on Page C17 of the New York edition with the headline: The Listings: Jazz.
