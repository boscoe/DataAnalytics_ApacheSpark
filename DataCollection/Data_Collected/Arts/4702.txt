CreditRichard Perry/The New York Times        Pop means a lot of conflicting things to the label and Internet phenomenon PC Music and to the D.J. and producer Sophie, who shared a high-concept extravaganza at BRIC House in Brooklyn on Friday night as part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival.To them, pop means fun, mass appeal, crass commercialism, shared experience, celebrity, artificiality, fashion, dancing, performance art, simplicity, craftsmanship, kitsch, naïveté, self-consciousness, something to love, something to mock and something to reconfigure. In an interview with Tank magazine, the head of PC Music, the producer A. G. Cook, described pop music as having “the potential to be overwhelming, extravagant and banal all at the same time.” Those possibilities were in play on Friday.Since 2013, PC Music has been prolifically releasing and giving away songs online that are, by and large, pop gone pointillistically bonkers. They use perky, mostly female, computer-manipulated voices, singing concise tunes in synthetic settings full of shiny sounds — not all that different, so far, from the Top 10. But the productions, and particularly Mr. Cook’s remixes, destabilize the pop they know so well; pitches shift, tempos suddenly skid, syncopations rise to battle the beat, and interlocking parts multiply to head-spinning effect. (Mr. Cook has cited as a source the composer Conlon Nancarrow, who used player-piano rolls to create music of superhuman intricacy for mechanized performance.) The voices, too, are not nearly as guileless as they sound.Friday’s show was billed as the premiere of Pop Cube, “a multimedia reality network,” whatever that is. It started with a stunt. With the audience lined up along the sidewalk, a white stretch S.U.V., not quite a block long, pulled up and gradually disgorged the performers outside a red-carpeted entrance.AdvertisementThe first, QT, posed for photographers and then put on headphones in an outdoor D.J. booth and started playing electronic pop. Soon, everyone was a momentary celebrity; the audience also used the red-carpet entrance, photo opportunities included, against a backdrop of logos.AdvertisementInside, BRIC’s gallery had become a combination of party space and backstage TV studio; the D.J.s were Dux Content, the duo of Mr. Cook and his longtime collaborator, Danny L Harle. Audience members could, a sign offered, “Get your picture taken with a pop star!” — the rest of the performers. Their encounters were shown on video screens. In a glassed-in studio, the group Try Slaughter flailed at instruments like a grunge band, with its singer swigging from a bottle of whiskey, although the speakers broadcast Dux Content’s set instead.The main show moved into BRIC’s theater for brief sets by male D.J.-producers (Mr. Harle, Mr. Cook and Sophie) and female vocalists (Hannah Diamond, QT and GFOTY). Ms. Diamond is PC Music’s version of a teenypop starlet; her online images are meticulously altered and her songs are among the label’s most straightforward, retro productions (although the melodies hop around). She came out smiling in 1990s Spice Girls style, with a long ponytail, a headset microphone, white pants and a navel-baring bustier that read, “it’s all so simple.” And she pranced through dance routines that Madonna might recognize. But her songs speak to Internet natives wandering between the physical and the virtual; Ms. Diamond’s initials can also stand for High Definition. In “Keri Baby,” she lip-synced along with her sampled, edited voice through lyrics like “I don’t wanna be an MP3/ 320 kbps, you know that I feel kinda real, kinda ooh.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Her “Hey QT” is a mock commercial for an energy drink that promises a feeling of connection. Before dancing through the song, she introduced herself as the C.E.O. of Drink QT and gave a product pitch over bubbly electronic sounds; a cooler held cans of QT (which were the same shape as Red Bull). “I’m dedicated to creating pop products that promote a different type of energy,” she said, wide-eyed and deadpan. That could be PC Music’s mission statement.GFOTY, as in Girlfriend of the Year, was more contentious. Her video introduction provided wildly overblown pop statistics — 18 No. 1 singles (à la Mariah Carey), seven billion albums sold (à la no one) — and showed $100 bills tucked under her bra straps. She’s as much a spoken-word act as a singer, and her tracks are some of the label’s nuttiest, twitchiest, most neck-snapping productions. Tracks like “Don’t Wanna/ Let’s Do It” are at once declarations of ambivalence, satires of pop stereotypes and bursts of impulse — adding up to a persona both knowing and wild.Mr. Harle and Mr. Cook brought a shared aesthetic to their sets: staccato sounds, pop refrains, brief use of live instruments, rhythmic escalation. Mr. Harle’s electronic setup was flanked by a harpsichord on one side and a string trio, but the musicians disappeared after a little Baroque-versus-electronic byplay, and the dance beats and pitched-up vocals began. Voices singing about teardrops or togetherness chirped amid little snippets of themselves, with tinny versions of trance chords and house beats and with arpeggios stopping and starting, zipping around and accelerating, arriving like a hailstorm of jelly beans.Mr. Cook moved, at one point, from his electronics to an upright piano, and sang along with his recorded voice. “I know I’m going up, up, up with you,” he sang, and “You make me feel like a superstar.” His hands splashed around on the piano, but the Jerry Lee Lewis glissandos he acted out weren’t audible as the beat kept going. No matter; back behind his electronics, he was mathematical and mercurial. One song had a persistent vocal sample: “I don’t wanna be real.”Sophie was the night’s rightful finale: noisier, blunter, more extreme. He shuns photographers, but he dressed for the occasion; above the electronics, he had a shiny, multizippered black jacket and biceps-length gray gloves, latex perhaps, that let him manipulate his gizmos. He pushed the pop/noise/hook/distortion matrix further in a set that started with pure animosity — drone and dissonance — and ended up euphoric and spattered with brittle noise. A track promised (in helium voices), “We can go crazy and go pop if that’s what you want to do.”PC Music is both raising pop questions — How much is music? How much is marketing? How crazy can a producer get? — and positing answers. One metric matters above all: Can you dance to it?A version of this review appears in print on May 11, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: Something to Love, Mock and Shape .
