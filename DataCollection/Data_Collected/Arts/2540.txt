PARIS – Authorities have imposed new restrictions on filming movies or television shows in the city of Paris nearly a month after shootings that killed 17 people in and around the French capital. Outdoor scenes of actors in police or military uniforms and the use of fake weapons or explosives have been banned, underlining the heightened level of security after the attacks.Police commander Sylvie Barnaud, who deals with filming authorizations at the Paris police prefecture, described the ban and said the use of fake weapons and pyrotechnic effects were also prohibited.Commander Barnaud said the ban was designed to avoid confusing bystanders or cause terrorists to attack actors.Paris has remained an attractive setting for movies and television shows, often featuring landmarks like the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower. Official statistics provided by city authorities showed that there were 930 film shoots in Paris in 2014, including approximately 20 international productions, half of them American.Productions like last year’s blockbuster “Lucy,” in which Scarlett Johansson hurtles down the Rue de Rivoli in a police car, would have been impossible to film under the new rules. But Olivier-René Veillon, who heads a regional agency that promotes filming and assists crews in and around Paris, said the ban was not worrying in the long term.“There is no impact on current productions, because we are in a very calm period,” he said, adding that complex action shots were often filmed on private grounds anyway. “It’s perfectly manageable.”Commander Barnaud said the measures were common sense, especially after attacks so appalling that they had blurred the boundaries between fiction and reality. “I was shocked to hear witnesses of the Charlie Hebdo attacks say on television: ‘It seemed like a movie shoot to us,’” she said.
