Laverne Cox, a star of “Orange Is the New Black,” will jump to the left, and then step to the right from the prison series, having signed on to Fox’s new production of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” Ms. Cox will star as Dr. Frank N. Furter, the outrageous alien scientist and, in the vernacular of the era, a “sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania,” a role performed by Tim Curry in the 1975 classic cult film. The rock movie musical, a gaudy satire of horror and sci-fi B-movies, has been a fixture in midnight screenings since its debut and is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. The film was written by Jim Sharman and Richard O’Brien and directed by Mr. Sharman, and was based on the pair’s 1973 stage musical, “The Rocky Horror Show.”Fox’s version, which will run as a two-hour television special next fall, will be produced, directed and choreographed by Kenny Ortega (“High School Musical”). Lou Adler, a producer on the 1975 film, will be an executive producer. It is the latest musical to be adapted into a television event, though unlike with NBC’s “The Sound of Music,” “Peter Pan” and the coming “The Wiz,” “Rocky Horror” will be filmed in advance instead of aired live. Fox is producing a live version of “Grease,” however, which will air in January.Ms. Cox is the first transgender actress to be nominated for an Emmy, for her work in “Orange Is the New Black.” She also stars in “Doubt,” a coming CBS pilot. I am so excited that the news is out. I am so honored to be a part of the Rocky Horror legacy. #DontDreamItBeIt #TransIsBeautifulA photo posted by laverne cox (@lavernecox) on Oct 21, 2015 at 9:14pm PDTA version of this article appears in print on 10/23/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Laverne Cox to Star in Foxu2019s u2018Rocky Horroru2019.
