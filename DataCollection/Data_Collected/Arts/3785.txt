“Honeymoon in Vegas,” a madcap musical that won positive reviews but failed to find an audience, will close on Sunday.The show, a comedy about a couple with commitment issues and their misadventures with a lustful gambler, is the first victim of an increasingly crowded Broadway marketplace, as multiple new shows rush to open before the deadline for Tony eligibility.It was losing so much money that the producers were unwilling to hang on another few weeks until Tony nominations are announced — which could have provided a boost at the box office had the show won attention in major categories. “The math didn’t add up — it’s as plain and simple as that,” said Rick Miramontez, a spokesman for the production. “It had nothing to do with the passion inside the building, but to sustain losses over such a huge period of time makes moving forward untenable.”The musical was adapted from a 1992 film of the same name, and stars Tony Danza, Rob McClure and Brynn O’Malley, with a book by Andrew Bergman and a score by Jason Robert Brown. It began performances at the Nederlander Theater on Nov. 18, and officially opened on Jan. 15; it had previously been staged in 2013 at Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.“Honeymoon” had been running at a loss — it cost more than $500,000 a week to operate, but was consistently grossing less than $400,000. The show had brought in $7 million as of last week, according to the Broadway League; that is less than it cost to mount, meaning that the entire investment was lost.
