Their power is not only in their immediacy but also in how they prefigure outdoor painters who elevated landscape as a genre. Starting Tuesday, the Morgan Library & Museum will focus on the history of the practice in “Exploring France: Oil Sketches From the Thaw Collection.” The collector Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare, benefactors of the Morgan and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, have donated 135 oil sketches to the two institutions, in addition to giving hundreds of old master and 19th-century drawings to the Morgan. Mr. Thaw has described the sketches as “the most wonderful, fresh, free pieces on paper” — work that mattered to him because it mattered to the artists, who considered them much more than disposable studies: “They traded them amongst each other, and they preserved them.” (Through Oct. 4, 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, 212-685-0008, themorgan.org.)Advertisement
