CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times        WASHINGTON —  Two days into his job as chief curator at the Smithsonian’s Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Stéphane Aquin is, as he would say, dépaysé — away from home and off kilter. Heading out to our breakfast meeting, he makes the mistake of hailing a cab which, in classic Washington fashion, takes him all over town before depositing him at his destination — a few minutes’ walk from where he started out. At a grill, hungry for an egg sandwich, Mr. Aquin is offered such a dizzying array of options that he switches his order to sausage, which arrives as pancake-shaped patties of meat. Not quite the saucisse he’d have been served at any bistro in his native Montreal.Mr. Aquin hopes this cultural distance gives him an advantage, as he takes charge of the curating at America’s national museum of modern art. “Close neighbors always play the role of observer,” he said. “We Canadians, and especially Québécois, see American culture from both afar and up close.” Melissa Chiu, the new Hirshhorn director who hired Mr. Aquin, believes that, with his roots on the periphery of American culture, his “sensitivity to other voices” suits a museum whose ambitions are global.The Hirshhorn’s counterparts are, or ought to be, Tate Modern in London and the Pompidou Center in Paris, national museums with vast international reach. But despite a site on the National Mall, within view of both the Capitol and the Washington Monument, the Hirshhorn has so far registered mostly as a local institution.Given its setting in a second-rank cultural center, it has mounted more than its share of world-class shows, on old standards such as Yves Klein but also on the latest in film and video. Mr. Aquin says that under his predecessor, Kerry Brougher, the Hirshhorn’s acquisitions “didn’t miss one important video work of the last 10 or 15 years.” But the institution has never quite lived up to its potential as the “the modern and contemporary museum of the American capital,” as Mr. Aquin describes it. His new job will be to see that it does.AdvertisementMr. Aquin is 55 but seems a decade younger. He’s slim, with what can be described as dark Gallic looks. (Just before Valentine’s Day, one New York editor was considering pitting Mr. Aquin against Massimiliano Gioni, his Italian counterpart at the New Museum, as nominees for art world “heartthrob of the year.”) He speaks in a highly cultured but distinctly Québécois French while often switching midsentence into near-perfect American English. (He went to elementary school in San Francisco.)AdvertisementIn Montreal, Mr. Aquin counts as cultural nobility: His father was the novelist Hubert Aquin, an icon of Quebec’s independence movement, who as it happens barely knew his son. Mr. Aquin’s parents separated when he was young — hence his childhood in San Francisco — and his father committed suicide when Mr. Aquin was a teenager. Yet that literary pedigree seems to linger: Mr. Aquin says that he has always been an insatiable reader, and cites Charles Baudelaire as his touchstone for artistic excellence.Mr. Aquin earned degrees in art history from the University of Montreal, and later, in the 1990s, made his name as the hotshot art critic at Voir, Montreal’s alternative newspaper. In 1998, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts made the unusual decision to recruit him as its curator of contemporary art. This bookworm critic turned out to have the common touch, staging exhibitions about the 1960s, Cuba and Andy Warhol that were popular, but that also had a scholarly backbone.His “Warhol Live” show was about the artist’s ties to dance and rock ’n’ roll — an accessible angle that also touched on the “performativity” that’s much discussed among expert Warholians. (Mr. Aquin’s departure for the United States won him billing as “Person of the Week” in Montreal’s main newspaper. Only in Canada could a cultural defector be given a hero’s send-off.)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

(The joke in Washington is that the Hirshhorn’s space-age architecture pulls in tourists who are actually looking for the National Air and Space Museum next door.)At the Hirshhorn, impact and vision, rather than dollars and bodies, may be the measure of Mr. Aquin’s success. He’ll never have the funding to compete, in resources, with Tate Modern or the Pompidou, let alone with the private fortunes of the Museum of Modern Art. But if he does his job well, the Hirshhorn could be to international art what the Supreme Court is to justice worldwide — a beacon and symbol of American understanding. For that to come true, Mr. Aquin will have to challenge the capital’s audience — and maybe his audience on the Capitol — with offerings that push far beyond the safe fare he turned out in Montreal.“The more adventurous the Hirshhorn can be, the better,” said Michelle Kuo, the editor in chief of the magazine Artforum. “Creating a surprise would be one of the best things they could do.” (A bold program may also help Hirshhorn-watchers forget the recent debacle around the architectural ambitions of former director Richard Koshalek, who resigned.)One exhibition that Mr. Aquin has dreamed of overseeing would again involve the “inexhaustible” Warhol, but this time as a sexual — a homosexual — figure. “One of the deep, driving impulses of his work is love and desire, expressed in voyeuristic tendencies and fetishistic forms — extreme ones,” Mr. Aquin said. That might just count as a brave project in a city where as recently as 2010 politicians got the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery to remove a work by a gay artist and where same-sex marriage can still tie Congress in knots.But to make the Hirshhorn truly speak globally, he might have to go even further. Despite the political winds he knows buffet the Smithsonian, a lot of whose funding comes from Capitol Hill, he begins to talk hesitantly about one idea among many that emerged from his first meetings with Hirshhorn curators: They’re thinking about a show “exploring the American ’60s, but seen through the lens of the Vietnam War,” Mr. Aquin said. It could include the infamous “And Babies?” poster, based on a photo of the My Lai massacre; Martha Rosler’s collages of the war invading American homes; and any number of landmark movies. That show would mean more at the Hirshhorn than anywhere else, Mr. Aquin said. It might also rekindle the debates that once burned around Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial, now seen by many as the greatest work of art on the mall.Mr. Aquin may be the man to bring off such a show. Ms. Chiu says she hired him partly for his people skills — a “compelling but gentle way.” Pierre Théberge, who gave Mr. Aquin his first curatorial position and later became director of Canada’s own National Gallery, again and again used the word “flexible” (souple), to describe him. When Mr. Théberge was on the acquisitions committee of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, he was impressed by how Mr. Aquin managed to sell committee members on a few difficult pieces, including a racially charged painting by Mickalene Thomas and a photo by Nobuyoshi Araki of a tattooed Japanese gangster having sex with a woman who seems to be in pain. Mr. Aquin bends when he confronts opposition, Mr. Théberge said, but he almost never cedes.AdvertisementThat makes this Québécois sound, already, like the ultimate Beltway insider.A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2015, on Page AR1 of the New York edition with the headline: From Observer to Guardian.
