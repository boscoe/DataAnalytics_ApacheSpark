The as-yet untitled song was, she said, about being in a not-very-big high school while dealing with a not-very-amicable breakup.She started it alone, sparsely strumming an electric guitar, her voice a thin, clear beacon of wounded pride. “I didn’t think you had to go to town,” she sang, “and tell everybody’s mom that I’m” — long, despondent pause — “sleeping around.” Then the strumming picked up steam and the drums kicked in, flipping the tune into whiplash mode.Diet Cig is a buzzed-about indie-rock duo — Ms. Luciano with drummer Noah Bowman — whose output fits neatly within the scope of this year. A byproduct of the college and house-party microcosm in New Paltz, N.Y., the band released its debut EP, “Over Easy” (Father/Daughter), in January. Its songs are low-fi and low stakes but emotionally direct, sometimes as raw and pithy as a Tumblr rant. “Scene Sick” has a girl-group beat and a disaffected air, opening with a line that could have been printed on official CMJ merchandise: “I’m sick of hearing about your band.”Ms. Luciano performed every song with a manic gleam, bouncing all over the tiny stage. She can still give the impression of someone playing for her friends in a living room, radiating breezy assurance.Two newer songs, released as a split seven-inch single last month, suggested that Diet Cig has been gaining some bulk along with its momentum. “Sleep Talk,” another song-to-my-ex, was nestled in a vignette of homecoming, and shaded with ambivalence. “And if I told you I loved you,” the chorus goes, “I don’t know who it would scare away faster.” Ms. Luciano sang this refrain with a light touch, already trained by experience to know precisely how it should play.Advertisement
