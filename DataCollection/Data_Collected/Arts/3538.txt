This week on Popcast: Reviewing the first season of “Empire,” which came to a calamitous end on Wednesday night with a two-hour episode that – spoiler alert – featured a murder, an attempted murder, an announced pregnancy and an arrest. The show has been renewed for a second season, and it will likely take the several months before it returns to process all that happened – “Empire” moves quickly, and does not stop for explanations.Since its premiere in January, it has been a runaway hit for Fox, and it’s beginning to have an effect in the real-life world of pop music that it depicts. It also serves as a strong rebuke to any television executives who’d argue that shows with predominantly black casts can’t have broad appeal.This week Jon Caramanica, the host of Popcast, was joined by Gilbert Cruz, television editor of The New York Times and “Empire” hyper-enthusiast, and Justin Charity, a writer at Complex who’s written extensively on the show and its music.Listen above, download the MP3 or subscribe in iTunes.
