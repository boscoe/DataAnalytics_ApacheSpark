The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington plans to present several new programs next season that will be curated by artists, the center’s new president, Deborah F. Rutter, announced on Tuesday.The new initiatives will be programmed by Jason Moran, the pianist who is the center’s artistic director for jazz; Mason Bates, its composer in residence; Chris Thile, the mandolin virtuoso and composer; and Damian Woetzel, the dancer and choreographer.“I hope to put the artist at the center of our conversation and have our artists provide illumination and commentary about contemporary events,” Ms. Rutter said in a statement.The Washington National Opera’s 60th-anniversary season will feature several notable productions, including Wagner’s “Ring” cycle, a revised version of “Appomattox” by Philip Glass, and Kurt Weill’s “Lost in the Stars,” starring the bass-baritone Eric Owens.The center’s dance offerings will include a new work it commissioned from Twyla Tharp, who is celebrating the 50th anniversary of her choreographic debut; the Suzanne Farrell Ballet presenting works by Balanchine; and performances by the Joffrey Ballet, New York City Ballet, and the Royal Swedish Ballet.
