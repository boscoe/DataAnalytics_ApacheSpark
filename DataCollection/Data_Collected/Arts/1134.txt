The Alfred A. Taubman collection again brought disappointing results for Sotheby’s, which guaranteed the sales for $515 million.Thursday night’s sale of 31 works from the American art collection of its former chairman, Alfred A. Taubman, totaled $13.04 million (including the buyer’s premium), below the low estimate of $15.1 million. Eight lots failed to sell.Sotheby’s did better with its regular sale of American art Thursday night, which brought $26.6 million; all but 10 of the 56 lots sold.The auction house raised $420 million from its previous two Taubman sales, leaving it some distance to go before making back the guarantee. (The total stands at $433 million). The next and last Taubman sale is of old masters on Jan. 27. And Sotheby’s may be able to sell the unsold Taubman works privately.Thursday night’s Taubman sale did have one big winner — Martin Johnson Heade, a  Luminist often referred to as “the Vermeer of American painting.”   His  “Great Florida Sunset” sold for $5.9 million, more than double the previous auction record for the artist — but less than the estimate of $7 million to $10 million.A version of this article appears in print on 11/20/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Taubman Sales Sag Again.
