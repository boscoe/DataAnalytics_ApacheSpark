You, there — you are worthy of love. How would you like to be loved this week? There are two options — two that count, at least.Thursday, take yourself to the Barclays Center. There, submit to the brawny tones of Neil Diamond. His voice is huskier than it once was, but it still smolders. Bring SPF 40. (8 p.m., 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, 800-745-3000, barclayscenter.com.)Prefer a smooth caress? Friday, head to Nassau Coliseum to see Barry Manilow, in what’s being billed as his last large-scale tour. (7:30 p.m., 1255 Hempstead Turnpike, Uniondale, N.Y., 800-745-3000, barrymanilow.com.)Pick one, but honestly, better to take advantage of the fact that they’re on back-to-back nights and pick them both. Everything that Mr. Diamond sets ablaze, Mr. Manilow can soothe. Allow yourself to be loved twice. You deserve it.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Pop; The Lengths to Go for Love.
