In a slow season for new albums, no one can beat Taylor Swift.The singer’s “1989” (Big Machine) claimed its 11th week at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart, selling another 108,000 units, including album sales and downloads, according to Nielsen Music. Since its release 15 weeks ago, “1989” has sold more than 4.2 million copies and never slipped lower than No. 2 on the chart. Its 11 weeks spent at No. 1 ties Ms. Swift’s longest previous reign with “Fearless” in 2008 and 2009.At No. 2 with 99,000 albums sold was the “NOW That’s What I Call Music! Vol. 53” compilation, which features hits by Mark Ronson, whose “Uptown Funk” scored a sixth week at No. 1 on the singles chart, Ed Sheeran, whose song “Thinking Out Loud” is No. 2, and Sam Smith. (The songs on “NOW” are not counted toward the sales total when downloaded individually, hurting its standing within Billboard’s new ranking formula.)Mr. Sheeran’s album, “x” (Atlantic), sold 97,000 units, good enough for No. 3, while Mr. Smith’s “In the Lonely Hour” came in at No. 4 with 86,000. Both artists’ totals relied heavily on streams, each counting more than 10 million for the week. “Reflection” by the “X Factor” group Fifth Harmony debuted at No. 5.Any Grammys sales bump for Mr. Sheeran, who was nominated and performed, or Mr. Smith, the night’s big winner, would be reflected next week. Ms. Swift, of course, appeared as well.
