LONDON — The singer and former Smiths frontman Morrissey won Literary Review’s Bad Sex in Fiction Award at a ceremony here for his debut novel, “List of the Lost.”Morrissey’s book follows four student-athletes who are saddled with a curse after an ill-fated encounter with a man who accosts them in a forest. Critics panned it after its release in the fall. It was hailed as an early favorite for the award, which is given annually by the London-based magazine.The book won for the following passage:“At this, Eliza and Ezra rolled together into the one giggling snowball of full-figured copulation, screaming and shouting as they playfully bit and pulled at each other in a dangerous and clamorous rollercoaster coil of sexually violent rotation with Eliza’s breasts barrel-rolled across Ezra’s howling mouth and the pained frenzy of his bulbous salutation extenuating his excitement as it whacked and smacked its way into every muscle of Eliza’s body except for the otherwise central zone.”Morrissey did not attend the awards ceremony, held Tuesday night.This year’s other nominees were “Before, During, After” by Richard Bausch, “Book of Numbers” by Joshua Cohen, “Against Nature” by Tomas Espedal, “Fates and Furies” by Lauren Groff, “The Martini Shot” by George Pelecanos and “Fear of Dying” by Erica Jong. (Ms. Jong’s book is a follow-up to her 1973 “Fear of Flying,” in which she coined a well-known term for “zipless,” or casual, sex. The passage for which she was nominated is unpublishable here.)Literary Review describes the award’s purpose as “to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them.” Erotic fiction does not qualify for the prize.The journal has awarded the prize since 1993. Past winners include Norman Mailer for “The Castle in the Forest,” Tom Wolfe for “I Am Charlotte Simmons” and Sebastian Faulks for “Charlotte Gray.” John Updike was awarded the Bad Sex in Fiction Award’s sole lifetime achievement title in 2008.
