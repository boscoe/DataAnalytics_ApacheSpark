This grouping of spare, elegant dances, performed in silence and to Bach, also introduces a new performance series at Abrons Arts Center: Travelogues, organized by Laurie Uprichard, formerly the director of Danspace Project and the Dublin Dance Festival. During Ms. Uprichard’s tenure at Danspace Project, Mr. Léveillé’s unadorned choreography was regularly on display; his 2012 production, which features Marc Parent’s austere lighting, is a chance to revisit Mr. Léveillé’s unaffected choreographic voice. The series will continue in May with a shared program by Kimberly Bartosik and Dylan Crossman, as well as in October with separate engagements by the Irish company ponydance and the Los Angeles choreographer Lionel Popkin.   (Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side; 212-352-3101, abronsartscenter.org).
