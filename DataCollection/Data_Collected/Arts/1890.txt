For the music business, this Christmas was all about the Beatles and Adele.The Beatles made their long-awaited entry into the streaming market on Christmas Eve, bringing 17 albums — the bulk of the band’s catalog, with some exceptions — to subscription streaming services around the world, including Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal and Amazon Prime.Numbers are still being tallied, but the Fab Four are clearly a streaming hit. In a blog post on Sunday, Daniel Ek, a co-founder of Spotify, said that in the Beatles’ first three days on the service, its songs were streamed 70 million times. More than 65 percent of the group’s listeners there were under the age of 34, Mr. Ek said, which may also be a reflection of Spotify’s young-leaning clientele.Despite the Beatles’ success, the week once again belonged to Adele, whose album “25” (XL/Columbia)  appears to have been a hugely popular stocking stuffer. The album marks its fifth week at No. 1 on Billboard’s album chart with 1.16 million copies sold, according to Nielsen data reported by Billboard.That is up 47 percent from the week before, and marks the second-biggest week of sales for “25” after its record-breaking debut in November. Since it came out, “25” has sold more than seven million copies in the United States alone, with one week of sales still left in the year.Down the chart, Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” (RBMG/Def Jam) holds at No. 2; Chris Brown’s new album, “Royalty” (RCA), opens at No. 3; and Pentatonix’s “That’s Christmas to Me” (RCA) is No. 4.Also this week, the soundtrack to “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (Disney), with music by John Williams, opened at No. 5. It is the sixth soundtrack in the series to reach the Top 10, according to Billboard — only the “Return of the Jedi” album, in 1983, failed to reach that level, peaking at No. 20.A version of this article appears in print on 12/29/2015, on page C4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Streamers Welcome the Beatles.
