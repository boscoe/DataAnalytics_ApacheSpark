On his new album, “Intents & Purposes,” he addresses fusion as a literature, playing songs by bands like Weather Report in an acoustic context — as he will here, with the vibraphonist Bill Ware, the bassist Stephan Crump and the drummer Eric McPherson. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.

More information is at cbjcjazz.org. (Chinen)Stanley Clarke Band  (Tuesday through May 10) The bass virtuoso Stanley Clarke has a peppy recent album, “Up,” that makes a show of his breadth, ranging from chamber miniatures to fusion odysseys, with special guests. Here Mr. Clarke leads a four-piece band featuring the pianist Beka Gochiashvili, the keyboardist Cameron Graves and the drummer Michael Mitchell. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ The Claudia Quintet  (Wednesday through May 8) Led by the drummer John Hollenbeck — whose next big band album, “Songs We Like a Lot,” reimagines Cyndi Lauper and Daft Punk — this chamber-jazz unit occupies its own unclassifiable space. With Chris Speed on reeds, Red Wierenga on accordion and piano, Drew Gress on bass and Matt Moran on vibraphone, it’s a model of shifting texture and smart rapport. This three-night run will be recorded for a future live release. Wednesday and Thursday at 8:30 and 10 p.m., Friday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.

The album features a series of vocalists, but this weekend Mr. Greene simply enlists the pianist Orrin Evans, the bassist Luke Sellick and the drummer Jimmy Macbride, a solid rhythm team. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Instant Composers Pool Orchestra  (Wednesday through May 8) The name of this 10-piece Dutch ensemble, often abbreviated to ICP Orchestra, conveys both the immediacy and the integrity of its mission.

(Chinen)Jason Lindner Big Band  (Friday and Saturday) The pianist and keyboardist Jason Lindner has been a busy rhythm scientist, bringing authority to a range of bands concerned mainly with depth of groove.

Appearing as part of the Jazz Gallery’s 20th anniversary festivities, the group looks both forward and backward. At 8 and 10 p.m., 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Brad Mehldau Trio  (Tuesday through May 10) The pianist Brad Mehldau has led this iteration of his pace-setting trio — with the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Jeff Ballard — since 2005, and it has evolved into a graceful powerhouse, equally savvy about groove and harmony. There’s still no better place to hear the band than the Village Vanguard, a special room for Mr. Mehldau and for his devoted base. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com; some shows sold out. (Chinen)★ New York Hot Jazz Festival  (Sunday) This daylong marathon of roughly Prohibition-era jazz, on multiple stages in a properly historic setting, will feature a cavalcade of musicians working fastidiously in the style. In this third edition of the festival, that lineup includes Evan Christopher, with his band Clarinet Road; the Hot Sardines; the trombonist Wycliffe Gordon and friends; Bill Charlap, playing stride piano; and the Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band.

From noon to 2 a.m., the Players Club, 16 Gramercy Park South, at Irving Place, Manhattan, nyhotjazzfest.com. (Nate Chinen)Dan Nimmer Trio  (Monday and Tuesday) Dan Nimmer, an engaging pianist with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, has a fondness for the small-group signature of Wynton Kelly.

Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)★ Arturo O’Farrill & The Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra  (Friday and Saturday) The pianist Arturo O’Farrill recently made a pilgrimage to Cuba, his father’s homeland, with members of the Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra, his flagship band. “Cuba: The Conversation Continued” — an ambitious album recorded in Havana late last year, and due out this summer — will provide most of the substance for this concert, featuring the orchestra along with the Cuban composer-performers Alexis Bosch, Cotó and Yasek Manzano. (As on the album, the repertory will also include pieces by Americans: in this case, Michele Rosewoman and Rudresh Mahanthappa.) At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Chinen)Enrico Pieranunzi Quartet  (through Sunday) Enrico Pieranunzi is one of the leading jazz pianists in Italy, a careful rhapsodist with a more than casual appreciation of the Bill Evans style.

At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Sara Serpa  (Sunday) Ms. Serpa, a vocalist, and André Matos, a guitarist, recently made a calmly stunning duo album, “Primavera,” that capitalizes on their many affinities: as limber improvisers, as thoughtful composers, as selfless ensemble players, and as internationalists hailing originally from Portugal (by way of Boston and New York). They revisit some of that music in good company, with Leo Genovese on piano and Dan Weiss on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com.

At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0368, roulette.org. (Chinen)Leni Stern’s African Trio / Surface to Air  (Friday) Leni Stern, a guitarist and vocalist with an ethereal sensibility, has been focusing intently on West African music; her partners here, both from Senegal, will be the electric bassist Mamadou Ba and the percussionist Alioune Faye.

(Chinen)Marcus Strickland’s Twi-Life  (Wednesday) Mr. Strickland is a tenor and soprano saxophonist of postbop assurance, but Twi-Life represents an outlet for the millennial soul music in which he also traffics. With Jean Baylor on vocals, he appears as part of this year’s Harlem Jazz Shrines Festival. At 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, 212-281-9240, harlemstage.org.

(Nate Chinen)Joe Temperley and Wess Anderson  (Friday through Sunday) On the heels of a concert program celebrating Joe Temperley — the longtime baritone saxophonist in the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, and the Duke Ellington Orchestra before that — this booking features Mr. Temperley in a cozier setting. Alongside Mr. Anderson, a soulful alto saxophonist, he leads a group with the pianist Richard Johnson, the bassist Yasushi Nakamura and the drummer Willie Jones III. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org.

(Chinen)★ David Virelles Trio  (Saturday) Mr. Virelles, a serious young pianist, has made it his mission to interrogate the folkloric root systems of Afro-Cuban life. Throughout his excellent recent album “Mbókò,” he did so with an ensemble including the bassist Thomas Morgan, who rejoins him here. On drums is Nasheet Waits, who knows how to bring any high-flown concept down to eye level without losing the point. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Cell, 338 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 646-861-2253, thecelltheatre.org.

At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)Advertisement
