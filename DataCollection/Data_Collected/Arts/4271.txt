She’s 90. He’s 84. Between them they have three Tony Awards and five nominations. But you have to go all the way back to 1966 for the last time Cicely Tyson and James Earl Jones shared a Broadway stage.New York will have them back this fall, starring in a revival of D.L. Coburn’s two-hander “The Gin Game.” Producers announced on Wednesday that the Pulitzer Prize-winning play, directed by Leonard Foglia, will begin previews Sept. 21 and open Oct. 13 at the Golden Theater.Mr. Jones, a Tony winner for “Fences” and “The Great White Hope,” had a supporting role earlier this Broadway season in “You Can’t Take It With You.” Ms. Tyson won the lead actress Tony in 2013 for “The Trip to Bountiful.”They appeared together on Broadway in “A Hand Is on the Gate” in 1966, in a long-running Off Broadway production of Jean Genet’s “The Blacks,” and in several films. They will take the stage for eight performances a week at the same theater where “The Gin Game” — an evening-length conversation between card players in a nursing home — had its premiere in 1977, starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. The show was revived in 1997 with Charles Durning and Julie Harris.
