Nicholas Brody, the double agent played by Damian Lewis.Just over 4,100 miles, to be specific. That’s the distance between the Washington area and Berlin, the location of the Showtime thriller’s fifth season, which ends Dec. 20. Along the way Carrie had a baby, Mr. Lewis moved on and the show has been declared dead and resuscitated multiple times. But its twisty narrative about international terrorists and their pursuers remains as relevant as ever, alas.Before creating “Homeland” with Howard Gordon, Mr. Gansa was a writer and producer on series ranging from “24” to “Dawson’s Creek.” He was also one of many acclaimed TV creators who came through the “X-Files” shop in the 1990s (see also: Vince Gilligan, Frank Spotnitz, et. al).Mr. Gansa won an Emmy in 2012 for writing the pilot for “Homeland,” which was also named the top drama for its debut season. Please leave questions for him in the comments. We will post his responses to some of them soon.Previously we heard from Noah Hawley of “Fargo”; Sarah Treem of “The Affair”; and Damon Lindelof of “The Leftovers,” among others.Advertisement
