John Douglas Thompson and Aaron Clifton Moten will star in “Young Man Langston,” a dramatic reading of the letters of Langston Hughes that has its premiere at the Unterberg Poetry Center of the 92nd Street Y on Feb. 23. Mr. Moten, who will star in Annie Baker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play “The Flick” at the Barrow Street Theater in May, will read the part of the young Hughes. Mr. Thompson, who appears in the production of “The Iceman Cometh” beginning this week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, will read the part of the narrator.  The script is by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel, editors of the newly published “Selected Letters of Langston Hughes,” who will also hold an onstage conversation following the reading. The piece draws on Hughes’s early years as a poet, from the publication of his signature poem, “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” in 1921, to his travels in the South, to his life in New York at the height of the Harlem Renaissance. That is  represented by correspondence with Zora Neale Hurston, Countee Cullen, Carl Van Vechten and others. Hughes made three appearances at the Poetry Center, including during its inaugural season in 1940.A version of this article appears in print on 02/06/2015, on page C2 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Langston Hughes Reading.
