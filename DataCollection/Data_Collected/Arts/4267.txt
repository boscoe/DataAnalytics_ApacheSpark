Two years ago, Shawn Mendes, a high school student in Pickering, Ontario, began covering popular songs on Vine, the mobile app that specializes in six-second videos. As the videos spread online he came to be seen as the next Justin Bieber — a baby-faced crooner with a mastery of social media — and today Mr. Mendes, 16, has taken a big step in that direction with a No. 1 album.His album, “Handwritten” (Island), opens at the top of Billboard’s chart with 106,000 sales and 4.8 million streams, according to Nielsen Music. Mr. Mendes’s stream of mini-videos on Vine — a strikingly efficient form of mercenary marketing — helped promote the record, as did being named an opening act on Taylor Swift’s world tour. According to Billboard, Mr. Mendes, who is 16 years 8 months old, is the youngest person to reach No. 1 in five years; the last, in May 2010, was Mr. Bieber, whose age at the time was 16 years 2 months.Also this week, the soundtrack to “Furious 7” (Atlantic) fell one spot to No. 2 and three new albums opened high on the chart. Reba McEntire starts at No. 3 with “Love Somebody” (Nash Icon), the rapper Tyler, the Creator is No. 4 with “Cherry Bomb” (Odd Future/Sony) and the hard-rock band Halestorm bows in fifth place with “Into the Wild Life” (Atlantic).The “Fifty Shades of Grey” soundtrack (Republic) fell three sports to No. 6, and Ms. Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine) falls out of the Top 5 for the first time in its 25 weeks of release, slipping to No. 7.
