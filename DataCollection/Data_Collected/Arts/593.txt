It’s only a matter of time until the sleepy Billboard charts get a jolt, with major November releases scheduled from Adele, Justin Bieber and One Direction. In the meantime, an a cappella group without much radio play can keep the No. 1 spot warm.Pentatonix, the vocal quintet known for its cover songs and Christmas carols, made its debut atop the album chart this week with its first collection of originals. The group’s self-titled album, released by RCA, sold 88,000 albums and its songs were played 7.8 million times on streaming services for a total of more than 98,000 album equivalent units counting streams and individual track downloads, according to Nielsen Music.Close behind was the former Disney actress Demi Lovato, whose “Confident” (Safehouse/Island/Hollywood) sold 77,000 albums and had 11.9 million streams, narrowly falling short of No. 1. “Beauty Behind the Madness” by the Weeknd — the 25-year-old Canadian singer Abel Tesfaye — held at No. 3 for a second straight week, selling 62,000 units, after spending three weeks last month at No. 1. The rapper Machine Gun Kelly’s “General Admission” came in at No. 4, with 56,000 units sold, while the robot-rap crooner Fetty Wap’s self-titled album was No. 5, selling 48,000 units.Mr. Bieber and Adele, meanwhile, are ramping up: both released singles last week, with Mr. Bieber’s “Sorry” — from the album “Purpose,” due Nov. 13 — totaling more than 40 million combined plays on Spotify and YouTube since Thursday. Adele’s song “Hello,” which had its debut on Friday, broke the Vevo record for most video streams in 24 hours — 27.7 million — topping the 20.1 million for Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood” earlier this year. Adele’s album, “25,” will be released Nov. 20.A version of this article appears in print on 10/27/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Pentatonix Tops Chart.
