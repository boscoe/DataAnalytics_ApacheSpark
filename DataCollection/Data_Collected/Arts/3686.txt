The winningest actress in Broadway history has sharply criticized the passage of a law in Indiana that opponents say would allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians.Audra McDonald, who has won a record six Tony Awards, lodged her objections with a flurry of tweets in which she briefly contemplated canceling upcoming concert appearances in Indiana, but then decided instead to give profits to gay rights organizations. Ms. McDonald is on a concert tour that includes two scheduled stops in Indiana, on April 7 in Bloomington and on April 25 in Indianapolis.Ms. McDonald, who most recently appeared on Broadway in “Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar and Grill,” has been a longtime and vocal supporter of same-sex marriage — in 2011 she traveled to Albany to lobby the New York legislature on the issue, and she has built her concern into her Twitter handle, which is @AudraEqualityMc.Indiana Governor Mike Pence on Thursday signed a law that supporters said would protect religious freedom by restricting the government’s ability to compel religious business owners to act in violation of their beliefs, but that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Ms. McDonald began posting her objections to the Indiana law on Thursday afternoon:.@GovPenceIN Some in my band are gay & we have 2 gigs in your state next month. Should we call ahead to make sure the hotel accepts us all?— Audra McDonald (@AudraEqualityMc) 26 Mar 15She offered a sarcastic solution:.@GovPenceIN or maybe I should fire my gay band members just to be on the safe side.— Audra McDonald (@AudraEqualityMc) 26 Mar 15And pondered boycotting the state:.@GovPenceIN Or MAYBE…we need to stick to singing in states that don’t legislate hate?
