The Barack Obama Foundation has asked seven architectural firms to submit proposals for the design of the Obama Presidential Center on Chicago’s South Side.After announcing in September that 140 firms had expressed interest, the foundation said, in a statement on its website Monday, that it had issued a formal request for proposal to seven firms. These are: Adjaye Associates, of London; four New York firms, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, SHoP Architects, Snohetta, and Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects; Chicago’s John Ronan Architects; and Renzo Piano Building Workshop, of Genoa, Italy.Two parks near the University of Chicago’s campus on the South Side are being considered as the site: Washington Park, a 380-acre space that borders several neighborhoods, including Washington Park and Hyde Park; and Jackson Park, which hugs both Lake Michigan and the Woodlawn neighborhood.The finalists must prepare plans for both sites, the foundation said. The center will include a library to house the presidential archives; a museum; and space for other programs.According to The Chicago Sun-Times, the final design is expected to be selected in the second quarter of 2016.A version of this article appears in print on 12/23/2015, on page C6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Design Proposals Sought for an Obama Center.
