A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Harry Allen Quartet  (Saturday) Ebullient swing is always a priority for the tenor saxophonist Harry Allen, who displays a breezy familiarity with midcentury modern conventions. His quartet includes the pianist Rossano Sportiello, the bassist Joel Forbes and the drummer Kevin Kanner. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Nate Chinen)★ Peter Bernstein Quartet  (through Sunday) The astute hard-bop guitarist Peter Bernstein can always be trusted in a quartet setting, and this one has a fine lineup: the pianist Gerald Clayton, the bassist Doug Weiss and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Terence Blanchard E-Collective  (Wednesday through May 31) The trumpeter and composer Terence Blanchard has a new album, “Breathless,” that represents both his plunge into electric fusion and his foray into sociopolitical protest. (Its title refers to the slogan “I Can’t Breathe.”) He celebrates the album’s release next week with a new band that features Fabian Almazan on piano and synthesizer, Charles Altura on guitar, Donald Ramsey on bass and Oscar Seaton on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)Matt Brewer Quintet  (Friday) Matt Brewer has established a foothold as one of the stalwart young bassists on the progressive jazz scene, in bands led by the alto saxophonists Greg Osby and Steve Lehman. He leads a quintet with Mr. Lehman, the tenor saxophonist Kyle Wilson, the guitarist Lage Lund and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ George Cables Trio  (Tuesday through May 31) The pianist George Cables has an elegant and gracious recent album, “Icons & Influences,” that pays homage to an array of former colleagues or associates, like the saxophonist Joe Henderson and the pianist Mulgrew Miller. He’ll engage with the same loose framework during this engagement, with Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Bill Charlap Trio  (through Sunday, and Tuesday through May 31) The pianist Bill Charlap has become a trusted docent of the American Songbook through his decade-long programming role at the 92nd Street Y. But his interaction with jazz standards finds no clearer or more illuminating results than in this spruce trio, with Peter Washington on bass and Kenny Washington (they are not related) on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Nels Cline, Larry Ochs and Gerald Cleaver  (Tuesday) The guitarist Nels Cline, the saxophonist Larry Ochs and the drummer Gerald Cleaver share a feeling for exploratory narrative and bristling texture. They have also shared a stage, in one setting or another — but never before as an improvising trio, which should give this concert an extra push in the direction of discovery. At 8 p.m., Jack, 505 1/2 Waverly Avenue, between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue, Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, www.jackny.org. (Chinen)Miles Davis Celebration  (Friday through Sunday) This tribute to Miles Davis features two alumni of his bands — the drummer Al Foster and the alto saxophonist Gary Bartz — and one of his leading trumpet heirs, Eddie Henderson. Rounding out the band are the pianist Orrin Evans and the bassist Ed Howard. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)Mark Dresser at the Stone  (Tuesday through May 31) A master of abstract texture and extended techniques, the bassist Mark Dresser will be in residence next week at the Stone, with a different configuration for each set. He’ll begin with a solo invocation at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. Among the other early highlights are a set by Trio M, at 8 p.m. on Wednesday; and Deep Tones for Peace Bass Ensemble, a bone-rattling bass choir that includes Rufus Reed, Mark Helias, Ken Filiano and Lindsey Horner, on Thursday at 10 p.m. At Avenue C and Second Street, thestonenyc.com. (Chinen)Alan Ferber Nonet  (Tuesday) On his 2010 album, “Chamber Songs,” the trombonist and composer Alan Ferber presents a body of work scored for a hybrid jazz nonet and string ensemble. Mr. Ferber goes without the strings here, though that shouldn’t suggest a limitation on his textural possibilities, especially with sure-footed improvisers like the saxophonist John Ellis in the mix. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Kenny Garrett  (Friday through Sunday) Focus has never seemed a problem for the alto and soprano saxophonist Kenny Garrett, who at 54 still possesses the taut, molten sound that made him a force about 30 years ago. His chosen path as a bandleader builds on the mid-’60s terrain of the John Coltrane Quartet, and there’ll be a typical amount of slashing polyrhythm and modal expedition in this weekend run. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, 212-582-2121, theiridium.com. (Chinen)Vinny Golia  (Saturday) Mr. Golia, a multireedist and pillar of the West Coast improv scene, performs a pair of sets with the earthy but pliable rhythm team of Max Johnson on bass and Tom Rainey on drums; for the second set, they’ll be joined by Ingrid Laubrock, an adventurous tenor saxophonist. At 8:30 and 9:30 p.m., I Beam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Chinen)★ Fred Hersch Duo Invitation Series  (through Sunday) Mr. Hersch, a sophisticated and abidingly melodic pianist, has made a tradition of engaging in musical tête-à-têtes at Jazz Standard. He connects on Friday with the intuitive saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, and on Saturday with his fellow piano master Kenny Barron. Sunday’s guest will be the violinist Regina Carter. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)★ Dave Holland & Prism  (through Sunday) As on a recent album with the same title, the bassist-bandleader Dave Holland digs back into knockabout jazz-funk mode with Prism, a road-tested band featuring a famous old colleague, the guitarist Kevin Eubanks, along with the brilliant pianist Craig Taborn and the indomitable drummer Eric Harland. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)★ ‘Ron Horton Quintet Plays the Music of Andrew Hill’  (Friday) Before he died in 2007, the brilliant pianist-composer Andrew Hill saw his music find traction among younger musicians. No one was more deeply involved with it than the trumpeter and arranger Ron Horton, who revisits that realm with a band of peers: the multireedist Marty Ehrlich, the pianist Frank Kimbrough, the bassist Martin Wind and the drummer Tim Horner. (An opening set at 8 p.m. will feature Mr. Kimbrough in a duo with the bass clarinetist and alto saxophonist Anthony Orji.) At 9:30 p.m., I Beam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com. (Chinen)★ George Lewis: ‘Afterword: The AACM (as) Opera’  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Lewis, an accomplished composer and scholar, has also been the chief historian of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, now celebrating its 50th anniversary. This concert program, featuring the International Contemporary Ensemble and adapted from an opera that will have its premiere in Chicago this fall, builds on research Mr. Lewis did for his landmark 2008 book, “A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music” (University of Chicago Press). At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)Ibrahim Maalouf: ‘Kalthoum’  (Monday) Born in Beirut but raised in Paris, Ibrahim Maalouf has in some ways carried the mantle of his father, Nassim: Both have made a specialty of playing Arabic music, with classical precision, on the four-valve quarter-tone trumpet. For these concerts, the younger Mr. Maalouf will interpret the music of the great Arabic singer Oum Kalthoum, with a band that includes the saxophonist Mark Turner, the pianist Frank Woeste and the drummer Clarence Penn. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Kyoko Oyobe Quartet  (Friday) The pianist Kyoko Oyobe, originally from Japan but an emerging presence in New York for the last decade, has a new album, “Happy Silence,” that showcases the drifting elegance of her style. She celebrates the album’s release with her regular quartet, featuring the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the bassist Michael O’Brien and the drummer Matt Wilson. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)Nate Radley Quartet  (Saturday) A perceptive young guitarist with an introspective but assertive style, Nate Radley has a recent album, “Morphoses,” that features his regular compatriot Loren Stillman on alto saxophone. They reconnect here with a fine rhythm team consisting of Drew Gress on bass, and Mark Ferber on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Jerome Sabbagh Trio  (Saturday) The tenor saxophonist Jerome Sabbagh has worked increasingly often in a pianoless trio setting, typically with bass and drums. His bassist for this cozy one-nighter is Joe Martin; his drummer is Eric McPherson. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com. (Chinen)Ben Sidran and Alexis Cuadrado  (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Sidran is a singer-songwriter, pianist, raconteur and historian whose new album, “Blue Camus,” makes its subtext perfectly clear. He plays material from it, among other things, in this duo stand with the bassist Alexis Cuadrado. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Mezzrow, 163 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village, 646-476-4346, mezzrow.com. (Chinen)Matthew Stevens Group  (Tuesday) Matthew Stevens is a young guitarist who navigates with ease among jazz, indie-rock and soul; he was last seen in these parts a week ago, as a member of Esperanza Spalding’s tough new band. Here he draws from his own assured new album, “Woodwork,” re-enlisting its excellent rhythm section: Gerald Clayton on acoustic and Fender Rhodes piano, Vicente Archer on bass, and Eric Doob on drums. At 7:30 and 10 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)Tom Tallitsch ‘All Together Now’ Sextet  (Sunday) Tom Tallitsch is a tenor saxophonist whose new album, “All Together Now,” highlights his strengths in a swinging mode. Celebrating the album’s release, he leads a band with Mike DiRubbo on alto saxophone, David Gibson on trombone, Brian Charette on piano, Peter Brendler on bass and Mark Ferber on drums. At 6 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)★ Ohad Talmor Grand Ensemble  (Friday and Saturday) The saxophonist and composer Ohad Talmor has worked with large-canvas orchestration before, but rarely with as much momentous flair as he does in this aptly named band. Its lineup, with a total of 18 musicians, includes prominent peers like the trumpeter Shane Endsley, the trombonist Jacob Garchik, the saxophonist Josh Sinton and the drummer Dan Weiss. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at 27th Street, fifth floor, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Glenn Zaleski Trio  (Tuesday) A smart young pianist with a mellow gleam in his tone, Glenn Zaleski recently made a strong statement with “My Ideal,” effectively his debut album as a leader. He’ll surely draw from its style and repertory in this appearance, with Karl McComas-Reichl on bass, and Colin Stranahan on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, near Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Advertisement
