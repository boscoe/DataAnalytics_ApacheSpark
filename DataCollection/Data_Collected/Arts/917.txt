President Obama has been quite clear about how much he likes the new musical “Hamilton.” And last week, he managed to boost its grosses past those of Broadway’s longtime leader, “The Lion King.”“Hamilton,” the hip-hop musical about Alexander Hamilton and America’s Founding Fathers, grossed $1,772,253, slightly above the $1,764,832 grossed by “The Lion King,” Disney’s ever-popular global hit, according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League for the week ending Nov. 8. But the comparison is imperfect, because “Hamilton” had nine performances last week, while “The Lion King” had eight. “Hamilton” added a performance that was paid for by Democratic Party organizations, which resold the tickets for fund-raising purposes. The lure was not just the hard-to-get-into musical; the event also featured a post-show speech by Mr. Obama.Last week was a generally strong one for Broadway, rebounding after a down Halloween weekend. The top-grossing shows were “Hamilton,” “The Lion King,” “Wicked” and “The Book of Mormon,” while the lowest-grossing shows that ran a full week were “Hand to God,” “Dames at Sea,” “Fool for Love” and “Sylvia.”Two new musicals opened last week — “On Your Feet!”, about Gloria and Emilio Estefan, which seems to be emerging as the first post-“Hamilton” musical hit, and “Allegiance,” inspired by George Takei’s time in a Japanese-American internment camp. “On Your Feet!” grossed $1,070,197; “Allegiance,” which officially opened on Sunday night, grossed $420,978. The grosses for both shows were affected by free tickets given to to members of the media for press nights and theater industry guests on opening night.
