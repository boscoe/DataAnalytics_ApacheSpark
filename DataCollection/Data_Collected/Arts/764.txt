Broadway loves a good costume drama. But Halloween, not so much.The holiday apparently spooked potential theatergoers, many of whom chose to trick or treat somewhere other than at one of the 33 shows running on Broadway. Halloween is usually an off night — parents often opt to be with their children, rather than at the theater, and suburbanites opt to avoid Manhattan — and this year it was exacerbated because the holiday fell on a Saturday, which is traditionally a big day for theatergoing, with two performances of most shows.Overall, Broadway shows grossed $22.8 million during the week that ended Nov. 1, a significant drop from $27.4 million the week before, according to the Broadway League. Several other factors may have contributed: the New York City Marathon, which made hotel rooms less available and streets more crowded, and a brief Telecharge outage on Friday.Of course, Halloween is all about the big scare, and the scariest show on Broadway — a theatrical adaptation of Stephen King’s “Misery” — was an exception: The play, starring Bruce Willis and Laurie Metcalf, grossed $906,961 in eight preview performances.Another conspicuous exception: “China Doll,” a new play by David Mamet, which grossed a whopping $1.2 million in seven preview performances. Like “Misery,” “China Doll” is led by a movie star, Al Pacino, whose box office draw is significant. With an average of $163.80 per ticket, “China Doll” had the highest average ticket price on Broadway last week, surpassing longtime price leader “The Book of Mormon.”The top-grossing shows of the week were “The Lion King,” “Hamilton,” “Mormon” and “Wicked.” The lowest-grossing productions were “Hand to God,” “Dames at Sea,” “Spring Awakening” and “Sylvia.”“Hand to God” has announced that it will close in January; “Dames at Sea” and “Sylvia” each had a significant number of nonpaying audience members because, as all shows do, they gave free tickets to press and Tony voters upon opening.A version of this article appears in print on 11/04/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Halloween, as Usual,Is Scary on Broadway.
