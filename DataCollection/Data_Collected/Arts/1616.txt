Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz. A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Geri Allen, Terri Lyne Carrington, Esperanza Spalding (Tuesday through Dec. 20) Ms. Allen, a wise and adaptable pianist, teams up with Ms. Carrington, a veteran jazz and funk drummer, and Ms. Spalding, a stylistically fluid bassist and singer. Their trio, sometimes billed as ACS, works with a go-anywhere derivation of the mainstream acoustic jazz tradition, grounded but elastic. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Nate Chinen)Fabian Almazan: ‘Rhizome’ (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Almazan, a serious-minded pianist originally from Cuba, draws from his most recent album, “Rhizome,” with a chamberlike ensemble that includes Camila Meza on guitar and vocals, Linda Oh on bass, Henry Cole on drums, and a dynamic string quartet. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)Big Band Holidays (Thursday though Dec. 19) Jazz at Lincoln Center’s holiday concert has become a seasonal staple in New York, a festive showcase for the organization’s house orchestra. As on “Big Band Holidays,” a new compilation culled from the last several years’ worth of concerts, the band will play zesty arrangements of songs like “We Three Kings,” with vocal reinforcements — in this case, from Denzal Sinclaire and Audrey Shakir. At 8 p.m. (with an additional 2 p.m. show on Dec. 19), Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org. (Chinen)Advertisement★ Bill Charlap and Renee Rosnes (Tuesday through Dec. 20) Mr. Charlap and Ms. Rosnes are jazz pianists of comparable achievement; since 2007 they have also been partners by marriage. Their collaborative history is distinguished, including the album “Double Portrait” and portions of the latest triumph by Tony Bennett. They perform next week in a strictly duo format, notwithstanding the possibility of an unexpected guest or two. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.net. (Chinen)★ 577 Forward Festival (Saturday through Monday) This three-day affair coalesces in tribute to a single figure: Daniel Carter, a saxophonist, flutist, trumpeter and clarinetist who has garnered a large amount of good will in the amorphous jazz avant-garde. Partly organized as a 70th birthday celebration, it will feature Mr. Carter amid a range of his peers and admirers, including the trombonist Steve Swell, the bassist William Parker and the drummers G. Calvin Weston and Chad Taylor. For a schedule and tickets, call 718-577-1218, or visit 577records.com. Starting at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday, 7 p.m. on Sunday and 7:30 p.m. on Monday, Scholes Street Studio, 375 Lorimer Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn. (Chinen)★ Mary Halvorson Octet (Tuesday and Wednesday) The guitarist Mary Halvorson has gradually been expanding her palette as a bandleader-composer, with the notable exception of “Meltframe,” the solo album she released this year. Her octet, making its public debut here, includes regular associates like the trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson, the alto saxophonist Jon Irabagon and the tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock — and, bringing some potential for intrigue, Susan Alcorn on pedal steel guitar. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)AdvertisementHoliday Swing (Friday through Sunday) This upbeat celebration of holiday classics, a recent tradition at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, will feature three charismatic vocalists — Michael Mwenso, Brianna Thomas and Charenee Wade — backed by a band that includes the pianist Chris Pattishall, the trumpeter Alphonso Horne, and the drummers Joe Saylor and Jamison Ross. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys.

At 6 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)★ Rudresh Mahanthappa: ‘Bird Calls’ (Saturday) “Bird Calls,” the audacious new album by the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, takes Charlie Parker as a point of departure, if not a distant lexicographical ancestor. Mr. Mahanthappa reconnects with the sharp young trumpeter Adam O’Farrill, and a rhythm section consisting of the pianist Matt Mitchell, the bassist Thomson Kneeland and the drummer Dan Weiss. At 8 p.m., Miller Theater, 2960 Broadway at 116th Street, 212-854-7799, millertheatre.com. (Chinen)Christian McBride (through Sunday) The bassist Christian McBride leads the new group he has taken to calling his “New Jawn” — a quartet with the trumpeter Josh Evans, the saxophonist Marcus Strickland and the drummer Nasheet Waits. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)Ed Reed Trio (Tuesday through Thursday) Mr. Reed is a jazz singer well known in the San Francisco Bay Area for his gallant cool and his harrowing back story: a former heroin addict, he did time at San Quentin Prison back when its house band included the saxophonists Art Pepper and Frank Morgan. At 86, Mr. Reed is enjoying something like a late-career renaissance, working here with the pianist George Cables, the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Akira Tana. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)Eric Reed and the Source (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Reed has a precise, percussive relationship with the piano, and roughly the same inclinations as both an improviser and a bandleader: he favors syncopation and poise, spontaneity and control. Those are qualities well suited to his quartet for this weekend run, which features the alto saxophonist Tim Green, the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer McClenty Hunter. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, 212-864-6662, smokejazz.com. (Chinen)★ Helen Sung: ‘Sung With Words’ (Thursday) Ms. Sung is a pianist-composer drawn to clarity, in terms of both her touch and the contours of her designs. “Sung With Words,” the product of a collaboration with the poet Dana Gioia, features his text and her music, conceived for an ensemble with two vocalists, Carmen Lundy and Carolyn Leonhart; also aboard are the trumpeter Ingrid Jensen and the saxophonist and bass clarinetist John Ellis. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, at West 27th Street, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)★ Henry Threadgill’s Double Up Ensemble (Monday and Tuesday) Mr. Threadgill, the restlessly inventive multi-reedist and composer, released a potent double album this year, featuring the longtime band he calls Zooid. For this concert he’ll have a larger canvas, with a roster including the alto saxophonists Román Filiú and Curtis MacDonald, and the pianists Jason Moran and David Virelles. Monday’s program will feature “Old Locks and Irregular Verbs,” a tribute to the composer Butch Morris that first brought this cohort together last year; Tuesday’s concert will include the premiere of a new commission, “Double-Up Plays Double Up Plus,” built to accommodate a third pianist, David Bryant. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, 917-267-0363, roulette.org. (Chinen)Three Concentric Sections IX (Sunday) The baritone saxophonist Josh Sinton organizes Three Concentric Sections, a series of performances featuring several boundary-pushing bands, at Threes Brewing in Brooklyn. The ninth installment will begin at 8 p.m. with Jon Lundbom’s Big Five Chord, led by Mr. Lundbom, a guitarist; at 9 p.m., the saxophonist Jessica Lurie will lead her band Bravadas, which includes Marika Hughes on cello and Mazz Swift on violin. The final set, at 10 p.m., will feature Overseas, a tuneful proposition led by the bassist Eivind Opsvik. At 333 Douglass Street, at Fourth Avenue, Gowanus, 718-522-2110, threesbrewing.com.
