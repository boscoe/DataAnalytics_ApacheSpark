CreditGretchen Ertl for The New York Times        When it opens next month in Boston, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate will be aiming to restore respect for Congress at a time when rancor and partisanship have seriously damaged its reputation.As if to lead by example, the Kennedy family seems to have patched up its own reported differences over the $79 million institution, which with a full-scale replica of the Senate chamber will seek to educate the public about the legislative process.The senator’s two sons, who were said to be at odds with their father’s widow, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, over issues of cost and control, are by all appearances now supportive of the project and Mrs. Kennedy, who leads the institute’s board.“Like all families, we’ve had our disagreements,” said Edward M. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer. “But Vicki’s done an incredible job. We are totally united in our goal to make sure that our father’s vision is realized.”AdvertisementPatrick J. Kennedy, who serves on the institute’s board, said: “The period following my father’s passing was enormously painful for everyone in my immediate family and my extended family. But time moves on, and the immediacy of that painful period is well behind us.”AdvertisementPatrick J. Kennedy, a former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island, added that his father “believed in a Senate that advanced the national interest, not partisan interest.”“And today,” he continued, “the importance of that makes this institution in his name all the more relevant.” Visitors to the institute’s Senate chamber will be able to take part in simulated legislative sessions created by Edwin Schlossberg — the husband of Edward M. Kennedy’s niece Caroline Kennedy — who designed the institute’s exhibitions and programs. Up to 100 people at a time can play at being senators, debating, negotiating and voting on legislation.“It’ll be a collaborative environment for people to learn how to pass a bill or how to be obstructionist in not passing a bill,” Mr. Schlossberg said. “Teddy was so good at getting people to work together to get things done, and that’s what this does.”Mr. Kennedy, a staunch liberal who died in 2009, was often credited for reaching across the aisle to forge compromises with more conservative Republicans.The institution, which opens March 30, has worked to mirror that sort of bipartisan camaraderie though its 17-member board includes just two Republicans: the former Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, who was majority leader, and Ralph C. Martin II, a former district attorney in Suffolk County, Mass. In 2010, the chairwoman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, Jennifer Nassour, criticized the use of so much public money for the project, which has received $38 million in federal funds.“Obviously, it has to be scrupulously nonpartisan, academic and historically accurate,” Edward Kennedy Jr. said, “beyond any political bias.”Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said he would welcome the institute provided that it did not take partisan positions.Advertisement“Civics education isn’t a priority like it once was and should be,” Mr. Grassley said. “A facility that objectively teaches kids about the branches of government and the Senate’s role as a deliberative body is welcome. Our society benefits when people are engaged in representative government.”The 68,000-square-foot institute, designed by the architect Rafael Viñoly, is on the Boston campus of the University of Massachusetts and has a 99-year lease on the site. Its primary purpose is educational, but, much like a presidential library, it will also serve to honor the career of Mr. Kennedy, whom supporters called the Lion of the Senate.One of the exhibits will be a model of his Capitol Hill office, including a 1932 certificate from President Herbert Hoover to Rose Kennedy commemorating the future senator’s birth, and a painting of Mr. Kennedy’s beloved Portuguese water dogs, Sunny and Splash.Presidential libraries have had mixed results in terms of attendance, but some have done quite well. The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas drew more than 490,000 visitors in the fiscal year that ended in September, according to the National Archives and Records Administration, putting it nearly in the same league as the Dallas Museum of Art, which saw roughly 650,000.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Kennedy said, referring to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum, which is adjacent to the institute. “My father’s Senate career lasted throughout the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, so you’re able to look at the evolution of a lot of issues over a longer period of time.”The institute also includes classrooms, an area highlighting Mr. Kennedy’s legislative career and a “pledge wall,” where, Mrs. Kennedy said in an interview, visitors can write “how they’re going to go back to their communities and make them better.”“It helps you to hold your leaders accountable, to understand what’s happening in Washington,” she said.To recreate the Senate chamber — in the first mass production of United States Senate desks since the New York cabinet maker Thomas Constantine created the original 48 in 1819 — the institute had extensive consultations with various experts like the Senate’s historian emeritus, a former parliamentarian and the current Senate historian.Edward M. Kennedy helped plan the institute and had a model of it on his dining room table before he died. “Teddy was totally enamored of the idea to teach and engage and inspire a whole new generation of young people,” Mrs. Kennedy said.Advertisement“In all the conversations we had, he said, ‘We have to feel the sense of place — that hallowed ground,’ ” she added.After the senator’s death, Mrs. Kennedy took the lead on the project. Citing an account from a family friend, The Boston Globe reported in 2012 that some family members came to feel she had excluded them from the decision-making process and had failed “to fulfill their request for a full financial accounting of the ongoing construction project and for strategic planning documents.“A week after The Globe’s report, the chairman of the institute’s board challenged the suggestion that anything was amiss in a letter to the editor. “Our finances are sound, our fund-raising is on target,” the chairman, Lee Fentress, wrote.Today such issues seem long settled as the family discusses what it hopes the institute can add to the discussion of American politics.“The system is broken, and the only way to fix it is to get citizens engaged,” Patrick Kennedy said. “We’re really in a crisis, so these kinds of institutions are so critical.”Mrs. Kennedy said that making personal connections was crucial to her husband’s way of working, and that he would walk down the hall to a colleague’s office when he could easily have picked up the phone. “He wanted to go talk face-to-face,” she said.Patrick Kennedy, who served for 16 years in the House of Representatives, said the institute evokes vivid memories of following his father around on the Hill as a child and later as a new member of Congress.In remarks at his father’s funeral, he added, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, a Republican, warmly recalled how he had come to Washington to fight Mr. Kennedy “and ended up being his legislative partner in every major initiative that they successfully saw implemented.”“Just because you have ideological differences,” Patrick Kennedy said, “doesn’t mean you have to have personal animosity.”An article on Monday about the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, which is to open next month in Boston, described incompletely the role of Edwin Schlossberg, the husband of Mr. Kennedy’s niece Caroline, in the creation of the institute. He designed the exhibits and programs, not just the software.A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2015, on Page C1 of the New York edition with the headline: In the Mold of a Senator Who Bartered.
