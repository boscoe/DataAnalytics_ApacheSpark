The invisible primary being waged before the players of the Berlin Philharmonic meet Monday to elect their new chief conductor and artistic director continues apace: Mariss Jansons, who had been thought to be a possible candidate, announced Friday that he had agreed to remain as chief conductor of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra until 2021.The announcement, made as Mr. Jansons prepares to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic this weekend, would seem to take him out of the running for the top job in Berlin. The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra said that Mr. Jansons, 72, a widely respected conductor, had agreed to stay on after “an internal voting process within the orchestra” wrapped up in recent days.“It is a great pleasure for me to continue our work together beyond 2018 after 15 years of successful collaboration,” Mr. Jansons said in a statement. He has been a strong advocate for building a new concert hall in Munich, an effort that has been dealt political setbacks lately.Several leading conductors who had been thought of as possible candidates for the Berlin post, one of the most prestigious in the world of classical music, have either taken themselves out of the running, or announced contract extensions with their own orchestras. The list of candidates who will be considered Monday seems to be shrinking.
