The golden women of rock ‘n’ roll have more stories to tell.Chrissie Hynde, the founder and frontwoman of the Pretenders, will publish a “literary memoir” with Doubleday on Sept. 8, the company said. The book sold for seven figures in an auction, according to two sources familiar with the deal, but who were not authorized to speak on the record.The major sale follows much-lauded memoirs in recent years from female musicians including Patti Smith, whose best-selling “Just Kids” won a National Book Award, Linda Ronstadt, and most recently, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth.In a statement, Gerry Howard, Ms. Hynde’s editor at Doubleday, said, “Chrissie is so incredibly frank, intimate and witty – and she has been involved in so much rich rock ‘n’ roll history – that there seems to be a surprise on every page.” Ms. Hynde added, “I’m approaching writing this memoir much the same way as I would an album. I hope it makes you want to dance, have fun, dig out some old records and maybe even root through your closet and dust off your guitar.”The singer’s story takes her from a 1950s childhood in Akron, Ohio, to the 1970 shootings at Kent State University, where she was a student before moving to London to join the booming punk scene. Since 1979, Ms. Hynde, 63, has released nine studio albums as the lead singer of the Pretenders. Her debut solo album, “Stockholm,” came out last year.A version of this article appears in print on 03/05/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Chrissie Hynde to Publish Memoir.
