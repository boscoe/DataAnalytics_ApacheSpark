The Signature Theater will stage world premieres of new works by two Pulitzer Prize-winning playwrights in 2015-16, the 25th and final season for its founding artistic director, James Houghton.Mr. Houghton, who is being treated for stomach cancer, announced earlier this month that the next season will be his last as artistic director. He said in an interview this week that the season would be “a moment to take stock” and “to honor all the sweat-equity people have put into making this place.”The season highlights will include “John,” by Annie Baker, who won the 2014 Pulitzer for “The Flick,” and “Daphne’s Dive,” by Quiara Alegría Hudes, who won the 2012 Pulitzer for “Water by the Spoonful.” Ms. Baker’s play, set in a Pennsylvania bed-and-breakfast, will star Georgia Engel and Lois Smith, and will be directed by Sam Gold, who is directing “Fun Home,” which opens on Broadway next month. Ms. Hudes’s play, about the regulars at a North Philadelphia bar, will be directed by Thomas Kail, who is directing “Hamilton,” which opens on Broadway in August.The Signature season will also include “Love and Money,” a new play by A.R. Gurney that is being co-produced by the Westport Country Playhouse, and “Night Is a Room,” a new play by Naomi Wallace. And the season will feature revivals of “Incident at Vichy,” by Arthur Miller; “Angel Reapers,” by Martha Clarke and Alfred Uhry; a trio of short one-acts by Edward Albee, María Irene Fornés and Adrienne Kennedy; and “Old Hats,” with clowns Bill Irwin and David Shiner, who played a sold out run of the show at the Signature in 2013.
