“Fifty Shades of Grey” and two other holdovers dominated the North American box office over the weekend, leaving “The DUFF” and two other modestly budgeted newcomers to fight over the remaining market share. As expected, “Fifty Shades of Grey” (Universal Pictures) was again No. 1, taking in an estimated $23.2 million, for a two-week domestic total of $130.1 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data. “Kingsman: The Secret Service” (20th Century Fox) was second, with about $17.5 million in ticket sales and a two-week total of $67.1 million. “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water” (Paramount Pictures) remained planted in third place, taking in an estimated $15.5 million, for a three-week total of $125.2 million. Among the newcomers, “McFarland, USA” performed the best. Costing roughly $25 million to make, the feel-good sports drama from Walt Disney Studios generated ticket revenue of about $11.3 million. “The DUFF,” a high school comedy that cost CBS Films about $8 million to make and was distributed by Lionsgate, rode positive word of mouth – it got an A-minus grade in CinemaScore exit polls – to a stronger-than-expected $11 million in ticket sales. On the negative side: “Hot Tub Time Machine 2” arrived with badly clogged jets, as the Hollywood trade news site Deadline.com put it, taking in about $5.8 million, or roughly 60 percent less than the opening-weekend result for its series predecessor.  “Hot Tub Time Machine 2,” from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount, cost about $14 million to make.
