LONDON– Eighty-five years after its first publication, Agatha Christie’s ghoulish short story series “The Mysterious Mr. Quin” is getting new life — as an app.The app, “Mr. Quin,” was released online on Wednesday. The first offering is an adaptation of “The Coming of Mr. Quin,” a story in the series about a group of socialites who gather for a party in a ritzy British country home. The conversation turns to Derek Capel, a friend of the group who committed suicide 10 years earlier under suspicious circumstances. Over the course of the night Mr. Quin, a mysterious interloper, helps the guests piece together the true cause of Capel’s death.In the app — which updates the action to the present day — viewers click through the characters’ social media walls, feeds and albums to learn the plot. The app includes short film clips posted on the characters’ various walls (Gethin Anthony, who appeared on “Game of Thrones,” is in the cast) and timed “V.I.P. Real-Time Shows,” where viewers can post comments and take part in the story. Mr. Quin reveals the truth of Capel’s death by taking over another guest’s blog.Agatha Christie Productions Ltd, a part of Agatha Christie Ltd., which manages worldwide rights to Christie’s work, released the app with TELL Player Limited, an app development company. They have tentative plans to roll out new stories beginning next year, if the app is successful.
