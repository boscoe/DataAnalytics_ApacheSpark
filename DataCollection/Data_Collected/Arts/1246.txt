Gigi, you don’t look so good.Yes, Gigi had apparently been roasted to a succulent gray, but the net body count for the episode ended up flat, because Hester, after seeming to die last week, turned up alive. Eh; I could do without both of them.The episode spent most of its time exploring Thanksgiving Celebrations of the World, or at least of the ‘Scream Queens’ world. We got an amusing glimpse of Thanksgiving in the family of Chanel No. 3, where a wall of televisions and TV dinners ruled the day.And then there was the Radwell household, where both Chanel and Hester turned up, making for an awkward dinner and a downright vicious game of Pictionary. Hester took the brunt of the game-playing humiliation, so much so that even Chanel, never known for her kindness, couldn’t take it. She called it “the most meanspirited game of Pictionary in the history of Pictionary,” then memorably ripped the entire Radwell family (including 80s sitcom father Alan Thicke as Chad’s father) before storming out, followed by Hester.Everyone ended up back at Kappa House, where Dean Munsch and some of the sorority sisters had begun an orphans’ dinner. The dean started a round of j’accuse, each attendee giving his or her theory on who the killer is. And dang it, just about everyone was plausibly implicated, then just as plausibly exonerated.So by the end of the night, what did we learn? That Grace’s father is apparently the father of dead Boone and presumably the other baby in the bathtub. (“It’s not out of the question,” he admitted. “I was a bit of a man-slut back in the day.”) Hmm. And where was Denise tonight, anyway? Did she get killed last week when I wasn’t looking? I forget, which is a statement I could make about much of tonight’s episode.Advertisement
