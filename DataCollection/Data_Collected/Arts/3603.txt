One of the defining images of “Mad Men,” which begins its final run of episodes on April 5, is from its opening credits sequence — a silhouette of lead character Don Draper (Jon Hamm) reclining in a seat, cigarette in hand. On Monday, that image was brought to life. Fans of the show gathered outside the Time & Life Building in Manhattan to catch a glimpse of Mr. Hamm and several of his castmates for the unveiling of a new piece of public art — a black bench that mimics the silhouette. The installation is part of a series of events taking place across New York in the lead-up to this year’s premiere.The show’s fictional advertising firm, Sterling Cooper & Partners, has its headquarters in the Time & Life Building, and street signs at the corner of 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas, where the building sits, have been temporarily changed to “Don Draper Way” and “Mad Men Ave.”Mr. Hamm was joined by castmates January Jones, Elisabeth Moss, Christina Hendricks and John Slattery, as well as the show’s creator Matthew Weiner,  according to Entertainment Weekly.
