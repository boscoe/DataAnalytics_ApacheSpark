Told largely in flashback, the recollections of the titular affair differed by self-serving degrees, depending on whether it was the petulant novelist Noah (Dominic West) or Allison (Ruth Wilson), a depressed waitress, who was doing the telling. There was also a murder.The second season finds Noah and Allison coupled up, trying to keep the heat alive as their jilted spouses, played by Maura Tierney and Joshua Jackson, pick up the pieces. The perspectives of those two characters are now included as well, producing a kaleidoscopic examination of how betrayals reverberate and memories remain stubbornly subjective. The murder remains an issue.Before “The Affair,” Ms. Treem was a writer and producer on the therapy drama “In Treatment,” and she is also a playwright. Please leave questions for her in the comments. We will post her responses to some of them soon.Previously we heard from Kenya Barris of “Black-ish”; Scott M. Gimple of “The Walking Dead”; and Noah Hawley of “Fargo.”Advertisement
