Promoting itself during the Grammy Awards telecast was a multimillion-dollar gambit for the Las Vegas rock band Imagine Dragons. But it worked, at least as far as Billboard’s charts are  concerned.Imagine Dragons’s second album, “Smoke & Mirrors” (KIDinaKORNER/Interscope), has opened at No. 1 on the chart, with 172,000 sales and 7.6 million streams, according to Nielsen Music. Its promotional campaign included a fan concert aboard a Southwest Airlines flight and a four-minute live performance that was broadcast by Target as a commercial during the Grammys, at an estimated media cost of about $8 million.According to Nielsen, the Target ad featuring Imagine Dragons — or is that Imagine Dragons’s  ad featuring Target? — reached an average of 16.3 million households, including 10.5 million people aged 18 to 49.Drake’s mixtape “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” (Cash Money), released without notice two weeks ago, fell to No. 2 with 129,000 copies sold and an astonishing 48 million streams on services like Spotify. According to Nielsen, that is the most streams that songs from any album have had in a single week in this country. (Last year Billboard began incorporating streams as well as sales into its album rankings, equating 1,500 song streams with a single album sale.)Also this week, the “Fifty Shades of Grey” soundtrack, released by Republic Records and featuring songs by Annie Lennox, Beyoncé and the Weeknd, fell one spot to No. 3. Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran traded chart positions from last week: Ms. Swift’s “1989” (Big Machine) rose one spot to No. 4, while Mr. Sheeran’s “x” (Atlantic) fell one, to No. 5.
