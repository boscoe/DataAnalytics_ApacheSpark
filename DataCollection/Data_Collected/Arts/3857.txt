American Dance Institute, founded 15 years ago in Rockville, Md., plans to spend less time teaching dance and more time supporting dancers and presenting new work — including with a New York season next year, the organization announced Friday.
The institute plans to close its ballet school, which has around 300 students, at the end of the summer, and to begin offering scholarships to help young dancers study at schools of their choice. At the same time it plans to expand its Incubator program, which was established in 2011 to develop new works: in addition to giving performances at its home in Rockville, the institute will have a five-week New York season at The Kitchen in the summer of 2016.It will be quite a transformation for an organization that began life as a ballet school, founded by Pamela Booth Bjerknes, a former American Ballet Theater dancer, and Michael Bjerknes, a former Joffrey ballet principal. When Adrienne Willis became the institute’s executive director in 2010, the group said in a statement, she and the board decided to try to expand and refocus its role  “to supplement, rather than supplant, existing institutions.”The 2016 New York season will feature works by choreographers including Yvonne Rainer, Jane Comfort, Brian Brooks, Jack Ferver and Susan Marshall, the organization said.A version of this article appears in print on 04/04/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: American Dance Institute Plans New York Season.
