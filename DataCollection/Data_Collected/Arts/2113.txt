For members of the press, Harold Holzer has been as much a staple of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as the Arms and Armor wing. He seemed to try to move on before — in 2005, when he was given additional responsibility for visitor services and the Multicultural Audience Development Initiative, and in 2013, when he assumed the new title of senior vice president for public affairs.And Mr. Holzer, who has worked at the Met for almost 23 years, seemed to have plenty of other things to do, given his work as a leading Lincoln scholar and his problematic shoulder (he’s going on his fourth surgery).Mr. Holzer said he had aimed to scale back, without success. “I tried to do a four-day-a-week schedule but I wound up working six days a week from wherever I was,” he said in an interview. “So the chance to do something on my own is irresistible.”Now, he’s really calling it a day — or so he says. On Tuesday, the Met announced that Mr. Holzer would retire this summer. “We will miss his quick wit, wry humor, felicitous prose, and savvy advice,” the Met said in its announcement. “For his dedication to the institution he cared about so deeply and served so well, he has our profound thanks.”
