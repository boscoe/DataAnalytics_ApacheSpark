Call it a mixtape or an album — Drake is No. 1 regardless.“If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” (Cash Money), last week’s surprise digital release by the Toronto rapper, topped the Billboard album chart without marketing or a single, selling 535,000 units, including downloads and streams, according to Nielsen Music.The 17-track project, Drake’s first full-length since 2013, has the noncommercial trappings of a free mixtape, long a rap staple in between studio albums, but with a twist: Fans were asked to pay.And they did. “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late” was downloaded in full 495,000 times, in addition to earning 17.3 million Spotify streams in the United States in just three days, besting the record for the most streams in an album’s debut week. (The previous record, 15.8 million streams, was set by Drake’s last album, “Nothing Was the Same.”)At No. 2 with 258,000 units sold in its first week was the soundtrack for the film “Fifty Shades of Grey” (Republic), which features Beyoncé and the Weeknd, followed at No. 3 by Grammys favorite Sam Smith, whose “In the Lonely Hour” moved 164,000 total units. Also benefiting from the award-show bump: Ed Sheeran, whose “x” (Atlantic) sold another 140,000 units, a 44 percent increase over last week, and came in at No. 4.
Taylor Swift’s “1989” fell to No. 5 in the album rankings with 125,000 units, marking the record’s only finish below second place in the nearly four months since its release. The Grammys’ album of the year winner, Beck’s “Morning Phase,” came in at No. 8 with 71,000 sold.A version of this article appears in print on 02/19/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Drake Tops Chart With Surprise Release.
