LONDON — The artist Ed Ruscha will donate one copy of every print he makes for the rest of his life to Tate, the umbrella organization that oversees the Tate Museums here, the organization announced Monday.In a statement Tate’s director, Nicholas Serota, called the gift a “generous commitment, not to mention a wonderful Christmas present to the whole nation.” As part of the donation Mr. Ruscha will also give 18 recent artworks to the collection, including “That Was Then This Is Now,” “We the People” and “Sponge Puddle.” Much of Mr. Ruscha’s recent output shows words in boldfaced lettering overlaid upon colorful, abstract backgrounds and landscapes.Mr. Ruscha was born in 1937 in Nebraska and has spent most of his life in Los Angeles. His artworks include paintings, prints and installation pieces that verge into performance art — like “Rocky II,” a fake boulder that he hid in the Mojave Desert more than 30 years ago. The artist Pierre Bismuth’s multiyear quest for the boulder is the subject of his recent movie, “Where is Rocky II?”A version of this article appears in print on 12/15/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Christmas Present From Ed Ruscha.
