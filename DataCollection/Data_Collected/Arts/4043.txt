The Times critic A. O. Scott reviews “Furious 7.”LOS ANGELES — “Furious 7” continued to dominate the North American box office over the weekend, while the 10th film adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, “The Longest Ride,” arrived to relatively muted ticket sales.The sheer spectacle of “Furious 7” — Universal Pictures crashed at least 230 vehicles during filming — led to enormous chatter on social media networks after its arrival on April 3, which in turn has kept demand high: The movie took in about $60.6 million between Friday and Sunday, for a two-week total of $252.5 million.That early total is simply massive. To compare, “Fast & Furious 6” took in less — $239 million — during its entire 15-week domestic run in 2013. “Furious 7” has sold an additional $548 million in tickets overseas.The surprise animated hit “Home” (20th Century Fox) stayed strong in second place, generating about $19 million in ticket sales, for a three-week total of $129.6 million, according to Rentrak, which compiles box office data.“The Longest Ride” (Fox) arrived in third place, taking in roughly $13.5 million, an acceptable result for a movie that cost $34 million to make but the second-lowest debut for a movie based on one of Mr. Sparks’s novels, after adjusting for inflation. (“The Best of Me” opened to $10 million in ticket sales in October.)Set in the world of professional bull riding, “The Longest Ride” could benefit in the weeks ahead from strong word of mouth. Audiences gave it an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls — on par with “The Notebook,” which arrived to $16.8 million in sales in 2004 and went on to take in $100 million.
