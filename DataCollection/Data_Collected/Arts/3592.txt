Masterpiece isn’t a word to be thrown around lightly, but there’s no denying that Mark Morris’s “L’Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato” is thrillingly that. Choreographed in 1988, when Mr. Morris was the director of dance at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, this production, at long last, has been preserved on film by “Great Performances” and can be seen on PBS on Friday night. (Check local listings.) Set to Handel’s 1740 oratorio based on Milton’s pastoral poems, this performance by the Mark Morris Dance Group was recorded in 2014 at the Teatro Real in Madrid. Using dance, music, poetry and visual design — Adrianne Lobel’s series of color planes, inspired by watercolors of William Blake, moves right along with the dancers — the production, as the host, Mikhail Baryshnikov, summarizes, reveals “joy, abandon, restraint, dignity and pride for humankind.”What’s also telling is how magnificently it holds up on film. “It’s a work of incredible hope and, dare I say, joy,” Mr. Morris says during the program. There’s never been such a good reason to stay home on a Friday night.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page AR4 of the New York edition with the headline: Dance; A Morris Classic, for Posterity.
