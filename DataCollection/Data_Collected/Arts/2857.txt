Before he became the music director of New York City Opera during its heyday and embarked on a conducting career that took him to podiums around the world, the first ensemble that Julius Rudel conducted was the Mannes Orchestra, during his student days there.When the Mannes Orchestra played at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night, the school, now called Mannes College the New School for Music, said it would begin an initiative named for Mr. Rudel, who died in June at the age 93: the Julius Rudel Award for Conducting Studies.The program, which is being financed through a bequest from the Rudel estate, will give some Mannes conducting students residencies with the Buffalo Philharmonic, which Mr. Rudel once led. There the students will get chances to conduct, and to learn about the workings of a professional orchestra from its music director, JoAnn Falletta, who also attended Mannes.Mr. Rudel’s son, Anthony, said that his father had always been grateful for his Mannes education, and that he kept a photograph on his wall of that first Mannes concert, when he conducted Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater and Mozart’s “Sinfonia Concertante.”A star-filled tribute to Mr. Rudel featuring Plácido Domingo, Sting and a host of others is being planned for March 9 at the Rose Theater at Lincoln Center. It is to benefit  NYCO Renaissance, one of the groups hoping to buy the name of City Opera, which declared bankruptcy more than a year ago, and to begin producing operas again.A version of this article appears in print on 02/23/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Gift From Julius Rudel to Mannes College.
