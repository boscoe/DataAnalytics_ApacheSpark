Britain’s Culture Ministry has temporarily barred the unidentified buyer of a $27 million Egyptian statue, purchased last year from a  museum in the town of Northampton, from taking the 4,400-year-old antiquity overseas, according to the BBC.The bulky, limestone statue depicts a royal scribe named Sekhemka seated with writing on his lap. Britain’s culture minister, Ed Vaizey, said he was blocking the export until at least July 29 after consulting with Arts Council England, a museum accrediting agency, which says the object has “outstanding aesthetic importance” to England.In August the council revoked the accreditation of the Northampton Museum and Art Gallery after it auctioned the statue through Christie’s to pay for an expansion. The sale was condemned by the Egyptian Embassy in London as an “unethical act” and prompted the Save Sekhemka Action Group to declare “a day of shame for Northampton.”David MacKintosh of the Northampton Town Council defended the sale, saying, “We want to expand our museum and to do that we need to raise the money.”The museum has kept the statue in storage since 2010. Sekhemka was given to the Northampton museum by the 4th marquess of Northampton in 1880. The 7th marquess and current Lord Northampton, Spencer Douglas David Compton, is to receive 45 percent of any sale proceeds under an agreement with the town.
