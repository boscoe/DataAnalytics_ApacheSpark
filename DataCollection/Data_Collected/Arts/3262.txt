LOS ANGELES — Hillary Schwartz, the first assistant director on the film “Midnight Rider,” on Tuesday was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass in the death of Sarah Jones, who was killed by a freight train last year while working on the film. A clerk of the court in Wayne County, Ga., where Ms. Schwartz had a bench trial on Tuesday morning, confirmed the convictions and said that Ms. Schwartz was sentenced to 10 years’ probation and will pay a $5,000 fine. The convictions followed the guilty pleas on Monday of Randall Miller, who was directing the film when Ms. Jones died, and Jay Sedrish, who was one of the executive producers. As first assistant director, Ms. Schwartz shared responsibility for safety on the set of the film, which ceased production after an accident in which a train ran through a set that was being prepared on its tracks without authorization from the railroad.A civil suit by Ms. Jones’s family against CSX Corp, which operated the railroad, is still pending.A version of this article appears in print on 03/11/2015, on page C3 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Another Conviction In Death on Film Set.
