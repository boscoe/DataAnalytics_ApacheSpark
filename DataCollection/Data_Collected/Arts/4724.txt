Chris Burden, a conceptual artist who in the line of duty had himself shot, pierced, starved, crucified, electrocuted, cut by glass, kicked down stairs, locked up, dropped from heights and nearly drowned, though by no means all at once, died on Sunday at his home in Topanga, Calif. He was 69.The cause was melanoma, his assistant, Tim Rogeberg, said.One of the foremost performance artists of the 1970s, Mr. Burden was perhaps the single best-known practitioner of the subgenre of body art. In that field, artists documented themselves in still or moving images as they gained or lost weight, underwent surgery or, in his case, courted genuine danger.Trained as a Minimalist, Mr. Burden began his career by making art that employed the most minimal materials possible: segments of his own body. Where traditional artists had long depicted images on canvas, he became the canvas — and a highly distressed canvas at that. The resulting installations, at once intimate and subversive, polarized the critics: Some dismissed Mr. Burden as a mountebank, while others praised his explorations of masculinity, martyrdom and the Romantic ideal of suffering for one’s art.In 2012, Los Angeles Magazine called Mr. Burden “Modernism’s Evel Knievel.”Among his most famous early works were “Shoot” (1971), in which a confederate shot him in the arm with a .22 rifle from about 15 feet away, and “Trans-fixed” (1974), in which Mr. Burden had himself nailed, Christlike, over the hump of a Volkswagen Beetle.AdvertisementImages from many of those works are in the collections of major museums worldwide. His work was the subject of a major retrospective, “Chris Burden: Extreme Measures,” at the New Museum in Manhattan, in 2013 and 2014.In later years, Mr. Burden built immense sculptural installations that, like his early work, explored the interplay of postmodern technology with postmodern anxiety.But it was for his body art that he remained best known. Performed against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, it evoked early Christian martyrs, latter-day Zen masters and the violence of the war itself.“Shoot,” for instance, was performed the year after the Kent State shootings. Enacted at a Santa Ana, Calif., gallery, it shocked its audience. It also shocked Mr. Burden, who had expected only a light grazing. What he received, he said afterward, “felt like a truck hit my arm at 80 miles per hour.”As The New York Times later reported, Mr. Burden was transported to the hospital “and filed the requisite police report (‘accident’).”AdvertisementIts sober concerns notwithstanding, Mr. Burden’s work was not lacking in wicked humor. To some observers, it recalled the gleeful tradition of American hucksterism à la P. T. Barnum. To others, it celebrated the ability of Mr. Burden, whose very surname seemed to foreordain a life of professional dolor, to inscribe himself indelibly into his own work, as artists from J.S. Bach to Stuart Davis to Alfred Hitchcock had done before him.Christopher Lee Burden was born in Boston on April 11, 1946. His father was an engineer, his mother a biologist and art restorer. He was reared in Cambridge, Mass., and, thanks to his father’s professional travels, in China, Switzerland, France and Italy.When Chris Burden was 12, an accident on Elba seemed to prefigure his adult career. Severely injured in a motor-scooter crash there, he endured emergency surgery — performed without anesthesia — on his left foot. During the long convalescence that followed, he became deeply interested in visual art, particularly in photography.After earning a bachelor’s degree from Pomona College, where he studied art, architecture and physics, Mr. Burden enrolled in the master of fine arts program at the University of California, Irvine. His first significant performance work, “Five Day Locker Piece” (1971), was created for his master’s thesis there.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Above him was a five-gallon jug of water, from which he could drink through a hose. Below him was a five-gallon bottle for the water’s inevitable outcome. He emerged five days later, and got his degree.His other performance pieces include “Through the Night Softly” (1973), in which he crawled, nearly naked, over a field of broken glass; “Doorway to Heaven” (1973), in which he attacked his chest with live electrical wires; “Movie on the Way Down” (1973), in which he was suspended, upside-down and naked, some six feet off the floor and swiftly chopped free, sustaining a bloody lip; “Velvet Water” (1974), in which he submerged his head until he passed out; “Kunst Kick” (1974), in which he was kicked down a flight of stairs at the Basel Art Fair; and “White Light/White Heat” (1975), in which, like a medieval anchorite, he inhabited a platform for 22 days without eating.“When I use pain or fear in a work, it seems to energize the situation,” Mr. Burden said in a 1975 interview with the film critic Roger Ebert. “In works with violent or unpredictable elements, the fear is really the worst part, worse than the pain. Getting nailed to the Volkswagen, for example, I had no idea what to expect. But the nails didn’t hurt much at all. It was the effect that was fulfilling.”By the end of the ’70s, Mr. Burden had largely abandoned body art. (“You can’t keep doing the same work over and over, otherwise it’s an act,” he told The Washington Post, with evident self-knowing humor, in 1982.)He turned instead to vast engineered sculptural installations that, in a less corporeal way, also explored the mettle of their constituent parts. They included “Urban Light” (2008), an illuminated forest of more than 200 cast-iron street lamps in front of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; “What My Dad Gave Me,” a 65-foot “skyscraper” fashioned from a Brobdingnagian Erector set, exhibited at Rockefeller Center in 2008; and “Ghost Ship,” a self-navigating crewless sailboat that made its maiden voyage, between Fair Isle, Scotland, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England, in 2005, and was later exhibited at the New Museum.AdvertisementMr. Burden’s first marriage, to Barbara Burden, onto whose nude body he flicked tiny incendiary devices as part of “Match Piece,” a 1972 installation, ended in divorce. His survivors include his second wife, Nancy Rubins, a sculptor.In an act whose irony appeared lost on no one, Mr. Burden and Ms. Rubins, both faculty members at the University of California, Los Angeles, resigned from the university in protest in 2005. At issue was their displeasure at U.C.L.A.’s failure to discipline an art student who, as part of a work performed in class, played Russian roulette with what appeared to be a loaded gun.If their resignation seemed to suggest that there are limits even to the art of endurance, Mr. Burden confirmed as much in a 2007 interview with The New Yorker, in which he looked back on “Doomed,” a conceptual piece of his from 1975.One of Mr. Burden’s most discomforting works — for spectators and for him — “Doomed” was performed at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. There, as museumgoers looked on and a clock ticked away above him, Mr. Burden lay on the floor beneath a lean-to fashioned from a glass panel.By prearrangement, he would not move from the spot unless an audience member intervened. Mindful that works of art are meant to be seen but not touched, no one did. The performance was a masterly study of the social psychological phenomenon known as the bystander effect, in which people are less likely to offer help when many others are present.Finally, after more than 45 hours, someone handed Mr. Burden a drink of water. Tired, hungry and dirty, he smashed the clock and left his glassy confines.Would he otherwise have lain there until he died, The New Yorker asked him in 2007?“Probably not,” Mr. Burden replied.A version of this article appears in print on May 12, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Chris Burden, 69, a Conceptualist With Scars, Dies.
