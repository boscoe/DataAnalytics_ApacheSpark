Texans (7-7) at Titans (3-11)1 p.m. No betting line.Occasionally a division is so justly maligned that it almost seems that it does not deserve a champion. For much of the season, that distinction belonged to the N.F.C. East, but the A.F.C. South has caught up. After the Texans defeated the Colts last week, they are in control, and could clinch a .500 record with a win over lowly Tennessee. But with a revolving door of quarterbacks that includes Brian Hoyer, T.J. Yates and Brandon Weeden, the Texans are hard to take seriously as a playoff contender regardless of the star power they have on defense or the presence of DeAndre Hopkins.Meanwhile, a quality team like the Jets is likely to miss out on the playoffs.Picks: TexansWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
