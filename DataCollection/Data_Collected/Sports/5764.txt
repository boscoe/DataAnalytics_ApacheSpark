Bengals (10-5-1) at Colts (11-5)1:05 p.m. Sunday, Line: Colts by 3In Week 7, Indianapolis embarrassed Cincinnati by 27-0, a loss that was one of the lowest points in the Andy Dalton era. The Bengals were outclassed on both sides of the ball, and they looked like a team that would not figure into the playoff race. In the game, Jeremy Hill, a rookie running back from Louisiana State, carried the ball four times for 15 yards in relief of Giovani Bernard.Two games later, Hill was given the keys to the Bengals’ offense, and he responded with 154 yards on 24 carries with two touchdowns. Much of Cincinnati’s success since has been a result of Hill’s outstanding play. Hill, 22, rushed for 1,124 yards despite starting only eight games and took some of the pressure off Dalton, who at times this season seemed lost, especially when A. J. Green was not on the field.Unfortunately for the Bengals, Green will not play after sustaining a concussion in Week 17, so Hill and his teammates may struggle to keep up with the high-powered Indianapolis offense.Pick: ColtsTimes are Eastern.
