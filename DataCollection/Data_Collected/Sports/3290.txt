The federation’s executive board, meeting in Houston, also removed one Olympic berth from Romania because of multiple positive doping cases during the Rio Games’ qualification period. ■ The Spanish runner Marta Dominguez was barred for three years and stripped of her 2009 world steeplechase title for blood doping. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld appeals by the International Association of Athletics Federations and the World Anti-Doping Agency that challenged the Spanish athletics federation’s decision last year to clear Dominguez of irregularities in her biological passport.
