The International Olympic Committee will understand if the waters in Rio de Janeiro are not completely clean for the sailing events in 2016, the governor of Rio de Janeiro State said. “Of course, they will understand if we don’t meet our target,” said the governor, Luiz Fernando Pezão.When it bid to host the 2016 Games, Rio said it would cut by 80 percent the amount of raw sewage flowing into the bay where the events will be held, but it has since admitted that it is unlikely to meet that goal. Pezão said this month that the amount of sewage treated before being dumped into the bay had increased to 49 percent from 17 percent. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent, but the waters remain fetid, with Olympic sailors who visited the city for test events complaining of floating sofas and animal carcasses. Last year, biologists said rivers leading into the bay contained a superbacteria that is resistant to antibiotics.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
