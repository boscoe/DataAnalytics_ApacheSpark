Redskins (5-7) at Bears (5-7)1 p.m. Line: Bears by 3N.F.L. Week 14 scores and highlightsThe Redskins fumbled a golden opportunity to take control of the N.F.C. East last week, losing at home to the Cowboys, who were without Tony Romo. This week Washington hits the road, where it has a nine-game losing streak, the longest in the N.F.L. The Redskins have won once in their past 19 road games.Working in the Redskins’ favor, however, is that the Bears have been terrible at home, losing eight of their last nine at Soldier Field. Makes you wonder, what would happen if these teams played on a neutral field?PICK: BearsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
