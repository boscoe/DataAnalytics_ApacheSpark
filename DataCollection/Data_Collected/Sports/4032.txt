The list includes Fabrizio Donato, the bronze medalist in triple jump at the 2012 London Olympics, and Andrew Howe, the silver medalist in long jump at the 2007 world championships. All 26 are accused of evading doping tests, but they maintain there was an administrative error. They will face trials at the committee’s antidoping court, with decisions expected sometime next year. Five of the 26 had already qualified for the Rio Games; about 10 have retired. Advertisement
