Week 13 scores and highlightsYou have to admire the Browns: Every week they seem to come up with a new way to lose. Monday’s loss came when a blocked field goal attempt was returned for a game-winning touchdown as time expired, but this week things should be a little more typical. The Bengals could seemingly just run their in-state rival into submission with a combination of Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard.Hill had 929 rushing yards over Cincinnati’s final nine games last season, including 148 in a victory over the Browns in December, but he has had a difficult sophomore season. Last week, he looked more like himself, rushing for 86 yards on 16 carries, and those numbers could go up drastically against a Browns defense that allows the second most rushing yards in the N.F.L.It is not yet known if tight end Tyler Eifert, who has 12 receiving touchdowns, will be able to play after sustaining a stinger in last week’s victory over the Rams, but he hardly seems necessary to beat the Browns, who will be starting Austin Davis at quarterback.Carlos Dunlap, who sacked Johnny Manziel twice in Cincinnati’s win over the Browns last month, offered an indictment of Cleveland’s quarterback situation.“It really doesn’t matter who the quarterback is because at the end of the day, we have to play our football game,” Dunlap told reporters. “If Johnny’s not playing, it’s a lot less running I have to do.”PICK: BENGALSAdvertisement
