SchmidtRob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, has decided not to lift the permanent ban imposed on Pete Rose more than a quarter-century ago, meaning that Rose, the player with more hits than anyone else in the sport’s history, will continue in an exile that has long kept him out of the Hall of Fame.The decision by Manfred, who succeeded Bud Selig as commissioner last January, comes less than three months after he met with Rose, 74, at Major League Baseball’s headquarters on Park Avenue in Manhattan to discuss his latest bid for reinstatement.It was the second time that Rose had appealed the ban, which was first instituted in 1989 after an investigation by baseball, known as the Dowd Report, concluded that Rose had bet on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds and that some of the bets had been placed on his own team.In a report that accompanied Manfred’s decision to uphold the ban, he said Rose informed him at their September meeting that he had continued to bet on baseball, which he can legally do in Las Vegas, where he lives.Commissioner Rob Manfred determined that Rose “has not presented credible evidence of a reconfigured life.”That disclosure clearly concerned Manfred. So did what Manfred described as Rose’s inability, at the meeting, to admit that he not only bet on games as a manager but also as a player. Manfred said that recently obtained evidence in that regard — a notebook containing records of bets Rose placed on games in 1986 — contradicted statements Rose made about betting during their meeting.He also said that Rose, at the meeting, could not seem to remember other facts concerning his betting habits as a player.“In short,” Manfred concluded in the report, “Mr. Rose has not presented credible evidence of a reconfigured life either by an honest acceptance by him of his wrongdoing, so clearly established by the Dowd Report, or by a rigorous, self-aware and sustained program of avoidance by him of all the circumstances that led to his permanent ineligibility in 1989.”However, in his report, Manfred did distinguish between the continued ban on Rose and his eligibility for the Hall of Fame, noting that as commissioner he did not have the authority to determine whether Rose belonged in Cooperstown or not.“In fact, in my view, the considerations that should drive a decision on whether an individual should be allowed to work in baseball are not the same as those that should drive a decision on Hall of Fame eligibility,” Manfred wrote.“Any debate over Mr. Rose’s eligibility for the Hall of Fame is one that must take place in a different forum,” Manfred added.Rose’s eligibility is under the jurisdiction of the Hall, which back in 1991 voted to formally exclude any person from induction who was banned by baseball. The vote was clearly made with Rose in mind. Whether the Hall would now reconsider its position after all these years and allow Rose to suddenly appear on a ballot seems like a long shot.Still, Manfred’s statement seemed to open the door just a crack for Rose. Were he now to be made a candidate for induction at some point, he would be voted on by one of the Hall’s veterans committees, since Rose’s eligibility for the traditional writers’ ballot has long expired.Manfred called Rose on Monday to inform him of his decision to uphold the ban, doing so after he learned that The New York Times was about to report that the ban would remain in place. The Times learned of Manfred’s decision from three people in baseball with knowledge of his thinking.There was no immediate public reaction from Rose, but in an interview this month with a television station in Cincinnati, he did address his chances for reinstatement and how he thought his meeting with Manfred had gone.“You don’t know which way to read anything,” he said in the interview with WCPO. “All I knew is, I was truthful to him, and he asked a lot of questions, and I had a lot of answers. We got along good, I thought.”When Rose was first barred from the sport 26 years ago, he insisted he had not bet on baseball, although in accepting the ban he implicitly acknowledged wrongdoing on his part.In the years that followed, Rose continued to deny he had wagered on baseball. But in a 2004 autobiography, he finally admitted to doing just that as a manager and to betting on the Reds as well, although he insisted that he had never bet on his own team to lose.All the while, Rose, whose long playing career included 4,256 base hits, three World Series championships, three batting titles and 17 selections to the All-Star Game, never gave up hope that the ban would eventually be lifted.He first applied for reinstatement in 1997, with the application going to Selig. But Selig was not inclined to allow Rose back into baseball.Rose, after all, had violated one of baseball’s basic tenets — that any player, coach, manager or team executive who bets on the sport is threatening the game’s integrity. In addition, Rose, in retirement, had often resorted to the headfirst, pugnacious style he displayed as a player, not always seeming contrite about what he had done wrong.Still, when Manfred took over as commissioner after serving as Selig’s deputy for nearly two decades, he seemed to take a quick, and genuine, interest in Rose’s case.By March, lawyers for Rose had filed his third appeal for reinstatement. Then came the face-to-face meeting between Manfred and Rose, and a promise by the league office to reach a decision by the end of the year.Manfred’s decision comes as Rose has become more visible around baseball because of his new role as a studio analyst for Fox Sports. In that role, he has shown himself to be funny and opinionated, with a swagger familiar from his playing days.On a number of occasions over the years, Rose has also been briefly allowed back into baseball — including an appearance at the 1999 World Series, when he took part in a pregame ceremony in Atlanta to honor the all-century team; and an appearance at a 2010 ceremony at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati that marked the 25th anniversary of the hit that made him the sport’s career leader.That door is likely to open for him again. In the final paragraph of his report, Manfred stated that he would continue to allow Rose “to participate in ceremonial activities that present no threat to the integrity of the game.”As for Cooperstown, it remains to be seen whether Manfred’s statement initiates any debate on the merits of inducting Rose. For now, that famous baseball town will remain a place where Rose can make money signing his autograph. The Hall itself remains off limits.Advertisement
