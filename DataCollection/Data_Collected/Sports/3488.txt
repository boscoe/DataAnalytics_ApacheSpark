After he threw a career-high five touchdown passes Sunday, while helping his team reach 10-0, the public should talk about his ability to play football instead.N.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsNewton has long been seen as a red zone nightmare for opposing teams because of his ability to run inside, but he showed just how dangerous he can be with his arm today, torching the Washington Redskins, with all five touchdowns coming from inside 12 yards.The dominant display from Newton, and an equally stifling effort by the Panthers’ defense, led to Carolina beating Washington, 44-14.The scoring started with a 12-yard screen pass to running back Jonathan Stewart. Then it was fullback Mike Tolbert’s turn, who took a Newton pass just behind the line of scrimmage and barreled 3 yards for a score.Ted Ginn Jr., a wide receiver, was next. Newton backpedaled before hitting Ginn in the back of the end zone for a 2-yard score. Greg Olsen, a tight end, got a line drive from Newton for a 5-yard touchdown, and Devin Funchess, a wide receiver, got a 5-yard pass on the sideline to put Carolina up by 38-14.Coming into the game, Carolina had scored a touchdown on 60 percent of its red-zone attempts according to TeamRankings.com, and against Washington the Panthrs ended up scoring touchdowns on 5 of 6 tries, with Graham Gano delivering a 25-yard field goal on the lone drive that stalled inside the 20 for the Panthers.Coach Ron Rivera said in his postgame news conference that the team remains committed to playing one game at a time, and that with the win over Washington they will now focus on their next game and not an undefeated start.Rivera’s dedication to maintaining realistic expectations was evident, as despite the huge game from Newton, he was quick to point out that his quarterback did not have a perfect day.“I thought Cam did some real nice things today, but he also had some throws he wants back,” Rivera said, before adding, “But he commanded this offense today.”Newton echoed Rivera’s tone, calling the 31-point first-half sluggish, but did concede that the team had gone out and done what it set out to do.“We wanted to attack the things that they were going to show us,” Newton said at his post-game news conference. “Coach says trust your eyes out there and I did.”For the day, Newton completed 21 of 34 passes for 246 yards to go with the five touchdowns, which tied Steve Beurlein’s franchise record set in 1999. His previous high was three touchdown passes, which he had done eight times. He danced a few times, but for the most part it was his receivers and running backs doing the celebrating.Rivera said he had advised Newton and the rest of the team to not change who they are because of outside criticism.“Keep your personality, play with energy, but maintain your focus,” he said.With the result no longer in doubt late in the fourth quarter, Derek Anderson took over at quarterback.The offensive fireworks overshadowed yet another tremendous effort by the Panthers’ defense. The unit came into the game ranked 10th in average yards allowed a game, and sixth in points allowed per game, but that likely underestimated the unit’s value in the undefeated start to the season. The Panthers forced five turnovers against Washington, harassing Kirk Cousins into two fumbles and an interception just a week after he had the best game of his career in a win over New Orleans.Carolina ended up winning the time-of-possession battle, with its offense holding the ball for 38 minutes and 7 seconds, and running 75 plays to Washington’s 47. The Redskins didn’t run a single play in the red-zone.The Panthers now go into a Thanksgiving matchup against Dallas with an undefeated record and only two games against winning teams left on their schedule.Advertisement
