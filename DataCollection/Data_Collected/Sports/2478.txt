Fantasy football analysis for N.F.L. Week 9 games and Monday’s matchup between the Chicago Bears and the San Diego Chargers. You can also follow the Sablich brothers on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy and see their complete Week 9 player rankings. 1 p.m. Eastern Line: Bills by 3Quarterback Ryan Tannehill (MIA) — Coming off an ugly performance against the Patriots, he will be on the road against a well-rested Buffalo defense. Tannehill managed 297 yards and two touchdowns against this unit in Week 3, but he also served up three interceptions, giving him an 18th overall fantasy finish on the week (14 fantasy points). He’s a safer QB2 play this week.Tyrod Taylor (BUF) — Taylor is expected to return to the field against a unit that he dropped 273 yards and three touchdowns on in Week 3. He is firmly in the QB1 conversation with Miami permitting the eighth most fantasy points to the position this year. The loss of the top defensive end Cameron Wake is a huge loss to a weak pass rush that ranks 25th in the league.Running Back Lamar Miller (MIA) — The Bills rank sixth against the run, but have permitted double-digit fantasy points to an opposing back in four of six contests this year. Miller’s Week 3 was a disappointment, but he saw just seven carries in Miami’s blowout win. In a week with six teams on a bye, Miller is a low-end RB1.AdvertisementLeSean McCoy (BUF) — The Dolphins’ 25th ranked run defense has been hammered on the ground for an average of 25 fantasy points a game over their last five games. A banged up McCoy managed just 16 yards on 11 carries in his first meeting with the Dolphins, but he has played well in recent weeks. He should fare much better this time around.AdvertisementWide Receiver/Tight End Jarvis Landry/Rishard Matthews (MIA) — The Bills held Landry in Week 3 (67 yards), but could not contain Matthews (113 yards and two TDs). Both Jacksonville wideouts, Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns, eclipsed 50 yards and crossed the goal line in the Bills’ last outing. The Bills are yielding the 11th most fantasy points to the position this season.Sammy Watkins/Robert Woods (BUF) — Woods will serve as Taylor’s top receiving option if Watkins sits. The Dolphins were burned for 87 yards and two touchdowns by the Patriots’ Julian Edelman last Thursday and gave up 127 yards and two touchdowns to the Texans’ Nate Washington in Week 7. Charles Clay (BUF) — Clay’s biggest fantasy day (14 fantasy points) came against the Dolphins, in a game in which Watkins was forced to leave early. His possible return this week would cap Clay’s target potential, but he is still in play as a mid-to-low TE1 option.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 2 Quarterback Nick Foles (STL) — He still has not eclipsed 200 passing yards since Week 1 and is averaging just 11 fantasy points per game, making him nearly impossible to trust against Minnesota’s ninth ranked pass defense (229.3 Y.P.G.).Teddy Bridgewater (MIN) — He fell flat last week against the Bears’ subpar defense. It gets a whole lot tougher against the Rams, who are yielding just 13 F.P.P.G., which ties them with Carolina for second worst fantasy quarterback matchup.Running Back Todd Gurley (STL) — The Vikings have held the run games of the Chiefs, the Lions and the Bears to 206 scoreless yards over the last three weeks, but they will have their hands full with Gurley, who is averaging 141 Y.P.G. in his last four games.Adrian Peterson (MIN) — The Rams have not allowed double-digit fantasy points to the position since Week 4 and rank ninth best against the run. Peterson is an automatic start in a tough matchup.AdvertisementWide Receiver/Tight End Tavon Austin (STL) — The Vikings allow the eighth fewest fantasy points to the position, but opposing WR1 options have averaged 86 yards and three total touchdowns over their last three games against them. Austin is a solid WR3 play this weekend.Stefon Diggs/Mike Wallace (MIN) — The Rams rank 10th in the N.F.L. against the pass, and have allowed the fourth fewest fantasy points to receivers. Diggs is the only Vikings receiver worth considering.Kyle Rudolph (MIN) – He has been reduced to a block-first tight end and managed only two receptions in each of his last five contests. The Rams have not permitted a touchdown to the position since Week 1. We are staying far away from Rudolph this weekend.1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 14Quarterback Tom Brady (NE) — The Redskins have surrendered 20 or more fantasy points to Sam Bradford, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Jameis Winston in three of their last four contests.Running Back Alfred Morris/Matt Jones (WAS) — A blowout could put the uninspiring Morris on clipboard duty, with Jones functioning in passing-down, catch-up mode. The Patriots rank seventh against the run and have not allowed a 100-yard rusher since DeAngelo Williams in Week 1.Dion Lewis/LeGarrette Blount (NE) — The Redskins have surrendered at least 136 rushing yards to their last three RB1 opponents and now sit 30th against the run. Lewis is an RB1 play while Blount qualifies as a solid RB2 option. Wide Receiver/Tight End DeSean Jackson/Pierre Garcon (WAS) — The matchup is a good one on paper, as the Patriots are allowing the eighth most fantasy points to opposing wideouts. Jackson is expected to play and can be considered a WR3 with plenty of upside. Garcon is a low-ceiling WR3 option who has been a better P.P.R. play all year.Julian Edelman (NE) — Top receivers Brandon Marshall and Mike Evans both produced 17 or more standard fantasy points against this defense over the last two weeks. Edelman is a locked-in WR1.Advertisement Jordan Reed (WAS) — The Patriots have permitted just 3.5 F.P.P.G. to tight ends over the last five weeks, but a solid game for Reed is not out of the question considering the high volume of targets he receives.1 p.m. Line: Saints by 9Quarterback Marcus Mariota (TEN) — It is looking as if Mariota will start against a really bad Saints defense that has allowed the most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks this season. He has been shaky over his last two starts though, making him a safer QB2 play.Drew Brees (NO) — The Titans’ third ranked pass defense (197.9 Y.P.G.) should put up more resistance than the Giants’ secondary did last weekend, but Brees is an every-week QB1.Running Back Antonio Andrews (TEN) — Andrews has been carrying the load of late, but has not crossed the end zone in two straight plus matchups. The pending return of David Cobb could complicate the pecking order. He is tentatively a flex play out of this backfield against the Saints defense (seventh best matchup)Mark Ingram (NO) — The loss of Khiry Robinson for the rest of the season means Ingram will be a safer goal line back going forward. The Titans defense ranks 21st against the run, but has limited opposing backs to the fourth fewest fantasy points in the league. Fantasy’s second best running back remains an RB1 play regardless.Wide Receiver/Tight End Kendall Wright/Harry Douglas (TEN) — Wright’s chances for suiting up are slim at best, which would make Douglas a nice sleeper play against a Saints secondary that has yielded huge fantasy performances to receivers T.Y. Hilton and Odell Beckham Jr. the last two weeks.Willie Snead/Brandin Cooks (NO) — An opposing receiver has put up more than 10 fantasy points in all but one game against the Titans despite being ranked third in the league against the pass. Start both with confidence. Delanie Walker (TEN) — Walker has been the most consistent receiving option on this team, and would get a nice boost if Mariota returns. The Saints are fantasy’s sixth best running back matchup (10 F.P.P.G.).Advertisement1 p.m. Line: Jets by 2.5Quarterback Blake Bortles (JAC) — The Jets’ formidable defense was a mess last week, allowing Derek Carr 333 yards and four touchdowns. We will still put our money on a Jets bounce back at home, where they have permitted nine F.P.P.G. to the position.Running Back Chris Ivory (NYJ) — The Jaguars are giving up the eighth most fantasy points to the position. Expect big things from Ivory.T.J. Yeldon (JAC) — Yeldon has managed two 100-yard efforts in his last three games, and the Jets just handed over 113 yards to the Raiders’ Latavius Murray, but we would still consider Yeldon a low-end RB2 against a Jets front that remains the worst fantasy matchup for backs.Wide Receiver Brandon Marshall/Eric Decker (NYJ) — Ryan Fitzpatrick is expected to start at quarterback for the Jets (thumb), which is good news for Marshall in this favorable matchup (25th in receiving yards allowed). Decker is a shoo-in WR2, as he has managed at least a touchdown or 90 yards, or both, in each game played this year.Allen Robinson/Allen Hurns (JAC) — We are expecting Darrelle Revis to get the better of Robinson. He held Amari Cooper to 46 yards on five catches last week. Hurns may be the better play this week.1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 4.5Quarterback Derek Carr (OAK) — The Steelers have allowed just 13 F.P.P.G. to quarterbacks Carson Palmer, Alex Smith and Andy Dalton over the last three weeks, but Carr has thrown for three or more touchdowns in consecutive games. We cannot stop you from starting him this week.Ben Roethlisberger (PIT) — He should shake off the cobwebs against Oakland’s 31st ranked pass defense, which has handed over consecutive 20-point fantasy performances to quarterbacks Philip Rivers and Geno Smith in the last two weeks.Running Back DeAngelo Williams (CAR) — Williams will be an RB2 play against an underrated Raiders defense that ranks second in the league. Oakland has yet to allow a 100-yard rushing day and has permitted just three rushing scores this season.AdvertisementLatavius Murray (OAK) — The Steelers are the eighth best run defense and the third toughest fantasy matchup for backs and have allowed just one rushing score. Murray performed well against the strong Jets defense last week and can be used as an RB2 play in all formats.Wide Receiver Antonio Brown/Martavis Bryant (PIT) — Only the Giants are serving up more receiving yards this season than the Raiders. There is room for both Pittsburgh wideouts to have big days. Amari Cooper/Michael Crabtree (OAK) — The Steelers have allowed an average of 26 fantasy points over their last three games and rank 26th against the pass. You can start both receivers this week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Opposing quarterbacks are managing just 13 F.P.P.G., which is tied with St. Louis for second fewest in the league.Cam Newton (CAR) — The Packers are permitting only 15 F.P.P.G. to opposing quarterbacks, the sixth fewest in the league. But Newton has been as steady as they come, and remains a mid to low-end QB1 option.Running Back Eddie Lacy (GB) — Lacy has yet to clear 100 yards this season and enters Week 9 as the 41st ranked fantasy running back. He remains an RB2 option against Carolina’s 20th ranked run defense, which is surrendering 113 rushing Y.P.G.Jonathan Stewart (CAR) — The Packers’ 25th ranked run defense served up at least 15 fantasy points to both Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson last week. We expect Stewart, who is averaging 22 carries per game over his last three, to produce top-end RB2 numbers in this plus matchup.Wide Receiver Randall Cobb/James Jones (GB) — The Panthers are permitting the sixth fewest fantasy points to opposing receivers this year. It could be another long day for the Packers receivers.Ted Ginn Jr. (CAR) — He is a high-volume target as the Panthers’ WR1, but has struggled to make good on his opportunities. He is a low-end WR3 play against the Packers, who allow the seventh fewest fantasy points to the position.4:05 p.m. Line: Falcons by 7Quarterback Matt Ryan (ATL) — San Francisco represents the fifth worst pass defense in the league. Opposing quarterbacks are averaging 17 F.P.P.G. against. Ryan is a midrange QB1 play.AdvertisementRunning Back Devonta Freeman (ATL) — The Niners handed 20 fantasy points to the Rams’ Gurley last week, and 18 to the Seahawks’ Marshawn Lynch the week prior. Freeman is an elite play.Wide Receiver/Tight End Julio Jones (ATL) — San Francisco has given up 18 or more fantasy points to a receiver in five of its eight games played, and is the fourth best matchup for receivers this season. Jones is a top three fantasy receiver this weekend.Anquan Boldin (SF) — With Blaine Gabbert taking over for Colin Kaepernick, things are not looking good for Boldin the rest of the season. Atlanta is the third worst fantasy matchup for receivers. Jacob Tamme (ATL) — He made the most of his targets last week with Leonard Hankerson out, and with Hankerson likely to sit again, Tamme should be a decent play against a San Francisco team allowing 7 F.P.P.G. to the position.4:05 p.m. Line: Giants by 2.5Quarterback Eli Manning (NYG) — Not many quarterbacks throw for six touchdowns in a losing effort, but that is what Manning did in Week 8. He should produce again against a Tampa Bay secondary that has been shredded by opposing quarterbacks in each of its last three games.Jameis Winston (TB) — Winston has cleared 19 fantasy points in his last two games and can be treated as a high-end QB2.Running Back Rashad Jennings/Shane Vereen/Orleans Darkwa (NYG) — Darkwa was on his way to leading this backfield last week before exiting with a back bruise. No player here is worth more than an RB3 play in this messy running back committee against a Tampa Bay defense that has allowed just one 100-yard game this season.Advertisement Doug Martin (TB) — The Giants have allowed double-digit fantasy points to a running back in every game this season. Martin should be in for a bounce-back performance.Wide Receiver/Tight End Odell Beckham Jr. (NYG) — The WR1s Kendall Wright, DeAndre Hopkins, Allen Robinson and Julio Jones have managed at least 16 fantasy points against this secondary. Beckham is an elite receiver play once again.Mike Evans (TB) — The potential return of Prince Amukamara to the Giants’ 32nd ranked secondary could make things tougher for Evans, but with Vincent Jackson likely to sit another week, Evans should see plenty of targets. Austin Seferian-Jenkins (TB) — If he is able to play, the matchup could hardly be any better, as the Giants are permitting 12 F.P.P.G. to the position (second most).4:25 p.m. Line: Broncos by 4.5Quarterback  Peyton Manning (DEN) — Manning did not toss a touchdown last week against the Packers, but he did complete 72 percent of his passes for 340 yards. He is back in the QB1 conversation against a Colts unit that has allowed 18 or more fantasy points to the position in five of their last six games.Andrew Luck (IND) — Luck remains a QB2 against the league’s best pass defense, which just held Aaron Rodgers to 77 scoreless yards.Running Back Frank Gore (IND) — The Broncos rank fourth against the run, but have allowed at least 10 fantasy points to an opposing back in five of seven contests. Gore remains a solid RB2 play.Ronnie Hillman/C.J. Anderson (DEN) — The Colts have permitted 28 F.P.P.G. to the position over the last three weeks and are the sixth best fantasy matchup for backs. Hillman is operating as the lead/goal line back and is the one to trust in this outstanding matchup.Advertisement Wide Receiver/Tight End T.Y. Hilton/Donte Moncrief (IND) — We do not like either as more than a low-end WR3 play in fantasy’s worst matchup for the position.Demaryius Thomas/Emmanuel Sanders (DEN) — A receiver has managed at least 11 fantasy points against the Colts’ 27th ranked pass defense in all but one game this year. Both are must-start plays this weekend. Vernon Davis (DEN) — It is likely too soon to expect major fantasy production from the newly acquired Davis, but the Colts have allowed an average of 14 points to the position over the last three weeks.8:30 p.m. Line: Eagles by 2.5Quarterback Sam Bradford (PHI) — Dallas limited Bradford to 9 fantasy points in Week 2. The struggling Bradford is not a recommended QB2 this weekend.Running Back DeMarco Murray/Ryan Mathews (PHI) — Dallas has allowed at least 10 fantasy points to opposing backs in five of seven games played.Darren McFadden (DAL) — Just two backs have managed to top 10 fantasy points against the Eagles and only one has found the end zone. This difficult matchup makes McFadden a mid-to-low RB2 option at best. Wide Receiver/Tight End Dez Bryant (DAL) — Bryant played more than many anticipated last weekend (80 percent of snaps) and should fare better this week against fantasy’s sixth best receiver matchup. Matt Cassel does limit the potential, but Bryant is a must-start when healthy.Jordan Matthews (PHI) — Dallas is the fifth worst matchup for receivers and has given up just 11 fantasy points to the position over the last three weeks. Matthews did string together a nice fantasy day against the Cowboys in Week 2 (6/80/1 TD), but has averaged just 4.32 fantasy points per game since.AdvertisementJason Witten (DAL) — The Eagles have been rough on tight ends all year, allowing just 5 F.P.P.G. (fifth worst matchup). Witten had seven receptions for 56 yards against them in Week 2, and that was with Tony Romo at the helm. He is a low-end TE1 play in Week 9.8:30 p.m. (Monday) Line: Chargers by 4Quarterback Philip Rivers (SD) — The Bears are giving up 19 F.P.P.G., which is the fifth most in the league. Rivers is a shoo-in QB1 play at this point, but his banged up receiving corps, missing Keenan Allen, lowers his ceiling a bit.Jay Cutler (CHI) — Cutler is averaging 18.3 F.P.P.G. over his last three, and is a solid QB streamer against a fading San Diego defense that has allowed 19 or more fantasy points to the position in four of its last five games.Running Back Melvin Gordon/Danny Woodhead (SD) — The Bears rank 29th against the run but the Chargers rank 29th in rushing, and have not produced a rushing score since Week 1.Jeremy Langford (CHI) — The Chargers’ 27th ranked run defense has allowed the second most fantasy points to running backs. Langford is expected to carry the load with Matt Forte out, and is a great Week 9 play for those of you lucky enough to win your waiver wire bid.Wide Receiver/Tight End Stevie Johnson/Malcom Floyd (SD) — Johnson is expected to benefit the most from Allen’s absence, and finds himself in a favorable fantasy spot, as Chicago represents the seventh best matchup a receiver can have. Alshon Jeffery (CHI) — The Chargers’ secondary is on the decline, having allowed 25 F.P.P.G. to opposing wideouts over the last three weeks.Antonio Gates (SD) — Gates practiced Wednesday, and is an elite option at the position, with his role poised to grow even more in the wake of the Allen injury.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
