The defending champion, Wisconsin-Green Bay, is paying its own way to get there.Because curling is not an N.C.A.A.-sanctioned sport, students often create their own teams, and their expenses for tournaments, called bonspiels, are only partly covered. In many cases, a college team will affiliate with a local curling club to have a place to play.The camaraderie on the college circuit is reward enough. Teams from around the country get to know one another while participating at many of the same bonspiels. After a game, the greatest compliment players can receive is that they are personable. “I would rather have a compliment of being nice and lose in this sport than win and have them hate me,” said Aaron Gurholt, a member of the Wisconsin-Stevens Point team, who used to play football.“It changed my perspective on competitiveness,” he added. “I went from football to curling, and I’m a different person. In this sport, I’m so relaxed, like, this is who I am. I’m just smiling, and there are fist bumps for days.”Advertisement
