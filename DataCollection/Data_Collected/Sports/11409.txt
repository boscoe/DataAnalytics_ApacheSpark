When Eric Campbell walked into the Mets’ clubhouse Wednesday afternoon, he looked exhausted, and for good reason. The night before, he had been pulled from a game and put on a plane from Sacramento to Las Vegas. From there, in the morning, he had flown to New York and went directly to Citi Field.He was so ruffled that he forgot which airport he had arrived at minutes earlier. He checked the tag on the suitcase. “J.F.K., I guess,” he said, smiling.Campbell, a versatile utility player, had been one of the last Mets demoted to Class AAA before opening day. But now, with David Wright on the disabled list with a hamstring injury, Campbell is likely to be their third baseman for at least two weeks.In Wright’s absence, Manager Terry Collins tinkered only a little with the lineup in the hope that his players would benefit from continuity.AdvertisementTravis d’Arnaud moved into Wright’s No. 2 spot, Campbell batted sixth and Ruben Tejada started for Wilmer Flores and hit eighth. D’Arnaud and Lucas Duda each hit solo home runs, and Campbell went 1 for 5 while scoring a run.The Mets beat the Phillies, 6-1, to sweep the three-game series and improve their record to 6-3 as Jon Niese went six and a third innings for his first win of the year.Advertisement“I’ll sleep good tonight,” Campbell said.A version of this article appears in print on April 16, 2015, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Complete 3-Game Sweep of Phillies.
