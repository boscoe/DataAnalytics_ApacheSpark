Few players can match the ups and downs of Hasselbeck’s long journey, which began so long ago that the quarterback of the team he is facing this week, Jameis Winston, was 4 years old when Hasselbeck was drafted.The Colts’ Hasselbeck is 3-0 as a starting quarterback this season, but he has a fairly limited repertory, and the absence of the starting left tackle Anthony Castonzo should be enough to tip the scales in Tampa Bay’s favor.Pick: BuccaneersAdvertisement
