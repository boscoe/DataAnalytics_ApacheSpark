Bears (2-5) at Chargers (2-6)8:30 p.m. (Monday) Line: Chargers by 4The Bears and the Chargers enter this game missing important components to their offensive units. Chicago will be without running back Matt Forte, who injured his knee in last week’s loss to the Vikings, and the Chargers will be missing wide receiver Keenan Allen, who sustained a lacerated kidney in a loss to the Ravens and is done for the year. Allen had been on a pace for a potentially record-setting season — his 67 catches placed him third in N.F.L. history through eight games. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers paid Allen a visit in the hospital.“He was down, as you can imagine,” Rivers told The San Diego Union-Tribune.The Allen-less Chargers will host a Bears team that may be better than its 2-5 record suggests. Chicago’s last two losses came down to game-ending field goals (one in overtime, one as the clock expired in regulation). Interestingly, each of Chicago’s wins in 2015 have come against A.F.C. West competition (Oakland and Kansas City).Finally, both defenses are among the league’s worst — each giving up over 28 points a game — so do not be surprised if this one turns out to be a high-scoring affair.PICK: CHARGERSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
