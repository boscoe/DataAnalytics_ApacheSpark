Broncos (10-3) at Steelers (8-5)4:25 p.m. Line: Steelers by 7The Broncos continue to trudge along in what has to be among the most tumultuous 10-3 seasons in history. Their high-priced future Hall of Fame quarterback, Peyton Manning, was 7-2 as a starter even though he continues to lead the league in interceptions by a wide margin after missing four games. His backup, Brock Osweiler, is 3-1 but seemed almost incapable of finishing drives last week, with more than 300 passing yards but no touchdowns.Denver has gotten away with subpar quarterbacking and an inconsistent rushing attack because of its impressive defense. That unit will have its hands full with a red-hot Pittsburgh offense that has scored 30 or more points in five consecutive games while averaging 494 yards of offense in that span.Though Manning has practiced, he is not quite ready to return, so Osweiler will start again. He is likely to put up plenty of yards against a Steelers defense that has been among the worst at pass defense. But expecting him to keep up with his Pittsburgh counterpart, Ben Roethlisberger, is asking too much.PICK: SteelersWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
