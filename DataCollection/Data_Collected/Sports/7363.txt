GLENDALE, Ariz. —  On the same field where a receiver named David Tyree had improbably caught a desperation throw to propel the Giants to Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots seven years earlier, the Seattle Seahawks had a potentially historic acrobatic catch of their own to remember and treasure.The difference in the falling reception by Jermaine Kearse, however, is that the Seahawks did not complete the drive into the end zone.The highlight was almost immediately trumped by a highly questionable play call, an interception at the goal line and a brawl, all more unbelievable than the catch that had preceded them.“A very, very hard lesson,” Seattle Coach Pete Carroll said, noting that his team had been on the verge of another championship. “I hate to learn the hard way, but there’s no other way to look at it right now.”AdvertisementSeattle had blown a 10-point fourth-quarter lead but found itself at New England’s 38-yard line with 1 minute 14 seconds left. Trailing by 28-24, quarterback Russell Wilson lobbed a pass down the right side to receiver Kearse, who was blanketed by the backup cornerback Malcolm Butler.AdvertisementBoth men leapt over the 10-yard line, falling backward like high-jumpers over a bar, as the ball was volleyed into the air while they skidded backward on the grass. The ball dropped into the arms of Kearse, who cradled it for a catch as dramatic as any in Super Bowl history.The Seahawks had a first down at the 5-yard line and used the second of their three timeouts with 1:06 left. Wilson handed off to the bruising back Marshawn Lynch, who gained 4 yards, nearly dragging defenders into the end zone.

Lee/The New York Times        Carroll, his usual state of calm lost in emotion that seemed balanced between anger and disappointment, said after the game that he had not wanted to “waste” a running play and thought a quick pass would be the game-winner. The offensive coordinator, Darrell Bevell, made the play call, but Carroll gave it the go-ahead without debate.“It’s not the right matchup for us to run the football, so on second down, we throw the ball, really to kind of waste that play,” Carroll said. “If we score, we do. If we don’t, then we’ll run it on third and fourth down.” He said he had looked at Wilson, his third-year quarterback, before the play to make sure that Wilson understood the gravity of the moment. He did.With the clock ticking, on second-and-goal at the 1-yard line, Wilson took the snap from the shotgun position. He threw immediately to the goal line, toward receiver Ricardo Lockette.But Butler and the ball arrived at the same time, and Butler snagged the prize: a game-clinching interception.“I put the blame on me,” said Wilson, who did not question the call when he received it. “I’m the one who threw it.”AdvertisementThe interception immediately set off a debate over Seattle’s play-calling and, shortly after, a fight that escalated momentarily out of control in the end zone.The Seahawks had one timeout remaining and Lynch — the league’s leading bulldozer, with more rushing yards and touchdowns than anyone over the past four seasons — ready to plunge in for the winning score.The Seattle Seahawks coach spoke about the interception that cost his team the game.Instead of Kearse becoming the hero, it was the little-known Butler, who had been the foil to Kearse moments before he saved the game for New England with an interception.“I’ve worked so hard in practice, and I just wanted to play so bad and help my team out,” Butler said afterward. “I got out there and did exactly what I needed to do to help my team win.”With the expected Seahawks victory ripped away unexpectedly, Seattle’s emotions came unhinged. The New England offense took the field for the final snaps. With 20 seconds left, after Seattle had been penalized five yards for encroachment, New England quarterback Tom Brady took a knee.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

For a few seconds, as officials tried to gain control, it looked as if the fighting might spread.“It was just frustration between two teams,” said Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who had been in the middle of the scrum. “It’s football.”Irvin was ejected, Brady took another knee, and the clock expired in a cloud of confetti that fell on both teams.For those tantalizing few moments, it looked as if it would be the Seahawks who prevailed, and as if Kearse would be the hero — not unlike Tyree had been for the Giants in a come-from-behind victory over the Patriots in 2008.“The goal is to win the game,” Kearse said. “And right now that catch doesn’t mean anything to me.”A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Screeching Halt.
