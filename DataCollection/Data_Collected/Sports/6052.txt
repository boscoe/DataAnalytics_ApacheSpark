Hensley’s lawyer, Jacob Diesselhorst, said that Hensley was recovering at home and that he should be ready for spring training next month.According to the district attorney’s report, Hensley and some friends were at a bar, where they ran into Morales. A member of Hensley’s group knew Morales, and Hensley and Morales were invited back to the house of a mutual friend. Witnesses said that when the two men were in the living room, a disagreement broke out about how much professional athletes made in signing bonuses.The witnesses, who said there were no raised voices, said they heard a crash and saw Morales kicking Hensley in the face. Morales reportedly fled the scene, and the police said he did not come in for questioning, so the matter was turned over to the district attorney’s office, which charged Morales with aggravated assault and battery.Hensley and Morales are from Edmond, Okla., but they attended different high schools.“Ty told me the guy was talking about his signing bonus, and Ty said, ‘I’m not going to talk about that,’ ” Diesselhorst said. “He thought he had quelled it.”Hensley was selected 30th over all by the Yankees in the 2012 draft out of Edmond Santa Fe High School in Edmond, near Oklahoma City. He missed the 2013 season after hip surgery, and last year he posted a 2.93 earned run average in 11 games for two lower-level teams in the Yankees’ farm system.As a result of the altercation, Hensley’s jaw was broken in two places, and his mouth was wired shut. “Luckily, there were no skull injuries, and he had no neurological damage,” Diesselhorst said in a telephone interview. “He’s doing remarkably well, considering what happened.”Advertisement
