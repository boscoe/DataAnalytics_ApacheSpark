They have also permitted multiple touchdowns in four straight contests. Over all, they are the fifth best matchup a quarterback can have. But Mariota’s ceiling is limited without receiver Kendall Wright, who will miss his third straight game.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Blake Bortles (JAC) — Bortles was a major disappointment last week in a cupcake matchup against Baltimore, but we still consider him a low-end QB1 option Thursday night. The Titans’ banged-up secondary has allowed the ninth most F.P.P.G. and an average of 23 over the last three weeks.Running Back Antonio Andrews (TEN) — The Jaguars’ sixth ranked run defense held Justin Forsett to 53 yards on 14 carries last weekend. Andrews cannot be trusted as anything more than a low-end RB3 option considering his unpredictable workload and his 3.5 Y.P.G.AdvertisementT.J. Yeldon (JAC) — Yeldon just came out of his walking boot and is expected to play, but is coming off a short week of rest and is likely to be running at less than full strength. The matchup is not good, either, with the Titans clocking in as the fifth toughest one for running backs.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We haven’t seen enough good things from either to trust them in any fantasy format.AdvertisementAllen Robinson/Allen Hurns (JAC) — An opposing receiver has produced a minimum of 13 fantasy points in four of the last five games against the Titans. Hurns has hit pay dirt in seven straight, while Robinson has produced at least 70 yards or a touchdown over his last six. Both of these guys should be locked into your lineups. Delanie Walker (TEN) — Walker is the only Titans pass catcher you can trust; he should be Mariota’s go-to guy with Wright on the sideline. Walker has 26.7 fantasy points in the two games that Wright has missed, most of which came in Week 9 against the Saints (7/95/2). Jacksonville yields 9 F.P.P.G. to opposing tight ends, which is the 12th most in the league.The Sablich Brothers have provided award-winning fantasy football advice for The Times since 2010.
