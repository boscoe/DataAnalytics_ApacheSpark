Running a marathon for the first time is hard enough, especially when your debut involves vying for the top American slot in the largest race in the world. So before she took off with the other professional women Sunday in the New York City Marathon, Laura Thweatt faced a special set of concerns.In particular, it is difficult to grab your water bottle off a stationary table while you are hurtling up First Avenue at a pace of 5 minutes 40 seconds a mile, although she did spend a few days rehearsing with her coach of four years, Lee Troop. And even if you have done a fast half-marathon, as Thweatt had, in 1 hour 11 minutes 1 second, you still have to hang on for twice the distance you have ever raced, probably covering several of the final, hardest miles alone. After the race, you will almost certainly fall victim to the stick-legged stagger that seizes nearly all of the marathon’s 50,000 participants, a gait more characteristic of zombies than athletes.“It’s like your entire body shuts down,” Thweatt said when it was over. “I felt strong and natural and relaxed for a lot of the race, but at the end, it’s actually pretty awful.”Most important, when you are running in a field like Thweatt’s, your competitors mean business: $275,000 is at stake in your race alone, and they are ready to earn it. In this case, she was sharing New York’s streets with several reigning major marathon champions, including Tigist Tufa of Ethiopia (who took third place), Caroline Rotich of Kenya (who finished 10th), the newcomer Aselefech Mergia of Ethiopia (second) and the returning champion, Mary Keitany of Kenya, who broke away from the pack at Mile 19 and went on to win with a time of 2:24:25.

Thweatt was seventh, just off the course record for an American debut.AdvertisementIt was a strong showing in a quiet year for American runners. Most were sitting out this race to save themselves for the Olympic trials in Los Angeles in February. (Meb Keflezighi, 40, broke the United States masters record with his seventh-place finish, and he hopes to land a spot on the Olympic team.) In this year’s marathon, the only other significant American runner besides Thweatt was 18-year-old Alana Hadley, who wound up withdrawing from the race at Mile 15 with an ankle injury.Thweatt said this was her last marathon for a while because she wanted to concentrate on shorter distances.“Even if I won the race, I still was not going to run the marathon trials,” she said. “I’m going to stick to my original plan, which is going to be the track in July.”She treated the challenging New York route like a cross-country course and drew on her strength in that event — she won the United States cross-country championship this year in Boulder.On Sunday, Thweatt joined her competitors in employing an unusual tactic: She avoided consulting her watch.“New York City is such a challenging course, you could panic if you looked down and saw some of those splits,” she said. “You need to key off how you feel.”Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

She missed only one of the seven water stations set out for elite runners, who finish so quickly they do not need the mile-by-mile stations set out for the rest of the field. Other women were less fortunate. Lunging for a bottle, Sally Kipyego almost ran into the pacing motorcycle. Thweatt and Kipyego pushed each other, even as Kipyego, who did not finish, fell behind.“When you know someone like that is chasing you, you run a little faster,” Thweatt said.Landing in the annals of top American performances, Thweatt said she emerged from the race both inspired and a little chastened.“This race makes you work for it,” she said. “Six-minute pace never felt so hard.”Then she walked away from the racecourse straight-legged, like a zombie.A version of this article appears in print on November 2, 2015, on Page F2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Dazzling Encore, and a Promising Debut.
