Early in the season, he passed Brett Favre to become the career leader in passing touchdowns. With Manning at the helm, the Broncos regularly play in nationally televised games.But Manning faded in the last quarter of the season, and the Broncos lost to the Indianapolis Colts, 24-13, in the divisional round of the playoffs. Manning later revealed that he had played with a thigh injury and did not deny that he was considering retirement.Manning, who will turn 39 later this month, also had several neck operations before signing with the Broncos.This off-season, though, the head coach, John Fox, and the offensive coordinator, Adam Gase, have departed. The Broncos brought in Coach Gary Kubiak, who played his entire nine-year career in Denver as a backup quarterback behind the team’s general manager, John Elway.“I’m excited Peyton is returning, and I look forward to working with him and all our players starting next month,” Kubiak said in a statement.Elway, who led the Broncos to their only two Super Bowl titles, welcomed him back as well.“We’re glad to work something out with Peyton so that he will be part of our team this season,” Elway said.Keeping Manning was critical for the Broncos, who are 38-10 in the three seasons since Manning arrived. The Broncos have won three consecutive A.F.C. West titles and reached the Super Bowl two years ago, losing to the Seattle Seahawks.To help the Broncos, Manning agreed to have his salary reduced by $4 million, to $15 million, according to The Denver Post, which said that Manning had declined to discuss his contract. It is possible, though, that Manning could earn back some of that income through performance bonuses.Advertisement
