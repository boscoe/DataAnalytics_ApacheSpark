The Dodgers are expected to announce Monday that they have filled the last opening for a manager in the major leagues with the hiring of Dave Roberts, according to multiple media reports. Roberts, 43, whose parents are African-American and Japanese would be the Dodgers’ first minority manager and the third in baseball, along with Fredi Gonzalez of the Atlanta Braves and Dusty Baker, recently hired by the Washington Nationals.The Dodgers had taken a deliberate approach to finding a successor to Don Mattingly, who left the team after five seasons — the last three of which ended with division titles but fell short of the World Series, which the Dodgers have not reached since 1988.The Dodgers interviewed at least eight candidates for the job, including Kirk Gibson, whose pinch-hit home run was the signature moment of their last World Series. The other finalist was Gabe Kapler, who was a teammate of Roberts’s on the 2004 World Series champion Boston Red Sox.The Dodgers have undergone a sizable turnover in personnel since Andrew Friedman, the team’s top baseball executive was hired last year. The team is likely to lose pitcher Zack Greinke and second baseman Howie Kendrick through free agency.Kapler was viewed as the early front-runner because of his ties with Friedman, whom he worked under at Tampa Bay, and his oversight last season of the Dodgers’ minor league system.Roberts, though he has never managed, has spent more time coaching than Kapler, serving four seasons as a coach in San Diego, the last two as the bench coach.Roberts may be best known for his stolen base against the Yankees in the 2004 playoffs, which started the Red Sox on their historic road back from a three-games-to-none deficit in the American League Championship Series, but he also has roots with the Dodgers.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He was traded to Boston during the 2004 season and finished his career with San Diego and San Francisco.Roberts also has survived a bout with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which was diagnosed in 2010.A version of this article appears in print on November 23, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: After Deliberate Search, Dodgers Are Said to Be Hiring Dave Roberts as Their Manager .
