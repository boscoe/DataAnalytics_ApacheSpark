Cubs fans certainly have a right to wonder.Kris Bryant is joining the Cubs in time for Friday’s afternoon game with the San Diego Padres at Wrigley Field after three weeks in the minors. He will start at third base and bat cleanup.That brief stint in the minors was controversial. Under baseball’s complicated collective bargaining rules, if Bryant spent 12 days in the minors this spring, his eligibility for free agency would be delayed by one year, until 2021, potentially saving the Cubs millions.But after Bryant hit .425 with nine home runs in spring training, many Cubs fans did not want to wait another minute to have him on the major league roster.During the minor league stay, he duly returned to crushing the ball. In seven games at Class AAA Iowa, he hit .321 with three home runs, including one Thursday night in his final game for the club.And while he was there, Chicago was struggling to get production from its third basemen. The opening day starter, Mike Olt, is hitting .133, Jonathan Herrera .167 and Arismendy Alcantara .091. And Olt was hit by a pitch on Saturday, fracturing his wrist.There is no such thing as a can’t-miss prospect, but Bryant, 23, comes close. He was the college player of the year at San Diego in 2013, and the next year he was the minor league player of the year, an award won by the likes of Derek Jeter, Frank Thomas and Manny Ramirez. He hit 55 home runs in 181 minor league games.Cubs fans, who have been waiting for a World Series championship since 1908 and have experienced just one playoff series victory since, are desperate for success. If Bryant is all he is cracked up to be and brings the Cubs back to their century-old glory days, his brief, contentious sojourn to the minors will be forgotten.Advertisement
