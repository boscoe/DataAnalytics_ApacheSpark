At times in spring training, nothing short of Derek Jeter’s strolling through the clubhouse with a supermodel on each arm would have drawn more attention than the radar gun when Masahiro Tanaka was pitching.The red numerals that flashed may as well have been accompanied by sirens as Tanaka’s fastball began to register regularly around 90 miles an hour, several clicks below the norm.This fixation on Tanaka’s velocity — and the trouble it might portend for a pitcher who missed two months last season with a frayed elbow ligament — became a source of irritation for the Yankees even before they played their first regular-season game.
                In the Bronx, 48,469 fans filled up Yankee Stadium for the season opener. Explore the scene of opening day in this panoramic image.            But they were forced to revisit the topic once again Monday after Tanaka, the team’s presumed ace, was knocked around in the Yankees’ 6-1, season-opening loss to the Toronto Blue Jays before a capacity crowd at Yankee Stadium.AdvertisementTanaka, hit with a five-run flurry in the third inning, lasted just four innings, the shortest stint by a Yankees starting pitcher on opening day since Phil Niekro’s four-inning outing against Boston in 1985.Advertisement“I was in bad counts,” Tanaka said. “I just wasn’t able to pitch the way I wanted.”As debuts go, this was not a good one. The Yankees, who struggled mightily to score last season, managed three hits, their lone run coming on a home run by Brett Gardner. The man replacing Jeter at shortstop, Didi Gregorius, killed a last-ditch rally with a base-running blunder. And the defense, expected to be significantly improved, did not help Tanaka’s cause as third baseman Chase Headley threw away a bunted ball in the Blue Jays’ big inning.One of the few bright spots was the return to center stage of Alex Rodriguez, who was suspended all of last season for allegations he used performance-enhancing drugs.Rodriguez, who batted seventh as the designated hitter, kissed his bat as he stepped into the dugout after batting practice. He tipped his cap to the fans in the bleachers who chanted, “A-Rod,” during the first-inning roll call, a ritual shout-out that is usually reserved for position players.It was one of several moments when Rodriguez was made to feel welcome, and he encouraged more with his play, working an eight-pitch walk, singling to center and lining out to right.Rodriguez, though, does not figure to be central to the Yankees’ hopes of returning to the playoffs after their two-year absence. Tanaka does, and Manager Joe Girardi said he could best help the team simply by providing 30 or 32 starts.Although doctors did not recommend that Tanaka have Tommy John surgery, fear remains that his elbow ligament could give way at any moment, as has happened recently with pitchers like the Texas Rangers’ Yu Darvish, the Mets’ Zack Wheeler, and Brady Aiken, the top pick in last year’s amateur draft.This has led some to parse Tanaka’s decision to throw more two-seam fastballs (which have more movement but less velocity than fastballs that are gripped across four seams) and his decision Monday to throw more sliders and split-finger fastballs than usual.Advertisement“You know, I’m getting tired of talking about it, to be honest with you,” Girardi said at the end of his postgame news conference, his point being that a pitch’s location and movement are as important as its velocity.Still, concerns about Tanaka’s health are real enough that Girardi limited his innings during spring training and ensured that he would have six days between starts, a pattern that will be repeated early in the season, when the team has multiple days off.The worries also gave life, somewhat humorously, to conspiracy theories Monday when the scoreboard at the Stadium did not show velocity readings during Tanaka’s first inning.“I don’t know why that was,” Tanaka said when he was asked if he had anything to do with it.What bit Tanaka against the Blue Jays was falling behind in counts, and his command in those counts suffered.Asked why he threw so few fastballs, Tanaka had a reasonable explanation. “Because they were being hit,” he said.In the third inning, Kevin Pillar singled past a diving Headley, Devon Travis walked, and the Blue Jays took a 1-0 lead when Headley threw wildly on a Jose Reyes bunt. Russell Martin extended the lead to 3-0 when he poked a first-pitch fastball that was up and over the plate to right field for a two-run single. After Jose Bautista flied out to left, Edwin Encarnacion belted a home run to left.Although Tanaka notched three strikeouts in the fourth — he finished with six, having cruised through his first two innings — he was laboring, allowing Pillar and Reyes to reach base on a hit and a walk. Tanaka was removed after throwing 82 pitches.“The key with him is to keep the ball up a little bit because he throws so many balls with late movement that are balls and gets you to chase out of the zone,” Martin said. “To overcomplicate it more than that, there’s no need to.”AdvertisementBlue Jays center fielder Dalton Pompey said: “I felt like his command was all right. I faced him last year, too, and he was electric last year.”The Blue Jays added another run in the seventh on a Travis home run off Chasen Shreve, but the big third inning was plenty for Drew Hutchison, a 24-year-old making his first opening day start. He allowed three hits over six innings, the only blemish a leadoff home run in the sixth by Gardner.The Yankees threatened in the eighth with two on and two outs and their cleanup hitter, Mark Teixeira, at the plate. But Gregorius was thrown out trying to steal third on the first pitch to Teixeira, against whom the infield had shifted toward right.“Hopefully it never happens again,” Gregorius said.Girardi, who wore a look of disbelief in the dugout when Gregorius was thrown out, was surely happy to hear that. If their opener told the Yankees anything about what lies ahead, it was that there is plenty of work to do.A version of this article appears in print on April 7, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: One Up, One Down: Unable to Ease Concerns, Tanaka Struggles in Opener.
