A North Texas high school football team has secured a spot in the playoffs thanks to a winning coin flip at a fast-food burger restaurant. Timberview High School lost Friday, 33-29, dropping it into a three-way tie in its district. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that tiebreaker rules meant one of the three teams was eliminated on point differential, leaving Timberview and Waxahachie, which is coached by the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Jon Kitna. The rules required that the tiebreaker be decided by the coin toss. Coaches gathered Friday night at a Whataburger in Midlothian, where the coin came up tails, sending Timberview to the Class 5A Division II playoffs as the No. 2 seed.A version of this brief appears in print on November 8, 2015, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Coin Flip Decides Playoff Spot.
