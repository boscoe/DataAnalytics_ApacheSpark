Week 7 scores and highlightsRumors began swirling early in the week that Dez Bryant, the Cowboys’ star wide receiver, might miraculously return to the field this week after sustaining a broken foot in Week 2. The source of those rumors? None other than the Cowboys’ owner, Jerry Jones.“We’ll take a real good look at him tomorrow and Thursday,” Jones said in a radio interview. “It totally depends on how he’s doing. He had a good end of the week last week. He got in some really good work. He didn’t have much negative response from that work. It was strenuous work, the kind that if he can step out here and have a couple of really good days of practice then you could see him go.”The reality is that it is unlikely Bryant will be anywhere near ready to play Sunday, giving him more time to spend with the pet monkey he has adopted, which he named Dallas Bryant.PICK: GIANTSAdvertisement
