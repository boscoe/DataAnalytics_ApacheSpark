The N.B.A. playoffs this year have an exciting cast. There is Stephen Curry and the supercharged Warriors; the veterans on the Spurs; the Pelicans and the playoff debutant Anthony Davis; and LeBron James in his return to Cleveland.And then there are the Nets, who grabbed the last playoff spot Wednesday night after posting a record of just 38-44. That earned them a seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks, who finished 22 games better, at 60-22.A losing team in the N.B.A. playoffs is not all that uncommon. There is even another one this year, the Boston Celtics, who finished 40-42 and earned the seventh seed in the East and a series against the Cavaliers.A big reason this happens is the decade-long imbalance in the N.B.A. conferences. For years, Western teams have regularly fattened their records against their weaker Eastern counterparts. As a result, while many winning teams from the West, like Oklahoma City this year, have missed out on the playoffs, relatively weak Eastern teams have qualified.AdvertisementIn this century, 12 teams have made the playoffs with a losing record. All were from the East.The worst of these was the 2004 Celtics, who were 36-46, two games worse than this year’s Nets. They were swept by the Indiana Pacers in the playoffs, with no game closer than 13 points.
            Since 2000, 12 teams with losing records have made the playoffs, including two this season. So far, every one has lost in the first round.        All 10 of the Nets and Celtics’ predecessors lost their opening playoff series, posting a combined record of 10-40, a .200 winning percentage.AdvertisementStill, the Nets are hopeful.“The playoffs is a whole other monster,” Jarrett Jack said after the Nets’ last regular-season game. “Things could totally be different in that landscape.”“We have to go out and develop a game plan, control the tempo, rebound and score against them continuously,’ ” Nets Coach Lionel Hollins said of the Hawks in a conference call with reporters Thursday.He sounded determined, but does history offer any hope for a team with a losing record? Perhaps the Nets can look to the Hawks in 2008.Led by Joe Johnson, Josh Smith and the rookie Al Horford, Atlanta rode an 11-4 stretch starting in mid-March to the last playoff berth. The Hawks faced the top-seeded Celtics of Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Paul Pierce and Rajon Rondo, who had been 66-16 in the regular season, best in the league by seven games.Two easy Celtics wins at home to start made it look as if the series would be the expected formality. But the Hawks countered, winning their home games, with Johnson scoring 35 points in Game 4.The teams continued to trade home wins until Game 7, in Boston. There, the better team finally asserted itself with a comfortable 99-65 win. But Atlanta had overachieved by any measure, especially considering that the Celtics went on to win the N.B.A. title.AdvertisementThough it would be fair to call many of these losing playoff teams mediocre, none were truly bad. But peering back further in history, when the rules were different, it is possible to find terrible teams that were given admittance to the N.B.A. playoffs.None was worse than the 1952-53 Baltimore Bullets. Their star, Don Barksdale, is remembered for being the first black man to play in an All-Star Game, not for his part in their horrid 16-54 season.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Six of their 16 wins came against the abysmal Philadelphia Warriors, who finished the season 12-57. Because four of the five teams in each division made the playoffs, the Bullets were in, probably to the annoyance of the Milwaukee Hawks, eliminated in the West despite 27 wins.The first round of the playoffs was best of three then, and after 80-62 and 90-81 victories by the Knicks, the Bullets’ season was over, and they were lost to history.The 2014-15 Nets are facing steep odds. If the past is a guide, even one win against Atlanta would be a big achievement.A version of this article appears in print on April 17, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: It’s N.B.A. Playoff Time.
