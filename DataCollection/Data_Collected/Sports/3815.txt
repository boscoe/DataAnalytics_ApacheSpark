The Islanders scored two power-play goals after entering with just two on the road this season.“I had faith in our power play,” Coach Jack Capuano said. “We had a couple of good ones in the last nine periods of hockey we played, but we didn’t have the results” that the team had Saturday. He added, “Fortunately, tonight we got the bounces that we needed.”Josh Bailey and Cal Clutterbuck also scored for the Islanders, who were coming off a 3-2 loss Friday night at Florida, a game that the Panthers won in a five-round shootout.“A lot of things haven’t been bouncing our way, but we’ve been really working for everything we’ve been getting,” Tavares said. “We’re getting timely goals and certainly we seem to be getting better as the game goes on.”Alex Killorn and Anton Stralman scored for the Lightning, who blew a two-goal lead. Steven Stamkos had two assists.“Credit the Islanders, they hung in there,” Tampa Bay Coach Jon Cooper said. A “2-0 lead in our home and we found a way to cough it up.”Tampa Bay has dropped two in a row after winning three straight. It has given up five power-play goals over the last two games.“It’s frustrating, that’s for sure,” Cooper said.Advertisement
