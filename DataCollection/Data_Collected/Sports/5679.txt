PASADENA, Calif. — As Jameis Winston moved forward, looking for another improbable outcome, then circled counterclockwise in desperation, Florida State’s comeback magic came unraveled in spectacular fashion.On a fourth-down play Thursday late in the third quarter of the Rose Bowl, Winston, the Seminoles’ hitherto-undefeated quarterback, spun to elude Oregon defenders, only to fall clumsily backward on the grass.The ball slipped from his grasp, took a bounce and landed in the hands of Oregon linebacker Tony Washington, who ran 58 yards for a touchdown.A taut game turned into a rout, as the up-tempo, high-scoring Ducks scored the game’s final 34 points and ended Florida State’s 29-game winning streak with a 59-20 victory.

To be around these guys every single day, that’s probably the biggest blessing of all. We get a few more days together.”AdvertisementThe Rose Bowl served as a semifinal in the inaugural season of the four-team College Football Playoff. Oregon (13-1), seeded second and searching for its first national title in football, will face No. 4 Ohio State, which defeated No. 1 Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, in the title game Jan. 12 in Arlington, Tex.Advertisement“We want ‘Bama!” Oregon fans in the partisan crowd of 91,322 had chanted.The Rose Bowl, played on a cool, sunny afternoon, represented a highly anticipated match between high-scoring offenses led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks. Oregon’s Marcus Mariota, the 2014 winner, completed 26 of 36 passes for 338 yards and 2 touchdowns.Winston, the 2013 Heisman winner, was 29 of 45 for 348 yards and a touchdown in his first collegiate loss. The Florida State offense racked up 528 yards, to 639 for Oregon, and the teams combined for 47 plays of 10 yards or more.The Ducks converted four consecutive Florida State turnovers, including Winston’s stumble and fumble, into second-half touchdowns. Florida State (13-1) trailed by just 25-20 after Winston threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Travis Rudolph with 8 minutes 7 seconds left in the third quarter.Then, in a span of 12:54, ending with a 21-yard touchdown run by Oregon running back Thomas Tyner, the Ducks outscored Florida State, 34-0. Oregon’s 59 points represent a Rose Bowl record.“If everybody in this room just want to be real with themselves, this game could have went either way,” Winston said afterward. “We turned over the ball a lot. We beat ourself. Just be real with yourself right now — we beat ourself.”The Seminoles, winner of last year’s national championship, had not lost a game since the 2012 regular season.“It was an extremely great run,” Florida State Coach Jimbo Fisher said. “Hopefully, we can put together another one.”AdvertisementWinston, a redshirt sophomore, and Mariota, a redshirt junior, are both expected to declare for the coming N.F.L. draft. Speculation persists that they could be chosen first and second over all.Before Winston’s fumble, the game unfolded as expected, with Florida State trying to keep up with Oregon’s fast-motion offense. Even the officials struggled to keep up with Oregon’s high-speed flair. The Ducks appeared to score their first touchdown on a 1-yard run, but officials belatedly called off the play to review the previous play, in which Charles Nelson took a pitch from Mariota, was flipped by a tackler and landed just short of the goal line.Oregon scored, again, two plays later, on Freeman’s 1-yard run, and then added a surprise 2-point conversion when the holder Taylor Alie threw quickly to Torrodney Prevot. Oregon had an 8-3 lead, and the full attention of everyone in attendance.“We feel our tempo is a weapon,” Mariota said.The Seminoles had a season-long habit of falling behind and coming back to win, and its previous four victories came by a total of 13 points. They kept the Ducks within reach until turnovers undid the Seminoles. Both teams gained 208 yards in the third quarter, but Florida State had four turnovers, and Oregon had four touchdowns.With Oregon leading, 18-13, the Florida State freshman tailback Dalvin Cook fumbled on the first drive of the third quarter. Five plays later, the Ducks scored on Royce Freeman’s 3-yard touchdown.Winston and the Seminoles responded with Rudolph’s scoring catch. Soon enough, though, Oregon receiver Darren Carrington caught a short pass from Mariota, slipped past Florida State defensive back Tyler Hunter and ran for a 56-yard touchdown. The Ducks had a 32-20 lead. The Seminoles marched to respond again, but Cook fumbled once more after making a third-down reception near midfield.Two plays later, Mariota lobbed a pass to Carrington, who caught it inside the 10-yard line, eluded Hunter again and fell into the end zone. Oregon had a 39-20 lead as the sun set in California and on Florida State’s chances.Only Winston could lead the type of comeback required. Instead, he spun until he fumbled wildly as he fell — “That was crazy,” he said — and was greeted by defeat for the first time in 27 starts.Advertisement“It was just an unfortunate play, man,” Winston said. “I never thought I would slip, throw the ball backwards.”The defenses took turns through most of the first half bending easily yet breaking stubbornly, as if leery of stepping on the colorfully painted end zones. Like marching bands, the teams made a show of moving back and forth on the field but not contributing much to the scoreboard.After the Ducks stalled at Florida State’s 22-yard line looking for a second touchdown in the first quarter, the Seminoles churned downfield with a battery of running plays, slowing the pace between bursts by the quick-footed Cook, who finished with 103 yards on 15 carries.But Winston’s fourth-down plunge from the 1-yard line, initially ruled a touchdown, was overturned when replays showed that his knee touched the ground before the ball reached the goal line.The Ducks used 19 plays to go 88 yards the other direction, but settled for a field goal and an 11-3 lead. The Seminoles went the other direction for 13 plays and settled for a field goal.After Mariota threw his third interception of the season — a hush fell over the stadium, as if fans had just seen a comet — Florida State’s all-American kicker Roberto Aguayo ended the half by missing a 54-yard field-goal attempt that struck the left upright.It was just the beginning of a string of unusual plays, none more than the one in which Winston sputtered and toppled like a tired top, symbolizing the end of Florida State’s streak and Oregon’s ascension to the national championship game.“It’s crazy,” Helfrich said of the new playoff format, with his team 11 days from playing for the national championship. “It goes from four to two and all of a sudden their season’s a failure. That is a great team and very well coached.”After the game, as remaining fans in the stands sang the “Animal House” anthem “Shout,” Oregon players rushed into a jubilant locker room, some with roses clenched in their teeth.AdvertisementMoments after, first Fisher, then Winston, drove solemnly by on a golf cart, quietly headed somewhere out of sight.A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Awe and Shock: It’s Ducks vs. Buckeyes.
