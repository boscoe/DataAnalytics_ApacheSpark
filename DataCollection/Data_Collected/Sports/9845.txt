Austin, staving off an upset bid and advancing to the round of 32. The fifth-seeded Utes held Stephen F. Austin 30 points below its season average, suffocating the No. 12 Lumberjacks for a 57-50 victory in the South Region. Utah advanced to play No. 4 Georgetown on Saturday. During the season, Utah’s defense allowed an average of 56.9 points per game, 11th-best in the nation. Its field-goal defense, 38.2 percent, was ranked seventh. It brought that tenacity to its first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance since 2009. Stephen F. Austin averaged nearly 80 points per game during the regular season, but Utah limited the Lumberjacks to just 17 field goals in 51 attempts (33.3 percent), including 5 of 26 (19.2 percent) from behind the 3-point line. “Our defense was as good as it’s been all year to hold that team,” Utah Coach Larry Krystkowiak said. He added, “That’s what won the game for us, our defensive intensity.”Still, the game was not decided until a series of oddities in the final minutes. Utah’s freshman center Jacob Poeltl, a 43.8 percent free-throw shooter, made two to give Utah a 52-46 lead. Stephen F. Austin’s Ty Charles, who led the team with 14 points, banked in a 3-pointer from the top of the key, pulling the Lumberjacks within 3 points with fewer than 90 seconds remaining. The teams traded missed shots and free-throw attempts before Utah escaped with victory. Utah (25-8) looked ripe for an upset from the time the bracket was announced. Ranked in the top 10 a month ago, the Utes lost four of their final seven games. And Stephen F. Austin (29-5), winners of 28 of its previous 29 games, was seeded 12th a year ago when it surprised No. 5 Virginia Commonwealth for the first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in the college’s history. Utah had a 26-19 halftime lead, but Stephen F. Austin’s trapping defense discombobulated the Utes early in the second half, as the Lumberjacks scored the period’s first six points, part of a 10-0 run that bridged intermission. But 26-25 was as close as Stephen F. Austin would get, as Utah stretched its lead to 12 before the Lumberjacks crept back. Thomas Walkup and Jacob Parker, the past two players of the year in the Southland Conference, combined to average nearly 30 points per game during the season. Utah held Walkup to 12 points, Parker to 6. Poeltl led Utah with 18 points, making all seven of his field-goal attempts, and 8 rebounds. The senior Delon Wright, a rangy 6-foot-5 all-Pacific-12 Conference guard, had 11 points.“It was their ability to score at the rim, our inability to score offensively,” Stephen F. Austin coach Brad Underwood said. “That made it a difficult challenge.” Advertisement
