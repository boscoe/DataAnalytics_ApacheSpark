They also said the majority of challengers favored all racing being held in Bermuda rather than having a qualifying regatta in Auckland, New Zealand.Luna Rossa, a top challenger to the cup holder, Oracle Team USA, said last week that it would “be obliged to withdraw” if the race boat was downsized midcycle. Another top contender, Emirates Team New Zealand, supported the Italians.America’s Cup organizers then pulled a qualifying regatta from Auckland. The Kiwis said they needed that regatta to secure government financing for their Cup bid.Emirates Team New Zealand said on its Twitter account Tuesday night that it has filed for arbitration to reinstate Auckland for the qualifier “based on signed documents and fulfillment of the AC35 protocol.”A Luna Rossa spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.There is some question how much money the downsizing of boats will save considering that some teams have spent several months and tens of millions of dollars designing 62-footers.As it was, the 62-foot catamarans were said to be a cost-saving measure over the 72-foot catamarans used in the 2013 Cup races in San Francisco.The decision by the two-time defending champion Oracle Team USA to contest the America’s Cup in Bermuda rather than in the United States has made it difficult for some teams and the event itself to raise sponsorship money.While smaller boats would mean reduced costs and a smaller crew, they could also mean less sizzle than the 2013 America’s Cup provided. A boat in the 45- to 50-foot class would also be the smallest in America’s Cup history.If Italy and New Zealand drop out, Oracle Team USA would quite likely have an easier shot at retaining the trophy.Advertisement
