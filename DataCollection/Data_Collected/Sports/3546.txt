Arsenal’s spectacular flameout may reach its nadir when it hosts Dinamo Zagreb on Tuesday (2:45 p.m. Eastern time, Fox Sports 1). The word you Arsenal-haters are looking for is “Gunnerfreude.” Tired of Wenger & Co.? Fox Sports 2 has a better doubleheader on Tuesday: Zenit-St. Petersburg, which is already through, hosts Valencia at noon, and then scorching-hot Barcelona will try to join it there when it plays Roma at the Camp Nou (2:45 p.m.).On Wednesday, Shakhtar Donetsk-Real Madrid (2:45 p.m., Fox Deportes) could be a wide-open affair, while CSKA-Wolfsburg (noon, FS1) and Manchester United-P.S.V. (2:45 p.m., FS1) could clear up things in a very tight Group B.Turkey Day brings that traditional American delicacy, the Europa League. Ignore the exotic but consonant-heavy appetizers — Krasnodar, Qarabag, Rubin Kazan — and focus instead on a meaty matchup in Glasgow, where struggling Celtic will host Ajax, the greatest club in the world and one you should consider supporting (3 p.m., FS2). Ajax most likely needs wins in its final two group games to reach next year’s knockout rounds.Do not miss first-place Leicester City against second-place Manchester United on Saturday (12:30 p.m., NBC). Yes, you read that right: Leicester City is in first place in the Premier League. Honest. I looked it up. Keep an eye on Foxes striker Jamie Vardy, who leads the Premier League with 13 goals; he might be your favorite English player by dinnertime.The M.L.S. playoffs have provided some terrific moments so far, so there’s reason to think the conference semifinal second legs on Sunday will offer more. Portland will take a 3-1 lead to F.C. Dallas (5 p.m., ESPN), while Columbus holds a 2-0 advantage as it heads to New Jersey to face the Red Bulls (7:30 p.m., FS1).Advertisement
