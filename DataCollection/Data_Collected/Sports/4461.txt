Adrian Peterson said he thought the team had been “outcoached” in addition to being outplayed.Minnesota also lost perhaps its three best defensive players — safety Harrison Smith, linebacker Anthony Barr and nose tackle Linval Joseph — and all three have been ruled out for Thursday’s game against the Cardinals.Arizona’s N.F.L.-best offense is led by Carson Palmer, who has a full complement of weapons now that receivers John Brown and Michael Floyd appear back to full health. The rookie David Johnson could also be poised for a solid game. He had 99 rushing yards and two catches for 21 yards and a score on Sunday in his first start.Pick: CardinalsAdvertisement
