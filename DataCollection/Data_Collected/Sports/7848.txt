Amid concerns about multiple teams moving willy-nilly to Los Angeles without league approval, Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., has formally established a committee of owners to oversee the process of putting a team in the country’s second-largest market.The committee includes some of Goodell’s closest allies: Clark Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs; Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots; John Mara of the Giants; Bob McNair of the Houston Texans; Jerry Richardson of the Carolina Panthers; and Art Rooney II of the Pittsburgh Steelers.The Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities will evaluate the stadiums available in the region, “oversee the application of the relocation guidelines in the event that one or more clubs seek to move to Los Angeles” and “confirm that all steps taken in Los Angeles are consistent with the Constitution and Bylaws and N.F.L. policies,” according to a memo Goodell sent to owners Monday.Goodell reminded the owners that any team relocating to Los Angeles would require a three-fourths vote of approval by the owners.Last month, Stan Kroenke of the St. Louis Rams announced plans to build an 80,000-seat stadium south of downtown Los Angeles, even as officials in St. Louis unveiled their own plans to build a new stadium to keep the Rams from moving. On Tuesday, Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri said that two companies would move existing infrastructure to make way for a stadium, assuming a financial plan is approved.A version of this article appears in print on February 11, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Moving Committee Established.
