COLUMBUS, Ohio —  Thad Matta, who had just secured the most victories in Ohio State men’s basketball history, was celebrated at halfcourt inside Chicago’s United Center after a flawed but gutsy victory against Minnesota in the Big Ten tournament Thursday.Matta was handed a pristine white No. 298 jersey. It was an appropriate token for his 298th win, which has forever sewn him into program lore.He beamed and posed for pictures with his team, his wife, Barbara, and their daughters, Ali and Emily.Yet in the preceding two weeks, Matta had deflected questions from the news media about the inevitably of the feat with jokes and a brand of sarcastic stoicism that has become familiar in his 11 seasons in Columbus. Highs and lows are often met with humor and self-deprecation.Advertisement“Honestly, I haven’t thought about it,” Matta said with a thin smile. “I think if it happens, then I may take a deep breath and say, ‘Hey, let me think about what it really means to me.’ ”AdvertisementAt a place like Ohio State, where coaches and athletes are lionized, Matta has been careful in what he is willing to reveal to strangers.“He’s perfectly fine with coming to the gym, getting work done, going home and nothing in between,” said Aaron Craft, a former Ohio State star point guard. “When he has to, he can turn it on. But he’s never a guy that’s going to go out and seek that kind of attention and seek that kind of glory for himself.”Archie Miller, who studied under Matta for two seasons in Columbus before taking the helm at Dayton in 2011, agreed.“He wants to go about his business,” Miller said. “He wants do it in a way where he doesn’t have to be the center of attention.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            On the night of a milestone, though — one achieved by overcoming back problems that have rendered him unable to easily walk, sit or dress himself — Matta was grateful and introspective.“The people it probably means the most for me is my wife and my two daughters,” he told reporters at a postgame news conference. “Because I’ve gone probably — well, going on eight years — with a disability. And they’re the ones that have suffered the things that I can’t do as a father — I can’t do as a husband.”In 2007, Matta, who has had back problems most of his life, was left partially disabled after emergency surgery to alleviate extreme pain. His right foot no longer works properly, and he wears a brace to prevent him from falling. His back still hurts, and it has seemed to grow worse this season. He sits on a high stool during news conferences, and he is increasingly tethered to a high chair next to the team’s bench.Advertisement“I have some really, really bad days in terms of coming home after games, and they’ve got to help me get my shoes and socks off,” Matta said. “And for them to stay the course with me, it means a heck of a lot more to me for them than it does for myself.”Matta has won five Big Ten championships and four conference tournament titles and has taken his club to the N.C.A.A. tournament in eight of the last nine seasons. He led Ohio State to its first title-game appearance since the 1960s in 2007, the Final Four in 2012, the round of 8 a year later, and the round of 16 in 2010 and 2011.This season has been trying, however.One day after the team honored Matta, the Buckeyes fell to Michigan State in the Big Ten quarterfinals; it was the program’s worst showing since 2008.Ohio State (23-10) — which earned a No. 10 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament and will play Virginia Commonwealth on Thursday — trailed by as many as 17 points less than a week after a 24-point loss to Wisconsin at home that could be considered the nadir of the team’s inconsistent season.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It’s sort of illustrative of the short-attention-span fan right now.”
            Ohio State Coach Thad Matta’s coaching tree spreads far and wide across the college basketball world and beyond. Under his tutelage — be it as an assistant or staff member of Matta’s — the likes of Brad Stevens (Boston Celtics), Sean Miller (Arizona), John Groce (Illinois) and Archie Miller (Dayton) have bloomed into fixtures within the sport. Below are some of the coaches whom Matta has mentored and some of their protégés. Asterisk denotes team is in the N.C.A.A. tournament.

But if this continues, I think he could be in trouble.”AdvertisementBaptist said Matta was firmly backed by Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith and the administration “not only for as many games as he’s won, but for the type of person he is.”Alan Major, the former coach at Charlotte, who teamed with Matta for eight seasons as an assistant at Xavier and Ohio State from 2001 to 2010, knows Matta’s personality well.“He’s just got this kind of next-door-neighbor, blue-collar, guy-you’d-love-to-sit-on-the-front-porch-with-and-have-an-iced-tea mentality,” Major said.Even so, a disgruntled minority of fans has grown louder in recent months. Expectations are soaring here, especially after the football team won the inaugural College Football Playoff. An early exit in last year’s N.C.A.A. tournament did not help.Earlier this month in a teleconference, Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo compared Matta to Lloyd Carr, the former Michigan football coach, saying, “I think he does an incredible job, and I’ve gained so much respect for him over the years, and yet he doesn’t seem to please enough people sometimes in Columbus.”But those who know Matta best paint him as an optimist whose back struggles have led to relentless hope on the court. It is a notion apparent in interviews with his players, who maintain their goal of returning to the Final Four despite their struggles.Such outlooks might begin with how Matta embraces his pain.“You would never be able to tell unless he told you about it,” said Brad Stevens, the Boston Celtics’ coach, who began his foray into basketball under Matta at Butler in 2000. “Or excuse me, unless you asked him about it, because he’s not going to say anything.”Matta and the Buckeyes remain dreamers in a season in which they have been doubted — even by those within their passionate fan base.“The beauty of Thad is he does it and coaches for the right people and for the right reasons,” Major said. “I know he doesn’t let those things get to him. He knows who matters, and that’s the best part about him.”A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Personal Triumph for a Coach, but a Trying Year for His Team.
