Cardinals (3-1) at Lions (0-4)4:05 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 3N.F.L. Week 5 scores and highlightsYou have to feel for fans of the Detroit Lions, the N.F.L.’s only winless team. The noncall by the officials that cost them a victory against the Seahawks last week inspired a Lions fan (or fans) to buy space on several billboards in and around Detroit insinuating that N.F.L. officials are blind.At this point in the perpetually forsaken-by-the-football-gods franchise’s history, it is almost surprising that there have not been any Sarah McLachlan-narrated public service ads imploring people to take a moment to hug the Lions fans in their lives. Weepy commercials or not, go ahead and hug a Lions fan. You’ll feel better. Everyone will win. Except, of course, the Lions.PICK: CARDINALSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
