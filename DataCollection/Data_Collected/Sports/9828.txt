JACKSONVILLE, Fla. —  Few teams cherish having a No. 5 seed, a position that seems cursed with upsets against opponents with nothing to lose. So Arkansas was in a tough spot Thursday night as it tried to fend off the 12th-seeded Wofford Terriers, who were looking for their first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in four appearances.The Terriers had plenty of chances, but with an opportunity to send the game to overtime, they missed two 3-point attempts, and the Razorbacks escaped with a 56-53 victory.With 1 minute 40 seconds left in the second half, Alandise Harris hit a short shot and was fouled, and he made the free throw to put Arkansas ahead by 3 points. It was the 18th and final lead change in a game in which neither team led by more than 5. Michael Qualls led the Razorbacks with 20 points, and Bobby Portis scored 15.Arkansas advanced to face North Carolina, the West Region’s No. 4 seed, here on Saturday.Wofford, the champion of the Southern Conference, entered with its best seed, having reached the tournament in four of the past six years.
