Convicted of sexual assault charges in three states as a result of guilty or no-contest pleas, the former N.F.L. safety Darren Sharper entered a formal plea of not guilty before a federal magistrate judge in New Orleans, but that was considered a legal formality. When a multijurisdiction plea agreement was announced last month, the district attorney in New Orleans, where Sharper faced state and federal charges, said he was expected to plead guilty in Louisiana as well. Felony guilty pleas cannot be accepted in the magistrate court during initial appearances. Sharper is charged with drugging women with the intention of raping them.■ Muhammad Wilkerson, a premier defensive lineman who has sought a new contract to no avail, was conspicuously absent when the Jets opened the voluntary portion of their off-season training program. TOM PEDULLAA version of this brief appears in print on April 7, 2015, on Page B17 of the New York edition with the headline: Sharper’s Case Advances in New Orleans Court.
