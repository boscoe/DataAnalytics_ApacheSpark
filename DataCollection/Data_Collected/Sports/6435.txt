The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission said Steve Asmussen, one of the sport’s most accomplished trainers, and his top assistant, Scott Blasi, did not abuse the horses in their care as the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animalsalleged last year.After a 10-month investigation, the racing commission found that the two trainers did not violate any of its rules. The allegations were a result of an undercover investigation in 2013 by a PETA investigator who employed a hidden camera in Asmussen’s barn to record seven hours of video. The group said the video showed mistreatment of Asmussen’s horses to be widespread.PETA also produced a 285-page report about Asmussen’s operations consisting of the investigator’s notes, medical documents and reports from veterinarians who reviewed the videotape. The commission said that PETA denied a request to reveal the complete collection of its materials.“On the contrary, the investigation revealed that Asmussen-trained horses were well cared for as measured by such factors as incidence of injuries and K.H.R.C. veterinarian scratches,” the commission said in a statement. “The stewards concluded the allegations do not support any administrative action because no evidence of rules violations was found.”AdvertisementClark Brewster, a lawyer for Asmussen, did not return phone calls or emails.The New York State Gaming Commission also is conducting an investigation into similar allegations made by PETA against the Asmussen stable in the summer of 2013 and is expected to announce the results of their investigation in the coming weeks.AdvertisementThe New York StateLabor Department also is investigating allegations that Asmussen and Blasi falsified identification documents and did not meet minimum wage or overtime requirements for their employees.“If there was nothing wrong in the documentation that PETA found, then something is very wrong with racing in Kentucky,” said a PETA senior vice president, Kathy Guillermo.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
