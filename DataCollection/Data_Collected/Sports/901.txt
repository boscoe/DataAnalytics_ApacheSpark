But one got the feeling that skipping it would have been just fine for everyone involved.Three days after an emotional loss to Mexico drained the team’s energy and brought down a hail of criticism on Coach Jurgen Klinsmann and his players, the Americans pushed their way through an uninspired exhibition at a less-than-half-full Red Bull Arena. That they lost the match, 1-0, did not brighten the mood of the team or the announced crowd of 9,214.“It’s not as easy as it looks out there, man,” striker Jozy Altidore said. “Right now, we’re going through a rough patch.”The loss is sure to increase the pressure on Klinsmann, the coach of the United States men since 2011. The Americans have lost five of their last six games, including embarrassing defeats against Panama and Jamaica in the Gold Cup; the Concacaf Cup loss to Mexico over the weekend; and a humbling loss in a friendly against Brazil. On Tuesday, the Americans were shut out for the first time since a loss to Germany at the 2014 World Cup and blanked at home for the first time in nearly three years.Klinsmann, however, dismissed questions — again — about whether the recent defeats should cost him his job. He seemed confident, completely at ease — again — smiling through his news conference after the game and contending that the sky was not, in fact, falling.“There are not only sunny days,” Klinsmann said. “We’ve had a lot of sunshine — 2012, 2013, 2014. Now it’s raining a little bit.”U.S. Soccer’s president, Sunil Gulati, attended Tuesday’s match and would say only that he and Klinsmann had spoken since Saturday’s loss. The Americans are not set to gather again until November, when they open the 2018 World Cup qualifying cycle with matches against St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago.“It’s not part of my character to give up just because we’ve had a couple of bad results,” Klinsmann said. “That sits in your stomach. That drives you even more.”But, he added, “I’m not only the coach in good times; I’m here also to take the team through tough times.”That is what they are. Tuesday was just the latest in a string of frustrating results, starting with an early exit from the Concacaf Gold Cup over the summer and extending to Saturday’s defeat to Mexico at the Rose Bowl, when the Americans absorbed nearly two hours of pressure only to surrender the winning goal minutes from the end.Klinsmann’s lineup had a thrown-together feel. He had released eight players from camp on Sunday and a ninth, Fabian Johnson, on Monday after scolding him about asking to be taken out of the Mexico loss. In came five new faces, but there was little cohesion on display.Any hopes for a more attacking mind-set disappeared with the announcement that Jermaine Jones and Danny Williams, neither of whom is known as particularly creative, would start in central midfield. Altidore and Gyasi Zardes started up front, as they did Saturday, but were again ineffective.The rest of the lineup seemed disconnected. Defenders Geoff Cameron and Brad Evans, the right side of the back line, exchanged angry words after several early miscommunications. Then Jones shouted at Evans after an Evans mistake led to a scrambling tackle — and a yellow card — for Jones.The mood in the half-filled stands was not much better. Klinsmann was booed during pregame introductions, and Brek Shea got the same treatment when he sent a free kick a dozen rows into the stands in the third minute. Zardes heard it after losing the ball over the end line, and Cameron did as well after sending a first-half header directly out of bounds.Everyone got a run — Klinsmann used all six of his substitutes in the second half — but only the Costa Rican players and fans seemed to have any fun, cheering a Joel Campbell goal in the 70th minute and a shutout by goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who had carried the Ticos to the World Cup quarterfinals in Brazil last year.The Americans could only lick their wounds and look ahead to a future that some hope includes a coaching change.“We support him 100 percent,” goalkeeper Tim Howard, who was making his first appearance since ending a yearlong sabbatical, said of Klinsmann. “He’s a big boy, and we’re big boys. We’ll get it right.”U.S. STILL IN CONTENTION Marc Pelosi and Jordan Kiesewetter scored second-half goals, and the United States’ under-23 team beat Canada, 2-0, in Sandy, Utah, to stay alive in Concacaf qualifying for the Olympics next year.
