Bubba Watson holed out with a 7-iron for eagle and tied the course record with a nine-under-par 63 to build a two-shot lead after three rounds at the Hero World Challenge in Nassau, Bahamas. Watson tied the record at Albany Golf Club set 10 minutes earlier by Paul Casey, who made nine birdies in his first 13 holes before closing with five pars for his 63, which left him two shots behind. The defending champion Jordan Spieth had a 68, leaving him four shots back.■ Marc Leishman birdied the last two holes to capitalize on slip-ups by Henrik Stenson and move into the lead on the third day of the Nedbank Challenge in Sun City, South Africa. He began the day at eight-under par, trailing Stenson by three shots, but a strong back nine helped him shoot a six-under 66 that left him 14-under and a stroke ahead of Stenson.A version of this brief appears in print on December 6, 2015, on Page SP10 of the New York edition with the headline: New Record Is Quickly Tied.
