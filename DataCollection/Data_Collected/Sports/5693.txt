Think of the familiar blueprint: an underdog high school basketball team in “Hoosiers” or the aging ballplayer Roy Hobbs in “The Natural” battles the odds to emerge with a victory.They are often transformed with the help of a coach, like Herman Boone in “Remember the Titans.” And sometimes the triumph is a personal one, as in Ray Kinsella’s recognition in “Field of Dreams” that he had built his Iowa cornfield diamond to reconcile with his long-dead father.It is rare that a sports film ends without some spiritual uplift, even when it ends in a loss. Rocky Balboa fought gloriously and proved he was not a bum in “Rocky.”I was thinking about this formula recently when I watched “Foxcatcher,” the latest sports-theme movie to find itself in the Academy Award discussions. It reminded me of another sweaty, award-winning movie, “Raging Bull.” By being so dark, they offer no inspiration and challenge the genre’s convention; unless despicable behavior elicits goose bumps for you, these films will not produce any.There are no hero’s epiphanies (except, maybe, Jake LaMotta’s jail-cell cry in “Raging Bull” that he was not “an animal,” while banging his head on the wall) and no great climaxes that let the directors freeze the screen and roll the credits.They are intense stories about irredeemable central characters: LaMotta, the middleweight boxer of the 1940s and 1950s, who alienates everyone close to him, and the creepy wrestling benefactor John E. du Pont, who shot and killed the 1984 Olympic gold medalist Dave Schultz in 1996.“Raging Bull” is the better film and, in my view, the greatest sports movie of all time because its director, Martin Scorsese, and its star, Robert De Niro, were so adept at conveying a world of violence and amoral men. Four years earlier, they had collaborated on “Taxi Driver.”In “Raging Bull,” Scorsese and De Niro create little separation between the LaMotta whose ring brutality was an asset and the LaMotta whose fists were used as weapons against his wife.The ring sequences in the film are stunning and suggest a heightened cinematic equivalent of the Friday night fights.“Foxcatcher,” directed by Bennett Miller, leaves you cold with Steve Carell’s portrayal of du Pont’s psychopathology. Du Pont is a masterful manipulator with money who creates a training center for Olympic wrestlers, but is, in truth, an awkward loser trying to create a world of personal achievement that will set him apart from his distant mother.“Foxcatcher” and “Raging Bull” tell bleak stories, among the most somber in the genre. There are other sad tales in sports films, but when I think of the paralyzing injury to the boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) in “Million Dollar Baby,” it is as part of the heroic inspiration of Clint Eastwood’s Academy Award-winning film. Until a dirty opponent’s after-the-bell punch sent Maggie falling into the ring stool, Eastwood had established her as a lovable, spunky up-and-comer and the surrogate daughter to the trainer he plays — the same man who writes stacks of unanswered letters to his own daughter.Filmmakers always face a distinct challenge in creating movies about sports, which have their own real-time clock and inherent drama and, to some extent, have been seen by many people. Fans watch sports hoping for buzzer-beaters and game-winning touchdown passes with the time ticking to zero. I want sports films to create an alternative universe, one in which a sports story is told not through a nine-inning game but as a love story, or a fantasy, or even a prison tale.For instance, “Moneyball,” Miller’s previous film, created a world of conflict within baseball: the rise of analytics against the pessimism of old-school scouts. It was compelling enough on its own that it limited the need for much baseball action. Oakland A’s General Manager Billy Beane, played by Brad Pitt, was quixotic enough that his own Sancho Panza, a stats wiz played by Jonah Hill, felt organic.If fictionalized or fictional stories, like “A League of Their Own” or “Field of Dreams,” relieve filmmakers of the need to hew to facts, I look forward to seeing how they will handle stories about newsmakers like Oscar Pistorius, Donald Sterling, Ray Rice and, maybe, Mo’ne Davis.Advertisement
