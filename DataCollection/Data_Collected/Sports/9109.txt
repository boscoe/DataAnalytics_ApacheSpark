But now that I think about it, it is the biggest goal I ever scored.”Boston also won the Canadian women’s hockey league championship in 2013.”Winning this is one of the biggest things you can do in women’s hockey and I’m so proud of our team to go through everything we did and win it in overtime,” said Weber, an Austrian who will join her national squad next month at the IIHF Division I world championships in Poland.Hilary Knight and Brianna Decker also scored for Boston.
