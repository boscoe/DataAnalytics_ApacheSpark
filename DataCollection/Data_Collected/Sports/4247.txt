In early 2014, Fabio Tordin, an executive with Media World, a Miami-based broadcast-rights broker, met with the leaders of Guatemala’s soccer federation to buy the media rights to the country’s 2022 World Cup qualifier matches.Tordin agreed to pay them a $200,000 bribe, according to an American indictment unsealed Thursday. Then, in a twist, he promised to pay one of the men, Brayan Jiménez, the federation president, $200,000 more, without telling the other man, Héctor Trujillo, the general secretary.In July, more than a year later, the three men met again, in Chicago. As the Guatemalans described how they had received their payoffs, according to the 236-page indictment, Jiménez said: “Nothing should be said over the telephone! Nothing!” Trujillo seemingly boasted that the alleged bribe had been routed to him by a third party through a sham contract that would not arouse any suspicion.
                The 16 men arrested Thursday include five current or former members of FIFA’s ruling executive committee and the current presidents of Concacaf and Conmebol.            In indicting more than a dozen top soccer officials Thursday as part of a widening international investigation of FIFA, the sport’s world governing body, American prosecutors set their sights on some of the leaders overseeing the sport across Latin America, particularly in Central America and Brazil.AdvertisementBut the indictment also highlighted the lucrative if not well-known world of media and marketing companies like Media World and the Traffic Group, which, prosecutors said, facilitated the acts of bribery central to the prosecutors’ case.AdvertisementJiménez and Trujillo are among the 16 defendants who are accused of charges including racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering in the 92-count indictment.Tordin, however, also emerged as a central player. He agreed last month to forfeit $675,000 that he had received for his role in several bribery schemes as part of a guilty plea on charges of wire and tax fraud.
                The Justice Department unsealed a 236-page indictment on Thursday that described charges against some of the most powerful leaders of international soccer.            Tordin figures prominently in a yearslong bribery narrative that focuses on two companies he has worked for: Media World and the Traffic Group, a Brazilian-based media and marketing company with international influence. Tordin first worked in finance at Traffic Brazil in São Paulo and later rose to be the chief executive of Traffic USA around 2003. After leaving Traffic, he became a consultant to Media World before joining the company full time in 2011.Traffic is probably best known for its influential role within the North American Soccer League, in which it is still believed to be an investor, and it has owned part or all of a few teams, including the Fort Lauderdale Strikers and the Atlanta Silverbacks. In October, the company sold the Carolina RailHawks after the indictment of one of its top executives and the guilty plea of another.Traffic’s dominance in brokering South and Central American soccer rights began to be challenged about a decade ago by Media World, a part of the Imagina Group, a Spanish media company. They were competing for contracts involving, among other things, rights to qualifier games in Uncaf, the regional federation of Central American countries, which is part of the larger Concacaf association, in advance of the 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 World Cups.According to the indictment and soccer executives, the value in these contracts rested largely with the possibility that the Central American teams would play Mexico or the United States, enticing networks in those countries, like Univision, to pay substantial fees.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Traffic, prosecutors said, paid off Nicaraguan, Panamanian and Guatemalan officials. Media World bribed officials from Honduras and El Salvador, the indictment said. At different times, under the scenario laid out by law enforcement officers, each company gave Eduardo Li, president of the Costa Rican federation, six-figure bribes. Media World paid Li about $300,000 through an intermediary account in Panama. (Li has been indicted.) In 2012, the two companies agreed to a revenue-sharing arrangement linked to the rights to World Cup qualifiers played by all Concacaf associations, including Uncaf.The details of the indictment did not surprise soccer executives who had long felt that the media rights for Central and South American soccer events had become nearly impossible to penetrate because of the influence of companies like Traffic and Media World.A soccer consultant, who did not want to hurt his business relationships by speaking publicly, said: “For a long time there have been suspicions about how these rights were sold and what transpired. It was always a source of dismay here. I think there’s a different way of doing business there than in the U.S.”A version of this article appears in print on December 6, 2015, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: Case Outlines Offers of Bribes to Gain Rights to Broadcasts.
