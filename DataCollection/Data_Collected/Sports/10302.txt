The 49ers acquired Martin a year ago in a deal with Miami. Martin had left the Dolphins in October 2013 after accusing a teammate, Richie Incognito, of bullying. An N.F.L. investigation determined Incognito and two other Dolphins offensive linemen had engaged in persistent harassment of Martin, who started seven games at right tackle last season for the 49ers in place of the injured Anthony Davis.
