Week 13 scores and highlightsIn their first game under the new defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, the Saints gave up 362 yards of offense, which qualified as drastic improvement compared with the 424.7 per game they had allowed under Rob Ryan. But part of that was probably because the Houston Texans had little need to produce on offense, since their defense did such a spectacular job shutting down New Orleans. The Saints were held without a touchdown for the first time since 2005 in the 24-6 loss.It will not get any easier this week against the undefeated Panthers.Carolina’s defense has probably not received enough credit for the team’s perfect start. Ranked second in the N.F.L. with 312.5 yards allowed a game, it has held opponents to the third fewest points and produced an N.F.L.-leading 18 interceptions along with 10 fumble recoveries.It was a victory in New Orleans last season that started Carolina’s current 15-game regular-season winning streak, and with Carolina steamrollering its way to a third consecutive N.F.C. South title, a trip to the Superdome no longer carries the intimidation factor it once did.PICK: PANTHERSAdvertisement
