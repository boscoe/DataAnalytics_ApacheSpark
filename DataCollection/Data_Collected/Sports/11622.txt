Matt Kenseth ended a 51-race drought by winning at rain-soaked Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee.The start was delayed nearly 90 minutes because of rain, and the race was stopped three times as Nascar desperately tried to complete it. It succeeded, with the race going 11 laps past the scheduled 500 after yet another quick shower.Kenseth, the pole-sitter, got a terrific jump on the restart and was not challenged. Jimmie Johnson slid past Jeff Gordon to take second place.■ Lewis Hamilton, the defending champion, won the Bahrain Grand Prix in Sakhir from the pole position to strengthen his overall lead in the Formula One standings.■ Scott Dixon passed Helio Castroneves during a midrace pit stop in California and won IndyCar’s Grand Prix of Long Beach.A version of this brief appears in print on April 20, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Kenseth Wins at Bristol.
