STORRS, Conn. —  When Sarah Benedetti moved to Canton, Conn., as a fifth grader in 2004, she almost immediately started rooting for the University of Connecticut’s basketball teams. That year, UConn became the first Division I university to win the national titles in men’s and women’s basketball.Benedetti began attending Huskies games with her family and teammates. She idolized the UConn stars Diana Taurasi and Maya Moore. She was so obsessed with the sport that she arrived at Canton High School at 6 a.m. each day to shoot for an hour before classes started. Her father, Sergio, rebounded the ball for her.Now a senior at St. Francis of Brooklyn, Benedetti competed Saturday night against her former favorite team. The No. 16-seeded Terriers were heavy underdogs to No. 1 Connecticut in their opening-round N.C.A.A. tournament game, the first time a St. Francis men’s or women’s basketball team had played in the event.UConn lived up to its billing, cruising to an 89-33 victory and making 70.2 percent of its field goals, the highest rate in the Huskies’ N.C.A.A. tournament history. Benedetti scored 13 points and made 5 of 15 field goals, while the rest of her team scored just 20 points, shooting 8 for 45.AdvertisementAnd yet, as the Terriers ran off the floor after the final whistle, they received a standing ovation from their fans who traveled here.AdvertisementAfter the game, UConn Coach Geno Auriemma hugged Benedetti and joked that some of her shots should be worth 4 points because they were from far beyond the 3-point line.“Honestly, regardless of the outcome, I had a great time,” Benedetti said. “It was just such a cool experience that I’ll remember forever.”With a losing record (15-19) and four years removed from a four-win season, the Terriers were the most unlikely entrant in this year’s field. Still, knowing that St. Francis had little chance to win did not bother Benedetti. She said about 100 family members and Canton residents were expected to attend, and she could finally be at Gampel Pavilion as a player instead of a spectator.“That is pretty much the Connecticut dream,” Benedetti said. “When you’re younger, you always look up to them. It’s a really cool idea. It motivates a lot of kids to play basketball.”Not much has changed since Benedetti arrived in Connecticut, as the top-ranked Huskies remain the nation’s best program. They are 33-1 and entered the tournament leading Division I in scoring offense (89.7 points per game) and defense (47.2 points per game). They are overwhelming favorites to win their third consecutive national title and the 10th in the program’s history, all since 1995.St. Francis needed a late-season run just to become one of eight teams to qualify for the 10-team Northeast Conference’s postseason tournament. The Terriers started 7-17 over all and were 4-8 in the league before winning five of their final six regular-season games to clinch the fifth seed in the NEC tournament.St. Francis won all three of its conference tournament games on the road, including a double-overtime victory over No. 1-seeded Central Connecticut State in the semifinals and a 77-62 victory over Robert Morris in the final. Benedetti, who received no other Division I scholarship offers, scored a career-high 29 points in the championship game and helped her university receive national acclaim.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It’s a great awakening of school spirit.”AdvertisementLeading St. Francis to the N.C.A.A. tournament was an unexpected accomplishment in Thurston’s 42-year coaching career. He grew up in the Bronx and played basketball and baseball at Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens, where his teammates included Jim Larranaga, the Miami men’s basketball coach.After graduating from Seton Hall in 1970, Thurston spent nearly three decades coaching men’s basketball. As an assistant at James Madison University, Thurston coached in the 1981, 1982 and 1983 N.C.A.A. tournaments. The Dukes upset Georgetown, Ohio State and West Virginia before losing in the second round in each appearance.
                Women’s N.C.A.A. bracket.            “We were one of the first Cinderella teams that has made the men’s tournament such a great draw,” Thurston said. “We take pride in that we were one of the first teams that was kind of the no-name team that was able to beat a powerhouse. It was exciting back then.”Thurston got out of college coaching in the late 1990s, when he opened and ran a sports academy in Georgia. He returned in 2003 as an assistant for the University of North Carolina at Wilmington’s women’s team. A few years ago, he and his wife moved to New Jersey to be close to two of their grandchildren. Thurston is now in his fifth season at St. Francis and third as head coach.Before Saturday, Thurston had never been a head coach in the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament. Still, he said he did not plan on giving a pregame motivational speech. He understood the Terriers had little chance to beat UConn, and he knew his players were not expecting to win, either.“I have very, very intelligent players that are intelligent off the court,” Thurston said. “You can’t con those types of kids.”For the 2013-14 academic year, the St. Francis team had a 3.608 cumulative grade-point average, the fourth highest among Division I programs, according to the Women’s College Basketball Association.“Everybody knows Connecticut,” Thurston said. “Every kid knows every player. You don’t have to tell kids about them. We just really focus on playing our system the best that we can, wherever that takes us.”Before the game, Thurston said he expected the Terriers to reflect fondly upon a time when they turned around a season and created lasting memories.Advertisement“Twenty years from now, just like our players from J.M.U. do, these kids will remember that they made the tournament,” Thurston said. “There’s a whole bunch of teams out there playing in the W.N.I.T. that wished they could take our place, but we played our way in. You can’t take that away from us.”A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: For a St. Francis Player, UConn, Long an Inspiration, Is a Rival.
