OMAHA — Coastal Carolina, the No. 16 seed in the West Region of the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament, hit just enough shots to hang with top-seeded Wisconsin for the first 13 minutes of their game in the round of 64 on Friday.But that was all. The taller, stronger Badgers pulled away from there to win with little trouble, 86-72, and advance to the round of 32.Frank Kaminsky, the Big Ten player of the year, contributed 27 points, shooting 10 of 14 from the field, and grabbed 12 rebounds in a victory that was more methodical than melodious. The Badgers (32-3) will face Oregon on Sunday.Coastal Carolina (24-10) shot 52 percent in the first half, matching its performance in last year’s tournament, when it led top-seeded Virginia by 5 points at halftime before losing, 70-59. But Wisconsin shot even better — 54.8 percent — and finished the half on a 21-10 run to open a 47-32 lead.The Chanticleers cooled off in the second half, and Wisconsin stretched its lead to 24 points before pulling its starters with two minutes to play. Sam Dekker hit four 3-pointers and scored 20 points for the Badgers. Warren Gillis had 22 points and Elijah Wilson added 20 off the bench for Coastal Carolina.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition.
