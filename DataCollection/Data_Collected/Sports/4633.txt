Week 14 scores and highlightsHaving lost twice after a 10-0 start, the Patriots travel to Houston to play the resurgent Texans, winners of five of their last seven games after starting 1-4. And it looks as if they will have to do so without tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receiver Julian Edelman, who are battling injuries. Without Gronkowski and Edelman, and lacking any other notable weapons, the Patriots struggled last week against the Eagles, whose defense had been torched for 45 points on consecutive weeks by the Buccaneers and the Lions.Equally problematic for the Patriots, their banged-up offensive line cannot seem to block anyone and now must keep J.J. Watt and Jadeveon Clowney off quarterback Tom Brady. Perhaps Coach Bill Belichick should consider sitting Brady for his own protection and concede this one.This game will also see the longtime Patriots defensive anchor Vince Wilfork lining up against his former team for the first time. To hear Wilfork talk about it, Sunday’s game is likely to be a bit bittersweet for him, to say the least.“I never thought that, in my whole career, I’d be playing in something other than a Patriots helmet, but that’s the way the cookie crumbles sometimes, and it did,” Wilfork said during the week. “I will always love Bill Belichick, that organization, the teammates, the fans. I will always have my love for those guys because of the 11 great years we had up there.”PICK: TexansAdvertisement
