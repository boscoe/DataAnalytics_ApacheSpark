CreditChang W. Lee/The New York Times        The Pope Physical Education Center resides on the second floor of St. Francis College’s main building in Brooklyn, just above the student center, below the library, past the community fish tank, and near enough to the swimming pool that when the gym doors are ajar the smell of chlorine washes over the entire arena.Close those doors, however, and suffer the stifling misery of a cinder-block oven, which forces players to pick their poison: stench or swelter.In this cubby-size gymnasium with no concession stands or video boards, where the cheerleaders pound the padded wall behind them on the baseline for emphasis, the Terriers are quietly staking their case as New York’s darling college basketball team.Just do not insult the Pope, with its sporadic dead spots and rust-colored 3-point arc. It may be the fourth-smallest Division I basketball arena in the country, but it is home.Advertisement“I could walk in here with my eyes closed and know exactly where I’m going,” the senior guard Brent Jones said.AdvertisementThe Terriers are 16-9 over all and alone atop the Northeast Conference standings at 10-2.Off to its best start in a decade, St. Francis is approaching uncharted territory. It is one of only five eligible programs to have never qualified to play in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The closest it came in recent years — reaching the conference championship game in 2001 and in 2003 — ended bitterly both times.Then last season, the Terriers held a 19-point lead over Mount St. Mary’s with 10 minutes left in the first round of the conference tournament but ended up losing, 72-71, on a last-second shot. Although it went unnoticed at the time, Mount St. Mary’s had six players on the court when Rashad Whack’s buzzer-beater went through.The unfortunate ending — which was investigated but not overturned — served only to reinforce St. Francis’ star-crossed image.St. Francis might well be the oldest men’s basketball program in New York City (founded in 1896), but the Terriers amassed only four winning seasons between 1967 and 1998.In 1969, they opened the bandbox gym (capacity 1,200) that would remain their home for the next 46 years. In an age when several Division I college teams play in N.B.A. arenas, with plush locker rooms, private cafeterias and other enticing amenities, the Pope is a throwback, renouncing almost every modern conveyance.There are no timeout trivia games because there is no video board. There are two archaic scoreboards displaying little more than the game time, the score and the uniform numbers of the players on the court. The halftime show during a recent game against Long Island University-Brooklyn consisted of a five-minute performance by the dance team, an announcement about a 50-50 raffle and 10 vacant minutes.Tickets cost $15. Exposed beams and air ducts dissect the ceiling. Large white poster boards display the sections of the stands, although it does not seem necessary. There are only eight.Advertisement“We’re a gritty, New York City school,” Coach Glenn Braica said. “We take pride in what we do, how hard we work and what we do on the court. We don’t look for all the trimmings.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

You’ve got to want to get better and work hard. That’s what we want here.”Not surprisingly, his roster consists mainly of New Yorkers overlooked by other programs, and their style of play reflects the chips on their collective shoulders. Entering Thursday night’s home game against Wagner, the Terriers lead the NEC in scoring defense (64.0), rebounding (32.1), and blocked shots (4.88). St. Francis, picked No. 1 in the conference preseason poll, promptly began the season with five consecutive losses, forcing Braica to reassess his program.“You start questioning yourself when you start 0-5,” the junior Amdy Fall said. “But we didn’t stop working hard.”Since then, the Terriers have gone 16-4. If St. Francis gets an opportunity to host a conference tournament game, the program’s athletic director, Irma Garcia, said that officials were already designing contingency plans to accommodate more fans.The plans include possibly setting up bleachers along one baseline, cramming seats into the corners of the loge areas, and using a nearby 300-seat auditorium as a spillover viewing area, complete with surround sound.But, Garcia said, accommodating 5,000 people was just not going to happen.And St. Francis is O.K. with that.“We are who we are,” Garcia said. “We’re never going to change that. If we can fit 1,000 people here, that’s great. If we can’t, we’ll find a place where they can watch the game and still feel connected.”Advertisement“I’ve been in the Carrier Dome when there’s 25,000 people,” said Braica, a former St. John’s assistant. “And I’ve been at UConn and these other places, and I’m telling you, sometimes these little gyms are the toughest atmospheres.”Glancing around the gym after practice this week — as some students scrimmaged at one end and the men’s soccer team stretched at the other — the senior forward Jalen Cannon laughed when he recalled thinking the Pope was the practice facility during his official visit.But, Cannon said, “I’ve learned to love it.”A version of this article appears in print on February 11, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: In a Bandbox Gym, a Team That’s Long Had Room to Improve.
