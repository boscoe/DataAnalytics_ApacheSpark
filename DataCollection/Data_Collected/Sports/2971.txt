Bach gave his backing to the head of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zhukov, who has been charged with overseeing reforms to Russia’s athletics federation, its antidoping agency and its national drug-testing lab, all of which were implicated in a sharply critical report released by the World Anti-Doping Agency on Monday.
