Rory McIlroy extended his lead to four shots with a 6-under 66 on Saturday in the third round of the Dubai Desert Classic in the United Arab Emirates.McIlroy, ranked first in the world, led by a stroke overnight and posted five birdies in his first eight holes. He made just one birdie on the back nine of Emirates Golf Club’s Majlis course. With an overall 20-under 196, McIlroy can challenge the tournament record of 22 under, set by Stephen Gallacher in 2013 and Thomas Bjorn in 2001.Denmark’s Morten Orum Madsen, who shot a 9-under 63 on Friday, was second after a 66 with six birdies. England’s Lee Westwood (69) was third at 14-under 202. Gallacher, a Scotsman who also won the tournament last year, had bogeys in the opening nine but hit three birdies on the back nine. He is tied for fourth at 203 with England’s Andy Sullivan and Danny Willett, and Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger; all four shot 70.McIlroy, from Northern Ireland, could do no wrong in his first eight holes, but golf showed him its quirks on the 10th. At the 549-yard par-5 hole, he smashed a drive 380 yards, but his birdie putt from less than two feet spun out of the hole. “When I missed that little short putt on 10, it seemed like that momentum I had just sort of went away,” McIlroy said. He finally got a birdie again on the 17th, where he made an 18-footer, but needed to scramble to save par on the final hole after hitting his 4-iron second from 205 yards into the water guarding the front of the green.The $2.5 million tournament forms the closing leg of the three-stop Desert Swing of the European Tour.A version of this brief appears in print on February 1, 2015, on Page SP12 of the New York edition with the headline: Breathing Room for McIlroy.
