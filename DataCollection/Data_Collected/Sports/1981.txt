On Saturday, the Triple Crown winner American Pharoah will race for the final time, in the Breedersâ€™ Cup Classic at Keeneland Racecourse in Lexington, Ky., before eventually heading down the road to Ashford Stud to begin his stallion career. During his 3-year-old season, he has flown about 20,661 miles, rare for a modern-day thoroughbred, and has won all but his most recent race, the Travers Stakes. As his popularity grew, his followers began tracking his flights, referring to the planes as Air Horse One.
