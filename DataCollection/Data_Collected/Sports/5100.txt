The Lions’ Jim Caldwell and the Saints’ Sean Payton have to be feeling pressure after failing to field competitive squads this season.Beyond that, the game has little significance. The New Orleans defense has been terrible, but Detroit’s offense could be limited, with the star receiver Calvin Johnson listed as questionable. Caldwell did not exactly inspire confidence that the game would be worth watching.“They’re still keeping score in this game, and we have guys that are professionals,” he told reporters last week. “With the right kind of people that know how to approach the game, you’ll see them come out and fight with the same kind of energy that they always do.”With 206 passing yards, Saints quarterback Drew Brees will surpass 4,000 for the 10th consecutive season. And playing at home, he will very likely come away with a win as well.Pick: Saints  BENJAMIN HOFFMANAdvertisement
