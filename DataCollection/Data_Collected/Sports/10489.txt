HOUSTON — A huge black curtain looms at each end of the raised court, creating an illusion that players are launching jump shots deep into another galaxy. Lights appear to give off an unusually strong glare, as if signaling a tavern’s last call or the intermission of a play.Utah Coach Larry Krystkowiak played for six teams during a nine-year N.B.A. career and has seen enough stadium setups and court configurations to judge shooting backdrops and depth perceptions. After the Utes misfired from nearly every angle in their loss to Duke in the round of 16 on Friday, adding to NRG Stadium’s reputation as a black hole for college basketball sharpshooters, Krystkowiak offered his view of the building, a frequently used N.C.A.A. tournament site.“We never really got a good feeling,” Krystkowiak said of NRG, home to the Houston Texans of the N.F.L. “It’s an interesting environment. It’s not a basketball arena. It’s the only regional that’s played in a venue like this. Everybody else is a normal-sized arena.”Teams competing here in the South Regional semifinals mostly declined to solely blame NRG Stadium for the poor shooting during Friday’s games. Coaches said shots had singed nets in practices. Players clung to the notion that sometimes cold spells just happened.AdvertisementBut the frigid display in Houston was astonishing. Gonzaga (3 of 19) and U.C.L.A. (3 of 13) combined for 18.8 percent shooting on 3-point tries during the Bulldogs’ 74-62 victory. The Bruins went 6 minutes 23 seconds without scoring in the first half. Utah and Duke combined to miss 15 of their first 17 field-goal attempts during the Blue Devils’ 63-57 win, and the Utes shot 35 percent over all from the field (29.6 percent in the first half).Advertisement“I’m a little bit surprised; I’m not sure it’s just the arena or the level of game,” Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “Maybe that combination has something to do with it. All four teams didn’t shoot real well. I know in our game, some of it had to do with the defense.”As the Final Four begins in Indianapolis this week — NRG Stadium, the Final Four site in 2011, will host it again next year — the practice of staging N.C.A.A. tournament games at large venues that seem to affect shooting and thus lower the quality of play remains a questionable one. On Friday, crowds here were muted while watching scoring droughts, shots caroming off backboards without touching the rims, and even air balls.The tournament’s round of 16 and beyond are commonly held in bigger stadiums, thrusting players who have spent most of their college careers competing in smaller arenas into unfamiliar and visually difficult venues.“You get accustomed to a normal background, normal arenas,” Duke guard Tyus Jones said. “Coming into the playoffs, you play in 30-something games, and only one of those games, you play in a dome.“It’s just different. You have to adjust your eyes, and that’s what we try to do in practice. We try to get up a lot of shots and adapt to it so come game time, it feels normal.”NRG Stadium, formerly known as Reliant Stadium, has hosted 12 N.C.A.A. tournament games. During the 2011 national championship game, Butler shot 18.8 percent from the field in a 53-41 loss to Connecticut, setting a record for the worst shooting performance in a title game. No team has shot at least 50 percent from the field in an N.C.A.A. tournament game at NRG Stadium.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Ken Pomeroy, the creator of KenPom.com, a widely read statistical website, has found it increasingly difficult to attribute such poor play to randomness. After Friday’s games, he quickly posted a statistical analysis titled “The NRG Effect” and concluded that long-range shooting obviously suffered at the stadium, writing, “Whether it’s the Final Four where the entire stadium is exposed, or the configuration for this year’s regionals where a giant black curtain is hanging well behind the basket, it appears that it’s only slightly easier to make 3-point shots at NRG Stadium than it is on an aircraft carrier.”AdvertisementEven after Gonzaga had one of its worst shooting performances, Coach Mark Few said he was not convinced that the stadium backdrops had affected his players.“Look, we were a great shooting team; we’ve had off nights,” he said. “We’ve had off practices. Essentially it corrects itself. Statistically, I know it goes back to the Butler-UConn game. Maybe those guys weren’t very good shooters.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Bulldogs shot a combined 56 percent in two tournament games to reach the round of 16, and entering Sunday’s game against Duke, they had made 52 percent of their field-goal attempts for the season. The only time they shot under 40 percent (39.7) was in a loss to Arizona in December, but against U.C.L.A., they shot 35 percent in the first half and 40.3 percent for the game — their second-worst percentage in 37 games.Gonzaga did shoot better despite its 66-52 loss on Sunday, making 44 percent from the field, but the Bulldogs hit only 2 of 10 3-point attempts. For their two games here, they were 5 of 29 from beyond the arc. Their 52-point total against Duke was a season low.“You really don’t look at depth perception stuff,” Gonzaga guard Kevin Pangos said. “I know shots weren’t falling, but I don’t know if that’s always just the backdrop and what’s there. There’s so many other factors involved.”Duke shot 37.5 percent from the field on Sunday, its worst effort of the tournament, nearly matching its season low of 36.9 percent, against North Carolina State in January.Jones, the Duke guard, likened the atmosphere to that of Syracuse’s Carrier Dome, which hosted the East Regional this year.“Anytime you play in a dome, there’s a lot of open space,” he said. “Then here, there’s no stands behind the baskets. That’s what the biggest difference is. It’s just a black curtain.”Krzyzewski said: “I think in the domes, where you put the court, and how much space there is, matters. Here they put it kind of in the middle, so I think the black curtains help.”As if the magnitude of trying to win the N.C.A.A. tournament did not create enough pressure, these larger venues put a player’s focus and skill to the test, too.Advertisement“You can’t think about it, because that’s when you’ll start to miss shots,” Jones said. “You’ve just got to be consumed in the game and consumed in the moment.”An article on Monday about the shooting difficulties experienced by college basketball teams in games held at NRG Stadium in Houston misstated, in some editions, the number of N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament games played there. It is 12, not 13.A version of this article appears in print on March 30, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Shooters Can’t See? Fans, Cover Your Eyes.
