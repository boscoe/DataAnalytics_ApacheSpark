Fast and Nash scored 11 seconds apart in the first period to give the Rangers the lead even though Carolina controlled play for much of the period.Fast scored his third goal of the season after a sequence in which the Rangers maintained extended possession of the puck in the offensive zone, leading to him to take a shot from the right circle.Nash’s goal was aided by a giveaway, and by Cam Ward’s over-aggressiveness. Ward, the Carolina goaltender, slid far to his left, leaving Nash with essentially an empty net to tuck the puck into.Lundqvist passed Mike Richter for most appearances for a goaltender in franchise history and became the Rangers’ record holder for combined regular-season and postseason saves. Suitably, Lundqvist was strong throughout, never more so than in the second period, when he made 14 saves to help the Rangers maintain their two-goal lead.Perhaps his toughest save came with 8 minutes 3 seconds left in regulation, when he grabbed Victor Rask’s drive from the circle after Dan Girardi turned the puck over in the defensive zone.Advertisement
