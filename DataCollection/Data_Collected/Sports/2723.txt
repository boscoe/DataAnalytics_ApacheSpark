KEEPING SCORE
NOV. 10, 2015
When you think about Jay Cutler, you might think about ... well, what do you think about?A decent performance in a loss? An untimely interception? An 8-8 record? His marriage to the reality TV star Kristin Cavallari?Perhaps the name conjures a boozy fan yelling, “Cutlaaaaaah,” not necessarily in a positive way.But on Monday night, the much maligned Cutler officially became the greatest touchdown passer in Bears history, connecting for Nos. 138 and 139 to surpass Sid Luckman’s mark of 137. Chicago won in San Diego, 22-19.In the storied history of the Bears, there have been surprisingly few dominant passers. Third after Luckman on the list is the 1960s quarterback Bill Wade with only 68.All of the other venerable N.F.L. franchises have touchdown leaders who exceed Cutler’s total.Packers (est. 1921), Brett Favre, 442AdvertisementGiants (1925), Eli Manning, 278Steelers (1933), Ben Roethlisberger, 258Eagles (1933), Donovan McNabb, 216Cardinals (1920), Jim Hart, 209Redskins (1932), Sammy Baugh, 187Rams (1937), Roman Gabriel, 154Lions (1930), Matthew Stafford, 144Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But despite the big numbers, his reputation is mixed at best. The biggest blot on his ledger is team success. In three years in Denver and seven in Chicago, he has made only one playoff trip, in 2010. And when the Bears lost the N.F.C. championship to the Packers that year, Cutler drew criticism for sitting out the end of the game with a knee injury.AdvertisementCutler’s 64-62 career record, and 47-42 record with the Bears, pales next to the Bears legend Jim McMahon’s 46-15. Many of his individual statistics are shaky, too. Of the 77 active quarterbacks with at least 100 pass attempts, Cutler ranks only 24th in adjusted yards per attempt, probably the best statistic for assessing quarterback performance. Of the 15 active quarterbacks with 100 starts, Cutler has the highest interception rate, more than double that of his divisional rival Aaron Rodgers.As a result, Cutler may not have knocked Luckman down in the eyes of historically minded Bears fans. Luckman, a Brooklyn-born Columbia graduate, was a giant of the game. Though football was very different in the 1940s, Luckman was clearly the best passer in the league at his peak, from 1943 to ‘47. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he had the ability to go deep, a less common tactic at the time.Crucially, Luckman led the Bears to four championships; Cutler still has only one playoff win. Luckman also won a Most Valuable Player Award in 1943, an honor Cutler is quite unlikely to land.With the Bears 3-5 this year, another playoff-less season is in the offing, and Cutler will continue to be seen as a second-tier quarterback. But there is something to be said for showing up and doing a job, competently if not stellarly. Cutler’s reward is the top spot in the Bears’ record book, and he should hold it for many years to come.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
