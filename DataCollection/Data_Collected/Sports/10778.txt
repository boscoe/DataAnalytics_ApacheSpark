The Louisville men’s basketball team advanced to the N.C.A.A. tournament’s round of 8 this season, but it did so without its best defensive player: Chris Jones, a senior guard, who was dismissed from the program in February and shortly afterward pleaded not guilty to rape and sodomy charges. One of his two accusers was a fellow Louisville student.Duke, which is scheduled to play Michigan State on Saturday in the semifinals, dismissed the junior guard Rasheed Sulaimon in January. Coach Mike Krzyzewski said at the time that Sulaimon had “repeatedly struggled to meet the necessary obligations.” Duke’s student newspaper subsequently reported that two students had accused Sulaimon of sexual assault.It is in several ways a new world for big-time college sports. In August, the N.C.A.A. voted to award the five most prominent conferences — three of which account for all of the teams in the Final Four — more autonomy. And in January, in response to criticism that the organization does not share its profits with its athletes, those conferences granted colleges the right to offer scholarships several thousand dollars higher than previous limits.More under the radar, though, has been a change in how sexual assault is discussed in locker rooms.At a news conference last month, Louisville Coach Rick Pitino, who like Krzyzewski is one of the most accomplished coaches in the college game, reflected on what he saw as a new era in college athletics.Advertisement“Ten years ago, I would speak about drugs once a week to the team,” he said. “And now I speak about women once a week to the team. Not even going to the extreme of sexual assault, but just on how to treat women, and just getting them to understand what the world is today.”AdvertisementThe issue of sexual violence on campus has taken on increased prominence, and the Obama administration has pressured universities to raise awareness — for example, by citing Title IX, the federal law mandating gender equity at institutions of higher education. The administration has organized a public awareness campaign about sexual assault, called “It’s on Us,” that has received significant airtime during the tournament.Several prominent college athletes, including the former Florida State star quarterback Jameis Winston, have been accused of rape or sexual assault, and some — including, in January, two former Vanderbilt football players — have been convicted. As a result, coaches and universities find themselves having conversations with players on the subject.“At the beginning of the year, he talks to us about things like that,” Adam Woodbury, a junior center at Iowa, said, referring to Coach Fran McCaffery. “He makes it clear to us how we should treat women.”College coaches view their roles as extending beyond X’s and O’s to include teaching and mentoring. The main purpose of the discussions, they say, is to develop young men into adults.Auburn Coach Bruce Pearl said the issue extended beyond keeping players on the court.“I want more from them than to just be eligible, than just to be able to keep playing,” Pearl said. “I want them to excel — in the classroom, on the court and off the court. We want to be leaders in how we treat women.”Duke has declined to comment on the specifics of Sulaimon’s case and has said all athletic department staff members complied with Title IX and university policies. Asked before the Final Four whether he discussed sexual assault with his team, Krzyzewski said: “We have programs at Duke where you bring in people from the outside and also from the inside, where you not just talk to basketball players, but you talk to all the student-athletes. Not just about that, but about other things. But certainly about that specific thing.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Donna Lopiano, president of the consulting group Sports Management Resources, said that many universities still had a long way to go.Advertisement“Everybody’s playing catch-up,” Lopiano said. “Most colleges and universities are just getting to the point now where they’re appointing qualified Title IX compliance officers.”She added, “I think most coaches are not trained to talk to their students about this.”In many cases, universities stepped up education on sexual assault — from the perspectives of perpetrators and victims and also of bystanders — after the Obama administration made it known that it was taking an interest in the subject.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In January, the department revealed that more than 90 postsecondary institutions were under investigation for their compliance with Title IX in handling such cases. Among them were many colleges with major sports programs, including Michigan State, one of the participants in this year’s Final Four.In September, “It’s on Us” was introduced, with partners that included several athletic conferences and the N.C.A.A. Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., said the White House had approached the association about the campaign.“In many ways, the most visible students on any one campus are their athletes,” Emmert said, noting that data showed that athletes were not disproportionately represented among either perpetrators or victims.Perhaps no coach’s trajectory illustrates better than Steve Alford’s how times have changed. In 2002, as Iowa’s coach, he defended Pierre Pierce, a player who was accused of sexual assault. In 2013, when he was hired by U.C.L.A., Alford insisted he had followed all relevant policies.Yet a week later, he apologized for “inappropriate, insensitive and hurtful” statements regarding the handling of Pierce’s situation, adding, “I have learned and grown from that experience and now understand that such proclamations can contribute to an atmosphere in which similar crimes go unreported and victims are not taken seriously.”Beyond coaches, universities treat the matter in different ways. Some make use of their compliance staff; others the office of the dean of students. Beginning last academic year, Michigan conducted 90-minute seminars with some students on sexual assault; the seminars included disseminating information on resources for victims and on bystander intervention. The university focused on certain student-body blocs, including the Greek system and athletes.The Big East Conference, which like the N.C.A.A. was a charter partner of “It’s on Us,” had its lawyers brief the presidents of its 10 universities on developments in law and policy over the summer. At several universities, athletes produced public service announcements; DePaul enlisted the Chicago Police Department’s Sexual Assault Task Force for athlete training, according to the conference.Advertisement“I think people are very dialed in to this now in ways they maybe weren’t five and 10 years ago,” said Val Ackerman, the Big East commissioner.Demetrius Jackson, a sophomore guard for Notre Dame, said of sexual assault: “Before the season starts, we go over that with our compliance officer. We sit down and have meetings about it, what we can do if a situation ever occurs, where we can go for help.”He added, “It’s almost like a class.”A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: College Teams Add Assault Prevention to the Basic Drills.
