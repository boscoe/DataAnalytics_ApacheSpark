It was hard before the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament started to predict that the juggernaut Kentucky team would lose in the semifinals. It was harder still to pick seventh-seeded Michigan State to make the Final Four.But that was the just the beginning for Roberto Cabrera, a real-estate broker from the Upper West Side, the winner of this year’s Times New York Times N.C.A.A. basketball pool.Cabrera correctly picked Duke to win and Wisconsin as the runner-up. He was also perfect on the rest of the Final Four, and most impressively, the entire round of 8, including fourth-seeded Louisville meeting seventh-seeded Michigan State in a regional final. That was enough to beat out 17,799 others who submitted completed brackets.It was the only pool he entered this year, though he has played often in the past. His only previous win came in 1990 when he correctly tabbed Nevada-Las Vegas over Duke in the final in an office pool. He won $40 then. This year’s win gets him an Apple watch.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Cabrera, 47, is originally from Maryland and describes himself as “an old-school A.C.C. fan.” That was the deciding factor in his pick in the final, along with his admiration for Coach Mike Krzyzewski, whom he sees as “one of the best coaches in all of sports.”AdvertisementHis loyalty to his home state led to one of his rare missteps, he acknowledged, when he incorrectly picked Maryland to beat West Virginia in the round of 32, costing him a few points.AdvertisementThe pool this year, devised by the Upshot, rewarded picking long shots by giving points based on how unusual correct picks were. Cabrera approves of this kind of pool, saying, “It makes it fair, like having a handicap in golf.”He benefited from the rules, picking up extra points for his correct long-shot selections, like 11th-seeded U.C.L.A. winning two games.Now that his prognostication skills have been demonstrated to the country, Cabrera is ready to make his next fearless forecast: Rickie Fowler to win the Masters.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
