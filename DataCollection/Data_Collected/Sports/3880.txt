North clash — to say they were looking forward to such a putrid matchup of also-rans would surely be an overstatement — could at least find some intrigue in the quarterbacks. Then Baltimore’s Joe Flacco tore ligaments in his knee, ending his season, and Cleveland demoted Johnny Manziel to third string for partying during the team’s bye week. That leaves Matt Schaub and Josh McCown to face off in a game that, at best, could have implications for how the teams look next season.The Ravens, incidentally, were the team against whom McCown, the Browns’ Week 1 starter, had his best game this season: 457 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and a rushing score in a 33-30 overtime victory in Week 5. But McCown, 36, has not taken the field since aggravating a rib injury on Nov. 1, and Schaub will be starting for the first time since 2013 (when he was with Houston), limiting the potential for fireworks. At least the game could be close: All of Baltimore’s games this season have been decided by 8 points or fewer.Pick: BrownsAdvertisement
