The players — Natalie Cafone, Chandler Ackers, Jessy Silfer and Dani Hemeon — said in the complaint that the firing of Coach Tracey Griesbaum was part of a pattern in which female coaches have faced discrimination and been fired. Athletic Director Gary Barta fired Griesbaum in August after an investigation into former players’ allegations of verbal abuse. Advertisement
