There are still two unbeaten teams, but the most intriguing game of N.F.L. Week 11 is a matchup between also-rans that gets a big boost from the return of a star quarterback.1. Cowboys (2-7) at Dolphins (4-5)1 p.m. Eastern Line: EvenLike Monty Python’s Black Knight, the Cowboys have stood in front of their opponents for the last seven games with their arms lopped off, insisting, “I’m invincible!” And like King Arthur, opponents have walked away after soundly beating them, shaking their heads and muttering, “You’re a loony.”The early-season optimism brought on by two convincing victories should have faded when quarterback Tony Romo broke his clavicle, but instead it persisted as a result of the N.F.C. East. Cowboys players and fans steadfastly believe there is no hole so deep that Romo cannot lead them out of.Without Romo, the Cowboys went 0-7. They were bad with Brandon Weeden in place of Romo and might have gotten worse when Matt Cassel replaced Weeden. They lost close games and they lost blowouts. They were sometimes unlucky, but they were mostly just bad. They even managed to get far less likable when Greg Hardy came back from suspension and reminded everyone of the league’s image problem.AdvertisementThe true believers are not wrong; the Cowboys are mathematically alive. But at 2-7, 26 teams in the N.F.L. have better records, so they do not need a star quarterback as much as good scouts to determine whom they should target in the first few picks of next year’s draft.AdvertisementThere is no doubt that Romo’s return will kick-start the team’s offense, and Miami’s defense has been awful more often than it has been good, but the Dolphins make every attempt to bully opposing quarterbacks. It will be interesting to see how Romo reacts if Ndamukong Suh is able to get to him a few times.A win over the Dolphins, even on the road, is attainable, but with a matchup against currently undefeated Carolina next week, Dallas may want to wait before they start printing playoff tickets.PICK: Cowboys2. Redskins (4-5) at Panthers (9-0)1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 8.5These teams are probably closer in ability than their records suggest, but all anyone wants to talk about is Cam Newton’s dancing.Newton is known for his enthusiastic celebrations, and when he performed a “dab” in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s victory, it seemed to drive the football world to distraction. Newton’s dance inspired one mother to write to The Charlotte Observer to complain about the example he was setting for her 9-year-old daughter.Still, rather than scold his quarterback, Coach Ron Rivera seemed mostly amused by the situation. He told reporters that instead of having to worry about football, “ Newton made it possible to “worry about dancing.”Panthers defensive end Jared Allen had perhaps the best response.“This isn’t ‘Footloose,’ ” Allen told reporters. “You are allowed to dance.”Newton should get several chances to dance against the Redskins’ defense, and quarterback Kirk Cousins and Washington’s offense will learn the meaning of regression to the mean when their offensive outburst last week becomes a distant memory against Luke Kuechly and the Carolina defense.AdvertisementPICK: Panthers3. Packers (6-3) at Vikings (7-2)4:25 p.m. Line: EvenThe Packers have won four consecutive N.F.C. North titles, as much because of their own talent as the lack of quality competition in the division. But as Green Bay has encountered a rough patch, losing three games in a row, the Vikings have been chugging along and last week pulled ahead of the Packers in the standings with their fifth consecutive win.If the Packers had a hard time scoring against the porous Detroit defense, they may not have a prayer against Linval Joseph and the Vikings. Minnesota has allowed an N.F.C.-low 17.1 points a game thanks to a crushing interior defense led by Joseph that takes away the run while also harassing opposing quarterbacks.Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is listed as questionable, but he is expected to play. Even if he does, Minnesota seems like the better team.Pick: Vikings4. Bengals (8-1) at Cardinals (7-2)8:30 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 5Cincinnati’s strong start was no illusion. Between a defense that is harder to score on than any in the N.F.L. and an offense that can stretch the field, the Bengals started 8-0 and looked nearly unbeatable. Then the Houston Texans beat them soundly and now they go on the road to face a red-hot Cardinals team.Mike Iupati, the left guard who is charged with protecting the Cardinals’ aging and frail quarterback and running back, was taken off the field in an ambulance last week with a neck injury. Arizona says he has been cleared to play, but if he is unable to go, or is limited, it could affect the Cardinals’ game plan.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            The Bengals have a comfortable lead in the N.F.C. North, and remain one of the better teams in the league, but they appear on their way to following an eight-game winning streak with a two-game losing streak.PICK: Cardinals5. Broncos (7-2) at Bears (4-5)1 p.m. Line: EvenIn his first three seasons with the Broncos, Brock Osweiler threw a total of 30 passes. Last week, in relief of the injured and awful Peyton Manning, he threw 24 in the second half. And while he did not exactly resemble the Manning of 2013, he was a lot better than the Manning of 2015.Signs point to the Broncos suffering a third consecutive loss, but it is worth remembering that they won many of their games earlier this season despite Manning, not because of him. Their defense, led by Brandon Marshall, Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware (should he return from a back injury), is among the best in the N.F.L., and if Osweiler can find a way to get the ball to Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders and Vernon Davis, they know how to get it into the end zone.AdvertisementPICK: Broncos49ers (3-6) at Seahawks (4-5)4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 13.5The Seahawks probably lost any chance at a division title when they fell to Arizona last week, and a home game against the lowly 49ers should give them ample opportunity to take out their frustrations on a rival. Conveniently, the 49ers offer no threat on offense, and no resistance on defense, so Seattle has an opportunity for a slump-busting game. Even the 12th Man fans, reeling from a home loss, should get to have fun forcing Blaine Gabbert into numerous false starts and delays of game.PICK: SeattleRaiders (4-5) at Lions (2-7)1 p.m. Line: Raiders by 1If the Lions try too hard to shut down wide receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, the Raiders can run them into submission with Latavius Murray. The Raiders may have lost consecutive games, but they have built an offense that is as fun to watch as it is effective.Oakland’s defense lags far behind the offense in terms of development, and losing Aldon Smith to a long suspension certainly does not help, but the Lions’ offense scare no one despite the presence of Calvin Johnson. Detroit looked better last week, but in a game that should be a shootout, the Raiders have many more weapons.PICK: RaidersColts (4-5) at Falcons (6-3)1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 5.5Colts quarterback Matt Hasselbeck was once so confident in his ability that after winning an overtime coin toss, he blurted out, “We want the ball and we’re going to score!”The same player was asked to assess his currently ability before making the start this week in place of the injured Andrew Luck. His tone was different.“I know my limitations, so that might be my strength,” Hasselbeck told reporters. “But I have a lot of limitations.”Despite those limitations, Hasselbeck, 40, has helped account for two of the Colts’ victories, and getting a third may come down to what version of the Falcons shows up. At one point, they seemed like an offensive juggernaut, with Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and Devonta Freeman among the league’s best players. But three losses in four games — and a 10-7 win over the awful Titans their lone win — have the team coming out of its bye week with no one being sure what to expect.PICK: TossupJets (5-4) at Texans (4-5)1 p.m. Line: Jets by 2.5J.J. Watt often seems to try so hard to seem interesting off the field that it is easy to lose sight of how great he is on it. Last week, Watt helped lead the Texans to a victory over the previously unbeaten Bengals, but in a postgame interview induced groans by saying they had turned the Red Rifle (Andy Dalton) into a Red Ryder BB gun.AdvertisementHe will be the best player on the field Sunday, but the Jets will be the better team.PICK: JetsGet the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But despite their limited roles in an offense focused on short throws to running backs and tight ends, Cooper and Austin still represent the Eagles’ best options for stretching the field. It would be odd to suggest that quarterback Mark Sanchez could make a team’s offense more dynamic, but since Sam Bradford has basically abandoned any wide receiver not named Jordan Matthews, his shoulder injury could open things up for Philadelphia.PICK: EaglesRams (4-5) at Ravens (2-7)1 p.m. Line: Ravens by 1The quarterback exchange that sent Sam Bradford to Philadelphia and Nick Foles to St. Louis was one of the biggest trades of the off-season, with many observers predicting that a change of scenery would be beneficial to each of them. It has not worked out, and this week neither is expected to start. At least Bradford is injured; Foles is sitting simply because he has been terrible.The Rams have three offensive linemen on injured reserve, so Case Keenum, who is starting in Foles’s place, will have his hands full. The lone good news in the Rams’ world is that Chris Long, a standout defensive end, is expected to return.PICK: RavensChiefs (4-5) at Chargers (2-7)4:05 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 3Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston is paid like a superstar, and has the statistics of one, but he never seems to garner the attention of other players of his caliber. He led the N.F.L. last season with 22 sacks and should be able to boost his 7.5 this season while facing Philip Rivers and the Chargers. In last season’s finale, Houston had four of Kansas City’s seven sacks, helping the Chiefs keep their division rival from a playoff berth.The Chiefs are coming off a defensive masterpiece against Denver, which included five interceptions and five sacks. The Chargers, meanwhile, have lost seven of their last eight games, and even their noted passing game should be rendered ineffective against the opportunistic Chiefs defense. It will not help the Chargers that Keenan Allen, their best wide receiver, is on injured reserve, and Malcom Floyd, their second best receiver, is not expected to play while he works his way back from a torn labrum.PICK: ChiefsA version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Healed Romo Tries to Fix His Team.
