Detroit Lions (1-6) at Kansas City Chiefs (2-5)9:30 a.m. Line: Chiefs by 4.5Matthew Stafford has thrown for 661 yards, six touchdowns and just one interception in the two games since he was benched because of his poor performance in a Week 5 loss to Arizona. But last week the team struggled to keep up with Minnesota, so Jim Bob Cooter was promoted to offensive coordinator in place of the fired Joe Lombardi. The first test of Cooter’s offense will come in London against a tough Kansas City defense, but with the Chiefs missing Jamaal Charles and possibly Jeremy Maclin, the Lions could win for the second time in three weeks after opening the season 0-5.PICK: LIONSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
