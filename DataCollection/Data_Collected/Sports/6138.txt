It was just unbelievable.”North Dakota State (15-1) squandered a 9-point lead in the fourth quarter, but it answered quickly after it fell behind. R J Urzendowski had catches of 32 and 33 yards to get the Bison into scoring range, and Wentz broke a tackle near the 5-yard line and eased into the end zone with 37 seconds left for the winning score, capping a 78-yard drive that took six plays.Roberson threw three touchdown passes, but he also had a pass intercepted by Esley Thorton in the final seconds while trying to get the Redbirds (13-2) into field-goal range.“Like we have all year long, we fought really hard to get back in the game after some mistakes and were able to take the lead,” said Coach Brock Spack of Illinois State, which was making its first appearance in the title game.RETURN TO ACTION Miami’s Ryan Williams threw for 115 yards and a touchdown at the Medal of Honor Bowl in Charleston, S.C.Williams, a senior, helped the National team to a 26-14 victory over the American team and gained some extra looks from the N.F.L. personnel on hand.Williams expected to compete for Miami’s starting job this season but tore a knee ligament in the spring.
