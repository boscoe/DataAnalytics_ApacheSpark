His longest ban had been for 21 games — initially 25 — for a high hit on Chicago’s Marian Hossa in the first round of the 2012 playoffs, when Torres played for the Coyotes.Torres has until Wednesday to decide whether to appeal the suspension. The Sharks had no comment on the punishment, and Torres’s agent did not immediately respond to an email.Torres was suspended for the final six games of the 2013 playoffs, while with San Jose, for a hit to the head of Los Angeles’s Jarret Stoll. He was also suspended for two games in January 2012 for charging Minnesota defenseman Nate Prosser, and while playing for Vancouver, he sat out four games in April 2011 for a hit to the head of Edmonton’s Jordan Eberle.Torres was assessed a match penalty for the hit to Silfverberg’s head, which occurred during a preseason game in Anaheim on Saturday. He waived the right to an in-person hearing.The previous longest suspension for player-on-player violence was for 30 games, given to the Islanders’ Chris Simon in December 2007 for stomping on the skate of Pittsburgh forward Jarkko Ruutu.The Sharks had been counting on getting a boost this season from Torres, who played in just 12 regular-season and playoff games the past two seasons because of knee injuries.Torres will be eligible to return Jan. 14 against Edmonton and will forfeit $440,860 in salary. The money goes to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund.Advertisement
