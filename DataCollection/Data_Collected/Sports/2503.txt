Broncos (7-0) at Colts (3-5)4:25 p.m. Line: Broncos by 4.5N.F.L. Week 9 Scores and HighlightsWhile the 2015 struggles of Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning have been well documented, he will return to Indianapolis on the heels of perhaps his best performance of the year, throwing for 340 yards in a 29-10 win against the Packers. It could be the last time Manning plays in front of the Indianapolis crowd that supported him for years as a Colt, so you know he will be looking to have a memorable performance. And it just so happens that if Manning can throw for 284 yards or more in this one, he will pass Brett Favre to become the N.F.L.’s career leader in passing yards.The Colts, meanwhile, still sit atop the A.F.C. South, despite losing three straight and not beating any team outside their division. The Colts’ last such win came in the 2014 playoffs: a 24-13 win against Manning and the Broncos. Denver has not lost since.PICK: BRONCOSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
