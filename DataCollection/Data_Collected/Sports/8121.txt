Cup upset at third-tier Preston, rallying with three second-half goals to win, 3-1. Preston looked set to create another major surprise in this year’s competition when Scott Laird put the hosts ahead in the 48th minute with a deflected shot. But Ander Herrera equalized in the 65th for United, and Marouane Fellaini followed up his own rebound to make it 2-1 seven minutes later. Wayne Rooney put the result beyond doubt with a penalty in the 88th. United’s win sets up a quarterfinal meeting with the defending champion, Arsenal, next month. Advertisement
