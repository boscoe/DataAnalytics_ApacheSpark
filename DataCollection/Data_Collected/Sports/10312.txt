LOS ANGELES —  With a little over 11 minutes left in the first West Regional semifinal Thursday, the North Carolina sophomore forward Isaiah Hicks inadvertently woke the slumping giant. Battling for a rebound under the Tar Heels’ basket, Hicks tangled with Frank Kaminsky, Wisconsin’s standout 7-foot forward.Kaminsky and his top-seeded Badgers were having a miserable night even before Kaminsky dropped to the floor like a chopped redwood after being struck twice in the face, around the right eye, by Hicks. Grabbing the ball, Hicks made the rebound basket to give North Carolina a 7-point lead, equaling its largest of the night.After an up-and-down season, North Carolina, the No. 4 seed, was poised to steal its first victory over a No. 1 seed since the 2005 title game against Illinois in St. Louis. Kaminsky was treated on the bench and returned to the court with a vengeance. Playing with an aggressiveness that had been absent in the first half, Kaminsky led a 9-0 run that ignited the Badgers’ come-from-behind 79-72 victory at Staples Center.The Badgers (34-3) have eight of the nine players who logged time in their Final Four appearance last year. That experience, Kaminsky said, was the difference.“We just know how to stay calm,” Kaminsky said. “We’re a veteran group and we understand situations and we’ve been through a lot as a group.”AdvertisementHe added, “We were just going out there and having fun and trying to do whatever we could to win.” AdvertisementKaminsky finished with 19 points, including 15 in the second half, in 39 minutes. On this night he played a supporting role to the star turn of Sam Dekker, who collected 23 points and 10 rebounds. The Tar Heels (26-12) were led by Brice Johnson and Justin Jackson, who finished with 15 points apiece.“Little things hurt us at the end of the game,” Johnson said, adding, “They made more plays down the stretch than we did.”Wisconsin trailed, 33-31, at the half as Kaminsky, the front-runner for Player of the Year honors, came out tighter than the leggings he wore in warm-ups. He missed his first four shots, starting with a layup on Wisconsin’s first possession, before making a short jumper in the lane off a missed basket by North Carolina.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            A shiver went through the Badgers’ cheering section late in the half when Kaminsky had an open look at a 3-pointer — and passed to a teammate. The cold shooting of Kaminsky, who finished the half with five misses in seven attempts, spread through the team like a virus. Nigel Hayes, a 51 percent shooter from the field this season, was 1 for 6 as the Badgers shot 36.7 percent from the field.It would have been lower if not for Dekker. Recruited heavily by Williams as a Wisconsin high school star, Dekker made six of eight shots to keep the Badgers within striking distance after 20 minutes.Wisconsin finished the first half with more turnovers (three) than steals (two), a telling statistic for a team that prides itself on minimizing its own mistakes and pouncing on its opponents’ miscues.Led by the forwards Johnson and Jackson, who were a combined 6 for 9, the Tar Heels shot 50 percent in the first half. J. P. Tokoto added four rebounds.AdvertisementThe Tar Heels’ big man, Kennedy Meeks, played with a black brace on his left knee, which he sprained last weekend in North Carolina’s victory against Arkansas. He drew two quick fouls while guarding Kaminsky, but contributed three rebounds, including two on the defensive end, in the first half. Meeks finished with 4 points in 14 minutes.One of the few first-half high points for the Badgers came with 14 minutes 45 seconds remaining when the senior point guard Traevon Jackson entered the game, returning to action from a broken right foot he sustained in a loss at Rutgers on Jan. 11.The Wisconsin fans gave him a standing ovation, and their cheers grew even louder eight seconds later when Jackson made his first shot attempt, a 3-pointer, to give the Badgers a 9-6 lead. “Man, that was sweet,” Jackson said.His teammates were grateful to have Jackson back on the floor. “He was being a leader in the huddle, keeping us calm,” Dekker said.Jackson logged nine minutes and was on the floor, with the ball in his hands, when the clock ran out on the Tar Heels. Speaking on the eve of the game, Jackson talked about the adversity he has stared down the past 12 months, starting with the Badgers’ one-point loss to Kentucky in the Final Four. He described it as “just a part of the journey, a part of life,” and said: “It’s not the end of the world. You can have some fun, still.”The team’s camaraderie was evident in the postgame interview when guard Josh Gasser was asked what it was like seeing Kaminsky fall to the court with the game seemingly slipping away. Grinning, Gasser craned his neck to look in Kaminsky’s direction and said, “It was great to see you on the floor, Frank.” An article in some editions on Friday about Wisconsin’s 79-72 victory over North Carolina in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament misidentified, in some copies, the winner of a game between Wisconsin and Rutgers on Jan. 11. Rutgers won.A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: A Giant, Upset, Lifts No. 1 Wisconsin.
