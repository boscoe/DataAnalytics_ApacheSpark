CreditRichard Perry/The New York Times        When he visits New York, Dallas Keuchel says, he has no trouble fitting in with the crowd — even with his distinctive bushy beard, which gives him the look of a Mennonite farmer or a Brooklyn hipster.“Manhattan is so big that I’m just another Joe,” he said Monday.That should change now, after Keuchel’s latest turn as an extraordinary Joe against the Yankees, throwing six shutout innings Tuesday night to lead the Houston Astros to a 3-0 victory in the American League wild-card playoff at Yankee Stadium.Colby Rasmus and Carlos Gomez hit solo homers in the second and fourth innings to give the Astros an early 2-0 lead, and Houston added another on Jose Altuve’s run-scoring single in the seventh. That proved to be plenty for Keuchel, whose third runless performance against the Yankees this season was finished by three hitless innings from relievers Tony Sipp, Will Harris and Luke Gregerson.When Brian McCann grounded out for the final out, the Astros poured out of the dugout to celebrate, while most of the Yankees filed out of the dugout and up the tunnel to the clubhouse, their first postseason appearance since 2012 a short one.AdvertisementA few stayed and lingered, watching from the top rail of the dugout.“At that moment, you almost want to blink a couple times and wake up and have that not be the reality,” outfielder Brett Gardner said. “You want to have a couple more cracks at it.”AdvertisementIt’s uncertain how much that might have helped the Yankees, whose offense slowed over the second half of the season, sputtered down the stretch and screeched to a halt against Keuchel.The Yankees, through their ups and downs, showed in the regular season that they could muster the right approach and execution to beat some of the best pitchers in baseball: Max Scherzer, David Price, Cole Hamels, Jacob deGrom, Chris Archer and Felix Hernandez — often in convincing fashion.But they have done nothing with Keuchel.In three games against the Yankees, including two in the Bronx, he has thrown 22 scoreless innings, allowing 12 hits and two walks and striking out 28.“He’s Greg Maddux from the left side, with a little better slider,” Alex Rodriguez said.Though the Yankees had not scored a run against Keuchel in the regular season, they preferred to face a pitcher they had seen, confident that they would figure out a successful approach. On Tuesday, it was to look for pitches in a particular part of the strike zone — up — and lay off anything else. The problem was that Keuchel rarely obliged.“I came back and watched an at-bat and I’m doing what I’m trying to do,” said Chase Headley, who struck out and grounded out against Keuchel. “I’m swinging at pitches I want to swing at. I was executing what I was trying to do, and I was going back to the dugout.”Through five innings, Keuchel allowed only two base runners. He walked Chris Young in the first and allowed a single in the second to Greg Bird.The Yankees’ one real threat came in the sixth, when Didi Gregorius poked a single just beyond the reach of the diving Altuve at second base and Carlos Beltran laced a two-out single. That brought up Rodriguez, which brought the crowd to its feet and Astros Manager A.J. Hinch out of the dugout to visit Keuchel.Advertisement“The stadium was rocking, that’s for sure,” Keuchel said. “A-Rod’s coming up — doesn’t get any more exciting than that.”Keuchel said that after Rodriguez hit a liner to right that George Springer ran down in his previous at-bat, he thought if he threw a cutter up and in, Rodriguez might get under the pitch.“Luckily, that’s what he did,” Keuchel said of the lazy fly to center field that retired Rodriguez and the side. “But I was playing blackjack there, and it paid off.”The atmosphere at the Stadium, which has been sleepy much of the season, was electric at the start. By the end of the night, the crowd had turned on the home team, forcefully booing Gardner, who struck out three times, after he grounded out in the eighth and every Yankee thereafter who made out.“I know that they’re disappointed and frustrated,” Gardner said. “And nobody is more disappointed and nobody’s more frustrated about the way I played than myself.”The Yankees have been vulnerable to left-handed pitchers all season, with a lineup that tilts heavily with left-handed hitters and whose switch-hitters — Beltran, Headley and the injured Mark Teixeira — hit home runs far more frequently from the left side. The Yankees hit just 53 of their 212 home runs against left-handed pitchers, a significant handicap for a team that is built to take advantage of Yankee Stadium’s short right-field fence.The loss was the Yankees’ eighth in their last 11 games against left-handed starters over the last several weeks.That helped explain why Manager Joe Girardi’s hardest decision was not whether to play Young, who has a .329 batting average and .972 on-base-plus-slugging percentage against left-handers. It was whom to sit: Jacoby Ellsbury or Gardner.AdvertisementIt turned out to be Ellsbury, who despite the $153 million investment the Yankees made in him last year had struggled mightily in the second half, as had Gardner.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

C. Sabathia, their veteran pitcher and leader, left the team to check into an alcohol treatment center.If the Astros had Keuchel, the Yankees had Masahiro Tanaka, who burnished the big-game reputation he brought from Japan by shutting down Toronto twice late in the season.But Tanaka, who was sidelined 11 days late last month with a strained hamstring, did not look sharp in his previous start, which Girardi attributed to rust. He was better Tuesday, but he was troubled by the same goblin that has troubled him all season: home runs. Tanaka, who allowed 15 last season, ended the season surrendering 27, including two Tuesday.“It’s just location,” Girardi said. “Home runs are usually missed locations.”Rasmus hit the first pitch of the second inning deep into the right-field seats, and Gomez hit the first pitch of the fourth inning into the seats in left-center field. Both flipped their bats at the plate, a sign that there was no doubt about where the ball would land.The Yankees hoped the two home runs would not be enough to beat them. For much of the night, the Yankees looked like a guy hanging off a stone wall by the well-worn tips of his fingernails.Tanaka retired Altuve, who led the American League in hits the last two seasons, on a groundout to end the second with the bases loaded. He survived a leadoff double by Springer in the third, and the Yankees turned double plays in the fourth and sixth innings to short-circuit Astros threats.As it turned out, it was not enough.“It’s really disappointing,” Girardi said. “This is a club that fought all year long, and there’s a lot of character in that room, and it hurts. We just didn’t get it done.”A version of this article appears in print on October 7, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Yanks Skid Into Winter.
