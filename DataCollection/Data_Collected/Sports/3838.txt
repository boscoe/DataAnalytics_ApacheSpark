Just Learn to Project.To the Sports Editor:Re “Anyone Have a Lozenge?”, Nov. 22: The answer to the coaches’ vocal problems is learning correct voice usage. Rather than shouting, yelling or screaming — all of which involve tension — they need to learn to project their voices through proper focus, support and resonance. They can let their voices ring out as when one calls to someone at a distance. In so doing, they can acquire vocal intensity when it is desired, which is not tension. Paradoxically, when the voice is controlled, it can be more powerful than when it is out of control, straining at the top of its volume and range.Learning to project with strength and ease feels good and can have greater impact. And as the voice continues to warm up, it just keeps getting better and better — like a seasoned actor playing King Lear and doing battle with the elements for three hours.While using lozenges, herbal tea and honey are helpful, they are no substitute for proper voice usage. It is better to retrain and establish excellent habits that with time become second nature so that vocal technique becomes one with meaning and emotion and not something separate. Perhaps the coaches need to be coached.R. BRIAN LOXLEY, New YorkTo the Sports Editor:Throat lozenges and honey-flavored drinks and gargles are of no value for vocal problems associated with shouting. Coaches would never allow their players to compete without a carefully designed program of weekly exercises, pregame warm-ups and postgame cool-down routines. Yet coaches are vocal athletes and, therefore, need a similar routine designed for their voices.Hoarseness? Of course they have voice problems. They must demand of themselves the same consistency of attention to their bodies that they demand of their players. Or, like an injured player, they risk subpar performance.ALISON BEHRMAN, BronxRethinking a PolicyTo the Sports Editor:Re “A Player Concussed, and a Policy Questioned,” Nov. 24: Your article on the apparent concussion sustained by St. Louis Rams quarterback Case Keenum fails to mention that Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick took a similar hard blow to the head, leaving him in a dazed state that any television viewer could plainly see. This, too, was ignored by the player’s team and the game’s N.F.L. spotter.What is worse, the television commentators praised Fitzpatrick’s toughness for staying in the game, thus encouraging young players to mimic such highly dangerous behavior.Clearly, the N.F.L.’s new concussion policy is not working. It is time for fans to boycott the league until it takes this on-field carnage much more seriously.LAWRENCE REICHARD, Belfast, MaineProtection for HorsesTo the Sports Editor:Re “Trainer Fined in New York for Breaking Drug Rules,” Nov. 24: As someone who suffers from an underactive thyroid, I know firsthand the potency of the prescription medications used to treat this disease. Trainers like Steve Asmussen dispense thyroid medication to horses as if it were just a benign supplement to boost metabolism and enhance performance. Recklessly administering these powerful drugs to horses with no existing thyroid condition has been linked to multiple suspicious cardiac arrests during races. I applaud the New York State Gaming Commission for proposing new regulations to prohibit the administration of drugs that aren’t medically necessary and to control the use of thyroid medications as well.MELANIE JOHNSON, Arlington, Va.N.C.A.A. Taken to TaskTo the Sports Editor:Re “N.C.A.A. Clears Players, Then Absolves Itself,” Nov 26: Joe Nocera properly takes the N.C.A.A. to task for its indefensible (and painfully prolonged) actions with regard to Cheick Diallo and Kassoum Yakwe. Even worse than the disingenuous, secretive and “we can do whatever we want” nature of the entire episode is the hypocrisy of the N.C.A.A. senior staff, unfortunately including, as Mr. Nocera notes, Oliver Luck. It is obvious that athletes are not low on the N.C.A.A.’s priority list, but, rather, not a consideration in their actions at all. Most of us have come to suspect this over the years, but we sometimes think there must be legitimate extenuating circumstances. Once again, scrutiny shows otherwise.MATTHEW AMES, Bayview, IdahoAdvertisement
