He will work with Cashman and Gary Denbo, the Yankees’ vice president for player personnel.Joe Girardi, who managed Matsui in 2008 and 2009, said Matsui always did things in the right manner and would help convey that message to younger players.

He went on to play three years with the Angels, the Athletics and the Rays.“He really knew how to hit,” Girardi said. “Really knew how to play the game.”INSIDE PITCHThe minor league catcher Gary Sanchez hit a ninth-inning home run against the Orioles. ...
