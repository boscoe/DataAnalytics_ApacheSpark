Alan Venook’s season-preview article in the student newspaper was the harbinger. As The Daily Targum’s sports editor and a beat writer for the Rutgers men’s basketball team, Venook had been around the team long enough to know that the Scarlet Knights would be very good in 1975-76. But looking at their schedule, Venook thought there was also a good chance the team could win every game.So, deep in the article about a team he thought could be a special one, Venook slipped in this sentence: “This could be an undefeated season.”“I knew enough to know that it wasn’t ridiculous,” said Venook, now a leading cancer researcher at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. “The schedule wasn’t all that daunting. So, I wasn’t surprised. And as the season went on, they outclassed almost everybody they played.”Venook was right.Thirty-nine years ago, the N.C.A.A. Final Four in Philadelphia was the exclamation point to Indiana’s 32-0 perfect season. The Hoosiers marched through the year, becoming the last men’s Division I team to complete an undefeated season. But while Indiana arrived at the Spectrum the favorite, there was a second team without a loss to its résumé.AdvertisementRutgers was 31-0.“We never really got caught up in the undefeated season stuff, because we just expected to win,” said Mark Conlin, a backup point guard for Rutgers. “Night after night, we would slay people.”AdvertisementWhile Indiana was the traditional power, with blue-chip recruits and a famous head coach, Rutgers was, well, the opposite. The Scarlet Knights had Afros and shaggy hair, wore beards, stayed out late and even drank beer on the bus rides back from away games.There were the nicknames, too. Phil Sellers, known as Phil the Thrill; Eddie Jordan, known as Fast Eddie; James Bailey, known as Jammin’ James; and Mike Dabney, known as Dip: a cast of colorful characters who put Rutgers on the map with their high-octane play.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            In an era with no shot clock, no 3-point line and no dunking, the 1975-76 Scarlet Knights scored more than 100 points in 11 of their 33 games while still playing relentless defense.The architect of the breakneck brand of basketball in New Brunswick was the third-year head coach Tom Young, who had come from American University.“The year before, we had a good year and lost in the first round of the N.C.A.A.s to Louisville,” Young, 82, recalled. “We played a pretty good game, so we knew going into the season we were going to be pretty good. But no one envisioned the scenario of going undefeated.”That was because Rutgers basketball was not synonymous with success. That 1975 N.C.A.A. tournament appearance was the program’s first. A decade earlier, Bill Foster had begun the turnaround before handing it off to his assistant, Dick Lloyd, in 1971. That was where the groundwork for the undefeated season began.Lloyd’s first season coincided with two key events: the addition of scholarships and the ability of freshmen to play immediately.Advertisement“We were finally able to go after players with a great deal of intensity,” said Lloyd, now an analyst for Rutgers radio broadcasts.His assistant, a 32-year old former high school coach named Dick Vitale, tirelessly recruited two of the top players that year — Dabney, of East Orange, N.J., and Sellers, of Brooklyn.“We believed that we could attract the best players in the metro area,” Vitale said. “We were able to put together an incredible recruiting class.”It almost did not happen, though. Sellers, an all-American during his senior year at Rutgers, had originally committed to Notre Dame. Lloyd filled his fifth scholarship before hearing that Sellers had had a change of heart. To bring Sellers aboard, the university enlisted the help of a wealthy alumnus, Herb Goodkind, to finance a scholarship for the year. He did, and Sellers was a Scarlet Knight.Lloyd also was indirectly responsible for bringing in Jordan, the player many considered the most important cog for that undefeated Final Four team. After Lloyd left, Jordan — who had previously committed to American — followed Young to Rutgers, giving the new head coach the perfect point guard to run his fast-break style.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

(The average of 93.3 points per game from that season is still a program record.) The team’s home court — a 2,800-seat bandbox known as the Barn — got so crowded and so loud that games had to be stopped periodically to clean the court of paint chips that fell from the ceiling.“People knew how good this team was,” said Tom Luicci, a former reporter for The Star-Ledger of Newark who also covered the team for The Daily Targum. “But as the unbeatens kept falling, it got bigger.”The dream run came to an abrupt end in the Final Four. Michigan figured out how to solve the riddle of the Scarlet Knights’ offense, winning, 86-70. Two days later, in the third-place game against U.C.L.A., a spent Rutgers team lost again, 106-92. Indiana won its two games and took its place in college basketball history. Rutgers has been back to the N.C.A.A. tournament only four times since.Jordan, now the coach at Rutgers, gathered the players and coaches from the 1975-76 team for a reunion last August at a New Brunswick restaurant. They signed some basketballs and posed for pictures before retreating to a private room for almost four hours.“Everyone has been successful in whatever they do — coaching, business, teaching, whatever,” Conlin said. “But as we were talking about things, there was a little gallows humor. Someone said, ‘What are the chances that 40 years later, all 16 people are alive?’ What’s more perfect than that?”A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Remembering That Other Unbeaten Team in the 1976 Final Four.
