CreditJoe Buglewicz for The New York Times        NASHVILLE — Seven o’clock on a Tuesday, and the gold-clad, goose-calling, Tim McGraw-crooning fans of the Nashville Predators are offering an updated primer in Southern hospitality.One by one, the starters for the Predators’ victim on this night, the Colorado Avalanche, are announced, and one by one, each is advised by the frothing crowd that — in somewhat more colorful language — he is not good at his job, not good at all. The Avalanche’s coach, Patrick Roy, is then introduced, and he is told the same, with a bit more fervor.Bridgestone Arena, where the Predators skate, is a spaceship of a building perched on a stretch of Broadway downtown that evokes a hillbilly Bourbon Street — all boot joints and neon guitars and honky-tonks. By the opening face-off, all that energy is sucked inside, creating a rowdy atmosphere for a rowdy team, the N.H.L.’s unlikely juggernaut.The Predators have lost only five times at home all season, but they have not lost much on the road, either. After missing the playoffs the past two seasons, Nashville has upended the Western Conference establishment, barging into a realm usually occupied by the likes of Chicago and Los Angeles to seize the best record in the league. On pace for a franchise-high 116 points, the Predators, who play the Rangers on Monday at Madison Square Garden, have 89, 2 points ahead of Montreal and Anaheim.Advertisement“We all knew that we had more in here, and we liked the pieces we had, but I don’t think anybody would have said we’d be first in the league at this point,” left wing Matt Cullen said. “It’s a little more than we would have expected.”After an off-season retooling, General Manager David Poile said that all he wanted was to make the playoffs. He has since recalibrated his goals. More than three-quarters into this season of seasons, this serendipitous marriage of a new coach and system with new personnel, Nashville has evinced few discernible weaknesses.AdvertisementOutstanding goaltending? Pekka Rinne trails only Montreal’s Carey Price in save percentage (.928) and goals against (2.07).A dynamic and mobile defensive corps? This precocious unit, led by the ferocious tandem of Shea Weber and Roman Josi and bolstered by 20-year-old Seth Jones, has generated the most blue-line scoring (160 points) in the league.A deep group of forwards? An influx of talent, coupled with the maturation of Filip Forsberg and Colin Wilson, has produced the highest-scoring Predators team (2.94 goals per game) in eight years.“It definitely feels like we have the most complete team since I’ve been here,” Weber said, “and we’re set up in the right position to definitely have the best team.”How a franchise that has never won its division in 15 previous seasons, let alone a Presidents’ Trophy as the team with the most points, materialized as a strong contender to hoist Lord Stanley’s silver chalice is an exercise in contradictions — in daring but also in patience, in planning but also in hope, and some luck.Sitting in his ice-level office at Bridgestone an hour before the Predators paddled Colorado, in a 5-2 victory that showcased their craftiness with the puck and relentlessness without it, Poile ruminated on the team’s good fortune.Advertisement“It all had to happen for us to be where we are today,” he said.And it all started when he recognized that he needed to fire Barry Trotz, a dear friend and the only coach Nashville had had but who had never guided the Predators beyond the conference semifinals. The players needed a jolt — “Maybe we got too comfortable,” Rinne said — and one came from a man whose pedigree and philosophy Poile coveted, and who happened to be available.Peter Laviolette, a demanding boss with a Stanley Cup ring and a penchant for leading distressed teams to prominence, meshed an offensive-oriented style with the stalwart defense that has come to define the organization. He has molded Nashville into the N.H.L.’s best team at even strength, and also among its most resilient: Only the Islanders have won a greater percentage of games than Nashville after allowing the first goal.Facilitating those comebacks has been an offensive resurgence fronted by the gifted playmaker Mike Ribeiro, who wanted to play for the Predators so much that he paid his way for a visit. Bought out by the Coyotes in June after the first season of a four-year, $22 million contract because of off-ice matters that management refused to tolerate, Ribeiro garnered minimal interest. Poile’s unwillingness to add a potential nuisance outweighed his need for a center.At least until Ribeiro avowed that he had prioritized his family, that he sought to find serenity in the relative tranquillity of Nashville, that not once would he cause trouble. He and his wife bought a house here before Poile even offered a contract, and when that offer came, at a bargain rate of $1.05 million for one year, Ribeiro set about reclaiming his career. Centering a line with the sniper James Neal, acquired in a June trade with Pittsburgh, and the 20-year-old Forsberg, a leading candidate to win the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the year, Ribeiro was tied for seventh in the league with 40 assists through Sunday.“I’m doing the right things and eating well and taking care of myself, not drinking or partying,” Ribeiro said. “I actually am serious about it. I don’t want to screw it up like I did last year.”For entirely different reasons, last year was a dreary time for Rinne, who underwent a second hip operation that limited him to 24 games. He reported to training camp in excellent shape — testing indicated he was the team’s third-best-conditioned player, said Stu Grimson, the team’s color analyst — and has used that as a platform to post the best season of his career, vying to become the first goalie to win the Hart Trophy, awarded to the league’s most valuable player, since Jose Theodore in 2002.“Whatever else they’ve done, that’s been their most important addition — a healthy Pekka Rinne,” said the former N.H.L. center Ray Ferraro, an analyst for TSN.The Predators are built from Rinne out, with a defense that Poile has called the best in franchise history — all six defensemen who dressed against Minnesota last Thursday were drafted and developed by Nashville — and enviable depth up front. When Mike Fisher ruptured an Achilles’ tendon in July, Poile loaded up on veteran centers — “We threw a lot of spaghetti on the wall,” he said — like Ribeiro, Olli Jokinen and Derek Roy. Roy was waived in December, but last month, Poile flipped Jokinen to Toronto as part of a package that netted defenseman Cody Franson and right wing Mike Santorelli.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He and Poile identified some shortcomings, and then in training camp, Laviolette deployed the puck-possession system that Cullen, who won the Cup with Laviolette in Carolina in 2006, characterized as “attack, attack, attack.” Or, as Fisher described it, “shoot, shoot, shoot.”No attempt is a bad one for Nashville, which has won a league-best 74.3 percent of games in which it has outshot the opposition. That axiom also applies to defensemen, who are expected to shift to offense more quickly than before.To acclimate his players to the faster tempo, Laviolette emphasized skating and stamina in rugged sessions akin to what Colorado center Daniel Briere experienced with Philadelphia in 2009, when Laviolette took over two months into the season. Before the first practice, Briere looked on a board and saw 14 drills listed.“We thought we were going to be on the ice for four hours,” Briere said. “But everything was so fast, so intense, and we were done in 40, 45 minutes. That’s what he taught us — to play at a fast pace, always on the go. He completely turned our team around at the time.”Inheriting a team mired in 10th place in the conference, Laviolette guided Philadelphia within two victories of the Stanley Cup. These Predators soared from the outset, going 10-3-2 in their first 15 games, building confidence that served them well, when, in the third period of a 5-1 victory over Vancouver on Jan. 13, a fluky collision sent Rinne careening into the back boards. Rinne’s injury, a sprained knee that sidelined him for three weeks, left at least one fan uneasy.“There doesn’t seem to be anybody that we’re not able to hang with,” the country music star Vince Gill said last Thursday, chatting between periods during Nashville’s 4-2 loss to Minnesota, “but when Pekka got hurt, everybody went, ‘Oh, no, here we go again.’ ”At the time of Rinne’s injury, Nashville had 29 victories. Rinne had accounted for them all. Laviolette said he was less concerned than curious to see how the team would respond, and in Rinne’s absence, the Predators went 4-2-2, losing only 2 points in the standings.Rinne returned Feb. 3 and compiled a .929 save percentage during his next nine games, including last Tuesday’s rout of Colorado. After Nashville’s final goal glided into an empty net, clinching the victory that tied an N.H.L. record for most wins (26) in a team’s first 30 home games, a clip of McGraw appeared on the video board. The fans chanted along with him.They liked it. They loved it. They wanted some more of it.A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Nashville, One More Surprise Hit.
