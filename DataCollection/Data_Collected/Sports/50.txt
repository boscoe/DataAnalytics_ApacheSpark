The N.C.A.A. may restrict colleges from compensating athletes beyond the cost of attendance, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled Wednesday in an apparent victory for the college sports establishment as it fights efforts to expand athletes’ rights.As college football and, to a lesser extent, men’s basketball have generated millions of dollars in revenue through television broadcast deals and merchandise sales, some critics, including former and current athletes, have lobbied for greater financial compensation. The appeals court bluntly said that limiting compensation to the cost of attendance in exchange for use of the players’ names, images and likenesses was sufficient under antitrust law.The cost of attendance, typically several thousand dollars more than a traditional scholarship, accounts for the financial demands of additional activities like traveling home and back and paying cellphone bills. In January, the five most prominent football conferences voted to allow colleges to provide the higher figure to athletes.The ruling upheld a federal judge’s finding last year that the N.C.A.A. was, in the panel’s words, “not above the antitrust laws” and that its rules had been too restrictive in maintaining amateurism. But the appeals panel threw out the judge’s proposal that the N.C.A.A. allow colleges to pay athletes up to $5,000 per year in deferred compensation. One of the three judges disagreed with that specific decision, saying in a separate opinion that the $5,000 cap was not a clear error. Advertisement“Today, we reaffirm that N.C.A.A. regulations are subject to antitrust scrutiny and must be tested in the crucible of the Rule of Reason,” the panel wrote in what is known as the O’Bannon case.Advertisement“In this case,” it added, “the N.C.A.A.’s rules have been more restrictive than necessary to maintain its tradition of amateurism in support of the college sports market. The Rule of Reason requires that the N.C.A.A. permit its schools to provide up to the cost of attendance to their student-athletes. It does not require more.”Gabe Feldman, a professor at Tulane’s law school, said: “I would say this is a huge victory for the N.C.A.A. There was some question about the future of the amateurism model, and at least for now, a majority of this panel of the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and their definition of amateurism.“The N.C.A.A. is allowed to use amateurism as a justification in antitrust cases, and the N.C.A.A. is allowed to define amateurism as restricting any payments to the cost of attending.”
                A three-judge panel upheld a federal judge’s finding last year that the N.C.A.A. “is not above antitrust laws,” but the panel also threw out the judge’s proposal that N.C.A.A. members should pay athletes $5,000 per year in deferred compensation.            On a conference call with reporters, the N.C.A.A.’s president, Mark Emmert, said, “I was particularly pleased that the court recognized the fundamental difference between providing support for student-athletes that’s education related and, to use their words, ‘cash sums’ that were untethered to educational expenses.”The case, formally O’Bannon v. N.C.A.A., is known by the name of its lead plaintiff, Ed O’Bannon, a former U.C.L.A. basketball star.In 2009, Mr. O’Bannon sued the N.C.A.A. for using his name and image in television broadcasts and video games. His legal team argued that players were required to sign waivers to allow the use of their likenesses but that because those contracts were worth billions of dollars, players were entitled to a piece of the revenue.The N.C.A.A. countered that college athletes were amateurs and that anything amounting to pay for play would transform college sports into something unrecognizable, professionalizing the players and hurting the business model for college sports.AdvertisementWhile the appellate court’s decision maintained college sports’ new status quo, O’Bannon supporters saw several silver linings, most notably that it struck a blow to the N.C.A.A.’s long-held amateurism defense. Since 1984, when a group of universities sued the N.C.A.A. over restrictions on their television broadcast rights in a case known as N.C.A.A. v. Board of Regents, the association has cited a passage written by Justice John Paul Stevens that declared that banning payments to athletes was essential to the “revered tradition of amateurism.”In essence, the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday upheld Judge Claudia Wilken’s finding that preserving amateurism was not by itself enough to keep N.C.A.A. rules on compensation exempt from antitrust law.“They specifically went in and said the N.C.A.A. violated antitrust law,” said Sonny Vaccaro, a longtime N.C.A.A. critic who helped start the O’Bannon lawsuit. “That opens things up, and it’s tremendous.”Mr. O’Bannon’s lawyer, Michael Hausfeld, added that the ruling also explicitly tied athletics to academics more strongly.Sign up to receive an email from The New York Times as soon as important news breaks around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Those payments potentially raise new questions about competitive balance in college sports, Title IX rules relating to women’s sports, and athletic departments’ bottom lines.The tide has generally turned toward the expansion of athletes’ rights, although the N.C.A.A. and colleges still insist that their athletes are amateurs and students first.AdvertisementIn August, the N.C.A.A. and the college sports establishment won another victory when the National Labor Relations Board overturned a regional director’s finding that Northwestern football players were employees who could unionize under federal labor law.Two cases, which have been coordinated and have a class certification hearing on Thursday before Judge Wilken, seek an injunction against N.C.A.A. rules banning compensation.One of those cases, led by the lawyer Jeffrey Kessler, essentially seeks a free market for athletes in top football and Division I men’s basketball programs. (Mr. Kessler was unavailable to comment Wednesday on the Ninth Circuit’s ruling.) That case is expected to be remanded to a Federal District Court in New Jersey, where, in turn, any eventual appeal would go to a different circuit court.At a basic level, Wednesday’s Ninth Circuit ruling should give such a case hope; an alternative would have been to find that, as the N.C.A.A. insisted, rules restricting compensation were justified under antitrust law.The other case seeks, among other things, damages for past compensation that athletes were denied before the N.C.A.A. approved the full-cost-of-attendance model.“It’s very helpful in some respects,” said Steve Berman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in that case.“Given this precedent,” Mr. Berman added, “we might be entitled to summary judgment on the damages.”The question, he said, is whether Wednesday’s ruling precludes athletes from seeking compensation above the full cost of attendance.Advertisement“There’s a footnote that says the record on why $5,000 was appropriate was not fully developed,” Mr. Berman said. “We’re going to try to fully develop the record to establish that the conferences could compete and pay student-athletes without interfering with amateurism.”He added: “Where the fight’s going to be is, are we foreclosed by this ruling for seeking anything above the cost of attendance? That’s the battleground.”On the N.C.A.A.’s conference call, the Big 12 commissioner, Bob Bowlsby, echoed Mr. Emmert’s satisfaction with the heart of the decision.“This provides some level of uncertainty, but also a welcome level of certainty,” Mr. Bowlsby said, adding, “In the main, I believe this has affirmed the amateur status of collegiate athletes.”Mr. Emmert, too, said he hoped the ruling would provide clarity to N.C.A.A. universities and help deter future legal challenges.Each side will have 14 days to request a rehearing in front of the full Ninth Circuit, or 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court. Mr. Hausfeld said he was weighing his options, and the N.C.A.A.’s chief legal officer, Donald Remy, said his organization was doing the same.A version of this article appears in print on October 1, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Victory for N.C.A.A. as Panel Strikes Down Pay for College Athletes.
