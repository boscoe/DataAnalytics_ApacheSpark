SYRACUSE —  It has become almost trite and half-expected: Tom Izzo coaching Michigan State deep into the N.C.A.A. tournament, pushing all the right buttons at all the right times in March.But after a 62-58 victory Friday night over a rock-solid Oklahoma team in an East region game at the Carrier Dome, Izzo has brought the Spartans storming back to the round of 8 for a ninth time, a turnaround that might deserve a special place in his pantheon of coaching achievements.At 13-7 on Jan. 24, No. 7-seeded Michigan State (26-11) looked like a team desperate to grasp any success. On Friday, after trailing for the first 30 minutes, the Spartans remained poised, determined and capable of just enough to outscore third-seeded Oklahoma by 35-27 in the second half.Now Michigan State has earned a date with fourth-seeded Louisville and its Hall of Fame coach, Rick Pitino, on Sunday for a chance to reach the Final Four.AdvertisementWithout the same history of N.C.A.A. tournament success, or a coach whose name has become almost synonymous with March, Oklahoma (24-11) entered its matchup with Michigan State feeling a bit underappreciated. In the Sooners’ locker room after practice Thursday, reporters asked variations of the same question: How did it feel to be underdogs as a No. 3 seed?AdvertisementThe answer: not good.But after beating Dayton in the second round, the Sooners returned to campus in Norman, Okla., flipped on the film of Michigan State for several hours on Monday and found a team strangely reminiscent of themselves.The Spartans are well-balanced; they like to run, rebound and defend. It looked oddly familiar. So Coach Lon Kruger emphasized controlling the lane offensively and grabbing an early lead.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            The Sooners did just that in Friday’s matchup, using a blazing start from the floor. Oklahoma hit seven of its first nine field-goal attempts, almost all of them from within the lane, allowing the Sooners to jump to a 16-8 lead.Michigan State adjusted, re-established its transition defense and got Travis Trice a few open looks from beyond the 3-point arc. The Spartans cut the lead to 23-19 but fell behind by 10, at 31-21, with 3 minutes 27 seconds left in the first half. Oklahoma went into halftime with a 31-27 lead.Izzo and Kruger battled regularly in the Big Ten, when Kruger coached Illinois from 1996 to 2000. Both men were candidates for the Atlanta Hawks opening in 2000 — after Izzo’s team had just won the national title — but it went to Kruger.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Kruger eventually moved on from Atlanta, to the Knicks, to Nevada-Las Vegas and finally to Oklahoma, the fifth team he has taken to the round of 16.“In a lot of ways our styles are similar, what we demand and what we want,” Izzo said Thursday. “We just got there in different ways.”Within minutes after halftime, Michigan State had chopped Oklahoma’s lead to 2, thanks to 3-pointers by Trice and Denzel Valentine. The Spartans had yet to lead, but that changed with 9:25 left when Branden Dawson’s jumper gave Michigan State a 44-42 lead.AdvertisementFrom there, the lead changed five times. Keeping the Sooners alive, almost single-handedly, was Buddy Hield, the silky-smooth junior guard from the Bahamas, who scored 21 points. Michigan State at least had two primary scorers, Valentine and Trice, who combined for 42 points and eight 3-pointers.Oklahoma’s defense ranked 13th in Division I this year in opponents’ field-goal shooting percentage, but Michigan State went 11 of 21 from the floor to start the second half, and the Sooners’ offense could not keep up. Oklahoma shot just 36.4 percent for the game, including 4 of 17 from beyond the arc.Izzo has met Pitino only twice in the N.C.A.A. tournament, splitting the two games, with a win in 2009 and a loss in the round of 16 in 2012.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
