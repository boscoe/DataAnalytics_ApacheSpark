It was Nash’s seventh goal in eight games as he moved closer to his career high of 40 goals with Columbus in 2008-9.But Talbot, who made his sixth straight start for the injured Henrik Lundqvist, was tested just a few minutes later. Dominic Moore hauled down Rieder, setting up Arizona’s second penalty shot in a week. Both failed.Talbot gobbled up Rieder’s backhand attempt.“Cam’s been the backbone of our team,” Nash said.Added Vigneault: “He’s been waiting for an opportunity to prove he can play on a consistent level.”The Rangers soon unleashed the potent offense that has been key to their 6-1-1 stretch.Hayes soon scored the Rangers’ eighth short-handed goal of the season. Staal’s goal with 5:44 left and Stempniak’s tally with 2:13 left gave the Rangers 33 goals in nine games.Vigneault, 53, who also had stints coaching Montreal and Vancouver, improved to 500-355-35-72 in the N.H.L. He moved into a tie with Toe Blake for the 20th most wins in the league. Pat Burns (501) is next on the list.The Rangers were without defenseman Dan Boyle (illness), who had scored the first goal in each of the Rangers’ last two games.Advertisement
