The increasing number of top players who are getting close to 50 made it practical to add a national championship for senior women, said Mike Davis, the U.S.G.A. executive director. The association has had a United States Senior Open for men since 1980. For years, older players like Nancy Lopez, Pat Bradley and Amy Alcott did not have a U.S.G.A. championship to play as professionals. It has yet to be determined where the Open will be played in 2018 or how large the field will be.■ Bart Bryant holed out with a 6-iron from 195 yards on the par-5 18th hole, the first double eagle on the Champions Tour since 2010, for a share of the second-round lead at the Allianz Championship in Boca Raton, Fla.Advertisement
