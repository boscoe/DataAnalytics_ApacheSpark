Fans of both teams will acclaim him, then settle to watch Ireland’s next step in its pursuit of championship, Triple Crown and Grand Slam.Ireland took control of this year’s tournament Sunday, going 3-0 by beating England, also previously unbeaten, 19-9, in Dublin.In equaling their all-time record of 10 consecutive victories, the Irish were superbly controlled for the first two-thirds of the match.“Our first-half discipline was very good, and in the first 20 minutes of the second half we played very well,” O’Connell told BBC sport.“We sat back a bit, which was disappointing,” he added, “but we have a hell of a lot of respect for this England team and we’re delighted to win.”Ireland’s game plan is well known. “They’re clinical at what they do and do not make a lot of mistakes,” said the Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, as he looked forward.“They’re not playing a huge amount of rugby, their set piece is good, they drill the line-out well, they kick to the corners well, their kicking in the air is good,” Gatland said.The problem for opponents is combating that pattern.Ireland completely dominated England for 55 minutes, taking a match-winning 19-3 lead.An intense, destructive forward performance was supplemented by superb play from its half-backs.Jonathan Sexton landed four penalties out of five, winning two of Ireland’s kicks at goal by crunching tackles on Englishmen. Conor Murray then enabled the decisive blow, hoisting a kick that the outstanding centre Robbie Henshaw snatched away from England’s full-back Alex Goode before plunging for the touchdown.Sexton converted from the touchline in his last act before being replaced by Ian Madigan.“We’re very disappointed,” said England’s captain, Chris Robshaw.“We didn’t get the result we wanted,” he added. “Credit to the Irish, but we gave them points too easily.”The Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, has already said that nothing is guaranteed his team.It finishes with matches away to two other teams, Wales and Scotland, which also have New Zealand coaches.If Ireland slips up, England (2-1), which will expect to beat Scotland and France at home, still has a chance.So does Wales (2-1), which beat France, 20-13, in Paris on Saturday night.“We’re back in contention,” said Gatland, the Wales coach.“Obviously we need a couple of results to go our way.”Victory in Paris gives Wales a shot at emulating two years ago, when it won the championship after losing its first match at home.“We’ve prided ourselves in the squad in recent years that, the more time we spend together, we improve,” Gatland said.It won a contest of more physicality than quality because of superb defense, five penalties by the impeccable goal-kicker Leigh Halfpenny and the evening’s single moment of attacking quality.That came on the hour when a slick interchange between scrum-half Rhys Webb and back rower Dan Lydiate sent flyhalf Dan Biggar on a long angled run to score in the corner.Wales led 17-6, and was set for a fourth consecutive victory over France for the first time since the 1950s.The result leaves France (1-2) in jeopardy of a fourth consecutive bottom-half finish, its worst sequence since the 1920s.The France coach, Philippe Saint-André, has been left under acute pressure.The coach lashed out furiously in a team meeting on Sunday morning, according to the French sports website L’Equipe.fr “To wear the shirt of French you must be able to dedicate yourself and give everything on the pitch,” Saint-André is reported to have said.“Here, we had too many who could not raise the level of their game,” Saint-André said.The website, which is related to the French national daily sports newspaper, reported that Saint-André was likely to drop several players for the next match, which an away match with Italy on March 15. “I don’t need starlets, players who are O.K. for photo sessions and want to live their lives in the media,” Saint-André said.Italy (1-2) will be on a high after winning the most dramatic match of the weekend away to Scotland (now 0-3) in Edinburgh. Italy’s second road victory in 15 seasons membership of the Six Nations was clinched in the final seconds when referee George Clancy awarded it a penalty try following a series of defensive fouls by the Scots.Italy’s 22-19 triumph was revenge for Scotland winning in the closing seconds in Rome last year.“It’s fantastic for the team to win at the end,” the Italian captain, Sergio Parisse, told the BBC. “It’s been very hard on the team in recent years, as we lost from a last-minute drop goal in Rome last time out. The forwards did a tremendous job at the end there.”Italy showed huge spirit in spite of trailing until those final seconds after conceding an early interception try to Scotland’s center, Mark Bennett.Scotland remains winless despite scoring the first try in all three of its matches. It has looked better in attack than it has in years, but it still has found ways to lose this season.“I’m obviously not getting the message across,” said Vern Cotter, in his first year as Scotland’s coach. “Obviously, I’m responsible for the defeat, so I’ll be having a good look at myself and how we can move forward.”Italy deserved its victory, scoring three tries to Scotland’s one. It responded rapidly to Bennett’s try with the back-row forward Josh Furno crossing, and then winger Giovanbattista Venditti scored a try awarded after a video replay.Scotland led, 16-15, at halftime, thanks to the accurate kicking of its captain, Greig Laidlaw, who added three more points in the second half. But Italy’s forwards created pressure in the final few minutes, sealing the result.Advertisement
