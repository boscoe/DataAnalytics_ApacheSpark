The N.B.A.’s All-Star weekend is being co-hosted by the Knicks and the Nets, but if fans expect to see a lot of the teams’ owners, they will be disappointed.Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the Nets’ owner, will not attend the game at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. In fact, he will not even be in town, a spokeswoman said. But he rarely is.James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, will be a panelist at the league’s annual technology summit, an invitation-only, off-the-record event Friday at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, and will then go to one of the community events that are part of the N.B.A. Cares program’s day-of-service campaign throughout the city. The league and the Garden would not say which one he was planning to attend. Dolan inadvertently created a stir this week when Deadspin reported that he had sent a vitriolic email last month to a Knicks fan who was critical of his running of the team.The N.B.A. does not require the owners of the teams that host the All-Star Game to attend a specific number of events, although they generally attend Board of Governors receptions and events for the day of service. Dolan has been a regular attendee at past technology summits; several other owners are expected to be at the event, as is the Knicks’ president, Phil Jackson.
