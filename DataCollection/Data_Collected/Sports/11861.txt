CreditGretchen Ertl for The New York Times        WORCESTER, Mass. —  Before one of the Worcester Sharks’ final home games this season, fans gathered for a party at a popular pregame hangout near DCU Center, the team’s home rink for the past nine years.There was cause for celebration as the Sharks were close to qualifying for the American Hockey League playoffs for the first time since 2010. But the conversations eventually took on a funereal tone.Peter West, a season-ticket holder for minor league hockey for two decades, decided to give a toast. Wearing a customized jersey that he was awarded for being the Sharks’ one-millionth fan, he said: “We’ve had a great run of hockey in Worcester, lots of memories. Salud.”After this season, the team is moving to San Jose to play in the same arena as their parent club, the N.H.L.’s San Jose Sharks.AdvertisementThe Worcester Sharks are one of three Northeast teams — along with the Adirondack Flames of Glens Falls, N.Y., and the Manchester Monarchs of New Hampshire — that are casualties of the formation of a new A.H.L. Pacific Division. The Flames, Calgary’s farm club, will play in Stockton, Calif., next season, while the Monarchs will relocate to Ontario, Calif., which is almost 3,000 miles closer to their parent club, the Los Angeles Kings, than Manchester is.AdvertisementTo round out the new division, the Edmonton Oilers’ affiliate in Oklahoma City is moving to Bakersfield, Calif., and the Anaheim Ducks’ club in Norfolk, Va., is going to San Diego.Logistically, the change reduces cross-country travel for promoted players and enables N.H.L. Western Conference teams to better scout their farm clubs. The A.H.L.’s president, David Andrews, also described the division as a new era for professional hockey in California, an opportunity to grow the game.But it leaves a bittersweet spring for longtime fans in some hockey hotbeds. Manchester, Worcester and Oklahoma City qualified for the playoffs, which began Wednesday, providing the consolation of possibly extending their seasons into June.Manchester and Glens Falls have found replacements from the ECHL, and Worcester is also seeking a team, but local fans are unsure if they will support what is generally perceived as a lower quality of minor league hockey, leaving a potential economic and emotional void.“When they finally announced it, it was almost like a nail in the coffin,” said Chris O’Shea, a Sharks fan. “It’s devastating because this is my life.”Worcester has experienced loss before. In 1994, the Worcester IceCats were born and played to sellout crowds. But as attendance dwindled, the St. Louis Blues, the IceCats’ parent organization, moved the club to Peoria, Ill., in 2005.Worcester hockey fans are not the only residents fearing a life without the Sharks. Viva Bene, the restaurant that hosted the pregame party this month, often experienced a bump in business on game days, according to its manager, Keivan Mizrahi.AdvertisementThe Sharks also provided jobs. Bruce Blomgren, a season-ticket holder, said his son, Michael, began working as a mascot and is now the team’s assistant equipment manager. Michael has been offered a job in San Jose but was undecided about taking it, having never lived outside the area.A similar opportunity recently came to the Monarchs’ executive vice president, Matt Welch, who was born and raised in Manchester and began working with the team in 2001. He was offered a job with Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the Kings, but chose to stay in town and help bring in a new team.“My family was here, my friends were here and my ties were here,” Welch said.When the Pacific Division was finalized in January, Welch was concerned about hockey’s future in town, but he recalled a meeting with the Kings’ president, Luc Robitaille, in 2012, after the team brought the Stanley Cup to Manchester.“Luc said these people are passionate, these are real hockey fans,” Welch said.He added that, when the Kings announced their A.H.L. affiliate would move to California, Robitaille told him, “We need to make sure there’s something in Manchester.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The time change and long flights, it makes it real tough. Next year, it’s going to be a big advantage.”Sitting in Manchester’s Verizon Wireless Arena in early April, Welch understood the frustration in the perceived step down in quality of play.Advertisement“This was the alternative,” he said. “If it wasn’t this, then this was a dark building. It’s not a conversation you like to have, but it’s an honest conversation.”Monarchs fans are starting to come around. At a game in early April, Jacob Wedge, 11, cheered on the home team while hanging his arms over the railing of the upper level.He said he first saw the Monarchs play on his ninth birthday, and “ever since, they’ve been a part of my heart.”When Wedge learned the A.H.L. team was leaving, he cried.“It broke my heart,” he said. “But when I heard they were getting a new team, I sprung back up again.”Wedge has spent much of his free time learning the roster of the Kings’ current ECHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign.In Worcester, a grass-roots group called Save Worcester Hockey is holding out hope that there will be an ECHL team willing to move by October, but it is more likely to occur for the 2016-17 season.“It’s like any type of loss or death, you think in different stages,” said Rich Lundin, a leading member of Save Worcester Hockey. “Most people are in denial right now — they’re about enjoying what we have. We’re making a strong playoff run. After that, the depression’s going to come. And I think the acceptance part won’t come until next year, if we don’t have a team.”A version of this article appears in print on April 25, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Hockey Teams Leave Hotbeds for Warmer Climes.
