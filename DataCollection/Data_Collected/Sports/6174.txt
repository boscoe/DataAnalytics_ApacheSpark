As Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware, one of the most effective pass-rushing combinations in the N.F.L., charge toward a quarterback, linebacker Brandon Marshall patrols the middle of the field, helping to shut down the short passing game.With few options other than throwing deep, the opposing quarterback must try to avoid Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, who combined for 34 passes defended and seven interceptions this season. Talib made teams pay for challenging him, returning two of his four interceptions for touchdowns.Ranked ninth in the N.F.L. against the pass and second against the run, the Broncos are intimidating under normal conditions. But with a game-time temperature forecast to be around 20 and a slight chance of snow, Indianapolis might have trouble moving the ball.The Colts also do not have a defensive player as dominant as Miller or Ware — no Indianapolis player had more than six and a half sacks — but the team’s sack total, 41, matched Denver’s for ninth in the league.Much can be said about the talented quarterbacks in this game, Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck, and the connections between them, but you will hear plenty about that during the broadcast.Pick: BroncosTimes are Eastern.
