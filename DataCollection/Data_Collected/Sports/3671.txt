On this Thanksgiving Day, sports must extol the somber scene at the recent England-France soccer friendly at Wembley Stadium in London, four nights after the Paris terrorist attacks, as thousands of spectators from the rival nations and 44 players, arm in arm, sang “La Marseillaise,” the French anthem. Merci, soccer.Not to forget, there are so many others in sports’ little corner of the world who deserve a thank you.American Pharoah, who deserves an extra carrot or two, having worn horse racing’s first Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978, and the trainer Bob Baffert, the owner Ahmed Zayat and the jockey Victor Espinoza.Carli Lloyd, whose three goals in the Women’s World Cup final, notably a soaring midfield strike of about 50 yards, led the United States team to the championship and a New York ticker-tape parade up Broadway.AdvertisementMalcolm Butler, the New England Patriots rookie defensive back whose late goal-line interception of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was the most title-turning play in Super Bowl history.AdvertisementThe Kansas City Royals, who defined the words “baseball team” in winning the World Series with their bats, arms, legs, gloves and smarts.Clarence Gaines, a Knicks scout who first trumpeted the talents of Kristaps Porzingis — the 7-foot-3, 20-year-old Latvian who is creating a pro basketball revival at Madison Square Garden — to the franchise’s guru, Phil Jackson.Jordan Spieth (Masters, United States Open), Zach Johnson (British Open) and Jason Day (P.G.A. Championship), who turned golf’s four majors into memories.Stan Bowman, the general manager of the Chicago Blackhawks, who, for the third time in six seasons, won the trophy he was named after, the Stanley Cup (which his father, Scotty, won nine times as a coach: five with the Montreal Canadiens, three with the Detroit Red Wings, one with the Pittsburgh Penguins).Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who hushed a controversy in ruling that Patriots quarterback Tom Brady could not be suspended for New England’s deflated footballs because he was not aware such misconduct could lead to the punishment he received.Stephen Curry, the dazzling scorer and sorcerer of the Golden State Warriors in their rise to an N.B.A. championship.The Mets physicians who advised General Manager Sandy Alderson to cancel a July 29 trade with the Milwaukee Brewers for center fielder Carlos Gomez (who went to the Houston Astros), prompting instead the arrival of outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, whose slugging spurred the Mets’ late-season ascent under Manager Terry Collins to the National League East title and the World Series.AdvertisementNovak Djokovic, who won three of the four men’s Grand Slam tennis titles, as well as the ATP World Tour Finals for the fifth time.The Yankees, who honored their longtime pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre with a plaque in Monument Park at the Stadium.Sydney Seau, who allowed The New York Times to print the Pro Football Hall of Fame induction speech that she had prepared for her late father, Junior Seau; she was allowed only an interview onstage during the ceremony in Canton, Ohio. “The reason why this honor is so hard to accept,” she wrote in part, “is because we had always envisioned him still being here to accept it.”Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Their complaint: Pacquiao’s shoulder injury wasn’t revealed until after the fight, and after 4.4 million viewers had paid up to $100 each to watch. The fighters each collected more than $100 million.Jeff Gordon, the racecar legend who turned off the ignition after 24 years and 93 Sprint Cup victories.Cristie Kerr, Michelle Wie, Gerina Piller, Angela Stanford and Paula Creamer, who, with their team trailing by 4 points before the singles matches, rallied the United States Solheim Cup golfers to a 14 ½-13 ½ victory over Europe.AdvertisementChris Borland, the San Francisco 49ers linebacker who retired at age 24 because “I don’t think it’s worth the risk,” alluding to the future effect of the multiple concussions he had experienced and researched.Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson, the first climbers to reach the summit of El Capitan’s 3,000-foot Dawn Wall in Yosemite National Park in a single expedition with the use of only hands and feet to pull them up.Mike Krzyzewski, the Duke coach who enjoyed his 1,000th victory en route to another N.C.A.A. basketball title.And the more than 30 black football players at the University of Missouri who joined student protests against systemic racism on campus. Their threat not to play a game worth millions of dollars to the university in television and forfeit fees prompted the university system president Timothy M. Wolfe and the chancellor R. Bowen Loftin to announce they would resign. The Show Me State showed the activist power of college athletes.A version of this article appears in print on November 26, 2015, on Page B16 of the New York edition with the headline: From London to Missouri, Plenty of Thanks to Be Passed Around.
