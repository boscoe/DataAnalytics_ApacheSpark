Here’s a look at the players worth adding to your fantasy football roster this week:Kirk Cousins, Washington Redskins (10%): Cousins is not a very good NFL quarterback, and has one of the highest interception rates in the league. However, he hasn’t received a ton of help from his receivers this season. Washington dropped seven passes on Sunday, one of which resulted in Cousins’s lone interception. Granted, I’m not writing Cousins here because I like him the rest of the way. That’s crazy talk. But I do like his Week 10 matchup, especially when you consider that four more teams are on bye this week, including Matt Ryan, Andrew Luck and Philip Rivers. Cousins gets to face a New Orleans secondary that just allowed Marcus Mariota to pass for 371 yards and four touchdowns on Sunday afternoon, and now have coughed up a league-high 24 passing touchdowns this season. They have now allowed a whopping 10 scores through the air over the last two weeks, and no team in football has surrendered more passing touchdowns per game this season than the Saints (2.7). After two-consecutive massacres, New Orleans is now allowing over 28 fantasy points per game to opposing signal callers in 2015, easily the most in the league. And, for what it’s worth, Cousins actually ranks 8th in the league in completion percentage (66.9%), while opposing passers are completing just over 66 percent of their passes against the Saints this year.Blake Bortles, Jacksonville Jaguars (52%): Bortles had a very fine fantasy day against a tough Jets defense, despite throwing two picks and fumbling twice. He passed for a career-high 381 yards and two touchdowns, and now has tossed multiple touchdown passes in four-straight games. Bortles has 11 scores and seven picks during that span, and he’s becoming close to an every-week starter, especially when you consider the way that the Jacksonville wideouts are playing. He’s now inside the top-10 in both passing yards (2,193) and touchdowns (17) and gets a dream matchup against the Ravens shaky secondary. The Ravens are allowing 284 yards per game through the air, good for the fourth-most in football, while giving up 33 plays of 20 yards or more (6th-most), as well as eight such plays of 40 yards or more (3rd-most). Bortles is still out there in just under half of leagues, and if you can scoop him, you’ll have a top-10 option for Week 10.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Karlos Williams, Buffalo Bills (36%): Karlos Williams just scored another touchdown. This kid is a monster. In his first game back from suffering a concussion, the rookie product out of Florida State rushed nine times for 110 yards and two scores. There have been seven players in the history of the NFL to score a touchdown in each of their first five career games. Williams is one of them, and now has six scores on the season, putting him in third place among running backs. On 51 totes this year, he is averaging an impressive 6.6 yards per pop, and has continuously proved that he can step up when Buffalo needs him. Now LeSean McCoy also found success against this Miami defense, rushing for over 100 yards and broke a beautiful 48-yard touchdown. However, he suffered a right shoulder injury that forced him to exit late in the game. After the contest, McCoy stated he wanted to go back into the game and would be fine for Thursday night’s game against the Jets. He’ll undergo an MRI, but it is a short week, so if he can’t go, Williams would be a top-15 back for Week 10, even against the Jets tough run defense. He’s just been far too effective to ignore. Whether you own McCoy or not, Williams is essentially a must-own right now.James Starks, Green Bay Packers (39%): Man, hate to say it, but Starks has to be better than Eddie Lacy right now. He totaled 122 yards and scored on Sunday, while Lacy rushed five times for 10 yards and lost a fumble. Lacy also suffered a groin injury in this game, but either way, we’ve come to the point where Starks is the preferred option. While not as effective as Williams, Starks is still bringing a different (and better) element to this offense than Lacy right now, and needs to be universally owned. The Packers have lost two-straight games for the first time since 1812 (kidding), so look for them to come out and spank the Lions, who have really struggled on offense, defense, special teams and even owning and managing. Opposing rushers are averaging the 10th-most fantasy points per game against the Lions this year, so if Lacy’s groin injury is relatively serious, Starks should be in line for a very nice outing.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He has Calvin Johnson-like qualities with insane physicality and ball skills. Finally, it appears the Titans are beginning to unleash their talented rookie wideout. He saw a team-high 10 targets against the Saints on Sunday, hauling in five of them for 77 yards. Quarterback Marcus Mariota seems very high on his fellow rookie, stating they need to find ways to get him the ball more. Now, Kendall Wright did miss this game with a sprained knee, but DGB was one of my favorite stashes for months now, so with the Titans finally starting to get him involved, now is the time to make sure he’s not out there.Devin Funchess, Carolina Panthers (14%): I have a bit more trepidation with Funchess, but this rookie finally had his coming out party on Sunday, so he deserves to be mentioned. After Kelvin Benjamin was lost for the year, many thought that Funchess would step in and assume that KB role. That clearly hasn’t happened yet, as he entered this game against the Packers with seven receptions for 90 yards and zero scores for the season. However, he finished this game with three catches for 71 yards and his first career touchdown. His highlight play was an impressive 52-yard catch where Damarious Randall was draped all over him. It’s difficult to gauge whether or not this will lead to bigger things for Funchess, seeing as he still played just 27 percent of the snaps in this game. Consider him worth a look in deeper leagues and monitor if his usage increases in the coming weeks.Chris Givens, Baltimore Ravens (1%): With Steve Smith out for the rest of the year, the Ravens now unquestionably have the worst group of wide receivers in the NFL. Still, the targets have to go somewhere, and reports out of Baltimore indicate that Givens and Joe Flacco are starting to develop a bit of a rapport. We’ve seen Givens flash some big play upside before, and now he has an opportunity to play a major role in this offense. Flacco has one of the strongest arms in the league, and is very capable of hitting Givens on those deep balls. When Smith went down back in Week 8. Givens immediately saw his playing time increase, seeing a season-high 33 snaps.Nick Raducanu is the owner of ProjectRoto.com and is a contributor to Rotoworld and 4for4.com.
