CreditGretchen Ertl for The New York Times        BOSTON —  Before the first women’s Beanpot hockey tournament, in 1979, Harvard Coach Joe Bertagna purchased a two-toned brown beanpot for $6 at Howard’s Flying Dragon Antiques in Essex, Mass.For 35 years, until a more regal-looking silver trophy replaced it in 2014, Bertagna’s beanpot was awarded to the tournament’s champion and treated like the Stanley Cup — in stature and as a celebratory prop.“It’s probably a little worse for the wear after we were done with it,” said Alison Quandt, a goaltender on Boston College’s 2006 team that won the Eagles’ first Beanpot title. The men’s Beanpot, featuring Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern and Harvard, began in 1952 and is quite possibly the most prestigious in-season tournament in college hockey. Bertagna and the other teams’ coaches formulated the idea for a women’s Beanpot at a bar in Harvard Square in the late 1970s, and since 1979, the women’s Beanpot tournament has been played with the tradition of the men’s tournament, if not the pomp.The women’s competition has grown to include some of the game’s premier players, but they are still fighting to gain recognition from a larger audience.AdvertisementIn Tuesday’s final, No. 1 Boston College (27-0-1) will play No. 4 Harvard (18-4-2). Boston University, which fell in the opening round to Harvard, 9-2, on Feb. 3, was ranked sixth at the time. Northeastern has won a record 16 tournament titles.Advertisement“Our kids get up for the Beanpot even more than maybe a Hockey East championship game,” said Northeastern Coach Dave Flint, whose team lost, 3-1, to Boston College in the opening round.While Boston College was the favorite entering this year’s tournament, Harvard and Northeastern dominated for decades, combining to win 25 of the first 27 championships, often by lopsided scores. In 1995, Northeastern defeated Boston University, 24-0, in the first round.A contributing factor to the imbalance was the varsity status of the Harvard and Northeastern teams, while Boston University and Boston College competed at the club level. During the past 10 years, though, as all four teams began operating as Division I programs, the four Boston-area teams have developed into perennial contenders, combining for eight Frozen Four appearances. Boston College has won five Beanpot titles in the past nine years.Bertagna, who is now the Hockey East commissioner and has been the women’s tournament administrator since 2004, said the success of the women’s teams validated the increased support from within their respective athletic departments.In the early Beanpot years, respect and money for women’s hockey were scarce.Diane DerBoghosian, who won the first women’s Beanpot’s Most Valuable Player Award for Northeastern in 1979, started a club team with several other female students at Northeastern whom she met in weekend recreation leagues. They held bake sales for financing and car-pooled to games to save money. DerBoghosian often drove her 1977 brown Ford Pinto, which was purchased for $800 and barely carried four players and their equipment.The team also practiced at the whim of the men’s team.“Our ice time wasn’t always at ideal times,” DerBoghosian said. “We had to take a back seat to the men’s hockey team that was practicing and playing in the same arena. We were always in the background, typical back then.”While the men’s Beanpot tournament is now held before near-capacity crowds at TD Garden, the home rink of the Boston Bruins, the women’s teams take turns hosting their event. This year’s games are being played at Harvard’s Bright-Landry Hockey Center, which seats about 2,800. Bertagna said that when the arena was being renovated in the late 1970s, university officials wanted to put the women’s hockey team’s lockers in an adjoining building that housed an indoor track.AdvertisementEach year, Beanpot participants traditionally receive a gift, and Flint said women’s teams were often given a hat, at most.Today, men’s and women’s teams receive tokens of equal value, usually in the form of gift cards. But while the gifts for the men’s teams are paid by TD Garden and tournament receipts, the four universities split the cost of the women’s gifts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

One point of conversation has been the request to feature the women’s Beanpot final at TD Garden, as the opening of a doubleheader with the men’s final.“I think it’s the way it should be,” Harvard Coach Katey Stone said. “These women work their tails off. They deserve to play in front of great crowds. People would be pleasantly surprised by the product on the ice.”Bertagna said he believed they were earnestly working toward relocating the women’s final.“It’s not being dismissed out of hand, which I think at one time it might’ve been,” he said. “But anything that has so much tradition, it takes a little time for people to wrap their arms around doing something different after 60-some odd years.”Boston University Coach Brian Durocher noted how each team in the women’s Beanpot has Olympians on its roster, but he was frustrated that there might not be enough interest in seeing them play in front of bigger crowds.The 2014 Winter Olympics gold medal game, a 3-2 overtime classic won by Canada over the United States, featured six players who competed in this year’s Beanpot. Yet at the start of last Tuesday’s opening-round games, only about 200 people were in attendance. Hundreds more arrived throughout the night — the official attendance was 1,181 — including a number of girls hockey clubs that received donated tickets.“I know it will never get the recognition that the men’s tournament gets, that’s just a fact of life,” Flint said. “But I think they do a pretty good job with it, promoting it. I’ve seen the attendance grow.”This year, snow had postponed the men’s opening-round games from their traditional slot on the first Monday in February, so the men’s and women’s Beanpots were played simultaneously. Across town, at TD Garden, 14,520 were in attendance.AdvertisementNonetheless, Emily Field, a senior forward for Boston College, was impressed by the turnout for the women’s games.“On a Tuesday night at five o’clock after a big snowstorm, it’s kind of unbelievable,” she said. “It wasn’t like that a few years ago, and I hope it continues to grow.”There were Northeastern and Boston College fans at the first women’s opening-round game who also had tickets to watch the men’s teams play later that night. After supporting the men’s team earlier in the evening, the Boston University pep band arrived midway through the second period of the women’s game, as did a number of Terriers alumni and students.Boston College forward Danielle Doherty, who grew up in nearby Newton, attended the women’s Beanpot as a child. The rinks were so empty, she could go up to the end of the boards and slap hands with players she idolized.From her time as a fan to fulfilling a dream of playing in the Beanpot, Doherty said the tournament had grown tangibly and symbolically.“I remember the first trophy: It was on like a little wooden box, and it kind of broke off,” she said. “Now we feel a little bit more important with the big metal one.”A version of this article appears in print on February 10, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Women Seek a Bigger Beanpot.
