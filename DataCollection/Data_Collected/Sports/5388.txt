It can do that by dealing a crushing blow to the Jets’ playoff hopes this week, or by beating the lowly Dolphins next week in an otherwise meaningless game. Since the Bill Belichick-led Patriots have consistently proved to be the N.F.L. equivalent of pro wrestling’s heels, expect the Patriots to do everything they can to take care of business against the Jets.While the Jets have played numerous close games against their division rival in recent years, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has a 21-6 career record against them. He has thrown 38 touchdown passes in the 27 games, and also has three rushing touchdowns, his highest total against any team.“Hopefully, he gets traded at some point in time,” Calvin Pace, a Jets linebacker, joked to reporters this week. “Trade him to the N.F.C. somewhere.”The Jets’ quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, has been a revelation for the Jets, and has made the offense something to fear by using Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker to their fullest potential. But Fitzgerald comes into the game with a 1-7 career record against the Patriots, thanks largely to 17 interceptions, eight more than he has thrown against any other opponent.There may be a bright future for the Jets under Coach Todd Bowles, and Fitzpatrick may be the quarterback to guide them for a few years, but expecting them to stay alive by beating the Patriots when New England has something to play for may be asking for too much too soon.Pick: PatriotsAdvertisement
