When Matthew Graves was an assistant at Butler, he was known as a shooter’s coach. Graves believed that all players, from the point guard to the big men, needed a perimeter game. So when he called the former Butler coach Brad Stevens in the fall of 2009 and said that he had just scouted a unique talent, Stevens thought Graves had stumbled upon a phenomenally gifted shooter.That prospect was Roosevelt Jones, a guard at O’Fallon High School in Illinois. Stevens pressed Graves for details. Did Jones make 25 consecutive 3-pointers?“I told Brad that he didn’t look great during basic shooting drills, and I don’t know what it exactly was, but I really like this kid,” said Graves, who is now the coach at South Alabama.Jones committed to Butler about a year after that open gym, and he has since become the catalyst for the Bulldogs’ success this season. Sixth-seeded Butler (22-10) will meet 11th-seeded Texas (20-13) on Thursday afternoon in a Midwest Region game in Pittsburgh in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament.AdvertisementA 6-foot-4 guard, Jones is regarded for his defense and his passing vision, but what really stood out to Graves was his offensive skill set: He almost never attempted a jump shot.AdvertisementIn his three years at Butler, Jones has taken only three jumpers. His last attempt, a fadeaway 3-pointer to beat an expiring shot clock, was more than two years ago.All of Jones’s shots are near the rim, a combination of straight shots, floaters, scoop shots and push shots. He is not an offensive wallflower either: He has attempted 370 field goals this season for Butler, the second most on the team.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “All of Roosevelt’s work is within 8 to 10 feet of the basket,” Butler Coach Chris Holtmann said, “which makes him one of a kind. We don’t say he has a perimeter game — he has a float game.”When Jones expands his range up to 15 feet, “that’s his midrange game,” said Terry Johnson, who has been Jones’s position coach throughout his Butler career. Johnson added, “He shoots a floater just as well from there as he does at the hoop.”The most famous example of Jones’s float game was against Gonzaga in January 2013. With Butler down by a point in the waning seconds, Jones stole the ball near midcourt, drove and, using his body to create space between him and Gonzaga forward Kelly Olynyk, made a right-handed floater for the win.“Roosevelt puts so much pressure on defenses, and it is really difficult to guard him,” Johnson said.Only Butler and a handful of Missouri Valley programs were interested in recruiting Jones, and the Bulldogs were among the few that offered him a scholarship.Advertisement“We never expected Roosevelt to be a shooter,” Stevens recalled, “but we thought he would be a jack-of-all-trades.”Johnson said: “It never dawned on me that he really couldn’t shoot a jump shot. My first thought was, What am I going to do with him?”Johnson developed a specialized routine to emphasize shooting floaters with different release points and from alternating angles.“We had to find a creative way to keep his workouts fresh and also challenging for him,” Johnson said.Jones also had to learn how to convert while being fouled. Johnson uses what Jones calls “a padded broomlike device” to force the guard to shoot over the tallest defenders while being hit.“If Coach Johnson fouls me, and I miss it, I have to do it again,” Jones said. “When I am in a game now, I never expect a foul and just try to finish through everyone.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He already had four types of shots entering this season — a floater from his shoulder, a high floater, a “bully ball” (when isolating smaller defenders in the post) and a line-drive floater — and to combat opponents hacking his wrists, Jones added a Rajon Rondo-like scoop shot, one that is nearly impossible to block and almost never misses.Jones spent last season rehabbing a wrist injury sustained on the team’s preseason trip to Australia. Even with the development of other Bulldogs, Jones’s return is the underlying factor for Butler’s 2015 success. After he hit a game-winner against Creighton in February, Holtmann said that the play was called Get It to Roosevelt and Get Out of the Way.Jones has converted only 42 percent of his field goals, but his misses sometimes end up in the outstretched arms of Kameron Woods, a senior center who grabs four offensive rebounds per 40 minutes and makes 56 percent of put-backs. Jones’s drives create space on the perimeter for Kellen Dunham and Alex Barlow, Butler’s top 3-point shooters.AdvertisementWhile Jones has tinkered with his offense, and opponents know he is going to drive whenever he touches the ball, they still struggle to contain him.“Roosevelt is 230-plus pounds, and you may know he’ll drive right, but he is so strong that you’ll bounce off him,” Graves said. “He has a knack of keeping his balance, holding on to the ball and finishing at the same time.”Holtmann said, “Really good players play to their strengths and hide their weaknesses, and that is exactly what Roosevelt does.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
