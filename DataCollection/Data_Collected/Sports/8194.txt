LVIV, Ukraine —  Ten-man Bayern Munich was left frustrated as Shakhtar Donetsk held the German champions to a 0-0 draw in their first-leg match in the round of 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.Bayern had the better chances but was thwarted by determined defending from Shakhtar and some poor shooting.Bayern played the last 25 minutes with 10 men after midfielder Xabi Alonso was red-carded in his 100th Champions League game, having picked up his second booking for a poor tackle on Alex Teixeira.The match was played in Lviv, in western Ukraine, because Shakhtar has been left homeless by the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the team’s home city, Donetsk, is a separatist stronghold.A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Bayern Munich Is Held to a Draw.
