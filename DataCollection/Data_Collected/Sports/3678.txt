Mr. Bailey and another passenger, Antwan Reeves, were shot when another vehicle pulled up and an occupant opened fire. There were two minors in the car, and the other passengers were not injured, the police said.The police are still searching for a suspect.Earlier this month, Mr. Bailey was suspended for four games after he was found to have violated the N.F.L.’s substance abuse policy. He was also suspended for four games in 2014 for violating the league’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs (that suspension was later reduced to two games).Mr. Bailey, a South Florida native who was drafted in the third round out of West Virginia University in 2013, holds several school records at West Virginia, including most receiving yardage in a game and in a season.He has played mostly as a backup in the N.F.L. so far. He has four career touchdowns, including a memorable punt return last season on a trick play in which the Rams lured the Seattle Seahawks to one side of the field while Mr. Bailey fielded the ball unnoticed at the other side.Last week, Mr. Bailey acknowledged his suspension in a post on Instagram, and said that he hoped to “make amends” as he prepared to return to the field.“I put both my coaches & my teammates in a bad position by regrettably partaking in a disgraceful activity,” he wrote, adding, “my environment & how I grew up isn’t an excuse.”Victor Mather contributed reporting.Advertisement
