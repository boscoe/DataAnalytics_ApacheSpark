Sure, they have lost four of their last six, but they are still in first place in the National League East. Attendance is up nearly 5 percent to an average of 30,413 a game, and team officials have said that they recorded a burst of ticket sales during the off-season.Still, an annual report that details some of the financial operations at Citi Field during the 2014 season illustrates the impact of a losing team. Ticket receipts for the ballpark’s most expensive 10,635 seats fell from $41.9 million to $40.4 million, while advertising revenue slipped from $44.5 million to $42.9 million. Concession revenue rose slightly to almost $10.8 million, and parking revenue jumped 14 percent to $8.3 million, but luxury-suite revenue fell a bit to $8.5 million.Overall revenue fell from $119.2 million to $117 million.Revenue has fallen over the years. In 2009, Citi Field’s opening season, revenue totaled $180.4 million, including $99.3 million from the most expensive seats.The documents provide only a partial glimpse at the Mets’ financial operations. They do not show revenue from gate receipts from about 30,000 seats and from local and national media, or expenses like player payroll.The filing is made by Queens Ballpark Company, the Mets’ subsidiary that leases the ballpark from the New York City Industrial Development Agency, which issued the stadium’s tax-exempt bonds. Last year, Standard & Poor’s raised its rating on Citi Field’s bonds to BB+ from BB, citing a more favorable view of the project.Advertisement
