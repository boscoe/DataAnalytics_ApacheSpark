But Bruce Arians, Carson Palmer and Larry Fitzgerald have done more than enough this season to justify General Manager Steve Keim’s comparing them to fine wine during a radio appearance. They may have gray in their beards, but they also are the driving forces behind the highest-scoring offense in the N.F.L.Add to that a defense that intercepted four of Colin Kaepernick’s first 10 passes last week — returning two for touchdowns — and it is easy to view Arizona as a title contender. But anyone who watched last season’s implosion knows the team can go only as far as Palmer’s surgically repaired legs can take it, so some caution against a hard-hitting Rams team may be in order. One bad hit could take this movie from “As Good as It Gets” to “Wild Hogs.”Pick: CardinalsAdvertisement
