RoundupBy The Associated PressThe backup goalie Chad Johnson made 37 saves, and four players scored to lead the visiting Islanders past the Carolina Hurricanes, 4-1, on Tuesday night.Anders Lee, Brock Nelson, Michael Grabner and John Tavares scored for the Islanders, who took a 3-0 lead in the season series between the first-place and last-place teams in the Metropolitan Division.The Islanders improved to 19-3 against the Metro Division as Lee’s 19th goal of the season, Nelson’s 16th and Grabner’s sixth gave the Islanders a 3-0 lead. And that was more than enough for Johnson, who last won Jan. 10 against Columbus. He is 2-0 this season against Carolina.“He made some great saves,” Grabner said. “We gave up a lot of shots, and he bailed us out a lot of times.”The Islanders improved to 8-2 on the second end of a back-to-back and 38-19-1 over all.“This is where you can sort of build your identity as a team and show your true character,” Johnson said.“When you have a high-energy game like we had, it’s tough to play back-to-back,” he said, referring to Monday night’s game, in which the Rangers yielded three third-period goals and gave up three two-goal leads in a 6-5 loss to the rival Rangers. “But I think tonight, we really regrouped and stuck to our game plan and got a good result.”Carolina outshot the Islanders by 18-8 in the second period and by 38-30 over all but could not get past Johnson until Jiri Tlusty’s goal with 8 minutes 46 seconds remaining.Tavares scored his 28th of the season on an empty net with 4:19 remaining.The Islanders outshot the Hurricanes by 14-7 in the first period and could easily have had more than a one-goal lead.
