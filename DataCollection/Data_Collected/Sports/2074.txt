When Thomas Dekenipp’s sister, Lisa, bought him a standing-room-only ticket to the first World Series game at Citi Field on Friday night, it did not feel quite right — and not just because he loves the Yankees.Dekenipp knew that his best friend, Sean Dawson, a die-hard Mets fan, desperately wanted to go but could not afford even the cheapest tickets, the ones that came without a seat, which on the secondary market were running for more than four times their $125 face value.So Dekenipp surreptitiously went to Dawson’s close friends and relatives and asked if they wanted to contribute to an early birthday present. In a matter of days, he had pledges for a little more than half of the $740 ticket that Dawson bought earlier on Friday.“For a Mets fan and a guy with a ginger beard, that’s a lot for a Yankee fan to do,” Dekenipp said, wrapping his arm around Dawson, who wore a pinstriped No. 33 Matt Harvey jersey. “But I had to do it.”
CreditRichard Perry/The New York Times        They were among the boisterous crowd, announced as a Citi Field record of 44,781, that celebrated the Mets’ 9-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals.AdvertisementThe crowd grew so large because of the presence of several thousand standing-room tickets, which allowed fans to stand along the concourses and soak up the atmosphere even if their views were sometimes obstructed and their legs grew tired.AdvertisementThose problems were just part of the bargain, since those tickets cost far less than the ones that came with seats. The average price of Game 3 tickets peaked at $1,183 on StubHub and $1,897.42 on TiqIQ.“Almost all Major League Baseball ballparks now offer S.R.O. tickets for high-demand games,” said Cameron Papp, a spokesman for Stubhub.com. “Both Kansas City and New York have offered S.R.O. tickets for the playoffs. Teams have started offering them for the regular-season games as well. If a game sells out, there’s a good chance the team will offer S.R.O. tickets.”Standing-room tickets are also becoming available for other entertainment events, serving the dual purpose of increasing revenue and creating opportunities for people to see events they might not otherwise be able to afford. Many of Broadway’s most popular plays sell standing-room tickets, including “Hamilton” ($40), “King Charles III” ($37) and “Book of Mormon” ($27), whose average ticket price of $170 has long been the highest on Broadway.On Friday, fans offered an array of reasons for buying standing-room tickets.For Freddy Schultz, it was a business decision. He had bought five-ticket strips for his family for the entire playoffs at Citi Field, and sold all of his Game 3 tickets — which had cost him $1,100 — for $4,500.The family will go together on Saturday night.“I paid my American Express bill,” said Schultz, who spent $500 on a standing-room ticket. “When I left today, my daughter said, ‘You’re going without me?’ That’s right, Sadie.”As Schultz craned his neck over several rows of fans standing in the right-field corner, he chatted with Shannon McPartland and Kristin McGarrigle, sisters who bought standing-room tickets for $600. McPartland invited her sister when her husband, a Yankees fan, did not want to go.She enjoyed her sister’s company, although having her 6-foot-9 husband would have been useful. “I could have sat on his shoulders,” said McPartland, who is 5-5.AdvertisementThere were many options and vantage points for fans with standing-room tickets. The concourses along the field level, especially the ones closest to home plate, were the most crowded, with the ushers having difficulty keeping the aisles clear. In the upper deck down the right-field line, elbow room and clearer views were ample.There was a communal sense of bonhomie.Don McKay, who attended the game with his 12-year-old son Kayle, said that when they were standing deep in a crowd behind home plate, several fans pulled his son up to the front so he could have a clear view.“That’s what New Yorkers are all about,” said McKay, whose son received the tickets as a gift from his doctor after recovering from a brain tumor.“We’re so grateful,” McKay said. “It’s almost like a bucket-list thing.”As the game progressed, the McKays moved into the upper deck in right field, just beyond the foul pole. Down below, along the Shea Bridge in right field, the crowd was more raucous. The Mets fan known as Cowbell Man banged his bell to prompt “Let’s go, Mets” chants, and when Curtis Granderson launched a two-run homer that put the Mets ahead for good, 4-3, fans on the bridge erupted — screaming, hugging and high-fiving one another.Earlier, there had been some tense moments, when the Royals took a 1-0 lead in the first inning and answered David Wright’s two-run homer with two runs of their own in the second to take a 3-2 lead.“Kansas City’s too good,” one fan said to Enissa Perez and Theresa Haley, who bought standing-room tickets several days ago for $450 apiece.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They did not mind not having seats, especially on a night when the game-time temperature was 52 degrees.Advertisement“Plus, you can jump up and down without getting in anyone’s way,” Perez said.There was plenty for Mets fans to jump up and down about the rest of the night, from miscues by the Royals’ fielders to a key pinch hit by Juan Uribe to four R.B.I. by Wright, the team captain.Charlie Case, a self-described lifelong Mets fan, did not want to say how much he had paid for his standing-room ticket. “It’s a little embarrassing,” he said.The decision to attend the game was a last-minute impulse, but after years of watching bad baseball at Citi Field, Case had dreamed of this moment — the Mets’ first World Series appearance since 2000 and their second in 29 years. Case, an avid follower of the band Pearl Jam, said splurging for the ballgame was similar to shelling out lots of money for a special concert.There was, though, a difference.“When you go to a show, you pretty much know what you’re going to get,” Case said. “This is more of all or nothing. It feels pretty lousy when the Mets lose.”And when they win? It feels like the best seat in the house — even without one.Michael Paulson contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on November 1, 2015, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: No Seat, but Plenty of Reason to Cheer.
