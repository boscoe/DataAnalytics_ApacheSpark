He stayed in my mind long after I left Tulane for his warm nature, his intelligence and openness, and his commitment to Jewish learning.When I heard years later that he had emigrated to Israel and continued his athletic career, I was not surprised, for he had been mature, a real mensch, in a way most of the freshmen were not. To read of the attack and killings now, and the timidity with which the Olympic authorities still view making proper recognition of this immense loss, makes me remember David Berger even more sadly yet vividly in his quiet dorm room in McBride Hall under the Spanish moss trees of Tulane.DR. MARK BERNHEIM, Oxford, OhioTo the Sports Editor:I take issue with your headline, “Hidden Details Reveal Munich Attackers’ Cruelty,” Dec. 2. What is described in the story goes far beyond cruelty and is best defined as vicious depravity. Sadly, the athletes who were savagely and mercilessly tortured and killed in the attack remain without Olympic remembrance. It is past time to revisit this lapse and honor them in 2016.MARINA EIN, WashingtonLosing Games, Not MoneyTo the Sports Editor:Re “Little Progress With 76ers’ Process,” Dec. 3: Michael Powell discussed the Philadelphia 76ers’ lack of progress since the private equity investor Josh Harris purchased the team in 2011 for $280 million and the team president, Sam Hinkie, has “sold off assets like cheap suits” and “has yet to build anything of value.” They had a record-setting 28 total losses in a row and started this season with an 18-game losing streak. In spite of this, the team is now worth $700 million, according to Forbes, and Harris has more than doubled his investment in four years. It seems that he believes he has more of a fiduciary responsibility to his investors than a moral obligation to the fans and the city of Philadelphia.As a basketball fan, I am appalled by this. As a sports enthusiast, I am dismayed by this. But I am also disheartened that I was not one of Mr. Harris’s investors.MICHAEL STILLMAN, Waccabuc, N.Y.Turn to Women to Clean Up FIFATo the Sports Editor:Re “More Charges Envelop FIFA,” Dec. 4: Who says that FIFA can be controlled by men only? In every story I read about FIFA corruption, men are named as the perpetrators.Not one woman’s name has appeared in any story I have read — despite the fact that there are so many great women athletes in the world in so many sports, not just soccer. Men have bathed FIFA in filth as they prospered and gave millions to each other. It’s time for women to start applying for those FIFA leadership jobs and straightening out the status of the most beautiful game in the world.BARBARA GRIMALDI, Rockaway, N.J.Advertisement
