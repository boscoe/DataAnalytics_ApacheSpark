The N.F.L. announced its Pro Bowl teams Tuesday, naming the top players as determined by the votes of fans, players and coaches. Not surprisingly, players on the best teams tended to fare better than players on weaker teams, particularly at positions where few individual statistics are recorded.Two “special teamers” were selected to represent the best special-teams players aside from punters, kickers and return specialists. The two selections this year happen to play for the New England Patriots (Matthew Slater) and the Arizona Cardinals (Justin Bethel), teams with two of the three best records in the N.F.L.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ Bobby Rainey leads all players in special-teams fumble recoveries (with four), and the Cleveland Browns’ Johnson Bademosi leads all players with 16 special-teams tackles. But it is easier to argue that special-teams players on a good team are more valuable than those on a bad one.The 86 Pro Bowl players play on teams that have an average winning percentage of .640. That is based on an average winning percentage of .612 for offensive players, .685 for defensive players, and .580 for special teams.
            The average winning percentage for the players who made the pro bowl at each position.        Since fewer statistics are recorded for defensive players than offensive players, and defensive stars are more likely to accumulate the few statistics that they can achieve when playing with a lead (such as sacks and interceptions), it makes sense that voters chose defensive players on better teams.AdvertisementAt a position like running back, it is easier for a player to stand out on a losing team. The Buffalo Bills’ LeSean McCoy, the St. Louis Rams’ Todd Gurley and the Buccaneers’ Doug Martin were three of the six running backs named to the Pro Bowl, and all three play on teams with 6-8 records entering the weekend. A fourth, Devonta Freeman, plays for the 7-7 Atlanta Falcons.AdvertisementPerhaps more interesting is that the teams of the players selected at offensive tackle have an average winning percentage of .417; the only position with a worse average winning percentage was punter. Part of this is because offensive tackles cannot make an offense: An elite left tackle is not going to help a team win games if the quarterback or receivers are below average. In some ways, a top-notch offensive lineman is only as valuable as the players he is protecting.Another reason, though, is that offensive tackles are routinely selected year after year based on reputation. The six offensive tackles selected to the Pro Bowl were the Browns’ Joe Thomas (nine Pro Bowls), the Philadelphia Eagles’ Jason Peters (eight), the San Francisco 49ers’ Joe Staley (who made his fifth straight Pro Bowl), the Washington Redskins’ Trent Williams (fourth straight Pro Bowl), the Dallas Cowboys’ Tyron Smith (third straight Pro Bowl) and the Cincinnati Bengals’ Andrew Whitworth (second career Pro Bowl, but a second-team All-Pro selection in 2014). The 49ers, the Eagles and the Cowboys are having down years, but that did not stop Staley, Peters, and Smith from receiving their customary Pro Bowl nods. As for Thomas, he has made the Pro Bowl in each of his nine seasons in the league, but the Browns have never made the playoffs during his career.At quarterback, the six selections play on teams with at least nine wins. It is never quite clear which way the causation arrow runs (are they great quarterbacks because their teams win, or do their teams win because they are great quarterbacks?), but no position is judged by wins and losses quite like quarterback. The only offensive position with a higher average winning percentage than quarterback was tight end. There, the Patriots’ Rob Gronkowski and the Carolina Panthers’ Greg Olsen were obvious choices, but players like Delanie Walker (76 receptions, 935 yards, six touchdowns for the Tennessee Titans) and Gary Barnidge (68 receptions, 930 yards, nine touchdowns for the Browns) were passed over for tight ends on winning teams: the Bengals’ Tyler Eifert (48/564/12) and the Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce (65/822/4).A version of this article appears in print on December 25, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: Team Record Is Often the Key Statistic for Pro Bowl Candidates.
