Chiefs (8-5) at Ravens (4-9)1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 7.5The Chiefs are on the verge of an eighth consecutive win, but as of this writing they do not know which Baltimore quarterback to prepare for: Matt Schaub, Jimmy Clausen or Ryan Mallett. The good news for Kansas City is that none of them are hard to prepare for. The Chiefs are the first team to go 7-0 after a 1-5 start since the 1970 Cincinnati Bengals, and while much of their success seems artificial, coming against weak opponents, the playoff tickets they will probably be printing will be real.PICK: ChiefsWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
