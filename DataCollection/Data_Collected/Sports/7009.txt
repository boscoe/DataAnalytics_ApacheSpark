Her first was at last year’s United States Open, in which she lost to Serena Williams after beating Bouchard in the fourth round.Halep, a Romanian who was last year’s French Open runner-up, was under pressure from Makarova’s array of strong forehand shots to all areas of the court. Serving at 5-3 in the first set, Halep saved two set points, but Makarova clinched the opener on the third when Halep netted a backhand.Makarova broke Halep’s serve to open the second set, helped by a double fault. Makarova saved three break points in the next game to lead by 2-0 and then broke Halep again before shutting her out the rest of the way.Makarova, 26, has had her best Grand Slam results at Melbourne Park, advancing to the quarterfinals in two of the past four years and to the fourth round in the other two. Last year, she lost to the eventual champion Li Na in the fourth round, and both quarterfinal losses were to Sharapova.“I love this court — I’m so happy I came through,” Makarova said. “Before in the quarterfinals, was never sure about the semis, but now I’m there.”Two men’s quarterfinals were set for later Tuesday. Rafael Nadal was scheduled to take on Tomas Berdych, and Andy Murray was to play the local favorite Nick Kyrgios.Kyrgios, 19, beat then-No. 1 Nadal in the fourth round at Wimbledon last year. In the fourth round this year, Kyrgios defeated Andreas Seppi, who had knocked Roger Federer out of the tournament.Kyrgios is the first male player since Federer in 2001 to have reached two Grand Slam quarterfinals as a teenager.Advertisement
