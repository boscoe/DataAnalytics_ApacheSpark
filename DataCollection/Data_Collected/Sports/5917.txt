Drew is expected to play mostly second base in 2015, as the Yankees continue to groom the prospects Jose Pirela and Rob Refsnyder.The performances of the three players in spring training and beyond will probably dictate how they are used. Drew could start the season as the everyday second baseman or be used in a platoon or in a utility role if one of the prospects performs well.A shortstop by trade, the lefty-swinging Drew can also back up Didi Gregorius, the shortstop who was acquired in a trade from the Arizona Diamondbacks.Drew, who turns 32 on March 16, is coming off a miserable season, in which he batted only .162 in 85 games for the Red Sox and the Yankees after not beginning his season until June 2. He was traded to the Yankees on July 31 for Kelly Johnson and had only 38 total bases in 46 games, including three home runs.Advertisement
