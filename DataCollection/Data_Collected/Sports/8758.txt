Anthony Mason died at 48 on a day when St. John’s beat Georgetown, a season-affirming victory of 1980s vintage. That happened to be the time when a teenage Mason was growing into his muscular body, setting out on the long and winding road to Madison Square Garden from Springfield Gardens High School in Queens.This was no simple journey, in part because Mason never made it very easy on himself. Unlike Spock, he was never the first officer of his emotions, much less the captain. But as a Knick for a portion of those 1990s years affectionately remembered as the Patrick Ewing era, Mason was, if only between the lines, much more than a role player and certainly more of a consummate New Yorker than James L. Dolan could ever dream of being.He was loud. He was tough. He was, in so many respects, self-made.Along the way to becoming the N.B.A.’s Sixth Man of the Year in 1994-95, from Tennessee State to a couple of short-lived stays in Denver and New Jersey, Mason was just another guy beating around the basketball bushes, toiling for the Long Island Surf of the United States Basketball League.In late June 1991, an overflow crowd filled a gymnasium in Old Westbury, mostly for Lloyd Daniels, a New York prodigy whose walks on the wild side made Mason look like a choirboy. Daniels had been neck deep in trouble, shot three times in May 1989 over money taken from a teenager to buy drugs. Playing for the Miami Tropics, he was determined to put on a show, catch the eye of an N.B.A. scout.AdvertisementHis body was too soft, too spent. He withered in the brutish presence of the 6-foot-7, 235-pound Mason, whose 36 points more than caught and held eye of Fuzzy Levane, who worked for the Knicks.“I went way back with Fuzzy, had watched him play when I was 5 or 6,” Ed Krinsky, who was the general manager of the Surf, said in a telephone interview. “I had told him that Anthony’s problems were mostly attributable to his personality, but that I really believed he could play in the N.B.A. He was a huge guy with backcourt skills. Fuzzy came and saw for himself.”Soon Mason was on the Knicks’ summer league roster, getting a chance under the watchful eye of the new coach, Pat Riley.Advertisement“Riley was in the stands, behind the bench, and Anthony supposedly pulled down a rebound, dribbled the length of the floor and dunked on some 7-footer,” said Mason’s longtime agent, Don Cronson.It was the start of a beautiful and dysfunctional relationship.“Anthony Mason, in many ways, was Pat Riley,” Cronson said.He at least fit the brawny style that the real Riley — the scrappy kid from Schenectady in upstate New York, not the moussed man from Los Angeles — branded at the Garden. Mason and John Starks brought a survivor’s resolve, along with an edginess that occasionally went beyond the coach’s teachings.Courtside observers couldn’t help noticing how Mason would avoid eye contact with Riley while listening to his exhortations on the bench. Armchair psychology though it may be, it was Mason’s mother, Mary, who was his guiding light, to the day he died. Yielding to a male authority figure was never his thing.Riley would complain to Cronson about Mason’s intransigence. Cronson would tell Mason, “At the end of the day, he’s the boss.” Mason would nod. With him and Riley, ultimate peace was as elusive as it is in the Middle East.“It all came to a head when I was out in Phoenix at a college all-star thing and Anthony pops off in the papers about Charles Smith,” Cronson said, referring to a player Mason believed was getting minutes he deserved. “Riley goes ballistic and suspends him. What does Anthony do? He shows up to the next game. People told me you could see the veins bulging in Riley’s neck.“Now I’m in the car, driving to Sedona, stopping at every other gas station in the days before cellphones. I’m calling Ernie Grunfeld. I’m calling Dave Checketts. I call Anthony and say, ‘You have to apologize.’ He’s cursing and screaming, ‘I’m not apologizing.’ But you know what? They needed him for the playoffs.”Riley wound up leaving town before Mason did, but the Knicks ultimately traded him, after five years, to Charlotte in 1996 for Larry Johnson.

Agins/The New York Times        Mason returned to the Garden with the Hornets for the 1997 playoffs with “Only 1 Judge” carved into the side of his head, part of his standard barbershop communications routine.AdvertisementMason was behaviorally indulgent (he also had issues away from Garden, some with the law), so few could resist rendering occasional judgment. But time had its soothing effects. For all their squabbling, Riley brought Mason to Miami in 2000.And the last decade and a half of Knicks’ misery has elevated all those who came before, who made the Garden on many a playoff night feel like the center of the pro basketball universe.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Cronson, the Surf’s Krinsky and many others had warned him about potential consequences. Mason was stubborn. He was going to do things his way.But for all his flaws, for all that he missed growing up, Cronson said Mason was also a doting father to his sons, Anthony Jr., who played at St. John’s, and Antoine, currently at Auburn.So Saturday’s game — an 81-70 St. John’s victory, the Red Storm’s 20th of the season and one that may have secured the first N.C.A.A. tournament bid for a once-vaunted senior class — was preceded by a moment of silence for the man known around New York as Mase.Then it was the Knicks’ turn before hosting the Toronto Raptors on Saturday night at the Garden. They would remember the brawny, funky southpaw from Queens who willed his way onto basketball’s Broadway.Phil Jackson could do worse than finding another Anthony Mason or two as he tries to rebuild the Knicks, turn back the clock.A version of this article appears in print on March 1, 2015, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: An Edgy Knick, True to the City.
