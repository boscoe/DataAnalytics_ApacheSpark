Vantiv Entertainment Solutions, a major financial transaction processor, told its daily fantasy sports clients, including DraftKings and FanDuel, that it “must require you to immediately stop accepting players from New York” in light of the cease-and-desist order from the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, according to people familiar with the email correspondence at two daily fantasy sports companies operating in New York.Mr. Eccles said discussions with payment companies were “dynamic” and continuing, but he declined to comment further on that topic. He said that FanDuel had five business days, or by early next week, to respond to the attorney general’s demand and that his company would continue to let New Yorkers participate in its contests in the meantime.A spokesman for DraftKings also said the company would continue to allow New Yorkers to participate until the deadline.“By its plain terms, the attorney general’s letter, which was provided without notice, provides us five days to respond,” a statement provided by a DraftKings spokesman said. “We are evaluating all of our options in order to permit New Yorkers to continue playing the daily fantasy sports games they love. Under applicable law, the attorney general cannot and should not shut down daily fantasy sports through fiat and heavy-handed threats without first seeking a court order.”New York is not only the multibillion-dollar industry’s largest market but also its most influential because it is the headquarters of the major sports leagues and of many of the media companies and hedge funds that have invested and partnered with FanDuel and DraftKings to help power their explosive growth. What happens in the state will weigh heavily on lawmakers in nearly a dozen other states that are considering some form of fantasy sports legislation.Last month, Nevada regulators ruled that daily fantasy sports should be considered gambling and ordered fantasy companies to suspend operations until they secured gambling licenses. FanDuel and DraftKings left the state without a fight.In New York, however, the two companies have more than 1.1 million active users combined, a figure that makes up 12.8 percent of the daily fantasy sports market, according to Eilers Research. California is second at 9.8 percent. Adam Krejcik, a managing director at Eilers, said losing New York would cost FanDuel and DraftKings a combined $384 million in entry fees and about $35 million in revenue per year.“If they have to pull out, it sets a negative precedent and would be extremely troubling for the industry,” Mr. Krejcik said. “They could withstand the pullout of Nevada. They can’t afford to leave New York.”Legal experts said that under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, when a state says that a sports website is offering gambling services unlawfully, the onus is on payment providers like Vantiv to prohibit restricted transactions or risk steep civil or criminal punishments. Sarah Jane Hughes, an expert on banking and payment systems and a professor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law, said banks and credit card companies would be compelled to follow Vantiv and quit doing business with daily fantasy sports companies in New York. They would not risk losing the business of retail companies like Amazon and others that provide online services, Ms. Hughes said.“The transaction providers are the ones in the hot seat,” she said. “The banks have no option but to block payments if the individual is in a state that makes the gambling unlawful. Until these sites get proper licensing — which can be hard to come by — payment providers will have no choice but to cut the sites off.”Already, the daily fantasy sports sites Draft Ops and Mondogoal have stopped operating in New York.“Until New York passes legislation that clearly declares daily fantasy sports legal or DraftKings and FanDuel receive some declaratory ruling from a court of law that makes it safe to operate, we think it is wise not to operate within the state,” Draft Ops said in a statement.Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, the attorney general, said: “We are pleased by reports that several daily fantasy sports operators have decided to comply with the law and cease gambling operations in New York. We urge FanDuel and DraftKings to follow this example by immediately meeting the terms of the attorney general’s letter and by ending their illegal gambling enterprise — and the economic and public health harms that come with it — here in New York.”Nellie Drew, a University at Buffalo sports law professor, said the New York attorney general’s ruling should give pause to the professional sports leagues. Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and companies like Comcast, NBC and Google are among the investors at FanDuel and DraftKings. Nearly every N.F.L. team has a sponsorship deal with DraftKings or FanDuel, and two owners — Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots — have equity stakes in DraftKings.“This puts them in a very difficult position — do you go on record as supporting daily fantasy sports, which the attorney general’s office says is gambling?” said Ms. Drew, who served as outside counsel for the N.H.L. and as a lawyer for the Buffalo Sabres in the 1990s. Mark Zwillinger, a lawyer representing FanDuel, said he hoped to convince Mr. Schneiderman within the allowed five-day period that his analysis of daily fantasy sports did not fit the definition of gambling under New York law. If not, Mr. Zwillinger said, FanDuel will let the courts decide. “This is the beginning of a legal process,” he said, “and not the end of it.”Advertisement
