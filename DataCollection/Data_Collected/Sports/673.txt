Week 5 scores and highlightsEach year, it seems, people write off Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, saying that this will be the year he begins to fall off, and each year he and his odd shot put throwing motion seem to prove his doubters wrong. This season is no exception. Despite playing behind a badly depleted offensive line, Rivers remains one of the game’s best readers of defenses. After last week’s game in Cleveland, several Browns defenders told the news media that they felt as if Rivers knew exactly what they were planning on the field.“There were a lot of situations where he was kind of seeing what we were doing and making adjustments,” Browns linebacker Paul Kruger said. Cornerback Tramon Williams said, “He knew a lot of things we were doing.”Rivers will have another tool in his tool chest this week with the return of Antonio Gates, who served a four-game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs.The Steelers are hoping Michael Vick will improve after having some time to prepare to be the starting quarterback, a role he was thrust into with only a few days to prepare after Ben Roethlisberger went down with a knee injury in Week 3 and the Steelers had to turn around and face the Ravens on a Thursday night.PICK: CHARGERSAdvertisement
