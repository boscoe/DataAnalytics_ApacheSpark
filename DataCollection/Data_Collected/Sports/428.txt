For much of the year, Alex Rodriguez, Brett Gardner and Mark Teixeira carried the Yankees’ offense. With the season on the line Tuesday night, and Teixeira unable to play because of injury, Rodriguez and Gardner could no longer carry the load, as the Yankees lost to the Houston Astros, 3-0, in the American League’s wild-card game at Yankee Stadium.In an ugly display, Gardner and Rodriguez were a combined 0 for 8 with five strikeouts. Rodriguez flied out in the sixth inning with two runners on base, the Yankees’ best chance to score a run.The results were the culmination of a second half in which both players, and most of the team, struggled to hit consistently.“As a team, we hit a little bit of a wall collectively,” Rodriguez said. “And that’s rare, because usually some guys get hot and some guys get cold, but it seems like all of us hit the wall at the same time. But there’s no excuse. We just didn’t get it done.”AdvertisementFor Gardner, that translated to a batting line of a .206 batting average, .300 on-base percentage and .292 slugging percentage after the All-Star break. In the first half of the season, the numbers were .302/.377/.484. Rodriguez’s decline was less severe, as he continued to hit home runs, but he seemed to wear down as the season went along, playing 151 games, the most since he played 158 in 2007.AdvertisementOn Tuesday, however, the problem was largely their opponent. Astros starter Dallas Keuchel dominated the Yankees all season. Including two regular-season starts and the wild-card game, Keuchel threw 22 shutout innings against the Yankees, leaving batters looking foolish as his pitches danced around the plate.

A cutter came inside on the first pitch, and Rodriguez put his best swing on it. But he flied out to center field, ending the inning.“In that situation, you have to trust the process and kind of disconnect yourself from the result,” Rodriguez said. “You get a good pitch to hit, it’s in that box, and you get your A-swing off and you take your chances. It could have been a double, but it’s an out.”Keuchel decided after Rodriguez’s second at-bat that if he faced him again, he would go right after him with a first-pitch cutter."I knew if I could elevate it or get it middle-in, I had a good shot to just have him pop it up, and luckily that’s what he did," Keuchel said. "But I was playing blackjack there, and it paid off."By Gardner’s fourth at-bat, he had already struck out three times, and when he grounded out to first base, the crowd erupted in boos.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

You try to do all the right things and work your butt off and try as hard as you can, and it’s still a little short. That was our year.”As the night drew to a close, Rodriguez, 40, confirmed that he would be back next season. He hesitated, however, when asked if he thought he could play two more.“At my age, you take it one day at a time,” Rodriguez said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
