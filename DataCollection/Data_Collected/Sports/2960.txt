Saints (4-5) at Redskins (3-5)1 p.m. Line: Saints by 1N.F.L. Week 10 scores and highlightsThe Saints were dealt a major setback last week, losing by 34-27 in overtime to the Titans. New Orleans entered the game having won three in a row after a dreadful start to pull even at .500. The Saints were in command of the game early, but a bumbled potential interception that led to a fluky touchdown by Tennessee gave the Titans new life and swung the momentum. It was the type of loss so devastating that it has the potential to derail a team’s season, so it will be interesting to see how New Orleans responds.The Redskins are still in the thick of it in the weak N.F.C. East, and Kirk Cousins could have the game of his life against a Saints defense that has given up 83 points and 899 yards in its last two games.PICK: RedskinsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
