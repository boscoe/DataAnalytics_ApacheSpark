The same thing happened during the era when Michael Schumacher and Ferrari dominated, and the rules-making body changed rules in order to dent the domination.As in those days, last year there was a great deal of lobbying for change by certain teams — including Ferrari — that did not perform as well as Mercedes in building cars to the new specifications. Those teams are desperately seeking a second chance under a new set of rules and regulations.Ferrari, as it turned out, chose the day of the meeting in Geneva — Feb. 17 — to present a new concept for a Formula One car of the future that will look and sound more macho and sexy, with more elaborate wings and larger tires, and that will not require a complete overhaul of the rules.“Would it be possible to come up with an F1 car which not only is technologically advanced, but also captivating to the eye and aggressive-looking?” Ferrari asked on its website in introducing the new design with computer graphic images of the car. “And could this be made without having to overturn the current technical rules? At Ferrari, we believe so. Minimal changes give the car a look that is way different from what we have been familiar with so far. Our challenge was to create something that was — to put it short — better looking.”In fact, the 2015 cars are already better looking than last year’s, thanks to a rewriting of the technical regulation regarding the car’s nose, which has ensured that the many ugly noses of last year have been replaced by a more uniform and attractive snout.But the truth behind the so-called need to spice up the rules is the difficulty that the teams are having in swallowing the Mercedes domination. The Renault, Honda and Ferrari engines are considered so far behind the Mercedes version that a quick fix to alter the status quo seems far from possible.One of the proposals for the immediate future was to drop the new single-turbo, six-cylinder engine introduced last year to return to an eight-cylinder engine but with a double turbo and 1,000 horsepower, which would also increase the noise element.But every loser in the new formula has his own complaint about the current rules.“The chassis regulations have become overrestricted,” said Adrian Newey, designer of the Red Bull that won four straight titles until the superior Mercedes engine dethroned the team last year. “The problem for us is that the cars all look the same, and it’s difficult to differentiate from my point of view as designer, difficult to find new avenues.”As it stands, the series has made hardly any rules changes this season, after suggesting some vast changes — such as stopping the race and lining cars up on the grid for a restart after each use of the safety car when marshals must clean up debris from an accident — only to have most of them rejected in the end.The main changes in the rules this year include:Power units  Each driver may use only four power units (the hybrid engine) during the season. Should a driver exceed that, he will be handed a grid penalty.Power unit penalties  The replacement of a complete power unit no longer results in an automatic penalty; instead, penalties are applied cumulatively based on the individual components of each power unit. Unlike in 2014, grid penalties no longer extend to the next event. If a driver is unable to take his full grid penalty, the remainder will be applied as a time penalty at the relevant Grand Prix.New penalties  In addition to the five-second penalty introduced for 2014, race stewards also have the option to hand out 10-second penalties for minor infringements in 2015.Points  Double points will no longer be applied for the last race of the season, as was the case last year.Virtual safety car  To improve safety, especially during double-waved yellow flags, a virtual safety car system will be used to ensure that drivers slow sufficiently. This system can be used to neutralize a race without having to introduce the safety car itself.Race suspensions  Drivers must proceed slowly into the pit lane, rather than back onto the starting grid, if the race is suspended.Clearing the grid  A driver will be forced to start from the pit lane if any member of his team, or any relevant piece of equipment, remains on the starting grid after the 15-second signal has been given.Unsafe releases  Unsafe releases of a car during a pit stop will be punished by an automatic 10-second stop-and-go penalty for the driver. Additional penalties may be imposed at the stewards’ discretion.Minimum weight  The car’s minimum weight has been increased by 10 kilograms, or 22 pounds: Without fuel, each car must weigh at least 702 kilograms.Cockpit safety  The Zylon anti-intrusion panels on both sides of the survival cell have been extended upward to the rim of the cockpit and alongside the driver’s head.Testing  There will be two in-season two-day tests, down from four in 2014. Two of the four days must be reserved for new young drivers.It was also announced two weeks ago that drivers would no longer be able to change the design of their helmet whenever they wanted to. Changing helmets at will had made it difficult for fans — and even specialists — to recognize a driver by the design and color of his helmet.That new, seemingly unimportant rule did not go down well with everyone, however, including Alexander Wurz, a former Formula One driver.On his Twitter account, Wurz said: “I am a fan of consistency, BUT SERIOUSLY! what’s next? rules on haircut?”Advertisement
