The Warriors’ defense, the league’s best, smothered Anthony Davis and the Pelicans, thrilling a gold-shirt-wearing crowd that rocked and roared all afternoon.The Warriors led by 15 after the first quarter, by 18 at halftime and by 25 late in the third quarter. The Pelicans closed the gap to 4 points in the final minute behind Davis, who scored 20 of his 35 points in the fourth quarter, making the contest seem closer than it was.Game 2 is scheduled for Monday night in Oakland, where the Warriors have won 19 straight games.Davis shot 13 of 23 from the floor and grabbed seven rebounds in his playoff debut. Quincy Pondexter scored 20 points, and Eric Gordon added 16 for the Pelicans, who shot 42.2 percent.Pelicans guard Tyreke Evans left in the first half with a bruised left knee and did not return.WIZARDS 93, RAPTORS 86 Paul Pierce scored 5 of his 20 points in overtime, and Nene had 12 points and 13 rebounds as Washington beat host Toronto in the opener of their first-round playoff series.Pierce hit a 3-pointer, his fourth of the game, to begin the extra session, further tormenting a Raptors team he helped eliminate in last year’s playoffs while playing for the Nets.Bradley Beal scored 16 points, and John Wall and Kevin Seraphin each had 10 for the Wizards.Amir Johnson scored 18 points, and DeMar DeRozan had 15 for the Raptors, who have yet to win the opening game of a first-round series in seven postseason appearances. The Raptors’ only Game 1 win came against Philadelphia in the second round of the 2001 playoffs.“It takes the pressure off us and puts it on them now,” Pierce said of winning on the road to start the series.Toronto is scheduled to host Game 2 on Tuesday night.Washington held a double-digit lead in the second half, but Greivis Vasquez, who took over after the All-Star Kyle Lowry fouled out, tied the score at 82-82 by hitting a 3-pointer with 25 seconds left.Neither team scored again until Pierce made a 3-pointer 36 seconds into overtime, the first basket in a 7-0 Wizards run. Toronto missed seven straight shots before a DeRozan dunk with 29 seconds left.ROCKETS 118, MAVERICKS 108 James Harden had 24 points, and Corey Brewer scored 13 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter to lead host Houston past Dallas in Game 1 of their Western Conference series.Dirk Nowitzki had 24 points for the Mavericks, who are in the playoffs for the 14th time in the last 15 seasons.Advertisement
