Jacksonville Jaguars (1-2) at Indianapolis Colts (1-2)1 p.m. Line: Colts by 10The Colts were on the ropes against Tennessee last week and on the verge of an 0-3 start. Andrew Luck then threw two touchdown passes in a span of 56 seconds in the fourth quarter, winning the game and reminding everyone how good he can be. The team still has a losing record, and Luck is scraping the bottom of the barrel among N.F.L. quarterbacks with a 65.0 rating, but one quarter of playing well was enough for Indianapolis to be double-digit favorites against Jacksonville. It is hard to say if that says more about the quality of the Colts or the irrelevance of the Jaguars.Pick: ColtsWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
