Newton and the Panthers charged back to take a lead with just 32 seconds remaining, holding on to win 27-23.In a tightly-contested first half, with tensions high on both sides, the Seahawks’ secondary appeared impenetrable, with Newton completing just 4 of 12 passes for 46 yards. A first-quarter interception by Earl Thomas helped set up a field goal that gave Seattle its first lead.It was more of the same at the beginning of the second half, with Kam Chancellor also intercepting a pass, but the Panthers regrouped and reeled off three consecutive 80-yard touchdown drives at the end of the game to overtake Seattle. Jonathan Stewart finished off two of the drives with 1-yard touchdown runs and Newton threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Greg Olsen to give Carolina the lead.A primary reason for Carolina’s undefeated start to the season has been the efficiency of Newton, but playing in the hostile environment of CenturyLink Field was a lot to ask of any quarterback. In his career, Newton had been 0-3 against the Seahawks, with just 437 yards and 1 touchdown in three starts.After the rough start today, Newton finished the game 20 of 36 for 269 yards with 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions.The loss by Seattle, which dropped the two-time defending N.F.C. champions to 2-4, wasted a strong effort by Jimmy Graham. The star tight end, acquired in an offseason trade, has had a somewhat disappointing start to his season but finished today’s game with season highs of 8 receptions for 140 yards.Advertisement
