PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. —  On Monday afternoon, after the Mets were drubbed by the Miami Marlins in an exhibition game, the owner Fred Wilpon dropped by Manager Terry Collins’s office for more than 20 minutes to discuss the Mets’ roster. Afterward, Collins spoke to reporters; Wilpon did not, although that is nothing new.In recent years, Wilpon has generally avoided making any public comments about his team, which has not had a winning season since 2008. There have been a few exceptions to Wilpon’s silence, most notably the spring training news conferences a few years back in which a sometimes pugnacious Wilpon maintained that he was not selling the team amid the financial stress created by his connection to the Bernard L. Madoff scandal. But those news conferences have stopped.Collins indicated that he and Wilpon had discussed the team’s left-handed relievers and the pitching staff’s high walk total in spring training. Collins declined to name other areas of the team that might concern Wilpon.“He expects it to be a much better team,” Collins said of Wilpon. “There’s no doubt about that. He told me two weeks ago, ‘Look, I’m going to be here a lot — a lot.’ ”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
