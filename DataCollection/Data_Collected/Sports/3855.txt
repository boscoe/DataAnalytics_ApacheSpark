1. Steelers (6-4) at Seahawks (5-5)4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 3.5In Thomas Rawls’s college career, which he split between Michigan and Central Michigan, he ran for more than 100 yards in a game only five times in four years. In 10 N.F.L. games, only four of which he has started, Rawls, 22, has done it three times.Last week, he became the sixth-youngest running back since 1960 to run for 200 yards in a game in which he exploded for 209 in a 29-13 victory over San Francisco. He also had a career-high 46 yards receiving, giving him more than 250 yards from scrimmage. Not bad for a player who went undrafted.While Marshawn Lynch is among the best running backs ever to play, Rawls has been the better option for Seattle for much of this season, and he will get a chance to show if he is capable of being the Seahawks’ primary running back after Lynch was forced to undergo surgery for a sports hernia that could keep him out for several weeks.The first test for Rawls as an every-down back will be a Pittsburgh defense that is ranked fifth in the N.F.L. in rushing yards allowed per game and is tied for seventh in fewest yards allowed per rush. Only two running backs — the Ravens’ Justin Forsett and the Chiefs’ Charcandrick West — have topped 100 yards against the Steelers this season, who have allowed just three rushing touchdowns.AdvertisementRawls seems good enough to challenge the Steelers’ defense, but considering how easily Pittsburgh moved the ball last week despite Ben Roethlisberger’s movement being limited by the use of a padded shoe to protect a sprained left foot, the score may reach a point in which a running back will not be enough to keep Seattle in the game. And if this turns into any sort of shootout, the Steelers, with their outstanding wide receivers, tight ends and running backs, will have the advantage.AdvertisementPick: Steelers2. Patriots (10-0) at Broncos (8-2)8:30 p.m. Line: Patriots by 2.5The records of these teams make the matchup seem far more appealing than it actually is. Tom Brady and the Patriots have looked and acted like a team with a perfect record, but the Broncos could easily be 2-8 rather than 8-2, that if you listen to the litany of criticism from their fans.With Peyton Manning out for at least this week, and plenty of speculation that he may consider retiring in the middle of his 18th season, Brady-Manning XVII has become Brady-Osweiler I, and Brock Osweiler, while quite tall, is not likely up to the task of taking down the mighty Patriots.For Denver to win would require the its superb defense to shut down Brady, and for Osweiler to have the kind of performance he had last week against the Bears, when he did enough to keep the score decidedly in Denver’s favor.Patriots Coach Bill Belichick has often relished the chance to devise a game plan against an inexperienced quarterback, and his pursuit of a second perfect regular season is becoming more realistic every week.Pick: Patriots
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            3. Bills (5-5) at Chiefs (5-5)1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 7When Jamaal Charles tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a Week 5 loss to Chicago, all hope seemed to drain out of the Chiefs. They were 1-4, and their best player was lost for the season. They lost again the next week, and that seemed to be the end of any postseason aspirations.Since then, the Chiefs have been rolling, with their suffocating defense doing much of the dirty work but the offense delivering, too. They have gone 4-0, winning by a combined score of 130-39.The defensive schemes devised by the coordinator Bob Sutton have put significant pressure on opposing quarterbacks, with linebackers Justin Houston and Tamba Hali leading the way with a combined 13 sacks, and the unit has been opportunistic with 14 interceptions and 7 fumble recoveries.AdvertisementThe Bills have most of the pieces to be a top team, and look the part on occasion, but in traveling to Kansas City to face a red-hot opponent, victory seems beyond their reach.Pick: Chiefs4. Vikings (7-3) at Falcons (6-4)1 p.m. Line: EvenOnly 13 teams since 1933 have failed to make the postseason after starting the season 5-0, but Atlanta, losers of four of five games, appear to be trying their hardest to make it 14.Last week, the ship appeared to be righted when Atlanta built a 21-7 lead in the third quarter against Indianapolis, but the veteran quarterback Matt Hasselbeck guided the Colts to a shocking come-from-behind victory that could not have driven home more emphatically the extent of the Falcons’ disarray.With Devonta Freeman, Atlanta’s breakout star at running back, not practicing as of Wednesday in his recovery from a concussion, the hill to climb for a win against Minnesota got that much steeper. Even at home, where quarterback Matt Ryan is usually unstoppable, the Falcons seem vulnerable.Pick: Vikings5. Rams (4-6) at Bengals (8-2)1 p.m. Line: Bengals by 10There is no such thing as a good loss, but having a senseless penalty play a big factor in a defeat has to make the sting that much harder to take. On Monday night, before a prime-time audience, the Bengals stormed back against the Cardinals and had tied the game, but as quarterback Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense worked their way into field-goal range, they got a huge boost when Domata Peko, a defensive tackle for Cincinnati, was penalized for calling out a fake snap count. The free yardage helped set up a winning field goal for Arizona and gave the Bengals their second consecutive loss after starting the season 8-0.After the game, the Bengals were furious about the call, and they may carry some of that emotion into this week. The pieces are all there for Cincinnati to be a top team, but how well they deal with adversity should offer a clue as to how serious they should be taken as a Super Bowl contender.Pick: BengalsThe RestCardinals (8-2) at 49ers (3-7)4:05 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 11.5The last game between these teams was one of the most lopsided in their long history, with Arizona taking advantage of Colin Kaepernick’s sloppy passing to crush their division rival, 47-7. Tyrann Mathieu, one of the defensive backs most responsible for the victory, has gone out of his way to praise Kaepernick’s replacement, Blaine Gabbert, but there is no facet of the game in which the Cardinals do not shine brighter than the 49ers. The lopsided score in Week 3 was very likely an accurate reflection in the talent discrepancy between the teams.Pick: CardinalsRaiders (4-6) at Titans (2-8)1 p.m. Line: EvenCoach Jack Del Rio did an excellent job during the week of describing the issues Oakland has faced when losing three consecutive games despite having built a promising young core of players that includes quarterback Derek Carr, running back Latavius Murray and wide receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree.Advertisement“We could talk about potential; potential doesn’t win games,” Del Rio told reporters. “Production wins games. It’s a bottom-line business. It’s a production-based business. We expect to be better than we were.”Oakland’s defense still has a long way to go to match the reputation of its offense, but this week, the Raiders should score enough that their defensive shortcomings will be less apparent.Pick: RaidersBuccaneers (5-5) at Colts (5-5)1 p.m. Line: Colts by 2.5Only three players from the 1999 N.F.L. draft are still active: Peyton Manning (Round 1, Pick 1), Charles Woodson (Round 1, Pick 4) and Matt Hasselbeck (Round 6, Pick 187). Few players can match the ups and downs of Hasselbeck’s long journey, which began so long ago that the quarterback of the team he is facing this week, Jameis Winston, was 4 years old when Hasselbeck was drafted.The Colts’ Hasselbeck is 3-0 as a starting quarterback this season, but he has a fairly limited repertory, and the absence of the starting left tackle Anthony Castonzo should be enough to tip the scales in Tampa Bay’s favor.Pick: BuccaneersGiants (5-5) at Redskins (4-6)1 p.m. Line: Giants by 2.5The Redskins’ defense makes every running back look like Adrian Peterson, and the Giants’ defense makes every quarterback look like Tom Brady. So picking Giants running back Rashad Jennings and Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins for your fantasy team might be a good idea. As for real-life football, any game between teams in the N.F.C. East is best to avoid, but it might be fun to watch Eli Manning and Hakeem Nicks play together again after Nicks was brought back to help the Giants find some balance on the side of the field opposite Odell Beckham Jr.Pick: GiantsSaints (4-6) at Texans (5-5)1 p.m. Line: Texans by 3The Texans have won three consecutive games, but wins against the Jets and the Titans are not all that hard to come by. The fact remains, however, that the Texans came out of nowhere to beat then-undefeated Cincinnati two weeks ago, and they did it by dragging the Bengals’ offense down to their level. Three wins in a row have pushed Houston from the bottom of the standings into playoff contention.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They have lost six in a row, and last week, with Keenan Allen and Malcom Floyd out, their passing game, usually a strength, struggled to produce.AdvertisementThe Jaguars have won three of four games, and the combination of a home game and a struggling opponent could make it four of five.Pick: JaguarsDolphins (4-6) at Jets (5-5)1 p.m. Line: Jets by 3Both teams have, at times, played like serious contenders. But they have also, at times, looked like they had no business being on an N.F.L. field.This week, the Jets may be without cornerback Darrelle Revis and center Nick Mangold, which, for a team that has lost four of its previous five games, seems almost cruel.The recipe for success will be a steady diet of Chris Ivory running the ball into Miami’s porous front seven. Even without Mangold to help open holes, there should be plenty of room.Pick: JetsPicks do not reflect the betting line.A version of this article appears in print on November 29, 2015, on Page SP4 of the New York edition with the headline: Steelers May Corral Romping Seahawk.
