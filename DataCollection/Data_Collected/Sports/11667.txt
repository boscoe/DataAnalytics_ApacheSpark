The way I look at it is that I have one more year, and I am going to play that one more year and go from there.”The Giants could negotiate an extension of Manning’s current contract, which is set to pay him $17 million in 2015. Or they could wait until after the coming season, and should they not be able to come to terms on a new contract, they could keep him on the roster by designating him as their franchise player for 2016.Manning also said Monday that he had set a goal of limiting himself to about eight interceptions during the 2015 season and completing 70 percent of his passes. Of his interception total, Manning said: “I would like to get that in single digits. I think that is kind of a goal every year — the number is eight. You would obviously like to have zero interceptions, but understanding football and the funny things that can happen, one every two games is the mind-set.” ■ Doug Buffone, 70, a former Chicago Bears linebacker, was found dead of natural causes in his home, the Chicago police said. Buffone played 15 seasons for the Bears and retired after the 1979 season with 24 career interceptions, the most for any Bears linebacker. In recent years, Buffone hosted a Bears postgame radio show with his former teammate Ed O’Bradovich. (AP)Advertisement
