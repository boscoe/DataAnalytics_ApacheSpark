Week 13 scores and highlightsBefore Peyton Manning showed up, the Broncos were a team with a good defense and a quarterback who did not do much but always seemed to come away with a victory. Brock Osweiler may not have the fan base or the hype of Tim Tebow, but in his two games at the helm of the Denver offense, he has had similar results. On Sunday night, he became the first Denver quarterback since Tebow to lead the team back from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit to win (of course, before this season, Manning’s teams were rarely trailing).The switch at quarterback, which has not been declared permanent, has led to a 2-0 record, but it has meant bad things for Demaryius Thomas, who had blossomed into one of the game’s best wide receivers once Manning arrived. Osweiler has targeted him 21 times over the last two weeks, but he has only four receptions to show for it.The formula, however, should not change this week: Denver’s defense will hold down the fort, and Osweiler will have to produce only a modest amount of offense to win.PICK: BRONCOSAdvertisement
