OMAHA —  Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas stood in the middle of the gleeful Wichita State locker room Sunday, a fresh yellow-and-black “Kings of Kansas” T-shirt pulled over his head, and said what many others at CenturyLink Center were thinking:Kansas and Wichita State need to play more often. Not just when they are forced to.“This ought to be regular,” Brownback said after Wichita State’s thrilling 78-65 victory over the Jayhawks in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s round of 32. “We ought to have a preseason tournament, Wichita host it, invite K.U. and Kansas State in alternating years because you don’t need those teams playing each other, and then invite a couple of other teams.”As if it were that easy.Kansas and Wichita State met on Sunday for the first time in 22 years, brought together by serendipity and the N.C.A.A. tournament selection committee, whose creative placement set up this game in the Midwest Region. Kansans had anticipated it for a week, and the game lived up to the attention.The Shockers, after a sluggish start, relied on 3-point shooting to open a double-digit lead in the second half and never let up to eliminate the second-seeded Jayhawks. No. 7-seeded Wichita State (30-4) will play Notre Dame, the No. 3 seed, in the round of 16 on Thursday in Cleveland.One year after the Shockers lost a thriller to Kentucky in the round of 32, they defended Kansas well enough and made 10 of their 20 3-point attempts. Four of the 3-pointers were by Evan Wessel, one of two homegrown Kansans on the team.AdvertisementThousands of yellow-and-black-clad Shockers fans grew louder as the game went along, and they stood and cheered for the final 20 seconds as guard Fred VanVleet dribbled out the clock. After the postgame handshakes, Wichita State Coach Gregg Marshall crossed the court to greet his wife, Lynn, and other family members seated with jubilant Shockers fans.“They were far superior than us in the second half,” said Kansas Coach Bill Self, who opened his remarks by mistakenly congratulating Iowa State, which beat the Jayhawks for the Big 12 tournament title last week. He quickly corrected his error.“They took us out of most everything we wanted to do, and we didn’t help ourselves by not defending in the second half,” Self said.Five Shockers scored in double figures, led by Tekele Cotton, with 19 points, and VanVleet, with 17. Wessel added 12 points and 9 rebounds. Perry Ellis and Devonte’ Graham each scored 17 for Kansas (27-9). Wessel and Ellis grew up together in Wichita and won three state titles at Wichita Heights High School.Kansas led for most of the first half, but a scoring drought over the final 2 minutes 46 seconds allowed Wichita State to sneak ahead, 29-26, on a 3-pointer by VanVleet. Ellis finished the half with his left nostril plugged with cotton after taking a shot in the nose from VanVleet on a drive. A later collision between the two left VanVleet with cramping in his left biceps that affected his dribbling.AdvertisementWichita State stretched the lead to 41-30 with 7 consecutive points early in the second half — a 3-pointer by Wessel, a driving layup by VanVleet and a tip-in by Ron Baker, the other Kansan, in transition. The Jayhawks never came closer than 8 points after that.Before Sunday, the teams had played each other sporadically since their initial meeting, in 1903, and not at all since Jan. 6, 1993, when the Roy Williams-coached Jayhawks routed the Shockers, 103-54, in Lawrence. Wichita State had won only two of the teams’ 12 meetings before Sunday; the first was in the so-called Battle of New Orleans at the 1981 N.C.A.A. tournament, a down-to-the-wire 66-65 victory in the round of 16. After the second Wichita State victory, in 1987, Kansas won the subsequent five by 20 or more points.The separation made some sense because the games had stopped being competitive. Kansas was winning conference titles and advancing deep into the N.C.A.A. tournament, while Wichita State could not get past the first round of the Missouri Valley Conference tournament.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Then Wichita State improved, reaching the round of 16 under Coach Mark Turgeon in 2005-6 before making another jump with Marshall. The 2011 N.I.T. championship proved a springboard to four consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament appearances.Several years ago, Marshall said, he ran into Self at a Rotary Club event in Wichita and suggested that they resume the series. Self laughed, Marshall said, and neither followed up.Wichita State always seeks strong nonconference opponents to boost its Ratings Percentage Index. That is less of a consideration for Kansas, which plays in the Big 12 and had the toughest schedule in Division I the last two seasons. In short, Wichita State needs Kansas more than Kansas needs Wichita State.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I haven’t called them yet.”He continued: “They may want to play now. Who knows? I have no idea. I’m not worried about that. I’m fine letting the series lay the way it is right now. The series is good with me at this point.”It sure was on Sunday.A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Shockers Rule Kansas, and the Jayhawks.
