Porzingis finished with 9 points and 10 rebounds in 21 minutes as the Knicks looked fluid on offense.Carmelo Anthony, in his second preseason game since coming back after knee surgery, scored 21 points while shooting 10 of 15 from the field. In the team’s preseason opener Wednesday night against Bauru of the Brazilian league, Anthony shot 8 of 10. He appears to have confidence in his jump shot.Derrick Williams scored a team-high 23 points off the bench as the Knicks shot 50 percent over all from the field. Arron Afflalo (sore left hamstring) and Kevin Seraphin (sore right knee) did not play. Coach Derek Fisher said Seraphin had experienced swelling. Advertisement
