CHARLOTTE, N.C. —  Travis Trice, a senior guard at Michigan State, received a text message Sunday morning from a former Spartans teammate, Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors: “Don’t let this be your last game.”Trice made sure it was not, scoring 23 points in the afternoon — including a 13-point burst near the start of the game and a crushing 3-pointer late — to lead seventh-seeded Michigan State to a 60-54 East Region victory over Virginia in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s round of 32.Branden Dawson chipped in 15 points, 9 rebounds and 4 blocks while helping the Spartans’ defense hold Virginia to 29.8 percent shooting from the field, including an 11.8 percent mark (2 of 17) from 3-point range.It was the second year in a row that Michigan State ended Virginia’s season.“Stings right now, of course, the finality of the season after we’ve had a heck of a year with these guys, what they’ve done,” Virginia Coach Tony Bennett said. But, he added, “it doesn’t take away, when all the dust settles, what was accomplished.”AdvertisementVirginia (30-4) was ranked among the top five for much of the season and, until two late losses, appeared destined for a No. 1 seed in the tournament. The Cavaliers’ drop to a No. 2 seed led to the rematch with Michigan State, which had defeated Virginia at Madison Square Garden in the round of 16 last year.Some of Virginia’s players had acknowledged noticing the potential matchup when this year’s bracket was revealed, saying they had welcomed it. Most, though, brushed aside the notion that they could get some payback by winning on Sunday. As the junior forward Anthony Gill told reporters, “this isn’t going to be a revenge game, just us going out there and do what we do.”The Spartans had their own motivations. With a loss in the round of 8 last year, that team’s seniors became the first Michigan State class under Coach Tom Izzo to fail to reach at least one Final Four. This year’s group was determined to begin a new streak. Getting by Virginia was merely the next step.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “I think these guys had a lot more to play for than people give them credit,” Izzo said after the Spartans’ win.Trice put Michigan State in control from the start, with his early surge giving the Spartans a 15-4 lead just 5 minutes 31 seconds into the game. In that opening stretch, Trice shot 5 of 5 from the field, going 3 of 3 from 3-point range.Advertisement“Our thing was attack from the get-go — not just myself, everybody,” Trice said.Virginia could not keep up, going 2 of 10 from the field in the first eight minutes.Justin Anderson was back in the Cavaliers’ starting lineup after missing eight games because of a broken finger and an appendectomy and coming off the bench for three games as he returned to game shape. But he and two other top contributors for Virginia, Malcolm Brogdon and Darion Atkins, struggled, and the rest of the Cavaliers could not find their rhythm against Michigan State’s defense, either.“Our defense does lead to our offense, but when you’re having defensive breakdowns and you can’t get stops and you’re having trouble seeing the ball through the net, then you’re going to struggle,” Brogdon said.Still, Michigan State and Trice could not maintain their pace, and the game turned into a defensive grind. Virginia, which entered Sunday leading Division I in points allowed at 51.2 per game, shut down the Spartans’ offense for much of the first half, holding a team known for its fast-break offense to 4 fast-break points before the intermission.Virginia, which trailed by 23-18 at the half, had its best chance to take the lead early in the second half when it had the ball with the score at 24-22. But Brogdon missed a 3 from the wing, and suddenly, the Spartans were on the run again, outscoring the Cavaliers by 8-0 in a little more than a minute.When Virginia closed the gap again to 38-34, Dawson responded with a basket in the lane. And when the Spartans’ lead was back down to 4 with less than six minutes to play, free throws pushed it back to 8.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
