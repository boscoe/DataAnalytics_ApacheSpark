BEAVER CREEK, Colo. — The first ski race I covered was the Olympic women’s downhill in Meribel, France, in 1992, and I watched it from the finish area amid the cheers, the groans and the rubbing shoulders in the close-quarter mixed zone.So it has continued, but after 23 years of staring uphill as great skiers carved their way down, I had the opportunity on Friday to observe from a different vantage point: to look downhill instead and see a championship race from the start.“It’s one of the better views in sport,” said Barry Bryant, a 79-year-old American known as Bear who was the assistant start referee for the men’s giant slalom at the 2015 Alpine world ski championships.The truth is that it can be hard to see the forest or the trees when the fog is thick or the snow or sleet is coming down sideways. But Friday was not one of those days.AdvertisementBryant got to enjoy the panorama of the Rocky Mountains on a blue-sky afternoon with Grouse Mountain and Larkspur Bowl stretched out before him and a packed grandstand that looked like a scale model in the distance.AdvertisementHe got to see great talents like Ted Ligety and Marcel Hirscher kick out of the start and, fresh and full of ambition, attack the opening slope and the first few gates of the course before dropping quickly — astonishingly quickly — out of sight.“It’s what I live for,” Bryant murmured when the day’s work was done.But as Bryant stood watch in the start house — an inflated white archway that comes from the same architectural tradition as the bouncy castle  — what he could not see was all that was transpiring outside the temporary walls of his domain.He could not see the racers, lips pursed and eyes closed or open, contorting their bodies as they visualized the race and the challenges to come. He could not see them stooping in their boots to grab a handful of snow and then slap it on their necks to stay cool on an unseasonably warm day.“It’s 50 degrees,” Ligety mumbled to Steve Porino, the American television reporter, in what sounded like a complaint.On the World Cup circuit, the challenge at the top often can be staying warm. On Friday, it was quite the contrary, but the racers still warmed up nonetheless. There were push-ups, crunches and planks; sprints up the steep slope just outside the start house. A few earnestly yanked on elastic bands looped around their trainers’ legs — a little too earnestly for Tim Jitloff, the veteran American.“That’s the new trend,” he said. “They’ve got the bands and the trainer, and it’s all kind of ridiculous. I don’t need it. I just do my own thing and stay calm and go for it.”With 60 racers qualified for the second run, there were indeed a world of pregame philosophies on display in the corral that surrounded the start house. The top 30, as usual at world championships, went first on the second run and in reverse order of their first-run finishes.AdvertisementBetween the support staff and the competitors, it made for quite a crowd in a tight space, but the surprise to an outsider was how quiet and orderly it all seemed: more tea ceremony than ready room.There was little chitchat, virtually no tomfoolery except for one lobbed snowball. You could hear the hum of the generator that was keeping the start house inflated and the occasional shouts accompanying a racer’s burst out of the start gate that were not unlike the intermittent shrieks of teenagers jumping off the diving board in a different season.
                Some of the top ski racers in the world describe the sounds of a World Cup downhill.            But in general it was enough to pick up on the subtleties: the slap of the skis as a racer bounced to get himself ready, the thump of the therapist’s palms on a skier’s powerful thighs.“It is very quiet, because it’s a no-joke matter,” Jitloff said. “It’s kind of like the room before you take the test.”Except when you prepare to take the test, the student at the neighboring desk probably was not performing moves that Martha Graham or Twyla Tharp could have choreographed.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Some grip both poles, throw body and artistic soul into the task and work up a sweat.Others, like Ligety, are much closer to Zen as they stand quietly and barely twitch a muscle as they see what is not yet there.“Another thing that’s special with Ted is he does conserve his energy,” said Adam Cole, the start coach for the U.S. Ski Team who was on site on Friday.  “He’s not stressed out for two hours before his run or anything. He’s pretty even keel all the way until we are in the tent.”Half asleep might be a better way of putting it for a man who is viper quick between the gates. But Ligety took his time and then some, whether it was donning his speed suit or his bib or buckling his boots. He took in the view with the crowd gathered around the television monitor that sits just outside the start house.Advertisement“I was staying as relaxed as I possibly could,” said Ligety, even if it did not reflect his inner state. “I know any time I get in the start gate of a giant slalom I have a good chance of winning, and that adds that extra bit of pressure because you are fighting for the title.”He fought particularly well on Friday, and when he finished his remarkable second run, the roar from far below in the valley was obscured by the round of applause from those gathered around the screen up on top, most of whom had very little to gain from Ligety’s excellence.“Maybe it was everyone clapping for what they recognized as a little piece of art,” Porino said. “All I know is I’ve never heard that before.”Only Hirscher, the first-run leader, would have a real crack at drawing a mustache on Ligety’s Mona Lisa.Unlike his rivals, Hirscher had arrived in the start area just a few minutes before his second run: emerging from splendid isolation by way of the women’s downhill course. Once into the enclosure, he shadow boxed and stretched, heard a course report from the Austrian coaches delivered by two-way radio and then another course report as he clicked into his skis at the entry to the start house.He lifted them, first the right and then the left, as a ski technician wiped the bottoms with a cloth. He then slid methodically forward, his eyes fixed on the light-filled space in front of him before he finally heard the countdown and the electronic beep and propelled himself into the arena.Television now shows you so much with Alpine skiing, but it still cannot quite capture the steepness of the pitch or the speed of the racers. Watching Hirscher from this fresh angle, as he leaned hard and sliced past the gates and through the air, he looked computer generated in his wind-tunnel-ready perfection.But the challenge was very real, and when the last and loudest roar rumbled up to those of us whom Hirscher had left behind, it was the roar of an American celebration.A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2015, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Experiencing the View From the Top.
