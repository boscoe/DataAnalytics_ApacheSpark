With Selection Sunday right around the corner, here is a look at some of the top story lines at this week’s major conference tournaments and who should be moving on to the N.C.A.A. tournament.American Athletic ConferenceThursday-Sunday, HartfordLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Cincinnati, Southern MethodistTemple (22-9), with a Dec. 22 rout of Kansas as its best win of the season, could improve its case to make the N.C.A.A. tournament with a strong showing in Hartford. Squandering an opportunity to help its N.C.A.A. prospects, Tulsa (21-9) fell to S.M.U., 67-62, on Sunday in a game that decided the regular-season conference title.Atlantic Coast ConferenceTuesday-Saturday, Greensboro, N.C.Likely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Duke, Louisville, North Carolina, North Carolina State, Notre Dame, VirginiaAdvertisementMiami (20-11) padded its résumé with an 82-61 victory at lowly Virginia Tech on Saturday, but the Hurricanes, whose best win came at Duke on Jan. 13, still need to do well in Greensboro to solidify their case for the N.C.A.A. tournament.AdvertisementAtlantic 10 ConferenceWednesday-Sunday, BrooklynLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Davidson, Dayton, Virginia CommonwealthRichmond (19-12) has won six straight games, including a 67-51 victory over St. Louis on Saturday, but the Spiders will probably miss out on an N.C.A.A. berth unless they win the conference tournament.Big East ConferenceWednesday-Saturday, New YorkLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Butler, Georgetown, Providence, St. John’s, VillanovaAs long as Villanova (29-2) does not lose its first game of this tournament, it should be a No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Xavier (19-12) had a .500 record in conference play, which may be good enough for an N.C.A.A. spot, but winning a couple of games at Madison Square Garden would improve its chances.Big Ten ConferenceWednesday-Sunday, ChicagoLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Iowa, Maryland, Michigan State, Ohio State, Purdue, WisconsinPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Indiana and Illinois, which have identical records (19-12), will need strong showings in Chicago to make a case for an N.C.A.A. spot.Big 12 ConferenceWednesday-Saturday, Kansas City, Mo.Likely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas, Oklahoma, West VirginiaEven with sub-.500 records in conference play, Oklahoma State (18-12, 8-10) and Texas (19-12, 8-10) could make the N.C.A.A. tournament thanks to the strength of the Big 12. Still, they will need to avoid early exits from the conference tournament. On Saturday, the Cowboys lost at West Virginia, 81-72, their fifth defeat in six games. But the Longhorns beat Kansas State, 62-49, for their second win in a row after four straight losses.AdvertisementMountain West ConferenceWednesday-Saturday, Las VegasLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Boise State, San Diego StateColorado State (26-5) ended the regular season on a five-game winning streak. The Rams may have done enough to make the N.C.A.A. tournament, provided they are not quickly eliminated from the conference tournament.Pacific-12 ConferenceWednesday-Saturday, Las VegasLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Arizona, Oregon, UtahArizona (28-3) is still in the mix for a No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament, but it may need to win this tournament first. U.C.L.A. (19-12) probably needs to pick up a couple of wins in Las Vegas to have a chance of making the N.C.A.A. tournament.Southeastern ConferenceWednesday-Sunday, NashvilleLikely N.C.A.A. tournament teams: Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, MississippiNot even the unlikely possibility of an early exit from the conference tournament should prevent Kentucky from being the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Louisiana State (22-9) earned an impressive road win Saturday, an 81-78 victory over Arkansas that bolstered its N.C.A.A. case. Texas A&M (20-10), on the other hand, fell to Alabama, 61-60, its third loss in four games.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
