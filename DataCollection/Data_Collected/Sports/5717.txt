Ravens (10-6) at Steelers (11-5)8:15 p.m. Eastern Line: Steelers by 3 ½Things have not typically gone well for Baltimore when it has traveled to Pittsburgh for a playoff game, but the Ravens caught a gigantic break with Le’Veon Bell unable to play because of a knee injury. A force out of the backfield with 1,361 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, Bell was also Pittsburgh’s second-best receiver, with 83 catches for 854 yards and three touchdowns. Trying to replace all of that production with some combination of Josh Harris, Dri Archer and Ben Tate may make the Steelers regret sending LeGarrette Blount packing this season.Even with Bell out, a win in Pittsburgh will be difficult for the Ravens. Baltimore was 6-10 on the road over the last two seasons and was embarrassed at Heinz Field in Week 9 when Ben Roethlisberger shredded its secondary for six touchdown passes. The Ravens’ defense can be intimidating, with Elvis Dumervil and Terrell Suggs combining for 29 sacks, but a secondary that has been looking for answers at cornerback all season will have its hands full trying to stop Antonio Brown.As long as the Steelers find someone to run the ball well enough to take some pressure off Roethlisberger, the Steelers should hold off their division rivals.Pick: SteelersA version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: N.F.L.
