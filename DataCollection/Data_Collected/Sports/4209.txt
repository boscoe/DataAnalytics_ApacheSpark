Cardinals (9-2) at Rams (4-7)1 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 7N.F.L. Week 13 scores and highlightsArizona’s season collapsed last year when quarterback Carson Palmer went down with a knee injury. While he remains healthy, the loss of Chris Johnson (broken leg) for the season drastically affects the team’s ability to run the ball. If Andre Ellington is also forced to sit out this week with turf toe, the Cardinals will need the rookie David Johnson to step to the forefront.There is no doubt that Johnson has the potential to make thrilling plays, having scored four rushing touchdowns, three receiving touchdowns and one kick return touchdown in his 11-game career. But he has had ball security issues and may not be ready for an every-down role for a team with Super Bowl aspirations.Meanwhile, Arizona’s defense, which is among the best in the league at stopping the run, will have to face Todd Gurley, the only running back to rush for more than 100 yards in a game against it this season.The loss of Chris Johnson should not be as crippling to the Cardinals’ chances as Palmer’s injury was last season, and the Rams have played poorly enough recently that an upset is unlikely. But seeing how Arizona adapts to the change in offensive personnel will be interesting going forward.PICK: CardinalsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
