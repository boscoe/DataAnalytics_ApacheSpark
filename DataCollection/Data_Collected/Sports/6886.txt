The Nets on Friday morning said Teletovic would remain hospitalized to undergo further examination and begin treatment with blood thinners.“Our first thoughts are with Mirza and his family,” General Manager Billy King said in a statement, praising the team’s medical staff and the emergency room doctors for their work. “I have visited with Mirza this morning and he is in good spirits as he begins his treatment and recovery.”Blood clots can form for a variety of reasons, with long travel and surgical procedures among the most common risk factors. Blood clots near the lungs carry an increased risk of sudden death, said Dr. Alexis C. Colvin, a sports medicine specialist at Mt. Sinai Hospital, who was speaking generally and not about Teletovic’s specific case.Teletovic posted a message on Twitter late Thursday night that read, “I had a small problem, but now everything is ok... Thx all fans from Bosnia, Spain and USA for support.”The struggling Nets will miss Teletovic, who was averaging a career-high 22.3 minutes per game this season. They lost by 39 points to the Clippers, and their record dropped to 18-25. They had already been missing point guard Deron Williams, who fractured a left rib earlier this month.Regarding possible additions to the roster, King said the team would “explore all of the options available to us.”In 40 games, Teletovic, a shooting specialist, averaged 8.5 points and 4.9 rebounds. He was shooting 32.1 percent from 3-point range, down from 39 percent last season. Advertisement
