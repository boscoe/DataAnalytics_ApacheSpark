Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu told The Herald-Standard of Uniontown, Pa., that he would retire rather than return for a 13th season. Polamalu, 33, had two years remaining on his contract but saw his play dip significantly from the prime of his career, when he was named the N.F.L.’s defensive player of the year in 2010. Polamalu was limited to 12 games in 2014 because of a leg injury.The newspaper reported that the Steelers had asked Polamalu to retire in February but that he did not make a decision until this week.■ The Indianapolis Colts will use their fifth-year option to keep Andrew Luck through at least 2016. The team’s owner, Jim Irsay, has said that the Colts plan to make Luck one of the highest-paid players in the N.F.L. when his rookie contract expires. Since the Colts drafted Luck with the No. 1 overall pick in 2012, he has led them to the playoffs three straight times and has made the Pro Bowl each season.A version of this brief appears in print on April 10, 2015, on Page B17 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Pro Football; Polamalu Is Retiring.
