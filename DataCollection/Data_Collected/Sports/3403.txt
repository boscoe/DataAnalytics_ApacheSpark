Rory McIlroy had the best round of the day to close to a shot behind the leader, Andy Sullivan, through the third round of the World Tour Championship. McIlroy shot a seven-under-par 65 on Saturday at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to make up three shots on Sullivan (68) and move to four strokes ahead of Danny Willett. Justin Rose, who needs to win the tournament to become the European No. 1 for the second time in his career, shot a 78 and slipped out of contention.■ Kevin Kisner had a six-under 64 in the RSM Classic in St. Simons Island, Ga., to build a three-shot lead as he goes for his first win on the PGA Tour. Kisner, a runner-up four times this year, birdied his last three holes to build some separation between him and Kevin Chappell and Graeme McDowell.■ Cristie Kerr and Ha Na Jang share the lead going into the final round of the L.P.G.A. Tour’s season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Fla. Kerr shot a four-under 67 to match Jang at 13 under. Lydia Ko and Gerina Piller were tied for third at 11 under.A version of this brief appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: McIlroy’s 65 Leaves Him a Shot Back in Dubai.
