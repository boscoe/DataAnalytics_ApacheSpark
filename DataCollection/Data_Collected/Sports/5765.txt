Lions (11-5) at Cowboys (12-4)4:40 p.m. Sunday, Line: Cowboys by 7Tony Romo has been mentioned in the most valuable player discussion along with Aaron Rodgers and J. J. Watt, but one could argue he has not even been the most valuable player of the Dallas offense. The Cowboys seemed to thrive on a combination of dominant play by the offensive line and game-changing running by DeMarco Murray.In his fourth year, Murray finally put together a season promised by his occasional breakout games in the past. He rushed for 100 yards or more 12 times and broke Emmitt Smith’s franchise record for rushing yards, leading the N.F.L. with 1,845 on 392 carries. Once written off as too fragile, Murray was a workhorse who kept pushing forward every time doubters thought he might be running out of gas.Now Murray and the stellar Dallas offensive line will get a true test by going against Detroit’s brick wall of a front seven led by Ndamukong Suh. After being suspended for appearing to intentionally step on the leg of Rodgers in Week 17, Suh was cleared to play and fined $70,000 instead.Suh’s presence changes the dynamic of the game. If he can shut down Murray, all bets are off.Pick: LionsTimes are Eastern.
