Hasn’t everyone had enough of Alex Rodriguez by now? Enough of the lies and the apologies, and then the lies again, and the apologies again?In the latest round of mea culpas — a handwritten letter released on Tuesday — Rodriguez tried to sound contrite as he said he just wanted to play again and “help us win.”Wait — what? Help “us” win?The Yankees should have read that line and blushed.Not good, Yankees. Rodriguez thinks you are in this together, a band of like-minded brothers chasing the same goal. He wants to pretend that he’s been a loyal Yankee all along, an heir to Ruth and Gehrig and DiMaggio and Mantle, even when he was popping testosterone lozenges as he was pulling on pinstripes.The release of the letter should have been the moment when the Yankees realized this relationship was over. It should have been the moment when the Yankees finally turned their collective back on Rodriguez and his warm and fuzzy (and very distorted) version of “us.” Because in truth, their relationship is too damaged to last another season, much less three more years.AdvertisementTo send their fallen star packing, though, the Yankees will have to show two qualities not usually mentioned in the same context as Rodriguez: bravery and honesty.Bravery because Rodriguez has three years left on his deal, and that means the Yankees are on the hook for $61 million whether he is on the team or not. That’s a lot of money to surrender, even for the Yankees, but in this case it’s probably worth it. Just imagine the satisfaction of giving Rodriguez one last paycheck next month and then grabbing him by his pinstriped belt loops and tossing him onto 161st Street.Beyond being the ultimate kiss-off for a doper and a liar who has brought the franchise more grief than championships, it would also be the right thing to do. At the very least, it might just spare baseball from having to print even more asterisks in its record book.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            Rodriguez has 654 career home runs, which is fifth on the career list and dangerously close to Willie Mays, who ended his career with 660. If Rodriguez plays this season, he will almost certainly hit enough homers to pass Mays, which would trigger a $6 million bonus, if the Yankees could be forced to pay it. Next up would be Babe Ruth, and then Hank Aaron. Every step would remind all of us how dopers have infiltrated so many of baseball’s lists.Baseball doesn’t want that. Fans don’t want that.And the Yankees don’t want that, mostly because it might cost them still more millions in bonuses. But that is no one’s fault but their own, which is where honesty comes into this picture.AdvertisementThe Yankees should simply admit that they are to blame for this continuing public relations disaster. They are the ones who gave Rodriguez the ridiculous 10-year, $275 million contract that replaced his earlier, just-as-ridiculous 10-year, $252 million deal.In fact, they could have avoided all of this. They could have followed General Manager Brian Cashman’s advice and bid adieu to Rodriguez after the 2007 season, when he opted out of that first contract and temporarily became a free agent. Which was not long before Rodriguez denied doping, then admitted to it in 2009, only to deny it again in 2013, and effectively admit it — again! — just this week.The Yankees didn’t have to make Rodriguez the richest baseball player in history, with career earnings now at about $356 million. They didn’t have to agree to pay him more than the player in the No. 2 spot, Derek Jeter. They could have said goodbye to him for good in 2007. And they didn’t.And was Rodriguez really worth more than a player like Jeter? The Yankees can try to dodge the question, but they certainly know the answer.
                Alex Rodriguez issued a hand-written statement Tuesday apologizing for his behavior that led to a season-long suspension for performance-enhancing drugs.            Now, though, they are stuck with Rodriguez, his 39-year-old body and his repaired hips. If they don’t get rid of him now, they could soon enter some pretty nasty territory — secretly rooting for his body to give out again, dreaming of a day when a grounder in the hole or a bad step on the basepaths forces him to take a disability retirement. If that were to happen, Rodriguez could limp away from the Bronx and get all his money, and the Yankees could collect on his contract from their insurance man. Money they won’t otherwise have.But rather than wishing the worst for Rodriguez when he arrives at spring training, the Yankees can just take a stand now and declare that they, too, have learned from their mistakes. They can announce that they are swallowing the last three years of the contract and the $61 million, and are at last moving on from Rodriguez and his baggage. They have the money. They’ll survive. But are they brave enough to do it? Honest enough to do it?Think of the upside. It would end the distracting tension between the Yankees and Rodriguez. It would appease their grumbling fans. It would put focus back on baseball, at least in New York.It would also allow the Yankees to stop wondering if Rodriguez was clean this time around. (There is reason to worry: At his age, and with a battered body and little to lose, Rodriguez could perhaps benefit from performance-enhancing drugs more than ever.)Instead, the relationship would be over, finished, kaput. Painful in the pocket book, yes. But at least there would be no more “us.”Email: juliet@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on February 19, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Lying, Lying, Gone.
