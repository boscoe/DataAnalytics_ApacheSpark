Here is how that information could be useful.Creating RostersFantasy-game contestants want rosters full of high-performing players. But there are few as good as Aaron Rodgers, for instance, so it usually leads to rosters that are similar among the thousands of contestants. Finding the SleeperThe trick to winning the big payouts is to supplement the obvious picks with players who are under the radar, called sleeper picks. They are chosen by far fewer teams but might have a breakout game with gaudy statistics. Using Inside KnowledgeHaving a winning roster that is the same as many others splits the prize money many ways, leading to smaller payouts. It is alleged that employees of these gaming sites, who have access to everyone else’s rosters, were able to create more distinctive rosters for themselves. If one or two of their sleeper picks had a big day, then the employee won big. Advertisement
