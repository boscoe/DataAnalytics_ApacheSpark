When he’s at home in Rhode Island, Ken Read, the skipper of the 100-foot super maxi Comanche, walks every morning on Newport’s Gooseberry Beach with his dog, Toby. The walk doubles as a cleanup mission.“I get an armful of garbage off the same exact beach in the same exact place every morning, and frankly it’s just shocking,” said Read, who is in Australia to compete on Comanche in his second Rolex Sydney Hobart Race.The state of the ocean is a major issue in the sailing world at the moment, with deep concerns about pollution and debris at the sailing venues in Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Summer Olympics in August.It was also a point of contention during the most recent Volvo Ocean Race, which ended in June. And with another Sydney-Hobart set to start on Saturday, no sport seems better positioned to lead the way in signaling the enormous environmental challenges plaguing the seas.AdvertisementThe question is whether sailors are using that bully pulpit as frequently and effectively as they can.Advertisement“I do think we’re the ideal messengers, but I don’t think we are doing enough,” said Lisa Blair, an Australian skipper and activist who is competing in the Sydney-Hobart race in a recently purchased boat she has named Climate Action Now. “There are certainly lots of individuals trying to do work with it and raise awareness, with beach cleanup days and harbor cleanup days. There is a lot going on, but a lot of smaller things. There needs to be a great change toward just the products we are using and the things that we do that have a direct relationship with our environment and the quality of our oceans.”Surfers also have a direct connection to this issue, but they are close to shore. Sailors, particularly ocean racers like those competing in the Sydney-Hobart, are perhaps the only prominent sports figures whose playing field is far from land. What they observe sometimes brings them to tears.“I raced around the world from 2011 to 2012,” Blair said. “And I was just gobsmacked that in the middle of nowhere there were Styrofoam boxes floating around. There was just so much rubbish in the ocean in these untouched, pristine waters that were now no longer untouched. And there’s also the scientific data behind how much plastic is actually in the water and the microplastics and the damage it is doing to the fish life and to us indirectly from humans consuming those fish. We’re effectively poisoning one of our main food sources.”Dee Caffari, a veteran British sailor who was the first woman to complete a solo circumnavigation of the planet against the prevailing winds and currents, has seen a deterioration in the last 10 years, as illustrated in the last Volvo Ocean Race when she and her crew were in the remote Southern Ocean.“One of the things sailors love about sailing is being at one with nature, seeing whales, fish and birds,” she said. “And one of the girls who was up the mast shouted, ‘I can see a seal. I can see a seal.’ And as we got closer, it was a seal playing with a plastic bag.”A study published in February in the journal Science, based on research by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, at the University of California, Santa Barbara, estimated that 4.8 million to 12.7 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the oceans from land every year.  The report said that the midpoint of that range — about 8 million metric tons — would be enough to cover an area 34 times the size of Manhattan with ankle-deep waste.Experts estimate that 80 percent of the plastic in the ocean enters from land, while the other 20 percent comes from the sea through sources like direct dumping from boats, container spills and fishing gear.AdvertisementSome of the plastic collects in oceanic gyres, vast aquatic garbage dumps created by currents. But much of it ends up on beaches and on the ocean floor, and as it breaks down it can end up being ingested by microorganisms like zooplankton, infiltrating the food chain at its base.According to Dr. Sandra Whitehouse, a senior policy advisor at the Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, the current rate of pollution could mean a doubling of the amount of plastics in the ocean by 2025. “There could be one ton of plastic for every three tons of fin fish in the ocean,” she said. “That’s a pretty frightening thought.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They include two based in Newport: Sailors for the Sea, founded by David Rockefeller Jr., and 11th Hour Racing, co-founded by the philanthropist Wendy Schmidt and her husband, Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, via the Schmidt Family Foundation.11th Hour Racing has signed up professional sailors as ambassadors, including Charlie Enright, skipper of the yacht Alvimedica. 11th Hour Racing also has signed on as sustainability partner for Land Rover BAR, Ben Ainslie’s British America’s Cup syndicate, which will challenge for the Cup in 2017. Their projects range from an oyster revival initiative near the team’s base in Portsmouth, England, to the use of spill kits on all support boats to avert pollution.“You couldn’t get a better topic to have the sailing community involved with and care about and speak for,” Wendy Schmidt said in a recent interview. “We noticed that many sporting events, especially sailboat races, have sponsors, but they are usually clothing or watches or something like that. They are not ideas, and that’s how we got started actually. We want to take that place and be able to sponsor ideas.”AdvertisementBecoming a primary sponsor — rather than just the sustainability partner — for a Volvo Ocean Racing team or a sailing team involved in offshore races like the Sydney-Hobart could be a way to raise visibility on ocean conservation issues.But the Rio Olympics, where the site for sailing events has given rise to worries about competitors’ health and safety because of the pollution and debris, could be an even bigger teaching moment.“It’s way worse than any of these people imagine,” said Ian Walker, a British skipper and former Olympic silver medalist who won the Volvo Ocean Race in June. “People think the pollution in Rio is in the harbor and it’s fine out at Copacabana and on the open sea. But I remember sailing in from the ocean and when you are about 50 miles out, you hit the stench and the changing color in the water. So even the people who go in the water swimming off Copacabana beach everyday are basically swimming in filth, but they don’t realize it.”The situation is not so disquieting off Sydney and Hobart, but Blair still called for vigilance. “When you’re out in the middle of the ocean, it’s deceiving because you can’t see things like microplastics,” she said. “You see the big stuff that floats past. You can still hook up on debris, especially long-line fishing nets and the like. They get wrapped around your keel and hold your boat up, so those sorts of things are certainly risks that are around.”Read  wants more sailors to become outspoken on the topic or to join and create a more powerful chorus.“We need a leader like Sailors for the Sea or other organizations to help get us all together,” he said. “One voice ain’t going to cut it, but a lot of voices might. The plastic is just shocking and getting worse.”A version of this special report appears in print on December 26, 2015, in The International New York Times.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
