CLEVELAND —  On Wednesday afternoon, the day before his team was to play West Virginia, John Calipari walked into the Kentucky locker room after practice and delivered an important message with a tone of levity. He had heard about the comments made by West Virginia’s freshman guard Daxter Miles Jr., who predicted that the Mountaineers would end Kentucky’s unbeaten streak.For a team that had lost three of its previous six games heading into an encounter with the best team in college basketball, it came across as an almost preposterous boast. But according to Kentucky forward Willie-Cauley-Stein, Calipari would not let it slide.“He came in here laughing like, ‘Dudes is talking, dudes is talking,’ ” Cauley-Stein said. “ ‘Got to throw the ball up sometime. We’re going to see them tomorrow.’ Everything else was on us.”The ball was thrown up at Quicken Loans Arena shortly after 9:40 p.m., and within minutes, Kentucky made it abundantly clear that Miles and his fellow Mountaineers were in for a 40-minute public reprimand.AdvertisementKentucky’s seemingly inexorable march to the Final Four continued with a punishing 78-39 victory over fifth-seeded West Virginia in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s round of 16.AdvertisementClearly the class of the field, the No. 1 Wildcats brushed aside West Virginia’s challenge and improved to 37-0. The next test will come Saturday when they play No. 3-seeded Notre Dame (32-5), which toppled Wichita State. The Irish are not likely to make any predictions about the matchup.Five Kentucky players scored in double figures — Trey Lyles had 14 points, and four others had at least 12 each — and the Wildcats held West Virginia to 13-of-54 field-goal shooting (24.1 percent), rendering its press almost useless. Kentucky surged to an 18-2 lead and led by as many as 41.West Virginia (25-10) hit only one of its first 11 shots and did not hit the second until more than nine minutes into the game, when Juwan Staten’s 3-pointer made the score 18-4. Another jumper a few seconds later cut the deficit to 12, but that was as close as West Virginia would get.Miles played 19 minutes and scored no points on 0-for-3 shooting from the field. He spoke to reporters after the game but did not offer much.“Kentucky played great,” he said multiple times, regardless of the questions.Some of the Kentucky players said they had been motivated by the comments, but West Virginia Coach Bob Huggins defended Miles’s freedom of speech and dismissed the notion that his comments had played a part in the outcome.“I’m kind of happy he wasn’t hiding under a chair somewhere,” Huggins said. “There’s nothing wrong with having some confidence and wanting to go out and compete. They just were way better than we were.”Calipari said he was not upset by Miles’s prediction and did not want his team to use revenge as a motive.Advertisement“I don’t want my team playing angry,” he said. “I don’t want them to be mean, nasty, hateful. I don’t want that. It’s not us against the world. It is play with joy and love of the game and love of each other. That wins every time.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Looking every bit as dominant as their record indicated, the much larger Wildcats led by as many as 27 points in the first half and held West Virginia to 5-of-26 shooting from the field (19.2 percent). Kentucky shot 61 percent.“We said when we came in here at halftime, ‘Step on their throats,’ ” Cauley-Stein said. “ ‘Don’t let them back up.’ ”It was almost too much for Huggins to watch. He came into the game with an improbable 8-2 record against Calipari, his friend, but most of those games occurred when Huggins was at Cincinnati, from 1989 to 2005. Calipari arrived at Kentucky in 2009.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

When the Wildcats extended their first-half lead to 40-15, Huggins sat on his courtside stool with his arms folded and a blank expression on his face.Although Huggins professed to be uncertain how the Mountaineers would fare against Kentucky’s unforgiving size and depth, this was probably not the way he had envisioned the game playing out.The formula for a potential upset was supposed to have been engineered through the Mountaineers’ furious style of play. With an unrelenting press and dogged attack on the offensive glass, the Mountaineers were said by some to have the right approach, and apparently the confidence, to make history.West Virginia was hoping it could outhustle Kentucky, but that did not happen. Kentucky used its size, speed and skill to dominate even more than it had through much of the season. The Wildcats may not go all the way undefeated, but they will not be 36-1, either.“We’ve got better players,” Cauley-Stein said. “So, if you match their effort, then your talent will take over.”A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline:  After a Bold Forecast, West Virginia Is Blown Away by Kentucky.
