The prices were also reported by The Wall Street Journal.The demand for the long-awaited bout — which is a joint venture of HBO and Showtime — is largely the reason for the price. Mayweather and Pacquiao have been the most dynamic and telegenic fighters of an era bereft of charismatic or attractive heavyweights. Even at a record price to consumers, the fight is expected to break all boxing pay-per-view records.“It seems like it will break the record, but who really knows?” Bob Arum, Pacquiao’s promoter, told The Associated Press last week. “Anyone who predicts the total pay per view is whistling in the dark.”The cost of the fight exceeds the previous peak — $64.95 for standard definition and $74.95 for high definition — for Mayweather’s 2013 fight against Canelo Alvarez. That price did little to dampen purchases.The fight generated a boxing pay-per-view record of $152 million in revenue, from about 2.44 million buyers, exceeding the $139 million for Mayweather’s 2007 fight against Oscar De La Hoya, which had slightly more buyers.
