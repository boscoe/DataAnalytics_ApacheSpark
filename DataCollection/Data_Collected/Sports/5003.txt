They have both caught touchdowns in seven games, tied for most in a season with Cris Carter and Randy Moss with the Minnesota Vikings in 1988. Might they seize the record this week? The Cowboys’ cornerbacks — Carr and Claiborne among them — have not intercepted a pass in the last 536 attempts, according to The Dallas Morning News, a streak that dates to Week 14 of last season. The Cowboys will be facing a Jets offense operated by a quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has thrown nine touchdowns and no interceptions in his last three games. NUMBER TO WATCH 43That is the number of touchdowns Dallas receiver Dez Bryant has caught since 2012, the most in the N.F.L. over that span, but only two have come this season. His production has waned without Tony Romo at quarterback, and he has also been recovering from a foot injury that cost him five games. Of the 63 passes thrown toward him, Bryant has grabbed 27. Bryant, who is likely to draw Darrelle Revis in coverage, caught one pass last week in Green Bay.
