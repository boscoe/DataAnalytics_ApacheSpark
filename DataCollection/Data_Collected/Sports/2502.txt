Week 9 Scores and HighlightsIn 2014, the Panthers entered December with a 3-8-1 record. They have not lost a game since, a streak of 11 consecutive regular-season victories. Yet they do not seem to strike fear into the hearts of opponents the way the N.F.L.’s other undefeated teams do, especially the Patriots and the Broncos. Perhaps this is because the Panthers win ugly — they blew a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead to the Colts last week before winning on a field goal in overtime — and rarely blow out opponents (six of their wins have been by 11 points or fewer).Possibly outside of winning in Seattle, against a then 2-3 Seahawks team, the Panthers have yet to stake claim to a signature win, something with an exclamation point attached to it. This could be that game for them.The Packers, meanwhile, are looking to get back on track after their first loss of the season, 29-10 in Denver. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers had one of the worst games of his career, throwing for only 77 yards against the league’s top-ranked defense. Though the Panthers’ defensive unit is one of the N.F.L.’s best, it’s hard to imagine Rodgers and the Packers’ offense struggling in two straight games.PICK: PACKERSAdvertisement
