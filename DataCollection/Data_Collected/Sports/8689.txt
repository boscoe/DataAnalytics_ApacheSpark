The signing may mean that the Browns will not re-sign Brian Hoyer, who made 13 starts last season before he was benched in favor of the rookie Johnny Manziel, who entered a rehabilitation complex last month. ■ The Arizona Cardinals released the three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Darnell Dockett, 33. Dockett can test the free-agent market, but he may wind up re-signing with Arizona. Also Friday, the Baltimore Ravens released defensive end Chris Canty, 32, after two seasons with the team, and the Miami Dolphins released two receivers, Brian Hartline and Brandon Gibson.
