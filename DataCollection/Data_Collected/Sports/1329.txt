CreditTodd Heisler/The New York Times        CHICAGO — Hours before the neighborhood around Wrigley Field grew feverish with expectation and excitement on Tuesday, it was like many areas around the city. The rows of bars along Clark Street were empty except for a few stragglers around lunchtime. Mothers pushed strollers, and twentysomethings walked their dogs past brick rowhouses that were dotted with Halloween décor and Cubs flags. The rumbling of trains along the elevated tracks provided a soundtrack, and the trees, whose leaves have turned yellow, orange and red, provided the backdrop.That would all change as the day rolled on, as fans converged at the intersection of Clark and Addison Streets in anticipation of what in this city is a rare treat, late October baseball — Game 3 of the National League Championship Series between the Mets and the Cubs.Besides its ivy-covered brick walls and century-old charms, one of the allures of Wrigley Field is the surrounding neighborhood.Wrigley is unlike the suburban parks of the 1970s, or the urban ones that have been built in the past 20 years with a nod toward the past, some of them trying to create a vibrant work-and-play environment.Advertisement“It adds to the atmosphere,” Mike Kann said as he stood in line to enter the bleachers. “This came first. It’s different the way it developed organically, instead of the modern stadiums trying to create this. It’s in the fabric of the neighborhood.”AdvertisementThe neighborhood, like the ballpark, which is in the midst of an extensive renovation that includes enormous video boards and an adjacent building that will house the team’s offices, has continued to evolve.Wells Offutt, who was preparing to pedal his bicycle down Sheffield Avenue, said the neighborhood had undergone a striking change since he arrived in 1978. He pointed to buildings that had been abandoned and lots that had been vacant. But for some time now, the neighborhood has sported those telltale signs of gentrification: a Whole Foods and a Starbucks.“I’ve been here through the good, the bad and the ugly,” Offutt said. “There’s a lot of amenities — good transportation, good shopping. It’s become a destination. It’s become a place to party and have a good time.”Bob King, a firefighter at Engine No. 78, across Waveland Avenue, down the left-field line, said that when he began working there 25 years ago, a building next door to the station sold for $289,000. Now, he figures, it would go for at least $2.5 million.Whereas the station used to respond to a fire a day, now a vast majority of calls are for medical assistance. As fans pass by on their way in and out of the ballpark, some stop to ask if they can buy T-shirts or patches at the firehouse. Others ask for a photograph.“It’s a pretty popular house,” said King, who was busy cooking the afternoon meal of bacon-topped hamburgers for the entire station. “You’ve got to be a pretty good people person to work here.”The character outside the ballpark on game days is sure to evolve as the Cubs’ owners, the Ricketts family, continue to buy and develop the land around it. The eventual goal is to close off the streets and create an extension of the park, with bars and restaurants.For now, fans can congregate outside the players’ parking lot on Waveland and greet them. But next year, the players will park in an underground lot and will be able to enter the ballpark without having any contact with fans — the custom in most, if not all, cities.Advertisement“The die-hards have had the interactions with players because they’re two feet from the players’ cars,” said Scott Rickerson, who has been going to Cubs games for 20 years, “but a lot of these changes are done for the casual fan.”While the mile-long strip of restaurants and bars along Clark Street, just around the corner from Engine No. 78, did not begin to fill up until late in the afternoon, beer delivery trucks were parked along the street around noon, one unloading 1,400 cases.The stretch has become a popular spot to be, even for those who do not have a ticket to the game. Many of the bars opened early, some by 10 a.m., since they were not quite sure when fans would start arriving.“If it’s like this tomorrow, we won’t open until 3,” said Cole Mellendorf, assistant general manager of Irish Oak, a pub with a capacity of 150, one of the smaller places on the strip and one of the oldest, having been open for 20 years.When the Cubs won the National League wild-card game at Pittsburgh, most everyone in the bars emptied into the street, closing it down while the celebration went on.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

So were the opportunities to cheer on the Cubs.Justin Dardick and his brother, Sam, stood outside Murphy’s Bleachers, the renowned bar across the street from center field, watching on television. They live in the neighborhood but did not want to pay the $250 that tickets were going or in the upper deck.As the Mets, who would earn a 5-2 victory, scored the go-ahead run in the sixth inning on a wild pitch, it was an indication that for all the changes that have taken place in the neighborhood, perhaps one thing had not changed.AdvertisementSam Dardick shook his head.“Cubs,” he said.A picture caption on Wednesday with an article about Wrigleyville, the neighborhood surrounding the Chicago Cubs’ Wrigley Field, misstated the surname of a Wrigleyville resident and longtime Cubs fan in some editions. He is Bruce Mullens, not Bruce Mullens-Wricket.A version of this article appears in print on October 21, 2015, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Best of Times in Wrigleyville, for a Moment.
