 Saturday 12 Oklahoma at 4 Baylor8 p.m., ABCThese Big 12 matchups are starting to feel like elimination games. Texas Christian’s loss to Oklahoma State last week made the Horned Frogs’ path to the playoff very complicated. This week, Baylor is in a similar spot as it faces its first test of the season. The Bears may be undefeated, but not a single one of those victories was against a team that currently has a winning record. Now they face the Sooners, Oklahoma State and T.C.U. in consecutive weeks. Oklahoma has been blowing out conference opponents since a head-scratching loss to Texas, and quarterback Baker Mayfield has quietly been playing as well as any other quarterback in the nation over that stretch. For Baylor, there is a lot of pressure on the freshman quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who will start his second game in place of the injured Seth Russell. He threw for 419 yards against Kansas State, but the Wildcats are 0-5 in Big 12 play. Stidham has plenty of weapons at his disposal. Receiver Corey Coleman leads the nation with 20 touchdown catches, and running back Shock Linwood leads the Big 12 with an average of 130.8 yards per game.3 Alabama at 20 Mississippi St.3:30 p.m., CBSBefore this matchup last year, Mississippi State was undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings. A loss to Alabama knocked it off that perch. This year, the Crimson Tide are coming off a decisive victory over Louisiana State. If they can keep winning, it will be hard to keep them out of the Playoff. The Alabama defensive front made quite a statement when it held L.S.U.’s Leonard Fournette to 31 yards on 19 carries. On offense, Tide running back Derrick Henry carried the ball a whopping 38 times for 210 yards and three touchdowns to take Fournette’s spot atop the Heisman Trophy rankings. Now Alabama must avoid a letdown against Mississippi State. The Bulldogs have losses to L.S.U. and Texas A&M, but quarterback Dak Prescott is among the best dual-threat quarterbacks in college football. (Last year at this time, Prescott was the one atop the Heisman race.) Two more rushing touchdowns would make him the 11th player in major-college history to record 40 rushing and 40 passing touchdowns. Alabama is the favorite on the road, but this is a tricky test.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            Oregon at 7 Stanford7:30 p.m., FoxThis has been the premier game in the Pacific-12 Conference over the last five seasons, with the victor going on to win the conference in each of those years. Stanford opened the season with a loss at Northwestern but has won eight in a row since. Running back Chris McCaffery has emerged as one of the best all-around players in college football. He runs the ball, catches the ball, returns kicks and even threw a touchdown pass last week. Oregon lost at Michigan State, was blown out at home by Utah and was upset in two overtimes by Washington State. To win the conference, the Ducks need to beat Stanford and hope the Cardinal are upset by California later this season.Arkansas at 9 L.S.U.7:15 p.m., ESPNThe Razorbacks are coming off a wild victory over Mississippi, while L.S.U. was humbled by Alabama last week. The Tigers are not dead yet, however. If they keep winning and Alabama loses to Mississippi State or Auburn, they would be back in first place in the Southeastern Conference West.25 Memphis at 16 Houston7 p.m., ESPN2Memphis’s loss to Navy took some air out of this game, but it is still the first meeting of ranked American Athletic Conference teams. In fact, there are four teams from the conference in the top 25. These are two very good offenses led by superb quarterbacks. Houston’s Greg Ward Jr. is a dangerous runner, averaging 92 yards per game, while Memphis’s Paxton Lynch has thrown 19 touchdowns and only two interceptions.10 Utah at Arizona10 p.m., Fox Sports 1Utah has quietly kept winning after an Oct. 25 loss to Southern California, and the Utes are in the top 10 and sitting in first place in the Pac-12 South. To remain there, they will have to end a three-game losing streak to Arizona.
