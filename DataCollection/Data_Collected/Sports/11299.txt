CreditChang W. Lee/The New York Times        Jeurys Familia had noticed the crowd when he first took the field, with nearly 44,000 fans having trekked to Citi Field on Monday to see the Mets for themselves. Now, many of them were getting anxious watching Familia fidget on the mound.Familia stepped away to clear his head. Clinging to a two-run lead in the ninth inning, he had walked the leadoff batter and had fallen behind in the count, 2-1, against Grady Sizemore.David Wright, the Mets’ captain, noticed Familia’s body language and approached him, telling him to take a deep breath.This was the Mets’ home opener, their one chance to make a first impression on all these people. Familia was one of several young players the team would be relying on, its closer for now, and he would have to face moments like this all season.AdvertisementThe very next pitch, Familia fired a 98-mile-per-hour sinker, and Sizemore grounded into a double play. Familia clenched his fist and let out a primal roar. Cody Asche then lined out to center. As far as first impressions go, this one seemed appropriate. The Mets did not exactly hit the ball well or field it cleanly. But their pitching, led by Jacob deGrom, carried them to a 2-0 win over the Philadelphia Phillies, and Familia earned the save.Advertisement“They have to get used to this,” Manager Terry Collins said at a packed news conference. “They cannot be intimidated by the numbers in the stands, or by the expectations.”All winter and spring, the Mets had talked about becoming contenders, and the fans had apparently bought in. Only the 2013 All-Star Game drew a larger crowd to Citi Field than Monday’s announced 43,947. One vendor sold shirts that read, “The Magic Is Back,” and, “Take Back New York,” a clear jab at the Yankees.But the fans seemed a bit hesitant, too. They were smart enough to know the team’s flaws. During the pregame ceremony, they cheered deGrom and Matt Harvey, scheduled to start Tuesday. They had mixed reactions to Collins and shortstop Wilmer Flores, and they booed the backup shortstop Ruben Tejada and Mayor Bill de Blasio.During the first inning, fans in right-center field called out the starters for a roll call, just as the so-called bleacher creatures do at Yankee Stadium. That may have riled some Mets fans, but it was appropriate, too, with the team seeking the kind of success to which its neighbors in the Bronx are accustomed. The Mets had an announced crowd of 40,000 only twice last year, for the home opener and for a game in May against the Yankees.Since they moved to Citi Field six years ago, the Mets have a losing record at home (231-255), and they have not finished a season with a winning record there since 2010. They examined all kinds of factors, like their pregame meals and the dimensions of their ballpark, as if something was conspiring against them. This off-season, they moved in the right-center-field fence by about 10 feet, hoping that would provide some relief.The bottom line, at least, is relatively uncomplicated: Last year’s playoff teams had a combined .593 winning percentage at home. Monday, then, felt in some ways like a test. The Mets had to convince their record audience that they could win consistently at Citi Field.“We play half our games here,” General Manager Sandy Alderson said. “It’s very important.”DeGrom did his part, even though he noticed early on that he was having difficulty locating his fastball and his off-speed pitches were not as sharp. Pitching to contact, mixing his pitches and hoping for the best, he still ended up throwing six and a third scoreless innings.DeGrom left with two runners on in the seventh, but Carlos Torres retired the next two batters. Then Jerry Blevins retired three left-handed hitters in the eighth, striking out the final one, Ryan Howard. Blevins fooled Howard so badly with a 2-2 curveball that Howard needed to touch the ground to catch his balance.AdvertisementThe Mets’ offense looked just as uncoordinated at times, as if picking up from last season. The team stranded nine runners and batted 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position.The Mets’ two runs did not come pretty. In the fourth inning, Juan Lagares legged out an infield single on a comebacker with two outs, allowing a run to score from third. In the eighth, Michael Cuddyer, who scored on a sacrifice fly from Travis d’Arnaud, reached third base only because of an error by Chase Utley.“I thought we hit some balls pretty hard today,” Collins said. “Welcome back to Citi Field.”The Phillies were still in position to tie the game in the ninth when Familia became flustered and Wright went over to console him. Wright might as well have been consoling every nervous Mets fan in the park. When Familia got the double play, clenched his fist and roared, the crowd roared along with him.“I got chills,” Cuddyer said.A version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2015, on Page B16 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Win Jittery Home Opener With a Shutout and a Roar .
