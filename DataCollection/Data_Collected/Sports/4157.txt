The Giants’ offensive lineup appears to be getting healthier, but defensively, the Giants lost two more starters to injury this week.Guard Justin Pugh is expected to return after sitting out the last two games with a concussion. Center Weston Richburg, who did not play against Washington, seems to have improved after an ankle sprain and will probably play. The final determination on Richburg’s availability will be made after Saturday’s practice.Right tackle Robert Newhouse, who has started every game this season, woke up the morning after the Washington game with severe back pain. The Giants may wait until Sunday to clear him for the game.Linebacker Devon Kennard, who has hamstring and foot injuries, and safety Brandon Meriweather, who has a knee strain, were ruled out. Because of injuries to veteran linebackers this season, Kennard, a second-year player, has been making many of the pre-snap defensive calls. He will be replaced by a coalition of reserve linebackers depending on whether it is a likely run or pass situation.The starting tight end Larry Donnell will also not play for a fourth consecutive game because of a neck injury.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
