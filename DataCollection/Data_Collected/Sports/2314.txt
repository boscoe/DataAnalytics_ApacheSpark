His latest loss came in Houston, where the controlling owner’s father founded the franchise.It was apparently the last straw for the Titans, who named Mike Mularkey as the interim coach for the rest of the season.“We have expected more progress on the field, and I felt it was time to move in a different direction,” said the Titans’ controlling owner, Amy Adams Strunk, in a statement. “I would like to thank Ken for his efforts with our team, as he worked very hard to try to move us forward.”The Titans, who scheduled a news conference for Tuesday afternoon, went 2-14 in Whisenhunt’s debut season. It was their worst record since 1994, after going 7-9 in 2013 under Mike Munchak. Tennessee drafted the Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota with the No. 2 pick in the draft, then named him the starter.They won their opener, 42-14, in Tampa, then lost six straight for the longest skid in the N.F.L. Three of the losses were by a combined 6 points, and Whisenhunt was 1-11 at home.The latest was a 20-6 loss at Houston on Sunday with Strunk and other family members watching in the town where the late Bud Adams founded this franchise. Strunk took over as controlling owner in March, replacing Tommy Smith, who hired Whisenhunt in January 2014.That was the 16th loss in 17 games for Tennessee, and the Titans also have lost their last 12 games against A.F.C. opponents.Whisenhunt’s .130 winning percentage ranks behind only Leeman Bennett with Tampa Bay and Rich Kotite with the Jets (4-28, .125) for the worst N.F.L. coaching record since 1970, according to STATS. Whisenhunt tied with Jim Ringo, who went 3-20 with Buffalo.The Titans have started four rookies on offense this season, including Mariota, who has missed the last two games with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee. Tennessee ranks next to last in the N.F.L., averaging 17.9 points per game.Mularkey arrived in Tennessee with Whisenhunt as tight ends coach and was promoted to assistant head coach this off-season. He has been a head coach with the Buffalo Bills from 2004 to 2005 and in 2012 with Jacksonville. He played nine years in the N.F.L. with Minnesota and Pittsburgh. Mularkey also has been an offensive coordinator with Pittsburgh, Miami and Atlanta.The Falcons had a 3,000-yard passer, 1,000-yard receiver and 1,000-yard rusher in three of Mularkey’s four seasons between 2008 and 2011.Advertisement
