Kazmir, a three-time All-Star, ranked fourth in the American League with a 3.10 E.R.A. last season while going 7-11 for the Athletics and the Astros.Kazmirâ€™s deal includes an opt-out clause after the first year, but his arrival is still a highlight in an unusual off-season for the Dodgers, who lost the right-hander Zack Greinke in free agency to Arizona. The Dodgers also declined to close a deal with the right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma, who re-signed with Seattle, and backed out of a trade for Cincinnati closer Aroldis Chapman after learning he had been investigated over an accusation of domestic violence. Chapman was then traded to the Yankees. Advertisement
