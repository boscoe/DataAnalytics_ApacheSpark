To the Sports Editor:Re “A Son Calls His Mother,” April 27: My sister died of a brain injury in 1997 after she fell on rocks while skiing without a helmet. Few skiers used a helmet then, and when my family urged others to wear them, we were met with skepticism and disdain. Eighteen years later, helmet use is common. People can change their habits. Helmets are not likely to eliminate concussions in football if the game remains as it is; I’m not sure what will. Raising awareness of the need for change is essential. Thank you for your coverage of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in football players. And thank you, Karen Kinzle Zegel, for your bravery in sharing your difficult story and for your advocacy.HALLEY MOORECleveland Heights, OhioTo the Sports Editor:Having only daughters, I was not faced with a football-playing decision. But I am strongly urging my daughters to not allow my grandsons to play football. They have plenty of other choices if they wish to play sports. The article was striking. I wonder if The New York Times was itself so moved as to suspend coverage of football. Can The Times have it both ways? Can it print articles showing the inherent harm of football, while celebrating this same sport during football season?RALPH REINERTSENQueensTo the Sports Editor:The article’s eloquence does not make up for the newspaper’s promotional coverage of college and professional football. Glorifying the game and its players is not good journalism when the focus should be that for the sake of entertainment we witness brain damage for profit. The sport should not be banned, just ignored until it goes away.GARY ABRAMSONGoshen, N.Y.Keep Pitchers HittingTo the Sports Editor:Re “An N.L. Tradition That Should Be Retired,” April 28, 2015: William C. Rhoden doesn’t make much of a case for instituting the designated hitter rule in the National League. He argues for the rule based on the physical risk pitchers incur while batting, but as Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson points out, this risk is negligible from a statistical standpoint. The consequences of imposing the D.H. rule are significant. The strategic choices a manager must make when the pitcher’s spot is coming up is an important and fascinating part of the game. Besides, if we don’t keep pitchers hitting, we’ll be denied the joy of watching Bartolo Colon at the plate.AdvertisementTHOMAS J. MINETUpper Montclair, N.J.To the Sports Editor:Using the same logic of protecting pitchers from the hazards of the batter’s box and of giving fans greater expertise at the plate, there are many other improvements that could be made: How about a designated runner? Wouldn’t it be thrilling to have top speed on the basepaths throughout the game and not just rarely? And think of how that would save stars (ask David Wright) from the dangers of hamstring pulls. Or how about designated fielders? Certainly we could have someone out there near the mound to protect pitchers. Or why not two platoons, offense and defense? There are lots of ways we could “improve” baseball — if we don’t really care about the exquisite balance of the original game.MICHAEL SPIELMANBronxBuzz for the Subway SeriesTo the Sports Editor:Re “More Meh Than Meaning in Early Subway Series” April 26: I don’t think Billy Witz lives in the same New York City that I do. At the office, in the bars, on the radio and in the tabloids, the tension and anticipation for last weekend’s Mets-Yankees series was palpable. The only unsold seats at Yankee Stadium were the stupidly high-priced ones that go unsold every game. An examination of the secondary market via StubHub would have revealed a brisk market with most seats going for more than face value. The Mets’ winning streak and the Yankees’ success created a buzz that has been missing in recent years. Let’s play two.AdvertisementCHARLIE HAEUSSLERBrooklynA version of this letter appears in print on May 3, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Football, Brain Injuries and a Need for Change .
