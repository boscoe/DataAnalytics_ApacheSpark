Instead, it will be his brother, John, who led the Ravens to a Super Bowl victory against San Francisco three seasons ago.The 49ers could hardly be blamed if they experience some nostalgia, since they have been outscored this season, 140-75, while Jim Harbaugh’s Michigan Wolverines pummeled their opponents to the tune of 177-38 heading into this week’s showdown against Michigan State.The 49ers appeared to hit rock bottom against Green Bay two weeks ago, but the offense looked a little better last week against the Giants. Beating the Ravens would not do much to convince anyone that the team is worth watching, but 2-4 sounds a lot better than 1-5.PICK: 49ERSAdvertisement
