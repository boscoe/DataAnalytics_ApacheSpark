Over 40 years, Phil Jackson and Charley Rosen have coached and written books together, played hundreds of games of one-on-one, and discussed basketball philosophy as if Descartes equaled Holzman.“I don’t know whether it was the Communist Party background of Charley’s parents that helped balance my own conservative Christian upbringing,” Jackson wrote in “More Than a Game,” a collaboration with Rosen published in 2001, “or his radical hippie outlook that matched my own contrarian ways. Whatever it was, it brought about an unlikely exchange of ideas.”Now, the two men — who each stand around 6 feet 8 inches — are inadvertently connected by exquisite basketball misery.Before a Knicks season that began with hope based largely on what Jackson could do as their new president, Rosen, variously an author, coach and columnist, published his 20th book, “Perfectly Awful,” a chronicle of the Philadelphia 76ers’ 1972-73 season, when they finished 9-73, the worst record in N.B.A. history. Writing about a team so dreadful had to be fun, he said.Advertisement“Tolstoy said that happy families are all the same and unhappy families are the most interesting,” Rosen said recently, loosely adapting the beginning of “Anna Karenina.” “Winning teams can be interesting, but they’re very rarely funny and very rarely tragic. And guys on winning teams don’t usually complain, even if they’re the 12th man.”AdvertisementBut now the Knicks are 5-36 and looking more awful and overmatched with each game. Even Carmelo Anthony’s return against the Milwaukee Bucks in London on Thursday did nothing to revive the team, which lost by 16 in front of Jackson at the O2 Arena. The possibility that Anthony will have knee surgery that could sideline him for all, or most, of the remainder of the season gives impetus to comparisons between these Knicks and the old 76ers and the notion that this Knicks team may be worse. If there is any consolation in the comparisons, it is that after 41 games in 1972-73, the 76ers were only 3-38.At Madison Square Garden on Jan. 10, when the Knicks lost to Charlotte by 28 points, Rosen talked to Jackson about the struggling team that he had begun to dismantle. And he thought about that infamous 76ers team. “I asked Phil, ‘Are you going to win more than nine?’ ” Rosen said. “And he said, ‘I don’t know.’ ”Through a Knicks spokesman, Jackson declined to comment for this article.Rosen said that Jackson was unhappy with the Knicks’ worst start ever — when he took the job, Jackson had predicted a playoff appearance this season — but was coping well.
                As a player and coach, Phil Jackson is used to his teams being well above .500. But now as an executive, his Knicks are exploring unimagined depths.            “He’s got a plan,” Rosen said. “He knows what’s going on. He gave those guys a chance, and they couldn’t do it. He’s brave enough to start from scratch, which you never see guys in New York do.”Rosen and Jackson met for the first time at a party in Jackson’s loft in Manhattan above an auto repair shop late in the 1972-73 season. Rosen was a writer; Jackson was in his sixth season with the Knicks, who were on their way to winning their second N.B.A. championship. The Knicks played the 76ers seven times that season, winning six of the games, including a 139-91 rout in November. But when the teams played in mid-February, the 76ers were in the midst of a two-week renaissance, winning five of seven, including an easy 114-98 victory against the Knicks.In “Perfectly Awful,” Jackson said, “We had beaten them fairly easily the night before, so we all were goofing around in the locker room before the game and were not prepared to play hard.”Still, the Knicks were, after that loss, 48-17, and the 76ers were 7-59 — a record that would be matched by the Charlotte Bobcats in the 66-game, lockout-shortened 2011-12 season.AdvertisementRosen’s and Jackson’s professional trajectories have converged and diverged. Rosen, a Hunter College star, medieval scholar and novelist, became Jackson’s assistant coach with the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association. Rosen coached four C.B.A. teams, while Jackson turned an assistant’s job with the Chicago Bulls into 11 championships as the head coach of the Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers. Jackson never offered Rosen an assistant’s job, but rumors that he was a candidate at one point were scotched when Bulls General Manager Jerry Krause called Rosen and said he had other plans.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We’re friends, and you sent this guy to call me.”Rosen said they didn’t speak for eight or nine months.Rosen, who turns 74 on Sunday, works as a columnist, mostly for digital sites like HoopsHype, while writing fiction and nonfiction books about basketball and baseball.He has commented with regularity about Jackson, notably last October when he defended Jackson’s triangle offense against criticism by the former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy. Jackson also provided Rosen with a candid preseason assessment of his players for the ESPN website. Rosen considers his access to Jackson “privileged.”Jackson has discarded some of the players he analyzed for Rosen (J. R. Smith, Iman Shumpert and Samuel Dalembert), and may part with others.What remains, after Jackson’s initial round of housecleaning, Rosen said, is not even talented enough to beat the 76ers of 1972-73. The game has changed, but Rosen said those Sixers were more talented than these Knicks.“They had several legitimate players,” he said. “Freddie Carter, who was battle-hardened, had been to the finals and hit a clutch shot against the Knicks in the playoffs. Tom Van Arsdale, who was terrific. Leroy Ellis, who could rebound and block shots, but was really a runner and jump shooter. And Manny Leaks, who was a tough defensive player.“Van Arsdale was pretty good defensively and, all things being equal, would prevent Anthony from going off, plus he would score his share of points.”The Sixers were coached to a 4-47 start by Roy Rubin, who succeeded Jack Ramsay. Rubin was an erratic disciplinarian who had been successful at Long Island University but was out of his depth in the N.B.A., with questionable pregame scouting reports, substitution patterns and late-game strategies. Nicknamed Poor Roy Rubin, he pulled a muscle protesting a referee’s call when the 76ers broke a season-opening 15-game losing streak with a win in San Antonio.AdvertisementKevin Loughery, who was playing for Rubin, replaced him two months later and guided the 76ers to a 5-26 finish, which included 13 consecutive losses to end the season.“If Loughery had coached that team, they would have won 10 more games,” Rosen said.So exactly how would the 76ers under Loughery do against Jackson and Derek Fisher’s Knicks?Rosen separated his response into whether the Knicks would have the sore-kneed Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire in their lineup.“Without Carmelo and Stat, the Sixers win in four or five games,” he said, imagining a seven-game series. “With them, the Sixers win in six or seven.”A version of this article appears in print on January 18, 2015, on Page SP7 of the New York edition with the headline: Jackson Confidant Studies Historically Bad Teams, Like Knicks.
