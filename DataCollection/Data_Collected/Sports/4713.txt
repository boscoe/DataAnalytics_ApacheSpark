The Dolphins’ anemic offense was ranked 29th in yards per game entering Sunday, and quarterback Ryan Tannehill was just 9 of 19 passing, for 86 yards, in a 15-13 victory over the Baltimore Ravens last week.Two offensive players, at least, can expect to enjoy themselves: wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants and Jarvis Landry of the Dolphins, close friends and former teammates at Louisiana State.“This game has been marked on the schedule for a long time,” Beckham told The Associated Press on Wednesday.Landry said, “I want him to have the game of his life, but I want to win the game.”Pick: GiantsAdvertisement
