Week 5 scores and highlightsIn another game that once looked promising on the schedule, the Giants and the 49ers are trending in opposite directions. The Giants pulled out a tough road win last week in Buffalo and look to be in a strong position in the N.F.C. East. San Francisco has looked ugly in three consecutive losses. While Giants quarterback Eli Manning has passed well, throwing only one interception through four games, the 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick has been dreadful, completing just 22 of 44 passes with no touchdowns and five interceptions, two of them returned for touchdowns.On the bright side for the 49ers, Coach Jim Tomsula apparently did not pass wind during a news conference, as many on the Internet recently accused him of doing, so there’s that.PICK: GIANTSAdvertisement
