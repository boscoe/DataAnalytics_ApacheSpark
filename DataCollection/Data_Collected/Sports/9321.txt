SURPRISE, Ariz. —  When the main portion of her presentation on the scourge of athletes’ violence against women was over, when Kathy Redmond opened the floor to the fresh-faced players of the Kansas City Royals organization, a much older man from the minor league coaching staff asked more questions than anyone else.One of them was heart-to-heart.“Did you forgive him?” Willie Mays Aikens asked.Did Redmond forgive the hulking defensive lineman she had accused of twice raping her when she was a University of Nebraska freshman almost a quarter-century ago?Why, yes, Redmond said Sunday afternoon, as a woman of faith, and for her inner peace, she absolutely had, though only after much weeping, suffering and counseling.She added, “The bad thing that happened to me ended up being a positive, because I’m here talking to you guys about it.”AdvertisementWith that in mind, Aikens told Redmond after her talk that she had touched him on a personal level. He, after all, had been granted clemency by the Royals for crimes he had committed, though mostly against his own career.AdvertisementAikens, 60, was once young and virile, a Royals slugger just hitting his stride when he lost it all to alcohol and drugs. He later surrendered 14 years of freedom after being convicted in 1994 on four counts of crack cocaine distribution and one count of use of a firearm in the process.Released from prison in 2008, Aikens was hired by the Royals as a hitting instructor three years later to work out of the team’s training facility on sun-drenched fields about a half-hour’s drive from Phoenix.“I’m at the lowest level of the minors,” he said. “I get the guys right out of high school and college. But I believe this is the most important level for what I can offer them, because they are beginning to go through stuff they’ve never experienced before.”Redmond began her one-woman crusade against misogyny in sports with the formation of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes in 1998. In a culture that celebrates male athletes, puts them in positions of affluence and power, the long-simmering issue exploded last year with the release of a video showing Ray Rice, then a Baltimore Ravens running back, knocking unconscious his then-girlfriend, Janay Palmer, in a hotel elevator. Rice and Palmer have since married.After Redmond’s talk, Aikens said the habit of objectifying women and not understanding the societal consequences had long been a problem in sports. He had been there, done that.“I never raped anybody, but I took advantage of women, like many athletes,” he said. “I had the mind-set of a ballplayer, the thinking that we are entitled to certain things, we are invincible and nothing is going to happen to us.”What happened in Kansas City on Dec. 1, 2012, precipitated a call Redmond received not long after from the Royals organization. That day, Jovan Belcher of the N.F.L.’s Chiefs — who share a sports complex with the Royals in Kansas City, Mo. — killed his girlfriend, the 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins, before driving to the team’s training facility and turning the gun on himself.AdvertisementThe same day, The New York Times posted an article online about Redmond’s marriage to Derek Brown, a former star running back at Nebraska, and her reconciliation with the university after years of contention over how it had handled her rape accusations against another former player, Christian Peter.Redmond had returned to Lincoln to tell her story to the team, in itself an emotional and cathartic experience. Shaken by what happened with Belcher and the Chiefs, the Royals summoned Redmond to speak when spring training began in 2013.This year — no doubt motivated by the national uproar created by the Rice case and the N.F.L.’s perceived mishandling of it — all of baseball has embarked on a domestic violence education program, working with a group called Futures Without Violence.But as Redmond told the young Royals, their organization had been ahead of the curve — proactive, not passive.“So many times, teams will put programs in place, or will call organization meetings, only after something bad has happened,” said Dayton Moore, the Royals’ general manager and the architect of the wild-card playoff team that came within a game of winning the 2014 World Series. “We wanted to be in a position where we put those guardrails around us, where we could have programs in place that used baseball as a platform to grow leaders.”Baseball’s new initiative requires all major league employees to attend a presentation. But Moore said the Royals — along with the Texas Rangers, who share their spring training complex in Surprise — had continued to have Redmond speak to their minor league players.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They watch ‘SportsCenter.’ That’s their world. If you can present both sides to them so they understand, ‘That could be me,’ they can relate, whether they raise their hand or not.”Several players did pose questions, including one during the Spanish-speaking session, who asked how soon Redmond and her guest, Alison Jennings — who accused four football players of raping her at Oklahoma State in 1999 — had been able to trust a man in a relationship again after being assaulted.The answer, from both, was not soon enough.But near the end of her second session, Redmond told the players, “I don’t have some angry thing about athletes.”AdvertisementOn top of a life in sports — growing up on Nebraska football, playing and now coaching girls’ high school lacrosse — she wound up marrying Brown, who, like Peter, played in the N.F.L.“I know about this more than you can imagine,” she said, adding that she wanted the players to understand that women are not their opponents. But nor are they their playthings.Embrace the complexities of equitable relationships, she advised them. Understand the meaning of no, and the laws that govern assault.“Your greatest strength is knowing your weakness,” she said.Aikens said in an interview after Redmond’s program that he, more than most, could appreciate that line. Whatever an athlete’s transgressions might be, they typically begin with that false sense of invulnerability.In his day, Aikens said, there were no employee assistance programs, no life coach or confidant to speak with such unabashed candor.“Maybe it would have kept me out of that life, out of prison,” he said. “Maybe what she said here today can stop one of these players from a career cut short.”A version of this article appears in print on March 11, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Royals Heed Plea to End Violence Against Women.
