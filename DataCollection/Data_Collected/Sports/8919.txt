Sulaimon was dismissed Jan. 29, becoming the first player to be discharged in Krzyzewski’s 35-year tenure. During a conference call with Atlantic Coast Conference coaches Monday, Krzyzewski declined to comment. The university, citing student confidentiality in a statement Monday, said it “takes immediate action when it receives reports of alleged sexual misconduct or other violations of the student conduct code.”According to The Chronicle, an anonymous “former affiliate” of Duke basketball conveyed the allegations, which were lodged separately by the two students, at two Duke diversity retreats, to the team psychologist. Subsequently, the affiliate told The Chronicle, Krzyzewski, three assistant coaches and other athletics officials, including White, were told of the allegations.Citing “sources close to the women,” The Chronicle reported that the immense popularity of Duke basketball had played a role in their decision not to file complaints with law enforcement or the Office of Student Conduct.The Durham Police Department confirmed Monday that it had no report on Sulaimon. According to Duke’s sexual misconduct policy, written under Title IX, the federal anti-discrimination law, “All employees who become aware of conduct that might fall under this policy are expected to notify the Office of Student Conduct with the names of the parties involved and the details of the report.” That policy also encourages students to report such conduct, providing confidentiality if requested.“Any allegation of student misconduct that is brought to the attention of our staff and coaches is immediately referred to the Office of Student Conduct in Student Affairs, which has responsibility for upholding the Duke code of conduct,” White said in the statement. “The athletics department does not investigate or adjudicate matters of student conduct, and cooperates completely in the process.”Advertisement
