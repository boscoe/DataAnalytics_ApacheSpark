CreditKatie Orlinsky for The New York Times        It is difficult to tell if the musher standing behind a sled pulled by 16 dogs and wearing a puffy red parka and a face protector shrouded in frost is a man or a woman. But in competitive sled dog racing, it does not really matter.The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, promoted as “the last great race on earth,” is a 1,000-mile trek across some of the world’s harshest terrain, from the wilderness of the Alaskan interior to the rugged coastal town of Nome. The 2015 race started with almost 80 teams of dogs and mushers from the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, France, New Zealand and Australia.This year’s race also includes a notable increase in female competitors. Among the top contenders is Aliy Zirkle, who has finished second in the Iditarod the past three years and is the only woman to have won the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest.Other female challengers this year include Jessie Royer, 38, who grew up in Montana and has won the La Grande Odyssée, in the French and Swiss Alps, and Michelle Phillips, 46, from the Yukon, in Canada, who won the Yukon Quest 300-mile race. DeeDee Jonrowe, 61, a cancer survivor, has competed in the Iditarod since 1980 and finished in the top 10 of the race 16 times.In 1985, Libby Riddles became the first woman to win the Iditarod, and Susan Butcher won it four times after her. A woman has not won the Iditarod since 1990, but that might change this year — women make up nearly a third of the entries.A version of this article appears in print on March 14, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Enduring an Odyssey as Equals.
