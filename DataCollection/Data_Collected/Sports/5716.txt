Cardinals (11-5) at Panthers (7-8-1)4:20 p.m. Eastern Line: Panthers by 6 ½Led by a third-string quarterback, Ryan Lindley, the Cardinals lost their last two games, and they have not scored more than 17 points in a game since Week 13. A Super Bowl contender when Carson Palmer was healthy, the team has fallen on hard times.In contrast, the Panthers are led by the franchise quarterback Cam Newton and have been one of the hottest teams in the past month, so their losing record has been rendered meaningless.A big reason for the change in momentum: The Panthers have shown flashes of the defensive brilliance that carried them to the playoffs last season. A makeover of the secondary seemed disastrous early on, but the rookies Tre Boston and Bene Benwikere stopped the bleeding, and the team has won four consecutive games since putting them in the starting lineup.There will not be much heavy lifting for the Panthers’ defense. Arizona has not proved capable of running or passing the ball, so as long as Newton puts a few points on the board, Carolina should keep its winning streak going as the memory of its difficult season begins to fade.Pick: PanthersA version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Saturday's Wild-Card Matchups.
