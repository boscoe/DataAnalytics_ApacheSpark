CreditJosh Ritchie for The New York Times        VERO BEACH, Fla. —  The Montreal Alouettes football players, dozens of them, jogged out of the Jackie Robinson meeting room to a practice field wearing shorts, cleats and Jackie Robinson T-shirts.Half of them wore a replica of the Brooklyn Dodgers No. 42 shirt that Robinson once wore on these very grounds; the other half had the design he wore for the Class AAA Montreal Royals, with the city’s name written on the front, above the spot where the players cradled the football, and Robinson’s No. 9 on the back.As the players for the Canadian Football League team shook off their off-season rust, tossing arcing spirals to receivers in the 20-yard end zone, fireworks exploded overhead. The pyrotechnics came from two fields away, where the Class A St. Lucie Mets played the Brevard County Manatees at Holman Stadium in the second annual Jackie Robinson Celebration Game, an event commemorating Robinson’s first major league game on April 15, 1947.It was a busy but poignant evening at the quaint campus once affectionately known as Dodgertown, the spring training home of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers from 1948 to 2008.AdvertisementThree years ago, the site was on the verge of becoming an industrial park or a wasteland. But because of the O’Malley family, which has not owned the Dodgers for more than 15 years, it is springing back to life.AdvertisementToday it is known as Historic Dodgertown and hosts events like C.F.L. minicamps, high school soccer games and junior college softball championships. Its players use the fields and pathways once patrolled by men like Sandy Koufax, Roy Campanella and Robinson.“We like it because we have everything we need here,” said Jim Popp, the longtime vice president and general manager of the Alouettes. “But you can just feel the history.”Popp stood near the rooms used by his team on its visit, the same rooms Dodgers players and coaches slept in decades ago. He watched as Coach Tom Higgins led his players through drills. Before the Alouettes’ first practice, on Wednesday, Popp provided each player with a one-page biography of Robinson, who played one season in Montreal, in 1946, before joining the Dodgers. It was the Alouettes’ second year at Historic Dodgertown, their first wearing the Robinson shirts.“It’s just to give them some perspective on who came here before us and blazed the way,” he said.When the Dodgers left Vero Beach in 2008, headed eventually to their new spring training site in Arizona, Dodgertown seemed doomed. Indian River County owned the grounds, but there was no high-profile tenant to move in. The old golf course that was long part of the complex was abandoned and overtaken by weeds, and the general infrastructure threatened to follow suit.Minor league baseball stepped in and tried to make a go of it as a multisport complex, despite one snag: The Dodgers, under the ownership of Frank McCourt, refused to relinquish the name Dodgertown, having reserved the rights to it for the team’s minor league complexes around the country.The new venture lost more than $1 million in two years, and minor league baseball withdrew.At that point, Peter O’Malley, scion of Walter O’Malley, stepped in to save his childhood springtime playground, which he later oversaw as owner of the Dodgers from 1979 until 1998. Peter O’Malley had vowed that the Dodgers would never leave Dodgertown under his stewardship, but he no longer had a say when McCourt decided to move the team in 2008.“The place was shuttered once,” O’Malley said in a telephone interview. “If it got shuttered a second time, it’s over. Some developer would buy it and convert it into some light industry or something. There are just too many memories there.”AdvertisementO’Malley was 10 when the Dodgers first moved to Vero Beach for spring training, in 1948. At the time, his father was chief legal counsel for the team, but by spring training in 1951, Walter O’Malley owned the team and young Peter and his sister, Terry, spent school vacations here. Peter’s first job out of college was administering the place.“I learned to drive on those grounds,” he said.The Brooklyn Dodgers established Dodgertown when they took over an old naval air station. They moved here in part, Peter O’Malley said, to escape the racist abuse and dehumanizing rules of segregation that Robinson and his teammates faced at their 1946 spring training camp in Daytona Beach. (They spent 1947 in Havana.) The air base was self-contained and safer, though not perfect, and Robinson would say he felt as if he were on a reservation.“It was not easy for Jackie,” O’Malley said. “But I think it was easier than it would have been anywhere else at that time.”They slept in the old barracks and ate in a communal cafeteria, and most everything the players needed was on site, from a swimming pool to movies.Much of that exists today, minus the barracks. The pool recently served as a training site for a Norwegian swimming club. There are basketball and tennis courts, meeting rooms, a cafeteria and 89 rooms for teams to rent. All of it is preserved and enhanced as a joint venture between the county, which owns the facility and makes capital improvements, and O’Malley’s group, which manages it.When O’Malley heard that minor league baseball was going to end its operation, he spoke to his sister, Terry O’Malley Seidler, and she agreed to help. O’Malley also secured the support of Chan Ho Park and Hideo Nomo, two former Dodgers pitchers.The four became the founding partners of the new project, which is clawing its way toward solvency. After McCourt was compelled to sell the Dodgers in 2012, the new team owners granted O’Malley use of the name Historic Dodgertown. The county built crisp new fields for baseball, softball, soccer, rugby, lacrosse and football, on which the Alouettes practiced for three days. The Edmonton Eskimos, also a Canadian football team, were scheduled to arrive the next day.AdvertisementThere is a growing list of international baseball teams that have trained there, including SK Wyverns from South Korea and the Italian, Chinese and South African national teams.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The busiest months are January, February, March and April, when the facility clatters with high school and college teams preparing for their seasons.The current administration is housed in offices once occupied by the Dodgers’ front-office executives. The old chairs used by general managers like Paul DePodesta and Ned Colletti, with the interlocking L.A. logo, were left behind, along with a trove of large photographs of famous Dodgers players and moments.Beneath those offices on Wednesday, an announced crowd of 5,915 at Holman Stadium, the same field on which Robinson, Steve Garvey and Mike Piazza once played, watched the St. Lucie Mets beat the Manatees.“I just walked around just now, and a lot of great memories came back to me,” said Phil Regan, the St. Lucie pitching coach, who played for the Dodgers from 1966 to 1968 and spent a few springs at Dodgertown. “I remember sleeping in those barracks, and, man, it was cold sometimes.”Also watching Wednesday’s game from the stands was another Dodgertown alumnus, Guy Conti, a former Dodgers and Mets coach who was a mentor to the Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez. Before the game, Conti stood on a little bridge traversing a brook near the stadium and pointed to spots all across the grounds.He gestured to a half-field about 30 yards away and explained how Maury Wills taught the art of stealing bases there, and one could picture Wills imploring players to be as daring as he was. Conti pointed to another area where Kirk Gibson took extra batting practice alone in the evening, long after everyone else had departed, and one wondered if it helped him hit that famous home run off Dennis Eckersley in the 1988 World Series.Then Conti looked over to where a porch once abutted the old lounge with a wooden bar (that still exists and is rented out for private parties) and chuckled.“That’s where I asked Johnny Podres to show me his changeup,” Conti said, imitating Podres’s downward throwing motion, “the same changeup I taught to Pedro.”AdvertisementFor those who spent any time at Dodgertown from 1948 to 2008, the memories can be irrepressible. That quality explains why O’Malley was so keen to preserve it. He said that the financial losses had shrunk steadily each year since 2012 and that the complex was within sight of breaking even. If it turns a profit, O’Malley said, he will reinvest it in the facility.To be sure, he has personal reasons for saving Dodgertown. But O’Malley’s goal is to make it profitable so that after he is gone, people less sentimental than he will be motivated to keep it alive for people like Popp and his Alouettes to carve out new memories.“It wasn’t only me that loved it,” O’Malley said. “Everyone did. You would walk around those pathways and bump into the players, wives, coaches, writers, trainers. It was like a small college campus, and it brought everyone together at that critical time of the year. There’s just too much history to let it disappear.”A version of this article appears in print on April 19, 2015, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Dodgertown 1, Ghost Town 0.
