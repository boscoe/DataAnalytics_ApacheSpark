Huddles With Mothers,” Jan. 29: In 1948, when I was 10, my friends and I played tackle football without equipment. We made sure we tackled was from the waist down; I cannot recall a single serious injury. Fairness was a priority, and if every player wanted to play quarterback, we rotated the position. We made certain that the sides were always equal. If there was a latecomer, we would insist he find another boy to join in.Contrary to the remarks of officials of the Texas Youth Football Association, we never considered that we were preparing ourselves for life or that we needed hard work and discipline. It was all about having fun.DANIEL CONNELL, Sonora, Calif.To the Sports Editor:It seems almost laughable for the N.F.L. to try to reassure mothers by suiting them up. All studies show, and common sense realizes, that there is no way a runner at full speed who collides with a 300-pound defender at full speed will not cause serious injury sooner or later, regardless of the equipment.The more parents realize this unpleasant truth, the less they will allow their sons to play this immoral sport.PETER J. RIGA, HoustonCheating, by Another NameTo the Sports Editor:Re “Gamesmanship vs. Cheating,” Jan. 24: I have a son who plays high school football and pays a lot of attention to professional sports. The article quotes Stephen Mosher, a sports ethicist, as saying, “If you don’t get caught, it ain’t cheating.”I fear for my son’s ethical development if this is what passes as sports ethics.TIM IGLESIAS, Oakland, Calif.To the Sports Editor:Tim Rohan used several examples demonstrating the fine line between gamesmanship and cheating in professional sports, and he seemed to imply that intentionally deflating footballs is similar. I disagree.Flopping, leaning into a pitch, framing the strike zone and inappropriately touching or moving a golf ball are acts performed by the competitor on the field of play, seen by television audiences, fans, referees, officials and umpires. Deflating footballs intentionally would almost certainly involve someone other than an athlete, and would without question be surreptitious.Further, the integrity of the game would be in more jeopardy and the act much more egregious if the athlete influenced a team employee of lower stature to carry out the deception.DAVID A.
