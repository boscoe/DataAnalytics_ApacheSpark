CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times        VIENNA —  In February 2010, at age 14, Jakob Poeltl attended an N.B.A. game, his first, between the Knicks and the Washington Wizards at Madison Square Garden.Even for Poeltl, a basketball-obsessed teenager who eclipsed his competition at home in both size and ability, a follow-up trip to the Garden without a ticket seemed unfathomable at the time.In Vienna, young athletes rarely harbor N.B.A. dreams.Almost six years later, Poeltl returned to the Garden on Saturday, scoring 19 points and grabbing 14 rebounds for Utah in a 77-75 victory over No. 7 Duke in the Ameritas Insurance Classic. Poeltl may soon be making regular visits to N.B.A. arenas after blossoming from infertile basketball soil into a possible lottery pick in next year’s draft, which would make him the first Austrian-born player in N.B.A. history.“I try not to pay too much attention to it, but it’s obviously around,” Poeltl said by phone last week about his rising pro stock, bolstered by his averages of 19.1 points — on 70.2 percent shooting — and 9.9 rebounds this season. “I guess either way it’s a good thing, too. The hype around myself, especially back in Austria, people back home have been telling me basketball is in the news way more often now. Even little kids get exposed to it.”AdvertisementFlorian Vetter, who covers sports for the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, began writing online recaps of Utah games during Poeltl’s freshman year last season, extending his outlet’s coverage beyond the usual staples like skiing and soccer.Advertisement“In Austria, there are a lot of people now who at least can put a name to basketball,” Vetter said.This month, Vetter described the intricacies of Vienna’s basketball landscape during a walk near Wien Mitte, one of the city’s busiest commuter areas. He stood out among the bustle in a 1990s-era Air Jordan jacket, which in a way signified his membership among a unique subset within the city: basketball fans.To regularly follow basketball in Vienna is akin to devoting one’s social life to an underground music genre — your fellow fans are few, but they are passionate and always looking to spread the significance of their affection to a wider audience.And Poeltl’s rise from local star to one of the best frontcourt players in college basketball has the Viennese basketball community brimming with hope.Inside Full Court Store, one of Vienna’s few basketball-specific shops, an employee, Peter Gruber, discussed Poeltl’s ascent. Like Vetter, he wore a garment telling of his affiliation to basketball — a vintage red Dennis Rodman Bulls jersey — and explained how he and his friends often pored over Utah box scores.“I think that we all hope that he will be the first Austrian N.B.A. player,” Gruber said of Poeltl.Peter Hofbauer, 17, who plays for Poeltl’s former club D.C. Timberwolves, thought an Austrian in the N.B.A. could create benefits beyond national pride, namely more government investment in the growth of the sport.AdvertisementThe D.C. Timberwolves’ president, Wolfgang Horak, saw the opportunity for social impact through Poeltl’s popularity. He said basketball could be an important bridge to help integrate recent waves of immigrants in Vienna.“The potential for basketball in Vienna is incredible,” he said.While his nationality has won him admirers in Vienna’s small pockets of basketball fandom, Poeltl has drawn the attention of pro scouts with an untraditional repertory. It is tempting to compare a 7-foot German-speaking basketball player to Dirk Nowitzki, but Poeltl’s game barely resembles that of a sharpshooting stretch forward.Zach Kuba of EV Hoops, a pro scouting service used by N.B.A. and international teams, said Poeltl had good footwork in the post and “does all the little things right,” and compared him to Cleveland Cavaliers center Timofey Mozgov.“Strong when they have the ball, can finish through people, can get good position in low post,” Kuba said, adding that Poeltl needed to gain more lean muscle.Utah Coach Larry Krystkowiak said he saw similarities between Poeltl and the former Ute and Golden State Warriors center Andrew Bogut.“Seven feet with great hands, runs really well, is athletic,” Krystkowiak said. “Andrew was really intelligent, a defensive presence. A throwback center more than a modern center.”Krystkowiak also broadly compared Poeltl to himself; coming from Montana, not traditionally a basketball hotbed, Krystkowiak played nine years in the N.B.A.Poeltl was unearthed from anonymity at an under-18 European tournament by the Utah assistant Andy Hill.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Played pretty tough.”Poeltl had not considered the option of playing collegiate ball in the United States before Utah’s staff contacted him.As the idea was cultivated through exhaustive conversations with his parents, Martina and Rainer, both former volleyball players for the Austrian national team, Poeltl also began drawing interest from professional clubs in Italy, Spain and Germany, in addition to other Division I programs.Martina Poeltl estimated that 25 colleges had contacted her son but said that the Pacific-12 competition and academics, and the relationships with Utah’s coaching staff, had been important factors.With Poeltl’s name gaining recognition in recruiting circles, Krystkowiak was one of the few coaches who traveled to meet with Poeltl’s family.Upon arriving in Vienna, Krystkowiak saw a city where signs of basketball life were difficult to find. Even in warmer weather, residents said, in contrast to American cities, it is unusual to walk to a park and expect a quality pickup game to form. Outdoor courts are mostly silent in the winter and are often not in prime condition. On a recent afternoon at Stadtpark, two parallel baskets with weathered chain nets went unused in a space smaller than a regulation half-court.Poeltl grew up kicking soccer balls on playgrounds until he joined a small local basketball club, and then D.C. Timberwolves, who play in the second tier of the Bundesliga. There, one of his coaches, Hubert Schmidt, immediately noticed unusual potential in a 12-year-old.“What you could see, there are no real limits,” said Schmidt, who often ignores the eight-hour time difference between Utah and Vienna to stream Poeltl’s games online.AdvertisementMany Austrian basketball fans treated the game against Duke, the defending national champion, as one of the biggest sporting events of the year. Last season Poeltl held Jahlil Okafor, the eventual third overall pick of the 2015 draft, to 6 points in the N.C.A.A. tournament, which tied a season low for Okafor.But many in Viennese basketball society also acknowledged that it would take the heightened status of an N.B.A. career for the general population to become enthusiastic about the sport. Horak took encouragement from the recent success of the Austrian national soccer team.“Austrians are like this — we had a really dramatic period with soccer, and now we have David Alaba,” Horak said of the Bayern Munich defender. “Now every game is sold out.”If Poeltl enters the draft after the season, former and current coaches said, his instincts and knowledge of the game should make for a clean adjustment as an N.B.A. player and a pioneer.“He’s a really bright kid,” Krystkowiak said, “whether it comes to common sense, academic work or his basketball I.Q., which is off the charts. I think he’s aware of it, but there’s certainly no internal pressure he’s putting on himself to carry the flag of his country.”If Poeltl does not yet feel the weight of a nation seeking its first basketball star, he understands the ramifications of his potential success.“I really hope it’s going to help basketball in Austria in general,” Poeltl said, “to get more kids interested in playing and maybe develop a little bit of a basketball culture back home, too.”Because of an editing error, a picture credit on Monday with an article about Jakob Poeltl, a top Austrian player at the University of Utah, misidentified the photographer. The picture of Hubert Schmidt, Poeltl’s former coach at D.C. Timberwolves in Vienna, was taken by Gyula Sopronyi, not by Sam Hodgson.A version of this article appears in print on December 21, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Standout at Utah, Unequaled in Austria.
