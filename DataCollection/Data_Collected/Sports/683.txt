Seahawks (2-2) at Bengals (4-0)1 p.m., Eastern time. Line: Bengals by 3N.F.L. Week 5 scores and highlightsCould this be the year that the Bengals finally break through to become more than a team that is good enough to make the playoffs but never advances? (Cincinnati is 0-6 in the playoffs under Coach Marvin Lewis, who is in his 13th season.) So far in 2015, this sort of progress seems entirely possible.Leading the leap forward has been Andy Dalton, who has gone from being a good quarterback to a very good one, a player who can make the type of big plays that win games. Dalton has completed 67.2 percent of his passes through four games for 1,187 yards with nine touchdowns and only one interception. His 123.0 passer rating dwarfs his previous career high of 88.8 in 2013. Dalton’s evolution mirrors the team’s growth. Coincidence? Probably not.The Seattle Seahawks, the defending N.F.C. champions, were 0-2 out of the gate, but their vaunted defense looks to be back to form after the return of safety Kam Chancellor. Chancellor’s impact could not have been more apparent than it was at the end of Monday’s game against the Lions, when he forced Calvin Johnson to fumble the ball just before he could cross the goal line for what would have almost certainly been a decisive touchdown. Opponents are averaging just 3.86 yards per play when Chancellor has been on the field and 6.02 when he has not.On offensive, quarterback Russell Wilson returns to his hometown to face a tough Bengals defense after being sacked six times by the Lions in Week 4. He may be without the injured Marshawn Lynch once again.PICK: BENGALSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
