MELBOURNE, Australia — The season-opening Australian Grand Prix felt more like a shooting gallery at a county fair than a Formula One race, as one by one, the 20 cars that showed up began to drop out of the competition.With the 10 teams’ budgets hitting a combined total of around $1.5 billion for the 20 races the season, and with four of the world’s major engine manufacturers powering them, it was an odd spectacle to find nearly half of the cars drop out of the race by its end on Sunday evening. All but one of the surviving cars was awarded points simply for having finished.Just 15 laps into the 58-lap race, Jenson Button’s engineer at McLaren Honda summed up the situation, after the British driver grazed another car trying to pass it while the two were in the last two positions: “There are only 13 cars left in this race, and there could be points available if we finish.”McLaren Honda is one of the better funded teams, as well as the series’ second-most successful team, so it was even stranger that it was in last place; its other car had dropped out even before it got to the starting grid when Kevin Magnussen’s car stopped on the circuit with a power unit problem. The two had qualified last and second-to-last.AdvertisementEight laps before the end of the race, Button told his team on the radio that he had a “big problem, big problem” with his gearbox, and he finished 11th — the only driver to not score a point.AdvertisementIt was no surprise, however, that at the other end of the grid, the 2015 season started the way last season ended, with the dominant Mercedes team and its two drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, leading the race from start to finish. It was an improvement over last year for Hamilton, when he had started from pole position only to have his car break down and he was unable to finish, with Rosberg taking the victory.This time, there was nothing to hold back the two-time world champion, prompting Arnold Schwarzenegger to get Hamilton to say together, on the podium, “I’ll be back.”“It’s an incredible feeling to continue on here from last year,” Hamilton said.Hamilton looked more impressed by standing next to the actor who portrayed the Terminator than with the way he destroyed the competition once again. It was his 34th career victory and second in Australia, the other coming in 2008.Rosberg may have finished only 1.3 seconds behind his teammate, but once again, the Mercedes cars were far ahead of the rest of the field. Hamilton finished 34.5 seconds ahead of the third-place driver, Sebastian Vettel, who was nevertheless pleased to finish on the podium in his first race with the Ferrari team.“They have a great package at the moment, both as car and drivers,” Vettel said about Mercedes. “Thirty-four seconds down the road, it will be difficult to beat.”Vettel’s Ferrari teammate, Kimi Raikkonen, was the last car to drop out of the race, after his team performed a bad pit stop and sent him off before changing the rear left tire, forcing him to retire with 16 laps left.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It could not even get its cars to start, though Manor had made a miraculous return from bankruptcy over the winter and spent only five weeks designing and building its cars.AdvertisementValtteri Bottas, who drives for Williams, injured his back during the qualifying session and was advised by doctors to not race, according to a team statement.As the cars began to line up on the grid, two more dropped out: Magnussen’s McLaren Honda and the Red Bull of Daniil Kvyat, which suffered a transmission problem. That left just 15 cars to start the race.At the start of the race, Pastor Maldonado, a driver for Lotus, was involved in an accident and dropped out.“Racing is like this,” said Maldonado, who brings a considerable budget to the team from his Venezuelan backers.His teammate, Romain Grosjean, found his car losing power on the formation lap before the start of the race, and he dropped out after the first lap as well, leaving only 13 cars.One of the sadder losses was that of 17-year-old Max Verstappen, of the Toro Rosso team, who made his debut as the youngest ever Formula One driver. Verstappen drove a solid race until just after a pit stop after Lap 33. His car began to send out plumes of smoke and retired. Before the pit stop he was in sixth place.The series has become so costly, its new hybrid engines so complicated to produce, and budget disparities between teams so massive, that only the strongest and richest teams managed to survive.“I think it shows how complex it really is, how difficult it is to master the challenge of making the car reliable for a Grand Prix and for the entire season, so that’s why you really have to say ‘chapeau’ to these guy,” said Vettel, pointing to the Mercedes drivers.A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2015, in The International New York Times.
