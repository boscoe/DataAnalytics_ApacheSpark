Cowboys (2-7) at Dolphins (4-5)1 p.m. Eastern Line: EvenN.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsLike Monty Python’s Black Knight, the Cowboys have stood in front of their opponents for the last seven games with their arms lopped off, insisting, “I’m invincible!” And like King Arthur, opponents have walked away after soundly beating them, shaking their heads and muttering, “You’re a loony.”The early-season optimism brought on by two convincing victories should have faded when quarterback Tony Romo broke his clavicle, but instead it persisted as a result of the N.F.C. East. Cowboys players and fans steadfastly believe there is no hole so deep that Romo cannot lead them out of.Without Romo, the Cowboys went 0-7. They were bad with Brandon Weeden in place of Romo and might have gotten worse when Matt Cassel replaced Weeden. They lost close games and they lost blowouts. They were sometimes unlucky, but they were mostly just bad. They even managed to get far less likable when Greg Hardy came back from suspension and reminded everyone of the league’s image problem.The true believers are not wrong; the Cowboys are mathematically alive. But at 2-7, 26 teams in the N.F.L. have better records, so they do not need a star quarterback as much as good scouts to determine whom they should target in the first few picks of next year’s draft.AdvertisementThere is no doubt that Romo’s return will kick-start the team’s offense, and Miami’s defense has been awful more often than it has been good, but the Dolphins make every attempt to bully opposing quarterbacks. It will be interesting to see how Romo reacts if Ndamukong Suh is able to get to him a few times.A win over the Dolphins, even on the road, is attainable, but with a matchup against currently undefeated Carolina next week, Dallas may want to wait before they start printing playoff tickets.AdvertisementPICK: CowboysWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
