CreditCooper Neill for The New York Times        Covering an event like college football’s national championship game is an exciting and challenging assignment. For the game Monday night between Ohio State and Oregon in Arlington, Tex., the wire services positioned photographers at all corners of the field and on the catwalks, and editors worked on-site and used card runners to make sure photos were promptly uploaded.I was the sole photographer for The New York Times and given the assignment to create something unique. Along with my digital cameras to send in images to the newspaper and the website throughout the night, I carried my trusty old Nikon 35-millimeter film camera to create double exposures. By shooting through a roll of film, rewinding, then shooting through again, I can juxtapose different aspects of an event in a single frame, hopefully enhancing for the viewer the sense of what it is like to be on the scene.With 35-millimeter film there is no screen to check exposure, focus or composition. The limited number of frames forces the photographer to be selective and to pay extra attention to the lights and darks in each frame. The shadows in the first frame become the canvas for the second exposure. I shoot through an entire roll, taking mental and physical notes of composition after each frame, then I pair and compose different elements when I shoot through a second time. There are ways to do this in Photoshop with a digital camera, but where’s the fun in that?A version of this article appears in print on January 18, 2015, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: Catching Layers of Action.
