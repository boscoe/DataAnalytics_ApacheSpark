Week 14 scores and highlightsFor Jameis Winston, who has been improving each week and is looking every bit like the top draft pick, this week may be his Christmas as the atrocious Saints defense rolls into town giving away yards and points the way a drunken Mardi Gras float captain gives away beads.The Santa Claus of this unit is unquestionably Brandon Browner, statistically the leagueâ€™s worst cornerback in 2015, according to Pro Football Focus. Browner may well finish by having the worst season by any defensive back in N.F.L. history. Quarterbacks have accumulated a 107.9 passer rating when throwing at him, and with four games to play, Browner needs two more penalties to become the most penalized player in a single season since 1999, the year the league first started tracking individual penalty statistics. (The former Houston Texans tackle Chester Pitts holds the record with 22 penalties in 2003.)Improbably, the Buccaneers are seventh in the N.F.C. playoff race, a game behind Seattle for the sixth seed, after starting the season 1-3.PICK: BuccaneersAdvertisement
