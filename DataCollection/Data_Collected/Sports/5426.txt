The N.F.L. likes to call it parity. This season, it looks closer to mediocrity.From the porous offensive lines to the suspect quarterbacking and poor tackling, from the inconsistent officiating to the multitude of costly injuries, the 2015 season has been filled with the unwatchable.Yes, the playoff races, particularly for the A.F.C. wild card, have been intriguing. Carolina’s chase for perfection has been noteworthy. The performances by the league’s top players — particularly the ones making substantial breakthroughs such as Cam Newton and Doug Baldwin on offense and Khalil Mack and Ziggy Ansah on defense — have been mesmerizing.There is also the noteworthy, if maddening, race to relocate to Los Angeles involving the Rams, the Raiders and the Chargers.As for the rest, maybe the playoffs and Super Bowl will go in a different direction than what we have witnessed since September.AdvertisementOne team not concerned with the postseason for the 16th straight time — remarkable in itself that anyone could miss the playoffs that many years in a row — is Buffalo. The Bills, under Coach Rex Ryan, epitomize how disappointing the level of play has been in so many cities. They brought in a high-profile coach and upgraded their talent level. They paid huge salaries to hold on to some key players.AdvertisementAnd they flopped.“I mean, I could tell you the common thread is this: That when you have high expectations and you don’t reach those things, that obviously you’re going to have a little more questioning,” Ryan said.Here is what has been most worth questioning thus far:PARITY If what the N.F.L. wants is nearly every team in contention to win a division or grab a wild card when the calendar turns to December, it came close to that goal in 2015.If what it wants is high-quality football from many of those teams, sorry.It is worthwhile to praise the work of the Panthers and Patriots, Cardinals, Broncos and Bengals, who pretty much for the entire season have risen above the morass. Second-half surges by the Chiefs, the Steelers and the Seahawks have been impressive.But also recall that Kansas City lost five in a row, going into a funk after blowing a game against Denver. Seattle wasted the best home-field advantage in the sport, falling twice at CenturyLink Field and basically being handed a win over Detroit by incorrect officiating. Pittsburgh was 4-4 and somehow lost to Baltimore at home.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            Most disturbing has been the level of play and coaching throughout the N.F.C. East and the A.F.C. South. It is possible both divisions will be won by teams without winning records.BLOCKING AND TACKLING Shield your eyes. These basic skills appear to have gone the way of the chip-shot extra point. One reason quarterbacking has been so spotty is the inability of linemen, tight ends and running backs to provide protection.No area requires bonding more than the offensive line, but even some units that enjoy that continuity have underperformed. If the Broncos disappear quickly in the race to the Super Bowl, the lack of solid blocking could be the determining factor.On the other side, it might be difficult to find a dozen strong tacklers in the entire N.F.L. In their defense, the rules about what is a legal hit have made some of them confused. But the very basics of wrapping up and keeping the head out of the play have been lost.AdvertisementQUARTERBACKING Someone recently wondered why the league did not simply expand to get teams into Los Angeles — or the cities abandoned through relocation — and maybe even into London in the near future. One good reason: Where will N.F.L.-quality quarterbacks come from?And what is N.F.L. quality for the position today? It seems fair to say that half of the 32 teams are not sure what they have behind center, and a bunch of those do not like what they have.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the future for quarterbacks is unpredictable, and when the aging crop of stars leaves, it is hard to see the college game producing a plentiful number of replacements.OFFICIATING For decades, it has been fashionable for fans to blame the officials for losses, while team owners, general managers and coaches have bitten their tongues and tried to shrug off officiating problems.Not anymore.There’s a growing sentiment that game officials have lost their way, and the N.F.L. will need to look long and hard into how it handles who is blowing the whistles; how to simplify the rule book; and how to better use the ever-improving technology.A version of this article appears in print on December 27, 2015, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Parity Strongly Resembles Mediocrity as the Game’s Fundamentals Suffer .
