CreditGretchen Ertl for The New York Times        BOSTON —  In the Canadian Women’s Hockey League, job titles are often ambiguous.An hour before a Boston Blades home game last month, team staff members scurried around the lobby of Milton Academy’s ice rink, their temporary home for the night.Blades General Manager Aronda Kirby pulled a variety of jerseys, hats and shirts from plastic storage bins and displayed them for sale on two folding tables. Nearby, Coach Digit Murphy directed members of the visiting Brampton Thunder toward their locker room and reminded fans as they arrived to post on Twitter about the game.As Blades players sporadically entered the commotion carrying their equipment bags, Carl Cincotti, the team photographer, filled up water bottles at a fountain.“I got demoted to equipment manager today,” he said, jokingly.The players do not always have defined roles, either. Megan Myers was in uniform for that night’s game, but watched the next afternoon’s game from the press box because the United States Olympian Meghan Duggan was available.AdvertisementMyers had passed up the opportunity to work an extra shift at Tatte, the bakery where she works full time. Like Myers, most of the C.W.H.L.’s approximately 125 active players have other jobs — as police officers, teachers, or in the local district attorney’s office — because they do not earn league salaries.AdvertisementIn its eighth season, the C.W.H.L. continues to face challenges as the home for women’s professional hockey in North America. The five-team league, which also has franchises in Calgary, Montreal and Toronto, has grown incrementally. The Blades, the only team in the United States, now fly to all away games, except those in Montreal. Their players also receive money for meals, usually for one a day.Stars like Hilary Knight and Brianna Decker, who a year ago played in the classic Olympic final against Canada, earn training stipends as members of the United States national team, have sponsorships and do not need part-time jobs to supplement their income. But most of their teammates have to buy their own sticks and skates. After games, all the players wash their own gear at home.The players are cognizant of the locker room dichotomy. Knight said she tried to help supply a teammate if a stick broke. Decker said she respected the extra effort of her less heralded cohorts, like Jillian Dempsey, who wakes up at 5:15 a.m. to prepare for her job as a second-grade teacher.“I give them more credit than myself,” Decker said.Knight turned down professional opportunities in Canada and Sweden, including one offer from a men’s league, to play for free in the C.W.H.L. European leagues offer salaries but have lesser competition, and many players for the United States national team also choose the Blades because of their proximity to the Woburn, Mass., training facility of the national team’s strength and conditioning coach, Mike Boyle.Although Knight missed the last month of this season with a broken foot, she was at her team’s final two home games, taking pictures with fans who are regularly in attendance.Fan interaction is a staple of postgame activities in the C.W.H.L. Players wait in the lobby after the final horn, signing autographs. Among the fans was Sophia Brooks-Randall, a 15-year-old from Providence, R.I., who owns three Blades jerseys and is a season-ticket holder. She often attends games with her 12-year-old sister, Peri, and is representative of the league’s core audience.But gaining new fans remains a challenge, particularly without more support from the N.H.L.Commissioner Brenda Andress said that her league maintained good relationships with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Calgary Flames, whose players have attended community events with local C.W.H.L. teams. Kirby said that the Boston Bruins honored the Blades at home games and donated items for fund-raising.AdvertisementBut the efforts of individual clubs pale in comparison to the support that the N.B.A. has provided for the W.N.B.A.“It’s really discouraging that the N.H.L. doesn’t view us as part of their family,” Murphy, the Blades’ coach, said. “I’m 100 percent positive if they viewed the product and see people want to come watch it, I think they will be on board.”Frank Brown, a vice president for communications at the N.H.L., wrote in an email that the league had a consultant examine the viability of a women’s professional league.“While it was determined the overall development of women’s hockey at the grass-roots level through the college level isn’t at a point where a professional league is viable, we very much believe in the importance of the women’s game,” he wrote. “But it’s going to take some more time, more development.”Andress disagreed that N.H.L. support was needed for her league to thrive.“I think that it would have been an easier path,” she said. “I think the path that we’re on will get us there.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Blades players approached Bruins forward Chris Kelly in the lobby.He later admitted that he had no idea the Blades existed, but he agreed to give a speech to the team as it boarded the bus.“It’s kind of crazy that we’re supposed to be their male version,” Blades forward Denna Laing said. “When we were there with them, it definitely didn’t feel like that. I hope someday we get there. I’d really like it if our team was seen as a professional team, like we’re supposed to be seen. It kind of felt like they were talking to a youth team.”Despite awkward moments during the encounter, Kelly praised the Blades players in a phone interview and said he thought it would be beneficial for the N.H.L. to partner with a league like the C.W.H.L. Kelly has two young daughters and said that he would like them to have the opportunity to play professionally if they choose to play hockey.Murphy said she hoped players could begin receiving salaries before the 2018 Olympics.“We’re losing a valuable part of our hockey population by not paying them,” she said.AdvertisementMurphy and Andress estimated that each team would need about $2.5 million per year to provide livable wages for each player, in addition to other team operating costs. The C.W.H.L. is sponsored by Scotiabank and other Canadian companies, but Andress said the league did not have any American sponsors.Both games during the Blades’ late-season series with the Thunder were filled close to capacity, although UMass Boston’s rink seats only 1,000 fans, and Milton’s arena is about the same size. To reach the goal of salaried players, larger crowds are necessary.For now, players pay a $150 fee to enter the league’s draft. During the season, each team is also asked to raise $35,000, Kirby said. To fulfill this amount, Blades players often have an allotment of tickets to sell.“They call it a professional league, but really we’re not paid and that’s a big misconception,” said Jocelyne Larocque, who plays for the Thunder and the Canadian national team.Laing, who works as a victim-witness advocate in the Essex district attorney’s office, and Thunder defenseman Laura Fortino, who was the first overall pick in the 2014 draft, are already making plans for law school and graduate school.Thunder forward Jesse Scanzano, a police officer, said she had thought about when she might have to leave hockey to concentrate on work or raising a family.Jenny Potter is a forward for the Blades and coaches at Trinity College in Hartford. But her children, 14 and 8, live in Minnesota, and Potter said she saw her family twice during the season, which runs from October to March.AdvertisementBlades defenseman Blake Bolden said: “You make a decision — do I keep going or am I going to move on with my life? That’s something that all of us have to think about at the end of the day, having our bills paid, one, and deciding how to balance the two.”Despite the lack of salaries, progress is evident. On Saturday, the Blades will play in the Clarkson Cup final, the C.W.H.L.’s championship game, in the Toronto suburb of Markham. For the first time, the game will be broadcast on the Canadian television channel Sportsnet, with the hope that new audiences will tune in to the product.“I think our game is growing,” Decker said. “We can only keep going up. In our generation, we looked up to N.H.L. players, and we’re hoping to change minds of young girls, young players, just to look up to us.”A version of this article appears in print on March 6, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: A League Full of Professionals, in Actions if Not in Pay.
