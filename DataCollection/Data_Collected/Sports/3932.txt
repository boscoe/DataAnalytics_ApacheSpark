Guard Geoff Schwartz, who was considered a key acquisition during the 2014 off-season but missed 14 games because of foot and ankle problems last year, was lost for the rest of the season with a broken left leg sustained in Sunday’s loss to the Washington Redskins.The offensive line was already missing two other starters. Guard Justin Pugh was sidelined against Washington with a concussion, and center Weston Richburg sat out with an ankle sprain. Coach Tom Coughlin had little information Monday on whether the injuries to Richburg or Pugh, who is going through the N.F.L.-mandated concussion protocol, had improved. Coughlin said he was hoping to get at least one of the linemen back in uniform for the game against the Jets on Sunday.“With Richburg, it’s going to be, how much improvement is there?” Coughlin said. “He tried it once, it wasn’t very good, and so we did the best we could to keep him off his feet and continue to treat it. So I’m hoping there’s an advantage to that, and I really won’t know anything until I hear probably tomorrow to what extent he’s able to do anything. So we’ll see.”Richburg practiced one day last week, but his ankle did not respond well to the workout.With backups on the offensive line Sunday, Eli Manning was sacked three times, and the Giants rushed for only 33 yards. But Coughlin did not indicate that the Giants had plans to add another offensive lineman.“This is our team; these are our guys,” Coughlin said. “Some of these people were not able to play, and I’m sure they felt very badly about that, but we have to go on. We did go on, and the result wasn’t very good, but nevertheless you have to keep fighting.”Advertisement
