Wambach said at the players’ official FIFA news conference that they talked “openly, candidly” with FIFA’s secretary general, Jérôme Valcke, but did not expect natural grass field to be approved ahead of the World Cup’s opening game on June 6.FIFA has insisted artificial turf does not affect the quality of play or increase the risk of injury.Wambach and Marta have expressed support for an anti-discrimination legal action filed in a Canadian court, and on Monday they offered FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Association a resolution that would have seen only the semifinals and final played on grass, while leaving the tournament’s earlier games on turf.But Wambach suggested in her comments to the reporters that the offer had been rejected.“I think FIFA has made their decision and they are sticking to it,” Wambach said. “The powers that be, the logistics, the timing — it just may not happen.”“It’s tough because as female athletes we want to be treated equal and we want to be playing on grass.”A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Ronaldo Repeats as Player of the Year.
