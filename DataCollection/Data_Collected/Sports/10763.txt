Lydia Ko missed a chance to break the L.P.G.A. Tour record for consecutive rounds under par, closing with a bogey for a one-over-par 73 on Friday in the second round of the ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Needing a birdie on the par-5 18th to extend her streak to 30, Ko, 17, hit her second shot into the water. On Thursday, Ko shot a 71 to tie the record set by Annika Sorenstam in 2004. Ko was seven strokes behind the leader, Sei Young Kim, in the year’s first major tournament on the women’s tour.■ Andrew Putnam made a late charge to pass the three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson and take a one-shot lead after two rounds of the Houston Open. Putnam birdied six of his final nine holes to finish at 12-under 132. Mickelson shot 67 for a share of second place.A version of this brief appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Golf; Ko Misses a Record.
