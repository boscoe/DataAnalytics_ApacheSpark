CreditKevin Liles for The New York Times        ATLANTA —  Four years ago, the high school basketball standout R. J. Hunter entered his mother’s bedroom in Indianapolis and interrupted her sleep with some news: He would cast his college basketball lot with Georgia State.Delivering the scoop by phone to his father prompted the boilerplate parental response: Sleep on it, and let’s revisit the decision tomorrow. Ron Hunter immediately wished he could retract those words, seeing as how he was the Panthers’ coach.“I was mad at myself, thinking, ‘I shouldn’t have done that,’ ”he said.R. J. stuck by his decision, delighting his parents. Not only would the three reunite in Atlanta, Ron’s home away from home for the past year, but they would get a close-up perspective of R. J.’s transition to college life that most parents of top athletes are denied. Besides, R. J. might fortify Ron’s job stability at a program that was floundering and largely ignored.But as the journey apparently approaches the finish line, the Hunters are experiencing a hodgepodge of emotions that have complicated what at first seemed an ideal situation. R. J. has second-guessed himself as player and son. Ron struggled to balance the roles of father and coach.AdvertisementAmy Hunter, the mother and spouse, has spent plenty of days consoling R. J., debating and even arguing with Ron and defending both in this tangled intersection of relationships.AdvertisementSo when R. J., a 6-foot-6 junior who is projected as a late first-round N.B.A. draft pick, locked himself in a courtside embrace with Ron on Saturday in what was probably his final home game, neither man could stop the tears, nor could Amy as she watched from the stands. None of them regretted R. J.’s choice, but each was relieved that the pressure at home would dissipate.“Honestly, as much as I’ve loved coaching my son, which has been one of the best blessings in my life, if you asked could you do it again, I don’t know,” Ron Hunter said at practice as the top-seeded Panthers (22-9) prepared for the Sun Belt Conference tournament this week.“If I were in R. J.’s shoes,” he added, “I couldn’t have played for my dad.”Familial collaborations are not uncommon in college basketball. Pete Maravich said he would have been barred from the house forever had he not joined his father, Press, at Louisiana State. The Knicks alumnus Allan Houston took patriarchal direction at Tennessee. The highlight of Homer Drew’s distinguished coaching career at Valparaiso was son Bryce’s N.C.A.A. tournament buzzer-beater that remains a staple in TV promotions for the tournament.Jim Larranaga, now at Miami, coached his two sons at previous stops. Virginia Coach Tony Bennett graduated from Green Bay, where his father, Dick, worked, as its career scoring leader. One of the most accomplished duos completed their alliance only a year ago, when Doug McDermott of Creighton was the consensus player of the year under the guidance of his father, Greg.“I was very careful during practice and games that anyone watching couldn’t tell that we were father and son,” said the elder McDermott, who has counseled Ron Hunter. “He was careful not to give a crazy look that a son would give his father once in a while.”Another guideline from Greg McDermott that the Hunters have adopted: “When he came to our house, we didn’t talk shop.”As Ron Hunter has discovered, coaching a son with a future in the N.B.A. heightens the challenge.“I probably was more critical of him and pushed him harder than others,” McDermott said.AdvertisementIn his freshman year, R. J. vented frequently in person and via text message to Amy Hunter about perceived harsh treatment from his father, whose soft-spoken child-rearing contrasts with his shouting in the gym.“The first time I got yelled at, it was weird,” recalled R. J. Hunter, who had fielded offers from teams in the five major conferences. “I didn’t know how he was as a coach. He gets on everybody.”Amy Hunter recognized that, for R. J., the line between father and coach became blurred. She listened and commiserated without always agreeing. One standard line of advice: Trust his coaching instincts because “he knows you better than anyone else.”“Sometimes,” said R. J., who considered transferring, “I’d get mad at her. You want her to be on your side.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

When R. J. Hunter was 10, his father threw hitting practice for the youth baseball team. He tossed underhanded to everyone but his son. The others swung at underhanded tosses. With his son, “It was overhanded, 90 miles an hour,” he said. R. J. Hunter quit the sport that day.Neither father nor son was fully prepared for awkwardness on issues as simple as how R. J. should address him. For a week, they tried Coach until the title was abandoned.“When he needed a hug, I couldn’t do that,” Ron Hunter said. “I couldn’t be Dad. I needed to be the coach.”As all athletes do away from games and practices, the Panthers would gripe about their coaches. R. J. decided to take a cue from Doug McDermott, now a Chicago Bulls rookie, who told his Creighton teammates when they vented about Greg to not withhold their feelings.“They start talking, and I listen,” R. J. Hunter said. “Sometimes I’m the one complaining.”AdvertisementAfter Saturday’s victory against Georgia Southern, the ever-demonstrative Ron Hunter resembled an angry bull, sprinting toward the Georgia State student section that contributed to the program’s third sellout ever — the first was inspired by a postgame Jay Leno performance years ago — and pounding his chest. It was more than a gesture of thanks to supporters who drowned out a sizable Georgia Southern contingent, which displayed a sign that read, “If my dad was coach, I’d start too.”The crying returned for both while speaking to members of the news media after the game.“It’s hard coaching your son, man,” Ron said, choking up. “I’m saying this as a father. I’m proud of my son.”R. J. Hunter, who has amassed more career points than any current N.C.A.A. nonsenior, scored 35 during the 72-55 victory, including three 3-pointers from several feet beyond the arc. His father has learned to stifle himself when the seemingly low-percentage shots are launched. Nepotism? No. He has witnessed too many find the mark.The family chose not to partake in Senior Day festivities, which is an option for underclassmen turning pro, partly owing to R. J.’s uncertainty on leaving. It might be time for some separation. Twice this season, R. J. Hunter asked to leave practice early, according to his father, who believed his son felt overwhelmed by the enormity of the burden.Ron Hunter, who now takes calls from colleagues coaching their sons, is torn. He knows that a pro-ready player deferring advancement to the N.B.A. might be ill-advised, but another year in college would extend the Panthers’ successful run.Most of all, the father will miss seeing his son traversing the campus. He will miss less R. J. Hunter’s standard greeting, which would no longer be necessary with an N.B.A. contract: “Dad, I need $20.”A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: At Georgia State, Father and Son Seek Balance as Coach and Player.
