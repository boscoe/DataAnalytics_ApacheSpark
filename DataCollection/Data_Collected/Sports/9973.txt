JACKSONVILLE, Fla. —  North Carolina’s focus has wandered in so many different directions that it was hard to figure out which team would show up Saturday night against Arkansas.Would it be the Tar Heels who lost several games this season after blowing big leads, and almost did so again in their N.C.A.A. tournament opener here against Harvard? Or the talent-rich Tar Heels who built those leads in the first place and showed flashes of meeting the huge expectations for the program?North Carolina, a No. 4 seed, hung on the precipice again with a 10-point lead and about seven minutes to play. But coalescing behind point guard Marcus Paige, the Tar Heels finished off the frenetic Razorbacks with equal parts grit and style, 87-78, and advanced to the West’s round of 16 in Los Angeles next week.Paige scored 22 points, 20 of them in the second half, after opening 1 of 8 from the field. His teammates made up for his struggles with balanced scoring; Justin Jackson finished with 16 points, J. P. Tokoto had 13, and Nate Britt scored 10 off the bench. It was the 750th career victory for North Carolina Coach Roy Williams.AdvertisementPaige, a silky-shooting left-hander, did not let a cold first half dampen his confidence. He hit 4 of 6 attempts in the second half, including all three of his 3-point tries. After not getting to the free-throw line in the first half, Paige made all five of his foul shots in the second.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “I was getting some decent looks,” Paige said. “I just was rushing it a little bit. I think their pressure sped me up a little, so I just wanted to come out and let the game come to me.”Michael Qualls led No. 5-seeded Arkansas with 27 points, and Bobby Portis, the Southeastern Conference player of the year, scored 18. The Razorbacks shot 30 percent in the first half, 37 percent for the game.Advertisement“That’s what great players do,” Arkansas Coach Mike Anderson said of Paige. “He kind of put us back on our heels after we did a pretty good job of keeping him in check.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

North Carolina forced 21 turnovers, turning those into 23 points, and outscored the Razorbacks by 40-24 in the lane.North Carolina’s toughness and focus had been questioned during much of the season, and the Tar Heels’ near-collapse in their opening game of the tournament against Harvard only added to the evidence file. They blew a 16-point lead in the second half against Harvard, and Harvard actually took the lead with just over a minute to play, before Jackson won the game with two late baskets.Carolina blue-bloods would prefer not to mix luck with their basketball. But the first thing they heard from Williams was, “It’s the luckiest I’ve ever felt after a basketball game in my entire life,” and he added that he felt as if he had just won the lottery.“I don’t know that I’ve ever gotten my club’s full attention,” Williams said Friday.The Tar Heels focused at least enough to survive past the first weekend and extend their tournament legacy into another round of 16.“We didn’t have the type of regular season we wanted,” Paige said. “We had some bumps in the road, and we weren’t a typical Carolina team in terms of our record this year and our seed and stuff. Our fans expect us to have a No. 1 seed over all every single year.“But we understand the moment. You’ve got to win six games. Once you’re slotted in the tournament and you’re in position, it’s up for grabs.”A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: North Carolina Stays Focused in Victory Over Arkansas.
