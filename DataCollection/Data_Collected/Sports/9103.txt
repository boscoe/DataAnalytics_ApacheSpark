CreditLuke Sharrett for The New York Times        RICHMOND, Ky. —  For many boys in the Bluegrass State, the ultimate dream is to one day play basketball for the University of Kentucky.Dominique Hawkins was no exception.“As a kid growing up, all you do is watch Kentucky basketball and basically saying you want to be that guy,” Hawkins, a 6-foot sophomore guard, said. “I had those thoughts when I was little.”Hawkins’s high school coach, Allen Feldhaus Jr., knows the feeling. Feldhaus’s father played for the Wildcats under Adolph Rupp, who coached Kentucky to four national championships and 876 victories from 1930 to 1972. Feldhaus’s brother, Deron, was one of the so-called Unforgettables — four seniors on the 1991-92 team who led the Wildcats to the N.C.A.A. tournament’s round of 8 (they lost to Duke on Christian Laettner’s buzzer-beater). Three of them were Kentucky natives.“The last good Kentucky team to have a lot of Kentucky kids on it was my brother’s team,” Feldhaus said. “That’s why their jerseys are in the rafters.”AdvertisementBut Feldhaus never played for Kentucky. Instead, he suited up for Eastern Kentucky, about 25 miles south of Kentucky’s Lexington campus and a mile from Madison Central High School, where Feldhaus has coached the boys’ basketball team for 22 seasons. It was at Madison Central that Feldhaus helped Hawkins achieve his dream.AdvertisementWhat Hawkins lacked in size, he made up for with athleticism. He was built like a football safety, said South Florida Coach Orlando Antigua, a former Kentucky assistant. Hawkins led Madison Central in scoring all four years. During his senior season, 2012-13, the team won the state title, and Hawkins was named the commonwealth’s Mr. Basketball.Yet the team in Lexington — the one with the most wins in N.C.A.A. history, the one that has made three of the past four Final Fours, the one whose fanatical followers call themselves Big Blue Nation — barely noticed him until the end of the season, when Hawkins put on a show in the Kentucky Sweet Sixteen, a statewide single-elimination tournament at Kentucky’s Rupp Arena. Eventually, he received a scholarship offer from the Wildcats.“What makes me proud of him is this is where he wanted to be, and in order to get there, he had to set goals,” his mother, Denise, said.As a Kentucky freshman, Hawkins played sparingly during the regular season and not at all in the first two rounds of the N.C.A.A. tournament. Then, suddenly, he was tapped to play serious minutes in victories in the round of 16, the round of 8 and the Final Four. (Kentucky lost the national title game to Connecticut.)Hawkins tried only one shot in those three games; his job was to guard the other teams’ best perimeter players, including Michigan’s Nik Stauskas, who became the eighth overall pick in the N.B.A. draft.As a sophomore, Hawkins has again played little. Then again, under Coach John Calipari, No. 1 Kentucky (30-0) has nine former McDonald’s all-Americans on its roster, quite possibly the deepest in college basketball history, so for the Wildcats to have a former Kentucky Mr. Basketball as a reserve is not that surprising.Expected to enter the N.C.A.A. tournament as the top overall seed, Kentucky is seeking to become the first Division I men’s basketball team to finish undefeated since the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers. Hawkins has started seven games amid injuries, averaging a little more than 10 minutes in them, mainly to help maintain Kentucky’s unusual platoon system, in which two five-man lineups split minutes. When the freshman Trey Lyles returned from an illness in mid-February, Hawkins assumed his well-worn groove on the bench.AdvertisementAfter Lyles’s first game back, Calipari said his reasoning was that “Dom’s good; he’s just not as good as some of the other guys, and they deserve their minutes.”Now Hawkins waits, mainly playing at the ends of games after Kentucky has blown out the opposition, unsure whether he will get the call again.“He was in this same position a year ago,” Calipari said, adding, “So I know we can count on him if we need him.”Local FavoritesFans enjoy rooting for hometown heroes — just ask those in the stands at Cleveland Cavaliers home games. But this particular passion is especially strong at the college level, with programs thickly embedded in a community’s fabric and dependent on in-state talent.“I tell this to all Kentucky players we get involved with in the recruiting process,” said the Kentucky women’s basketball coach, Matthew Mitchell, whose star this season, Makayla Epps, is from Lebanon, Ky., and is the daughter of the former Wildcat Anthony Epps.“There’s something different when they call the starting lineup, and it’s Makayla Epps or it’s been any of our Kentucky kids,” Mitchell said. “It’s just different.”Anthony Epps is one of several Kentucky players who have hailed from the state. There were Richie Farmer, another of the Unforgettables; Jack Givens, who led the Wildcats to the 1978 national title; Rex Chapman, who helped win the 1988 Southeastern Conference championship, which was subsequently vacated because of N.C.A.A. violations; and Darius Miller, who is featured at least as prominently on the walls of Kentucky’s basketball complex as one of his teammates from the 2012 national title team, the budding N.B.A. star Anthony Davis.Hawkins, one of two in-state players on scholarship at Kentucky, is granted similar affection.“It’s like a hometown here, so they all love him,” the freshman guard Devin Booker said of Hawkins and the crowd at Rupp Arena. “I mean, they all love everybody. But obviously, it’s a special feel for Dom.”Basketball HotbedIt would be difficult to prove that there is a state more obsessed with college basketball than Kentucky. Louisville — which, of course, has its own major program, coached by its own storied coach, Rick Pitino — is set to be the Nielsen-metered market with the highest college basketball ratings on ESPN for the 12th straight year.AdvertisementBut the state, which ranks 26th in the country in population, does not provide the steady stream of top-notch recruits that would ensure the kind of sustained excellence its fans demand.“Kentucky isn’t a fertile state for high school talent,” said Evan Daniels, the director of basketball recruiting at Scout.com. “It’s just not.”Feldhaus noted that the annual Indiana-Kentucky high school All-Star Game routinely pitted a Kentucky team with only a couple of players headed to major programs against an Indiana team loaded with players headed there.“Truthfully, we just don’t have that many national-caliber players,” he said.Pitino, when he coached Kentucky from 1989 to 1997, began recruiting out of state more, helping build rosters that reached three consecutive Final Fours and win two national championships — the second coming under Tubby Smith, who took over after Pitino left to coach the Boston Celtics. Under Smith and his successor, Billy Gillispie, Kentucky experienced several fallow seasons, by its standards, in the 2000s.Enter Calipari, who was hired before the 2009 season. He had reached the Final Four with Massachusetts and Memphis (both trips were later vacated after the N.C.A.A. found violations) and was renowned for recruiting the country’s top prospects.Calipari’s biggest stars have come from outside Kentucky, including three who were selected to this year’s N.B.A. All-Star Game. According to The Louisville Courier-Journal, Calipari and Kentucky’s football coach, Mark Stoops, used nearly half a million dollars in private jets for recruiting purposes during the 2013-14 season.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Though the team is centered on the stellar big men Karl-Anthony Towns and Willie Cauley-Stein and the twin guards Aaron and Andrew Harrison, 10 members of the roster, if not more, including Hawkins, would probably start at most other Division I programs.To best use all his players (and to showcase them and get them drafted, the better to keep the recruiting pump primed), Calipari devised the platoon system. No Kentucky player averages more than 26 minutes per game, and nine have played at least 17 minutes a game. Kentucky routinely substitutes four or five players at a time, providing spectators with the sight of about 400 inches of talent jogging to the scorers’ table, checking in and hunching over, waiting for the next dead ball and the horn.The team has been a juggernaut, with an average margin of victory of 21.4 points. But Kentucky came close to losing after largely abandoning the platoon system because of a season-ending anterior cruciate ligament injury to the junior Alex Poythress. On Jan. 10, Kentucky barely slipped by Texas A&M in two overtimes in College Station, Tex.For seven of the next nine games, Calipari put Hawkins on the Blue Platoon, which starts. Hawkins averaged more than nine minutes in those games.Many in and around the program recognize there is something special about Hawkins’s presence on the team.“It gives us Kentuckians a sense of pride when they’re in the game,” Joel Childers, a 51-year-old fan, said last month while attending a live recording of a popular show on Kentucky Sports Radio.But wins are the real currency.Alice Wang, 60, who moved to the state in 1987, summed up many fans’ attitudes.“We love our Kentucky boys — if they can play for Kentucky,” she said.Seeking a TitleEven though Hawkins does not get a lot of minutes, no one doubts that he can play.Advertisement“His toughness is quite evident when you watch him play,” Feldhaus said. “You can challenge him. You can say, ‘I think this is the best guy on the other team; we need someone to lock him down.’ ”Sitting in her living room in Richmond recently, Denise Hawkins said Dominique had been a mischievous boy. A teacher told her to encourage him to play basketball.“He would wad up papers and shoot them in a trash can,” Denise Hawkins recalled.Hawkins, the oldest of five children, discovered his talent on a concrete court in Dillingham Park that had futuristically-arched hoops and was nicknamed the Dirt Bowl.Most of his friends also played basketball, he said, “and that made me love it even more.”By middle school, Hawkins had the self-assurance to prefer to get his teammates involved. But when the game was on the line, “he’d take over,” one of his former middle school coaches, Chester Rose, said.Hawkins was able to dunk in the seventh grade, and by eighth grade, he was playing for Madison Central’s junior-varsity squad.For most of his senior year, Hawkins’s main suitors were the in-state midmajors Morehead State and Western Kentucky. Later, more prominent programs like Butler, South Carolina and Purdue expressed interest.Marquis Estill, Hawkins’s cousin and the only other Madison Central graduate Feldhaus remembers playing for Kentucky, urged Antigua, the former Kentucky assistant, to look at Hawkins. Antigua watched Hawkins practice after he had helped Madison Central defeat Henry Clay in a regional playoff game at Eastern Kentucky’s 6,500-seat Alumni Coliseum in Richmond. “When you’re hearing about a kid that good in state, locally, who always wanted to go to Kentucky, you’ve got to take a closer look,” Antigua said.Antigua’s endorsement, combined with a rare noncompetitive season for Kentucky (it failed to receive an N.C.A.A. bid and lost in the first round of the N.I.T.) and the Kentucky Sweet Sixteen’s fortuitous location at the Wildcats’ arena, led Calipari to attend Madison Central’s 60-56 victory over Hopkinsville in the state semifinals. Hawkins had 30 points and 10 rebounds.AdvertisementIn March 2013, Madison Central was celebrating its title in the state capital, Frankfort, when Feldhaus received a call asking him to take Hawkins to Kentucky’s practice. It was there that Calipari informed Hawkins he was inclined to offer him a scholarship. On April 10, Hawkins held a news conference in the Madison Central gym to announce he would be staying close to home and playing for the Wildcats.Challenge to AdaptDenise Hawkins said Calipari had assured her son he would receive more playing time in his junior year. On a team that is known for its towering height, Hawkins is noticeably small.“Offensively, I don’t think he’s been able to relax since he’s been there,” Feldhaus said.Hawkins agreed.“I feel like I’m a way better shooter than I am,” he said.On defense, Hawkins has been more effective, but he acknowledged that it had been challenging to adapt to Calipari’s scheme, which requires perimeter players not to be too aggressive.“Basically don’t overplay your player,” Hawkins said, describing the coaching philosophy.If he is called upon during the tournament, as he was last year, Hawkins will be ready, he said. He was unexpectedly asked to contribute in 2009, when the Madison Central varsity team’s starting point guard was injured in the first minute of a game and his backup proved ineffective. Feldhaus put in Hawkins, who was 14. Playing more than 16 minutes, he went 4 of 5 from the field for 8 points, with 2 assists and 2 steals.Hawkins, who is majoring in communications, said he dreamed of playing in the N.B.A. someday. But in the meantime, he has another goal: to bring a title back home to Kentucky.“I don’t like losing,” he said. “If I get to play 40 minutes and lose, I’m going to feel bad about myself. If I play five minutes and win, I’m going to feel better. I just want to get to the ultimate goal and win a national championship.”A version of this article appears in print on March 7, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Beloved in Kentucky, but Benched for the Wildcats.
