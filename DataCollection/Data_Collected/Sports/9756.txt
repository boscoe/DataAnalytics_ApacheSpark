DAYTON, Ohio —  As a reward for beating Manhattan, 74-64, here on Tuesday night, Hampton will play undefeated Kentucky, the top overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament, on Thursday night in Louisville.This week, before the Pirates’ victory, the TNT basketball analyst Reggie Miller said that it would “take almost an act of God” for any team to beat the Wildcats.So Hampton Coach Edward Joyner Jr. tried to summon divine intervention by feigning a phone call at his postgame news conference. He picked up his cellphone and said, “I told you all I had Jesus on speed dial.”He added, “Hey, Jesus: They want to know how much of a mountain and what our odds are.”Silence followed. “Hello? Hello?” Joyner said, drooping his head.Jesus had apparently hung up, or perhaps he does not take long-distance calls. “I guess he’ll get back to me,” Joyner said.A version of this article appears in print on March 19, 2015, on Page B17 of the New York edition with the headline: Kentucky’s Opponent Hopes for Divine Intervention; Harvard Aims for an Upset.
