NASHVILLE —  Because of their bullpen depth and the value he might bring in return, the Yankees have explored trade possibilities involving their closer, Andrew Miller, this off-season. On Wednesday, though, they traded a different left-handed reliever.Justin Wilson, who had a 3.10 E.R.A. in 74 appearances last season, was shipped to the Detroit Tigers for the pitching prospects Luis Cessa and Chad Green. Both are right-handed starters who address the Yankees’ need for rotation depth in their farm system.“You see the way the value of starting pitching is in the marketplace,” General Manager Brian Cashman said. “It’s an area of weakness for us. Some of my focus has been on trying to backfill from Double-A on up. These guys go right into Triple-A, and they can compete, obviously, for any opportunities that make themselves available in our starting rotation, maybe even our ’pen.”The Yankees have six major-league-caliber starters — Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, C. C. Sabathia, Nathan Eovaldi, Ivan Nova and Luis Severino — but each worked fewer than 170 innings this past season.Cessa, 23, joined Detroit from the Mets in the Yoenis Cespedes trade in July and ranked as the Tigers’ No. 6 prospect, according to MLB.com. Green, 24, ranked 19th.Cashman said Chasen Shreve, James Pazos and Jacob Lindgren could compete for Wilson’s role. “But I’m also not done,” Cashman said. “I’ve got a lot of other conversations that are still in play.”A version of this article appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees Trade Reliever for Two Pitching Prospects.
