Falcons (5-1) at Titans (1-4)1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 4.5N.F.L. Week 7 scores and highlightsTitans quarterback Marcus Mariota is hopeful he will be able to play after sustaining a sprained ligament in his left knee after taking a low hit against the Dolphins last week. But his mobility may be somewhat limited if he does play.“My knee has felt better every day,” Mariota said. “We’ll see how it goes, and hopefully I’ll be ready Sunday. I’m preparing this week like I’m going to play.”PICK: FALCONSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
