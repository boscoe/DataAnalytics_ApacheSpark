RoundupBy The Associated PressA power-play miscue cost the visiting Rangers a chance at equaling the longest winning streak in team history.Valtteri Filppula’s short-handed goal ended a tie late in the third period, and the Tampa Bay Lightning ended the Rangers’ nine-game run with a 2-1 victory Thursday night.“It doesn’t matter how many games you win, when you play you want to win every game,” Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist said. “This one, the way we lose, it’s extremely frustrating.”Dominic Moore scored for the Rangers, who fell one short of matching the franchise record of 10 straight wins accomplished in 1939-40 and 1972-73.In their first meeting since Tampa Bay beat the Rangers in Game 7 of last season’s Eastern Conference final, Filppula scored with 1 minute 5 seconds to play off a 2-on-1 pass from J.T. Brown.“Maybe I was a little too aggressive,” Lundqvist said of going after Brown. “A tough way to end it.”Tampa Bay also got a goal from Alex Killorn. Ben Bishop stopped Chris Kreider’s penalty shot in the third and finished with 20 saves, improving to 9-0 against the Rangers in the regular season.Tampa Bay is 4-7-2 over the last 13 games, scoring 21 goals during that stretch.“It’s got to turn around at some point,” Coach Jon Cooper said. “We had to get the break, and clearly that’s a big break. The first short-handed goal of the season to be a game-winner.”The Lightning are without the injured forwards Ryan Callahan, Tyler Johnson, Ondrej Palat, Cedric Paquette and Jonathan Drouin. All are day to day except for Palat, who could miss three to five more weeks with an ankle injury.Moore tied the score at 1 from in-close at 13:43 of the third after Tampa Bay defenseman Anton Stralman could not control a pass from Bishop behind the net.“We spent a lot of time in their end,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said. “Didn’t get enough for it. At the end of the night, this game is about two plays with the puck. Two mistakes that we made, and they made us pay for it.”Killorn opened the scoring 14:47 into the first after Filppula made a nice steal of a pass by Keith Yandle just inside the blue line to set up Killorn’s goal from the high slot.Nikita Kucherov nearly made it 2-0 on the next shift, but Lundqvist stopped his breakaway shot.Lundqvist, who is 17-13-6 against the Lightning, stopped 26 shots.PENGUINS 4, AVALANCHE 3 Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin scored, helping Pittsburgh beat visiting Colorado.Malkin scored on a power play for his seventh goal of the season, and Crosby netted his third.STARS 3, CAPITALS 2 Alex Ovechkin scored his 484th goal in the N.H.L., breaking Sergei Fedorov’s record for Russian-born players, but Dallas bounced back to win at Washington.Ovechkin’s goal came at 7:01 of the third period, tying the score at 2-2.BLUES 3, SABRES 2 Alexander Steen scored a shootout winner, and Jake Allen made 32 saves to give St. Louis a home win over Buffalo.Kevin Shattenkirk and Vladimir Tarasenko scored in regulation for the Blues.COYOTES 3, CANADIENS 2 Martin Hanzal and Shane Doan scored in the first period, and Arizona held on for a road victory over Montreal.Oliver Ekman-Larsson also scored for the Coyotes.BRUINS 4, WILD 2 Loui Eriksson scored three goals, and Boston beat slumping Minnesota at home.Eriksson wrapped up his third career hat trick when he converted a perfect give-and-go from David Krejci early in the third.SHARKS 1, FLYERS 0 Melker Karlsson scored 3:45 into overtime, and Martin Jones made 34 saves in his third shutout of the season, giving San Jose a victory at Philadelphia.Joonas Donskoi set up the game-winner on a two-on-one with Karlsson.DUCKS 3, PANTHERS 1 Andrew Cogliano and Cam Fowler scored to lift Anaheim to a road win over Florida.Jakob Silfverberg also scored for Anaheim, and Frederik Andersen stopped 23 shots.SENATORS 3, BLUE JACKETS 0 Erik Karlsson scored twice and had an assist, Craig Anderson made 25 saves, and Ottawa beat visiting Columbus.Advertisement
