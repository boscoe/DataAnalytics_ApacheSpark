COLUMBUS, Ohio —  On Friday, West Virginia used a ferocious and swarming press defense to fluster and overpower Buffalo in a messy game of fouls and errors and body slams.That was the case again Sunday night as the fifth-seeded Mountaineers muscled past No. 4-seeded Maryland, 69-59, and into the round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Despite a clunky shooting display — including a 36 percent showing in the first half — West Virginia (25-9) forced 23 turnovers and battered the Terrapins inside and out.Melo Trimble, Maryland’s star freshman guard, scored 15 points but left the game midway through the second half after two hard falls. He was first blindsided and subsequently leveled by a screen early in the period and later clanked his knees on the court while leaping for a pass. He walked over to the team’s bench with his face buried in his jersey.Without Trimble — who did not return to action because of a head injury, according to a team spokesman — the Terrapins (28-7) came apart. They turned the ball over on their first possession without him and quickly fell behind by as many as 9 points.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Before that, this was a bruising tussle between heavyweights whose campuses are separated by a three-and-a-half-hour drive.AdvertisementDevin Williams, a muscular 6-foot-9, 255-pound sophomore forward from Cincinnati who wore goggles as if to channel his inner Horace Grant, scored 16 points, pulled down 10 rebounds and bullied his challengers in the lane.AdvertisementAs he did two days before against the Bulls, Williams seemed to embody the powerful and relentless Mountaineers, who will play undefeated Kentucky on Friday in Cleveland.“They’re just another team,” West Virginia’s Devin Williams said of Kentucky. “They put their drawers on the same way we do.”Despite a tepid display of shooting in the first half, West Virginia led by 35-34 at intermission. Maryland turned the ball over eight times in the first 20 minutes, and six of those blunders were off the hands of Dez Wells, a senior forward who has otherwise steadied the Terrapins this season. He finished with 9 points and 8 turnovers before fouling out late.A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: West Virginia Overpowers Maryland.
