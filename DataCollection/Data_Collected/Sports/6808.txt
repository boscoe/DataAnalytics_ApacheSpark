Derrick Rose scored 22 points on Thursday as the Bulls beat the San Antonio Spurs, 104-81, in Chicago. The Bulls, who had dropped six of eight games, handed the Spurs their most lopsided loss of the season. Rose, who criticized his team after Monday’s loss at Cleveland, went hard to the rim against San Antonio and made 9 of 16 shots from the field.■ Kobe Bryant tore his right rotator cuff in the Los Angeles Lakers’ latest defeat, the team said Thursday. Bryant was injured Wednesday in the second half of the Lakers’ game at New Orleans when he drove to the baseline for a two-handed dunk. A magnetic resonance imaging test Thursday in San Antonio revealed the tear, and Bryant returned to Los Angeles while the Lakers prepared to play the Spurs on Friday. The Lakers declined to speculate on the severity of the injury, but many rotator cuff injuries require surgery and several months of rehabilitation.Bryant, 36, briefly returned to the game in New Orleans and played essentially with one arm after the injury, making a 14-foot jumper with his left hand. He is a right-handed shooter.■ Pau and Marc Gasol were voted to start in the N.B.A. All-Star Game, the first brothers to earn the honor at the same time. Pau of Chicago is joined in the East lineup by Kyle Lowry of Toronto, John Wall of Washington, LeBron James of Cleveland, and Carmelo Anthony of the Knicks. Marc of Memphis joins Stephen Curry of Golden State, Anthony Davis of New Orleans, Blake Griffin of the Clippers, and Kobe Bryant, whose participation is in doubt because of injury.A version of this brief appears in print on January 23, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Rose Leads Bulls in Rout of Spurs.
