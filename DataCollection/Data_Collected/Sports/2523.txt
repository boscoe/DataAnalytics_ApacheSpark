Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul was added to the team’s active roster Saturday, which makes it almost a certainty that he will play Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Pierre-Paul has not played since last season and has practiced with the team for only the last two weeks. He has been sidelined since a Fourth of July fireworks accident caused the amputation of his right index finger and damaged his thumb and middle finger.On Friday, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said he was pleased with Pierre-Paul’s progress and called his practice efforts “all positive.” It is likely that Pierre-Paul will be used on a limited number of plays, especially in pass-rushing situations.The Giants also placed middle linebacker Jon Beason (knee, ankle) on season-ending injured reserve.
