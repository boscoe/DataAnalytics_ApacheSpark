It was a gathering place for friends, with a pool table inside and football games out front. The door was always open.“It literally was, because they had a screen door,” said Henry Diaz, one of Carroll’s boyhood friends. “You could walk in and say hello to his parents, even if he wasn’t there, and Jim and Rita would tell you to come in.”Across San Francisco Bay, the house where Marshawn Lynch grew up sits next to a freeway in Oakland, one of the most crime-ridden cities in the country. It was a hiding place from deadly shootings, drug deals and prostitutes out front. The gate was always locked.Who’s going to win? What color will Katy Perry’s hair be? What about the commercials? Make your Super Bowl picks and predictions and share your ballot with your friends.Carroll, the 63-year-old coach of the Seattle Seahawks, is the gregarious face of the franchise, an energetic and talkative ambassador who speaks in paragraphs and exclamation points.AdvertisementLynch, the team’s 28-year-old star running back, represents the team’s attitude. He lets his legs and a wake of empty-handed opponents do the talking while he cultivates a public persona of brooding detachment and distrust.AdvertisementAt Tuesday’s Super Bowl media day, Lynch sat at a podium for five of the session’s 60 minutes, answered more than 20 questions with the same sentence — “I’m here so I won’t get fined” — and left. Carroll spent the hour cheerfully answering queries of all kinds, including many about Lynch.“I don’t think he’s being misunderstood,” Carroll said. “I think people are starting to learn about who he is and what he’s all about. He’s a treasure.”Carroll and Lynch make a strange, perfect pairing, forming one of the great odd-couple partnerships in sports. As the Seahawks sit on the verge of a second consecutive Super Bowl title, each is indebted to the other for his own N.F.L. career makeover and for Seattle’s current run of success.Before arriving in Seattle in 2010, Carroll had middling success as an N.F.L. coach with the Jets and the Patriots and a stellar, if scandal-tinged, run in college football at Southern California. He inherited an aging Seahawks team that had won nine games the previous two seasons under Mike Holmgren and Jim Mora. Carroll wanted to build an offense around a powerful running back.Lynch, a first-round draft choice in 2007 and a Pro Bowl selection in 2008, was in his fourth season with Buffalo, but the match never felt right. He was sometimes in trouble and felt persistently out of his element in the cold of western New York.The Bills sent Lynch to the Seahawks during Seattle’s bye week in October 2010. Seattle paid with fourth- and fifth-round draft picks.Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson said that running back Marshawn Lynch should not be fined for refusing to answer questions at Super Bowl media day on Tuesday.Among the first things Carroll told Lynch was that he had no interest in changing him. We don’t have to be the same, a Seahawks axiom goes, but we have to play as one.AdvertisementLynch made his first big impression in that season’s playoffs, when his tackle-breaking, ground-shaking, game-clinching 67-yard touchdown run against New Orleans announced a new era in Seattle.In the four seasons since, Lynch has 1,181 regular-season carries for 5,357 yards and 48 rushing touchdowns — leading the N.F.L. in all of those categories in the span since 2011.When the Seahawks trailed the Green Bay Packers by 16-0 midway through the third quarter of the N.F.C. championship game, Lynch took over. He gained 120 of his 157 rushing yards after halftime as the Seahawks won in overtime, 28-22.“He was just alive — ripping,” Carroll said last week. “He had a couple catches, too. It’s been an extraordinary season that he’s put out here because he’s been so consistent for so long and he’s been so physically right for so long. He looked explosive again. He looked fast. His attitude is always there. He was able to take advantage of space and, sometimes, no space.”No back strikes fear into defenders the way Lynch does. His ability to shake tackles and carry opponents is a metaphor for his background and the foundation for his Beast Mode nickname. He attended and starred at Oakland Technical High School, then accepted a scholarship at California, just a few minutes from home, in Berkeley.In three seasons there, he gained 3,230 yards, a faithful following and a place in program lore by commandeering an injury cart and driving it around the field after a wild victory.He has attained folk-hero status in Seattle, too, with his bruising runs and his in-game penchant for Skittles — a flashback to childhood, when Lynch’s mother, Delisa, fueled him with the “power pellets” during games. After the Super Bowl last year in East Rutherford, N.J., he danced through the locker room while wearing a ski mask, a hood and a towel over his head.

He has been fined at least $100,000 by the N.F.L. for not fulfilling requirements with the news media, and he sometimes answers every question with the same response. At last year’s Super Bowl, he appeared at the mandatory media day and lasted for six of the session’s 60 minutes before leaving.Advertisement“I heard he did a great six minutes,” Carroll joked at the time. “Some comedians make a career out of that.”It has earned him a reputation as an eccentric, something that friends and teammates argue is a misinterpretation. Lynch is an icon in Oakland, where he spends much of his off-season, running a football camp for hundreds of children and building a foundation.Last fall, reports said that the Seahawks might cut Lynch after this season to avoid paying the $7 million in salary he is due in 2015. Lynch could consider retirement, though a few more seasons like the past couple would most likely elevate him to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.It has people in Oakland imagining a homecoming, with Lynch giving the rebuilding Raiders a marketable mass of hometown attitude.But could Lynch thrive without Carroll? Could Carroll win championships without Lynch?Like Lynch, Carroll exudes the personality of his childhood surroundings. He was born in San Francisco, and his family moved across the Golden Gate Bridge to the open spaces and tranquillity of Marin County in the 1950s.“It was pretty idyllic,” said Diaz, a close friend of Carroll’s since they were 14.At Redwood High School in Larkspur, as part of the class of 1969, Carroll was an undersize football player — and a classmate of the actor and comedian Robin Williams’s. He played at the local community college, the College of Marin, and then at the University of the Pacific before he climbed into coaching.One of Carroll’s great strengths over the years has been relating to players of all backgrounds. On Monday, he was asked how he had maintained that connection as he grew older.“Just kind of naturally,” he said.But he works at it. He makes a point of staying tuned into trends — popular YouTube videos, for example — so that he understands the jokes and the lingo his players use. While Marin County was home to many aging rockers of the 1960s and 1970s, Carroll was a fan of Motown as a teenager and is now a fan of rap, which he cranks to high volume during Seahawks practices. His rules are more relaxed than other coaches’ — be yourself, but be a team — which allows players, like Lynch or the outspoken cornerback Richard Sherman, to be themselves.Advertisement“I’ll say this, and let me say it again,” Carroll said Monday when asked how he handled Lynch. “We still celebrate the uniqueness of our players. We celebrate the way that they see the world as they fit in with our football team.”There may be no football coach better able to communicate with men one-third his age than Carroll. Much of that comes from acting a bit like one of them.“When I see him running around the sideline, I think: That’s the kid I’ve known almost all my life,” Diaz said.Diaz plans to be at the Super Bowl on Sunday as one of Carroll’s guests. It is appropriate. Along with several others from the neighborhood, they watched the first Super Bowl together 48 years ago at Carroll’s house. The door was open.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Odd Pieces, Perfect Fit.
