I knew that it would take a unique opportunity to leave the University of Florida and that is clearly how I look at this situation.”Donovan, who led the Gators to an overall record of 467-186, replaces Scott Brooks, who was fired as the Thunder’s coach after seven seasons. Oklahoma City finished this season 45-37, narrowly falling short of the final spot in the Western Conference playoffs. Kevin Durant missed 55 games because of injuries.Advertisement
