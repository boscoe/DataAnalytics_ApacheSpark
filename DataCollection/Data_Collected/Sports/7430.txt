Pictures posted on social media sites showed Manziel at night clubs and other locations. His extracurricular activities became an issue in training camp, and team owner Jimmy Haslam asked Manziel to focus more on football.Manziel started the season on the bench and then played in a handful of games before getting injured.Beckworth, did not specify what kind of treatment center the quarterback entered on Wednesday or how long he would be there.“Johnny knows there are areas he needs to improve on to help him be a better family member, friend and teammate, so he decided to take this step in his life during the offseason,” Beckworth said.Farmer added: “We respect Johnny’s initiative in this decision and will fully support him throughout this process.”Advertisement
