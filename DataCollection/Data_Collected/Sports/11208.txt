Herbert Warren Wind was one of the first to do this. In conjunction with the ’71 Masters, we had invited 200 clients to hear Herb talk about the coming event. However, as his longtime friend Bob Jones had died the week before, Herb told the group he would instead describe for them the main parts of Jones’s famous Grand Slam. In his wonderful understated way, and in his typical quiet voice, Herb proceeded to describe each of the four majors Jones had won, emphasizing individual holes and the shots the master had made. To say that the proverbial pin could have dropped during Herb’s talk is an understatement, and when he finished speaking, the room was totally silent. But as Herb began to leave, almost as one the audience rose and clapped, with a few cheers thrown in.FRED JACKSONWestport, Conn.To the Sports Editor:Karen Crouse’s article on Herbert Warren Wind was thoroughly enjoyable. However, devoted Wodehousians would take issue with her description of P. G. Wodehouse as a playwright. Certainly plays and books for musicals were wrought by the Master, but his nearly 100 novels and innumerable short stories, including some of the funniest golf stories reduced to print, are that for which he is far more widely known.SCOTT BROOKSLos AngelesThe Queen of Thieves To the Sports Editor:Re “Catch Me If You Can: The Lifespan of Baseball Records,” April 5: Your compelling visual of extraordinary achievements overlooked one startling stat.Rickey Henderson holds Major League Baseball’s stolen base record, 130 in a season. But a diminutive player named Sophie Kurys not only beat that record, she demolished it; in 1946, during the short-lived era of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, she stole 201 bases in 203 attempts, a feat recognized in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Until a major leaguer equals the astonishing achievement, all of us who love baseball should give Kurys the recognition she most certainly earned by stealing 201 bases. In a skirt.MARLENE H.
