Giants (4-4) at Buccaneers (3-4)4:05 p.m. Line: Giants by 2.5N.F.L. Week 9 Scores and HighlightsYou have to feel for Eli Manning. He returned to New Orleans on Halloween weekend, affording him the rare opportunity to trick-or-treat in his hometown. He threw six touchdowns and engineered an offense that scored 49 points, but the Giants still lost.The defeat is obviously not on Manning’s shoulders. The same cannot be said, though, for the Giants’ defensive coordinator, Steve Spagnuolo. His return to New Orleans, where he oversaw the worst defense in N.F.L. history in his lone season as the Saints’ coordinator, will probably haunt him for a while. The Giants’ defense gave up 614 yards of total offense in that game, while failing to sack Saints quarterback Drew Brees.On the bright side for the Giants, this game could include the return of their star defensive lineman Jason Pierre-Paul, who lost his index finger in July in a fireworks incident. Pierre-Paul played his college home games in Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium while at South Florida.PICK: GIANTSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
