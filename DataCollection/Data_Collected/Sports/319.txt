No structural damage was found in Luck’s throwing shoulder, but the team is choosing a cautious approach with the team’s most important player.The news sent fantasy football owners scrambling for a replacement quarterback:Now the Colts will turn to Matt Hasselbeck to fill in for Luck, which will dramatically alter their game plans. Hasselbeck, 40, has not won a start since October of 2012, but he has performed well in limited action as Luck’s backup so his familiarity with the team should help.The news was better for some other prominent players nursing injuries.Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie of the Giants is back after missing a week with a concussion. Jay Cutler of the Bears is active after missing last week with a hamstring injury. Arian Foster of the Texans, out all season with an injured groin, is back but will likely share a great deal of his workload with Alfred Blue. DeMarco Murray of the Eagles is active after missing last week with a hamstring injury.Among the prominent players who are not expected to play are LeSean McCoy of the Bills, Victor Cruz of the Giants, Luke Kuechly of the Panthers, DeSean Jackson of the Redskins, Davante Adams of the Packers and Alshon Jeffery of the Bears.Advertisement
