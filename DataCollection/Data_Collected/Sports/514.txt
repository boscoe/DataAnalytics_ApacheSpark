8:25 p.m.CBS, NFL NetworkLine: Texans by 1Four weeks into the season, the A.F.C. South appears to be the weakest division in the N.F.L. The good news for the Indianapolis Colts and the Houston Texans — two teams that have disappointed greatly after entering the season with playoff aspirations — is that the division looks up for grabs. Somebody has to win it.The Colts have dominated it of late, compiling 15 straight wins against A.F.C. South foes. Whether they can make it 16 will largely be determined by the status of quarterback Andrew Luck, who sat out Sunday’s 16-13 overtime victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars with a partial shoulder separation.“He was trending in the right direction throughout the course of the week,” Colts Coach Chuck Pagano said this week. “We’ll just take it day by day and see where he’s at.”The Texans, fresh off a 48-21 thumping at the hands of the Atlanta Falcons, will stick with Ryan Mallett at quarterback despite his failure to generate a point in nine offensive series Sunday. (The backup Brian Hoyer entered the game with the Texans down, 42-0, and engineered three touchdown drives.) And the team’s J. J. Watt-led defense has not lived up to the lofty expectations pinned to it in the off-season. Even if Luck plays, this game will probably be a tossup. The only thing that appears certain is that this one will not be pretty.
