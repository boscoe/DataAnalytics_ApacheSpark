As their list of general manager candidates expanded Saturday, the Jets also continued searching for their next coach. Three days after opting out of his contract as coach of the Buffalo Bills, Doug Marrone interviewed with the Jets, a person familiar with the team’s thinking said.Given Marrone’s head coaching experience and his history with the Jets — he spent four seasons as Herman Edwards’s offensive line coach — he is thought to be a strong contender to replace Rex Ryan, who was fired last week along with the team’s general manager, John Idzik.Marrone also worked in New Orleans at the same time as the Jets’ latest general manager candidate, Ryan Pace, the Saints’ director of pro personnel. The Jets have requested permission to interview Pace.Like many others on the Jets’ coaching list, Marrone, who guided Buffalo to a 15-17 record in two seasons, has drawn interest from other teams, including the Chicago Bears and the Atlanta Falcons. Of the Jets’ seven confirmed coaching candidates, three have yet to interview: Frank Reich, the San Diego Chargers’ offensive coordinator; Todd Bowles, the Arizona Cardinals’ defensive coordinator; and Gary Kubiak, the Baltimore Ravens’ offensive coordinator.A version of this article appears in print on January 4, 2015, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Jets Are Said to Interview Former Coach of the Bills.
