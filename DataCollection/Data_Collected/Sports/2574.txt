Antonio Brown set Steelers marks with 284 receiving yards and 17 catches, including a 57-yarder on the game’s final drive that set up a winning field goal. “I really don’t know what to say but ‘wow,’ ” said Raiders safety Charles Woodson, who spent most of the day futilely chasing Brown around Heinz Field. Brown and DeAngelo Williams, who ran for 170 yards and two scores and had 55 receiving yards, combined for 531 of Pittsburgh’s 597 yards of offense.The rookie Marcus Mariota, returning from a knee sprain that had sidelined him for two games, passed for a season-best 371 yards and four scores, the final one on a 5-yard pass in overtime that ended the Titans’ six-game skid. Mariota completed 28 of 39 passes, was not sacked and did not turn the ball over.Critics have accused Sammy Watkins of being unwilling to play through injuries, but on Sunday, at least, he shrugged off a sprained left ankle to record eight catches for a career-best 168 yards and a momentum-turning touchdown in the Bills’ win over the Dolphins. The fans chanted, “Sam-my!” as Watkins and the Bills left the field, but they had equal reason to cheer the running attack: LeSean McCoy had 112 rushing yards before leaving with an injury, and the rookie Karlos Williams had 110.Information from The Associated Press A version of this article appears in print on November 9, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: The Day’s Best.
