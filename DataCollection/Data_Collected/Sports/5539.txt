Thomas Greiss turned aside 30 shots.Toronto’s Jonathan Bernier again had trouble, getting beaten by the second shot of the game and giving up six goals on just 15 shots through two periods before James Reimer took over to start the third.Brad Boyes, Pierre-Alexandre Parenteau and Shawn Matthias had goals for the Maple Leafs (13-15-7), who beat the Islanders, 3-1, on Sunday at Barclays Center.Reimer, who was making his first appearance in net since missing seven games with an injury, made six saves.Nelson put the Islanders ahead by 1-0 when he cut to the middle of the slot and beat Bernier with a low wrist shot two minutes into the game.The Islanders’ lead did not last long, as Boyes scored 39 seconds later when he picked up a rebound at the top of the crease and put it past a sprawling Greiss.The Leafs controlled the pace of play after Boyes’s goal, but the Islanders restored their advantage when Josh Bailey put a slap-pass toward the front of the net that an open Tavares redirected over Bernier’s blocker at 11 minutes 51 seconds. It was just the fourth shot Bernier had faced up to that point.Nick Leddy found a speeding Nielsen to make it 3-1 for the Islanders at 17:45. After taking a pass from Leddy at Toronto’s blue line, Nielsen blew by a flat-footed Dion Phaneuf and beat Bernier with a backhand.Parenteau cut the Islanders’ lead in half with a wrist shot from the top of the face-off circle that beat Greiss to the low blocker side at 10:57.Any chance for momentum was halted, however, when Bernier gave the puck away behind his net and Kulemin was gifted an open look to make it 4-2 only 28 seconds later.Bernier received a subdued cheer from the home crowd when he stopped the Islanders’ 13th shot of the game, but he was beaten on the 14th by Martin with less than two minutes to play in the second.Making matters worse for the struggling goalie, Lee also beat Bernier with his club’s very next shot to make it 6-2 with 39 seconds to play in the period.Leafs Coach Mike Babcock challenged the goal for goalie interference but could not get it overturned and lost his timeout in the process.Matthias added a late goal for Toronto, beating Greiss to the glove side from the slot at the 16-minute mark of the third.Advertisement
