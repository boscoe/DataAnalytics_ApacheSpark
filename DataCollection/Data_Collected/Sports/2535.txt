The roots of one of the most agonizing pitches in Mets history date to February 2013. LaTroy Hawkins, then in the autumn of a 21-year career, arrived at camp in Port St. Lucie, Fla., as a savvy and analytical veteran.Even at 40, Hawkins pitched well for the Mets that season, and he exerted a big influence on a staff of impressionable young pitchers. One of those was Jeurys Familia, a hard-throwing right-hander who noticed that Hawkins occasionally threw a quick pitch, a controversial and increasingly prevalent stratagem designed to sabotage a batter’s timing. With the move, a pitcher does not come to a customary stop in the set position.Hawkins said that he began using a quick pitch in 2010 and that he continued with it, despite resistance from a few opponents, until his retirement last month with the Toronto Blue Jays.Hawkins never intended to spread the gospel of the tactic to the Mets. Nevertheless, Familia saw it and was intrigued. He assimilated the deceptive delivery into his repertory and had success with it over the next two years, mixing it in with his devastating 97-mile-per-hour sinking fastball.AdvertisementBut when Familia unleashed it in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the World Series, the result was disastrous for the Mets, and they never fully recovered.Advertisement“He and some of the guys asked me about it when I was there,” Hawkins said last week from his home in Texas. “I would throw it, and they wanted to know about it, so I told them. I said it’s only effective against hitters with big leg kicks, guys like Jose Bautista. It doesn’t work against guys with just a toe tap.”Guys like Alex Gordon.Gordon, the Kansas City Royals’ left fielder, tends to lift his front foot about five inches — more of a tap than a kick — as he awaits a pitch. That gives him plenty of time to adjust if the pitch arrives sooner than expected.The Mets were leading by a run, just two outs from stealing the first game of the World Series, and had their seemingly impenetrable closer, Familia, on the mound.But Gordon, who only seconds earlier had become aware of the possibility of the quick pitch, drilled the offering from Familia over the center-field wall to tie the score. The Royals went on to win in the 14th inning and take the Series in five games.No one can know if that home run deflated the Mets so much that they subsequently committed a catalog of errors. But like Kirk Gibson’s homer against Dennis Eckersley in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, it set a tone.“That was like a win and a half for the Royals,” Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees slugger and an analyst for the Series, said on the field a few days later. “Familia had been unhittable. Now they know they can get to him.”In late September, when the Yankees were playing the Mets at Citi Field, the Royals put five scouts in the stands to watch the games because both teams were potential postseason opponents.AdvertisementThe scouts, who then followed the Mets through the playoffs, marked down virtually everything the team did, like a third baseman’s looping throws, the holes in a slugger’s swing, and how long each pitcher took to deliver the ball.For the Royals, no level of scouting thoroughness was considered excessive. This was the same team that sent two scouts to Japan for a month to watch Trey Hillman manage before hiring him in 2007.But the quick-pitch information had somehow eluded Gordon, who stepped into the on-deck circle in the ninth inning on Oct. 27, preparing for perhaps the most critical at-bat of the Series.Normally, Gordon spends his time in the on-deck circle loosening up, he said. But having already done that, he watched Familia closely — like a scout. He had never faced him, but Gordon knew that Familia had been almost perfect for three straight months, including eight scoreless appearances in the playoffs.Then he saw it.Familia threw a quick pitch to Salvador Perez, the leadoff batter in the ninth. Familia got Perez to ground out on an 0-2 pitch, and Gordon strode to the plate, mulling over the visual data he had just compiled.“I wasn’t expecting that, and I wanted to make sure when I got on the box, I was ready to hit,” Gordon said.Rule 8.01(b) of Major League Baseball states that with men on base, the pitcher must completely stop his motion after coming to the set position with his hands at his waist. If he does not, it is ruled a quick pitch and a balk. But with no runner on base, as was the case in the ninth inning of Game 1, he may bring his hands down to his waist and throw without pausing. The hitter must be in the batter’s box and ready for the pitch — looking at the pitcher, in the opinion of the umpire — or the pitch can be called a ball.Johnny Cueto, a veteran Royals pitcher, uses the delivery, too.“I don’t have any problem with it,” Kansas City Manager Ned Yost said. “For me, pitching is about disrupting timing for the hitter. And most of the time, pitchers do it with fastballs, changeups, sliders. Some guys do it disrupting their timing in their delivery.”AdvertisementAs more pitchers used the delivery, especially this year, others took umbrage. As far back as 2011, the St. Louis Cardinals and their manager at the time, Tony La Russa, complained about Hawkins’s use of it, and in an August game this season, the Phillies were outraged when Mets reliever Hansel Robles used it against Darin Ruf.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Hawkins thought the Phillies’ reaction was excessive, and he sent a text message to Familia saying so.“I told him they never would have done that with me,” Hawkins said. “That was a total crock. They were just picking on a rookie.”Regardless of Familia’s delivery, his pitches are difficult to hit. He throws a nasty sinking fastball — some call it a split-finger fastball, but his fingers are not spread as wide as they would be for a more conventional splitter.The pitch is heavy and hard, and he used it to record 43 saves with a 1.85 E.R.A. in the regular season. Before Game 1 in Kansas City, he had not blown a save since July 26.“That guy throws a bowling-ball sinker,” Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said.Gordon took one of those 97-m.p.h. bowling balls, and he fouled off another to even the count at 1-1. Then Familia brought his hands to his waist and, without pausing, unleashed a sinker at 97 m.p.h.But it never sank. Perhaps it was because he was rushing his delivery, as Mets Manager Terry Collins later said. Or perhaps it would have stayed up in the zone even with a normal delivery.“I missed my location,” Familia said.The ball came in over the plate as if on a tee. Gordon did his toe tap and then uncoiled a swing that changed the course of the game and perhaps the Series. It was the only over-the-wall home run the Royals hit in the Series (Alcides Escobar had an inside-the-park homer), and the score was tied.
                This season, the Mets had four of the top 20 pitchers who threw the most pitches over 95 m.p.h.            For a hitter, timing is critical, and the pitcher seeks to thwart that timing. Just how hard is it to hit a fastball that is delivered a tick ahead of schedule?Advertisement“It can’t be that hard to hit if he just did it,” the Hall of Famer George Brett said of Gordon. “Jim Kaat used to throw it, too. But if it was so hard to hit, guys would do it all the time.”Even if the Mets felt that Familia had erred by using a quick pitch against a batter who did not use a high leg kick, they could not complain. Familia had been crucial to their success, and the quick pitch had been part of it.“I try not to say, ‘Don’t use that anymore,’ because it’s been an effective move for him,” Collins said. “We’ve got to realize when you do it, if you’re going to miss, you’ve got to miss in the dirt, not in the middle of the strike zone.”For many, the quick pitch is mere trickery, best used by someone needing a gimmick to enhance average stuff. But Familia, who first caught the attention of the Mets’ coaching staff by firing 98 m.p.h. as a 20-year-old in 2010 spring training, has overpowering stuff. That alone could be enough.“The quick pitch is in vogue right now,” Rodriguez said. “Generally speaking, if a guy has great stuff, why would he do anything that might disrupt his greatness? It’s almost like you’re doing the hitter a favor.”Hawkins had good stuff, too, but in his later years, he relied as much on guile to maximize his talent. As he grew older, he still fired fastballs in the mid-90s, but he tossed in the quick pitch for added effect.After the Blue Jays lost to the Royals in the American League Championship Series, Hawkins did not watch the World Series, he said, because he was busy preparing to open a cafe in Texas. He knew what happened, though.Familia, the young man who was once so intrigued by Hawkins’s quick pitch, had tried it on the wrong hitter.Advertisement“It’s not guaranteed to work,” Hawkins said. “It does get hit. If you use it, you still have to make a good pitch.”A version of this article appears in print on November 8, 2015, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: One Fateful Pitch, Two Years in the Making.
