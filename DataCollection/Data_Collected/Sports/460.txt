He was being held at the Hillsborough County Jail on $50,000 bond.Officials said Acosta sold the vessel, a 2006 Concept valued at about $167,000, for $22,000 to a boat dealer in Opa-locka, Fla., in July 2013 after claiming that he was doing so on behalf of Arroyo, who officials said knew nothing about the transaction.Arroyo, who grew up in Tampa, had bought the vessel, equipped with two outboard engines and capable of high speeds, in May 2007 and hired Acosta to maintain it and perform other duties while Arroyo was “away from his residence playing professional baseball.”In a 2009 video, taken aboard another boat in Sarasota, Fla., and posted by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Acosta is identified as a “childhood friend” of Arroyo, who narrated a tour of the vessel and called Acosta by the nickname Captain Tony.In 2012, Arroyo fired Acosta because he was “not reliable” and prone to “making mistakes,” according to an affidavit filed by the authorities on Oct. 1 to support an arrest warrant. “Arroyo told Acosta that he did not want him around anymore, and for Acosta not to contact Arroyo again,” the document said.Later, Acosta contacted Arroyo to inform him that his boat, which had been docked at the Westshore Yacht Club in Tampa, had sunk. Acosta said that it had been salvaged but would cost “several thousand dollars” to repair, according to the affidavit. The document said that Acosta “attempted to extract more money from Arroyo” to get the boat released from an unnamed yard, but when Arroyo “directed Acosta to stop calling him,” Acosta moved the boat to Opa-locka, where he ultimately sold it after forging the pitcher’s signature on a bill of sale.Arroyo, 38, did not pitch this season after having ligament replacement surgery in 2014, when he was a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks traded him to the Atlanta Braves on July 30, and Atlanta flipped him — and his contract and 2016 option — to the Los Angeles Dodgers that day as part of a three-team trade that also involved the Miami Marlins.Advertisement
