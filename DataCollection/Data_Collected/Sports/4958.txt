The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the St. Louis Rams are long shots to make the playoffs this season, but there are a pair of players having All-Pro caliber seasons worth watching Thursday night.Only three active running backs this season are averaging more than 80 rushing yards per game. One is Minnesota’s Adrian Peterson; the other two are Tampa Bay’s Doug Martin and the St. Louis rookie Todd Gurley. Those three are also the only players this season with more than 700 rushing yards on first downs, a good measure of how those three offenses revolve around these backs.Peterson and Gurley lead the league with five games with at least 125 rushing yards, while Peterson and Martin are the only two players with more than 1,200 rushing yards.The Buccaneers and the Rams lean heavily on their respective running games. St. Louis (5-8) has thrown for the fewest passing yards in the league; as a result, the Rams’ success depends heavily on the efficiency of the running game. Since a Week 1 victory against Seattle, in which the Rams’ passing game was uncharacteristically successful, St. Louis has not won a game with fewer than 150 rushing yards.AdvertisementTampa Bay, with a rookie quarterback in Jameis Winston, similarly leans on its rushing attack. The Bucs (6-7) run on 47 percent of all plays, the fourth highest rate in the league. Here’s another way to highlight these team’s identities: Three teams have completed fewer than 240 passes this season — Tampa Bay, St. Louis and the 13-0 Carolina Panthers.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Martin is having an incredible comeback season after a couple of down years. In his last 13 games before this season, Martin rushed for 608 yards on 3.8 yards per carry. In his 13 games this season, he has rushed for 1,214 on 5.1 yards per carry. It is a remarkable performance for a player who had a strong rookie season in 2012, but then followed that campaign with two nondescript years.In that sense, he serves as a cautionary tale for Gurley, the star rookie runner on the other sideline. The last first-round pick to average as many rushing yards per game as Gurley was Martin. (And before Martin, it was Peterson in 2007.) Gurley, like Martin, was a collegiate star, a first-round pick and a standout rookie. That combination often leads to a long and successful career, but Martin is a good example of the circuitous paths a running back’s career can take.AdvertisementMartin’s 2013 and 2014 seasons were marred by coaching turnover and injuries, including a torn labrum and knee and ankle injuries. Martin’s outlook was so bleak that Tampa Bay declined to exercise the fifth-year option on his contract in March. Given the tenuous status of Coach Jeff Fisher in St. Louis and Gurley’s own injury history (his college career ended because of a knee injury), Martin’s path shows how a great career is not preordained.But in the short term, these look to be two of the best backs in the N.F.L. Since Week 4, Martin (1,038 yards) and Gurley (966 yards) lead the league in rushing yards, while each has averaged more than 5 yards per carry and rushed for at least five touchdowns during that time.In a pass-happy N.F.L., the Rams and the Buccaneers have a pair of throwback workhorses worth watching.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
