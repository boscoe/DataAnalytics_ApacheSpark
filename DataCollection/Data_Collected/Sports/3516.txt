(The next Sunday featured coverage of the Paris terror attacks.) Over all, “The Hunting Ground” attracted an average of 457,000 viewers, second in cable news to Fox News’s 970,000.The documentary was shown in full despite legal action threatened by John A. Boudet, a lawyer for the football star Jameis Winston. Winston was accused of rape in 2012 while attending Florida State and is the focus of an extended segment in the film.Winston, now with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, did not face criminal rape charges and was cleared of violating Florida State’s student code of conduct. In a letter sent to CNN on Friday, Boudet said that the film “manipulates, misstates or simply omits facts to present a false narrative.”Boudet did not return a call and an email on Monday to see if Winston was proceeding with a lawsuit.Advertisement
