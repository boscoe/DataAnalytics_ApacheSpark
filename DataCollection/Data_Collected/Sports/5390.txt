Packers (10-4) at Cardinals (12-2)4:25 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 4.5Coaches have a tendency to heap praise on players who have unexpected success. But Cardinals Coach Bruce Arians may want to look around before complimenting his rookie running back David Johnson, a third-round pick out of Northern Iowa who has thrived filling in for the injured Andre Ellington and Chris Johnson.“He’s worked hard his whole life,” Coach Bruce Arians told reporters this week. “He had jobs at Northern Iowa cleaning latrines and working in the cafeteria. This is a very mature young man who’s paid his dues. He’s not like a guy who’s been given everything, highly recruited and they have a sense of entitlement. You have to be very aware of those guys.”Arians should be aware of those highly recruited players, since his team has quite a few of them. His quarterback, Carson Palmer, was the No. 1 overall pick in 2003 after winning the Heisman Trophy for Southern California in 2002. The Cardinals have plenty of other so-called “glory boys” like Larry Fitzgerald (No. 3 pick in 2004) and Patrick Peterson (No. 5 in 2011), along with a host of other celebrated first-round selections on offense and defense.But regardless of whether Arians may be attributing too much to Johnson’s humble beginnings, the fact that Johnson has rushed for 378 yards and three touchdowns in three weeks as a starter has done a lot to keep the Arizona offense in balance.A true test of the team’s depth may come this week, however, with cornerback Tyrann Mathieu out against the Packers and quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Pick: CardinalsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
