Jackson said the Knicks’ championship parade, on hiatus since he participated as a player in the last one in 1973, would not happen in 2016.“That would be like talking crazy,” he said. “But we really do think, progressively, we’re going to get better. I think teams have to take substantial steps, and that’s what we want to do.”Pressed on what he meant, Jackson said he hoped the Knicks could make the playoffs — which he also predicted last fall before blowing up an underachieving roster in midseason — though not as the Nets did this season, with a losing record.“I hope it’s not at the extent that well, we just made the playoffs and we’re not 35 and 47,” he said. “I want to see us having a winning record, and that’s a big jump to make.”Jackson appeared at the Knicks’ practice facility in a contemplative but playful mood, wearing an oversize button-down shirt, bluejeans and sneakers. As an example of how wrong the season had gone, he told the assembled news media, “You guys were bored,” and whimsically noted that certain reporters had had their assignments changed to avoid the numbing repetition of losses.But in shifting gears and staying upbeat, he added, “Getting two or three players of talent changes your direction quickly.”Here Jackson laid out the hypothesis of a plan that, he said, could not become operational until May 19, when the N.B.A. is scheduled to conduct the draft lottery that will determine whether the Knicks will choose anywhere from first to fifth.Should they have the worst possible lottery luck and end up with the fifth pick after finishing with the league’s second worst record, Jackson said, he would consider trading the pick, presumably for a veteran player and possibly a lower pick in the first round.But he pretty much dismissed the notion of surrendering the opportunity to select either of the premier freshman big men who have declared for the draft: Kentucky’s Karl-Anthony Towns and Duke’s Jahlil Okafor.He also seemed to say that Towns, the superior defender, would be his choice over the offensively gifted Okafor.“Bigs are a priority for us in the draft in that I believe that defense has to be a priority for us in having an intimidating force in the lane,” Jackson said.He cited the 1985 draft lottery — the league’s first — when the Knicks, with the league’s third worst record, wound up with the first pick in an equally weighted lottery and landed center Patrick Ewing. Jackson’s former Knicks teammate Dave DeBusschere is remembered for his fist pump on the dais that day, though Jackson did not sound eager to be the face of the Knicks during this year’s nationally televised event.He also reiterated what he said late in the season during an impromptu chat with reporters in Los Angeles — whomever the Knicks draft, that player is likely to be under 20 and not yet ready to be a franchise-altering impact player.The Knicks, however, should get back a healthy Carmelo Anthony after knee surgery and, Jackson hoped, be able to add talent with about $26 million in salary cap space (not including the money that will be slotted for the first-round pick).“A lot of our direction is about free agency, has to be,” he said.Contending that the team had five players under contract for next season and would not necessarily require a 10-player overhaul, Jackson said he believed the league was “moving into a new direction in free agency” with increased revenue expected after next season because of inflated television deals.“I think there may be shorter contracts that come out of this,” he said, meaning that some of the big-name free agents might be more willing to change locations and wait for a bigger score in 2016. “In that regard, it could be an asset for us.”But he also admitted that $26 million could disappear quickly in a competitive market that tends to overpay for even second-tier free agents.“We know we have to do some judicious shopping,” he said. “We’re not going to the dollar store, but we may not be one of the bigger ones.”He meant the Knicks might not get one of the bigger-name free agents — Memphis’s Marc Gasol and Portland’s LaMarcus Aldridge, to name two.Jackson defended his rookie coach, Derek Fisher, saying he had done a good job of “implementing, teaching, setting up a kind of methodology that we want to work from.” He again defended the decision to deal J. R. Smith and Iman Shumpert to Cleveland in January by rationalizing, “It doesn’t matter if you finish with 30 wins or 17.”He also insisted the triangle offense was here to stay and would ultimately be an asset in attracting talent that fits it.While saying that some players cared only about who their teammates would be, with the triangle, he said: “They’re going to get an opportunity to play in a game that enhances their skills. That part of it is one of the selling points of what we do. There are so many teams that play in a generic way that are similar. We have a unique style, and that attracts certain people.”By midsummer, we will know if he is thinking logically, especially on the triangle points, or wishfully.Advertisement
