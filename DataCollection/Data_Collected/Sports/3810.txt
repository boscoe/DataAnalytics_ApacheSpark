It’s a bottom-line business. It’s a production-based business. We expect to be better than we were.”Oakland’s defense still has a long way to go to match the reputation of its offense, but this week, the Raiders should score enough that their defensive shortcomings will be less apparent.Pick: RaidersAdvertisement
