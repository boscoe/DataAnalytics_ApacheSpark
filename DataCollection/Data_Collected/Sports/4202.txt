Week 13 scores and highlightsThe Ravens started the season 2-7, but despite losing Joe Flacco, Justin Forsett and Steve Smith for the season, they have won consecutive games and are still technically in playoff contention, with Matt Schaub doing his best to replace Flacco.The Dolphins, after a disappointing start to the season, have decided to turn over much of the decision-making on offense to quarterback Ryan Tannehill.A matchup of Schaub against Tannehill does not sound particularly appealing, but if the Dolphins can find a way to get Lamar Miller back into form, they should be able to come away with a victory.PICK: DOLPHINSAdvertisement
