AdvertisementSupported byBy Victor MatherWilliam Paterson, a Division III university in Wayne, N.J., forfeited a men’s basketball game on Tuesday night, apparently because the players declined to play after the departure of their coach.Paterson players left the floor shortly before tipoff of a home game against Ramapo College, The Asbury Park Press and other news media reported.The game was listed as a forfeit victory on both the Paterson and Ramapo athletic department websites on Wednesday morning.Paterson’s coach, Jose Rebimbas, revealed he was departing on Facebook on Saturday. “It is with great sadness and extreme frustration that after today I will not be coaching the basketball team at William Paterson University,” he wrote. “People I have trusted and served with have defied logic and are pursuing my termination because of a misunderstanding over a facility rental fee for a camp that I run.”He did not provide more details about the dispute over the rental fee, but said that he planned to fight to keep his job.Heather Brocious, the assistant director of athletics at Paterson, wrote in an email message: “Students have a right to express their opinion. Our men’s basketball team chose to do so by forfeiting the game against Ramapo College.”In regard to Rebimbas’s status, she wrote, “We don’t discuss matters regarding employees.”Ramapo Coach Chuck McBreen told The Associated Press that before introductions, William Paterson’s players dropped their warmup shirts on the floor and walked off.“It’s like someone knocked the wind out of our sails before we even started,” he said. “There’s no euphoria in getting this as a win.”The Paterson website listed Brian Chapman as the acting head coach, but as of Wednesday morning had no announcement about Rebimbas or the explanation for the forfeit.Rebimbas was in his 21st season as coach of William Paterson. His record with the team was 384-168, including this year’s 3-1 record before the forfeit. Last season, Paterson was 21-8 and made the second round of the N.C.A.A. Division III tournament.His players over the years included point guard Horace Jenkins, whom Rebimbas discovered playing in a park and who went on to a brief stint with the Detroit Pistons and a long career in Europe.Though teams boycotting a game is a rarity in college sports, the Missouri football team made national news this month when it threatened not to play unless the university president, Timothy M. Wolfe, under fire for his handling of racial tension on campus, departed.A brief video posted on Twitter on Tuesday night showed the announcement of the forfeit, followed by cheering from some in the stands.Advertisement
