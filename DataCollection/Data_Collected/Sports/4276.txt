8:30 p.m., ESPNLine: Redskins by 3 ½In case anyone forgot how the Dallas Cowboys did this season when Tony Romo missed seven games with a broken clavicle, it is best put numerically: 0-7.Expected before the season to be a powerhouse in the N.F.C. East, Dallas was anemic offensively behind the fill-ins Brandon Weeden and Matt Cassel, and there is no reason to believe things will be any different now that Romo is again out with a fracture of the same bone and Cassel is starting in his place. The Cowboys have somehow not been eliminated from playoff contention despite a 3-8 record, but a loss to Washington would put them three games behind the Redskins with only four games to play.With the way the Redskins’ offense has been playing, the Cowboys can start booking vacations for early January. Kirk Cousins has found a groove at home, with at least 290 passing yards in each of his last four games at FedEx Field, and he should have little trouble outproducing Cassel.Pick: RedskinsA version of this article appears in print on December 7, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Cowboys (3-8) at Redskins (5-6).
