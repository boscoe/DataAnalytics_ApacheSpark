 Saturday 4 L.S.U. at 7 Alabama8 p.m., CBSAlthough not a traditional rivalry, Louisiana State-Alabama has become the premier game in college football over the past decade. This year’s meeting takes place in prime time, under the lights at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala. A lot of the focus entering this one is on the running backs. L.S.U.’s Leonard Fournette is the Heisman Trophy front-runner and has been a seemingly unstoppable force, leading the Football Bowl Subdivision with 1,352 yards and 15 touchdowns through seven games. Derrick Henry is right behind, with 1,044 yards and 14 scores, and he has carried much of the Crimson Tide’s offensive load this season.But both defenses are strong up front against the run: Lineman Jonathan Allen leads a fearsome front for the Tide, and Kendell Beckwith is the star of a superb group of Tigers linebackers. The Tide allow an average of 2.6 yards per carry, and Fournette averages nearly 8. That will be a battle to watch.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            The matchup at quarterback is likely to be the difference. L.S.U.’s Brandon Harris and Alabama’s Jake Coker have been steadily improving, but it remains to be seen how they will respond in such a big game. Keep an eye on Calvin Ridley, who might be next in a long line of stellar Tide receivers.L.S.U. (7-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference West) is alone in first place in the division, and a win here would keep it near the top of the playoff rankings and move it a big step closer to the conference championship. A loss would all but eliminate Alabama (7-1, 4-1) from SEC West contention and most likely knock it out of the playoff conversation, too.Advertisement5 T.C.U. at 12 Oklahoma State3:30 p.m., FoxNovember promises to be quite a month in the Big 12. The four teams at the top of the conference have a combined record of 31-1, and they all play one another down the stretch. It begins in Stillwater, Okla., this weekend when Texas Christian and Oklahoma State square off in a battle of 8-0 teams. Neither has faced a ranked opponent this season. Horned Frogs quarterback Trevone Boykin is one of the most electrifying players in college football, and while T.C.U.’s defense has looked suspect at times, it seems to have improved. The Cowboys have the conference’s second-best defense but leaned on their offense in a shootout with Texas Tech last week.17 Florida State at 3 Clemson3:30 p.m., ABCAfter earning the top spot in the first College Football Playoff ranking this season, Clemson (8-0) gets an intriguing test against Florida State, which has won four of the programs’ last five meetings. The Tigers have won 11 straight games, their longest streak since their 1981 national championship season, and a good outing would put Deshaun Watson, a top dual-threat quarterback, in the thick of the Heisman race. Florida State (7-1) will have running back Dalvin Cook and quarterback Everett Golson back after injuries, which is vital.AdvertisementA win Saturday and another later this season against Florida might get the Seminoles back into the playoff race.8 Notre Dame at PittsburghNoon, ABCA sneaky big test for the Irish, who travel to Pittsburgh to face the Panthers (6-2), whose last six games have been decided by a touchdown or less. Notre Dame (7-1) is averaging almost 500 yards of offense, and while its defense has been decent up front, the secondary has been a concern. Some late interceptions have masked some of those problems. The Irish remain in the playoff hunt, but a loss here would all but eliminate them.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Despite Duke’s loss last week, the winner of this game is in a great position to win the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Coastal Division. North Carolina lost its opener against South Carolina but has since reeled off seven straight victories.Navy at 15 Memphis7 p.m., ESPN2Memphis (8-0) continues to find ways to win, and one more, combined with a victory by No. 18 Houston over Cincinnati on Saturday, would set up a showdown of unbeaten American Athletic Conference teams next weekend. Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds needs one rushing touchdown to set the career mark in the Football Bowl Subdivision. He has 77, tied with the former Wisconsin running back Montee Ball.Vanderbilt at 11 FloridaNoon, ESPNThe Gators (7-1) can lock up the SEC East with a victory. Quite a job by their first-year coach, Jim McElwain. FRED BIERMANA version of this article appears in print on November 7, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Games to Watch.
