The image of the Kansas City Royals' Eric Hosmer sliding safely across home plate in Game 5 of the World Series is one that Mets fans will find hard to erase from their memories. Hosmer's daring play came with one out in the ninth inning and tied the score, with the throw home from Mets first baseman Lucas Duda sailing wide of the mark. It was the beginning of the end for the Mets, who would go on to lose the game to the Royals in extra innings and, with it, the Series.The fans in this photograph had a front-row seat to that fateful moment and their reactions represented the pained emotions of all Mets fans that night.
