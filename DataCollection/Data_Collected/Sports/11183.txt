The gender barrier in one of England’s oldest sporting events was broken Saturday when the men’s and women’s rowing crews from Oxford and Cambridge raced over the same course on the same day for the first time. By the end of the afternoon, it was Oxford’s crews who were celebrating. Oxford’s women won by six and a half lengths for a 12th victory in 16 years, and the men followed up with a six-length win, along the same stretch of the River Thames in southwest London.The women’s races had been staged on a 1.2-mile strip of the Thames at Henley, with little publicity. This time, the course was three and a half times longer, and an estimated 270,000 spectators watched.A version of this brief appears in print on April 12, 2015, on Page SP10 of the New York edition with the headline: Gender Barrier Broken in England.
