She had been monitored closely since then.“We hope we can get her better and head toward next year,” Mandella said. “That’s what we’re planning.”Beholder, a 5-year-old mare, has always been high-strung and had difficulty traveling. Mandella said she became upset during the flight here and developed what he has referred to as “shipping fever.”“It’s still a great race,” Mandella said. “I just wish I was part of it.”Beholder, scheduled to break from far outside in Post 10, figured to be part of the early pace with her tactical speed. Without her, it is unclear where early pressure on the front-running American Pharoah might come from.Advertisement
