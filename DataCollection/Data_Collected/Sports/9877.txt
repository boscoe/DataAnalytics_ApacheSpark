Down the hall is a more modern gym, where Benet Academy’s championship banners hang in a lobby that displays trophies adorned by basketball nets.It is inside that nondescript alumni gym where Frankie Kaminsky — the self-described goofball who still remembers the combination of his high school locker (1-17-49) and who tried to catch falling confetti on his tongue like a 7-foot-tall kid seeing snow for the first time after Wisconsin’s Big Ten tournament championship victory — became Frank the Tank, the polished senior scoring, rebounding and assist machine determined to lead the Badgers to a second straight Final Four.It is in that dimly lighted basketball sanctuary where Kaminsky works out four days a week during summer visits home, putting up 750 to 800 shots until 500 find their target.AdvertisementDuring the 75-minute workouts, Kaminsky floats from station to station. He transitions from close-range hook shot to 3-point jump shot. He drifts to the top of the key and then to the right wing. He moves back to the top and then to the left wing, throwing up shot after shot after shot.AdvertisementWhen he is winded, Kaminsky stands 15 feet from the basket, where only a pair of made free throws will keep him from running suicides, from one end of the gym to the other.Just when Kaminsky thinks the shooting drill is finished, his former Benet teammate Dylan Flood pushes to see what Kaminsky has left.“Five more,” Flood barks, insisting that the big man keep shooting.This has always been Kaminsky’s way. Always pushing. Outworking the competition. Never allowing what his former Amateur Athletic Union basketball coach calls a “positive chip” to fall from his shoulder.“At every level, there’s an initial shock factor that it might not be as easy as you thought,” said Mike Mullins, the director of the Illinois Wolves A.A.U. program that Kaminsky started with at 15. “The difference is what you do from there. And Frank’s answer was always to go back to work.”Even now, Kaminsky, who goes by Moose, Joe College and the Sleepy-Faced Assassin among other nicknames, is not willing to stop.Those summer shooting sessions have continued throughout a Wisconsin career that began with Kaminsky averaging six minutes a game. Just as in high school, Kaminsky — who was offered scholarships by the midmajors Bradley, Northern Illinois and Southern Illinois before Wisconsin came calling — never hit his stride with the Badgers until his junior year, which he followed with a senior season that earned him the Big Ten’s Player of the Year award.Kaminsky is the face of a Badgers program that Coach Bo Ryan has built on recruits who are underadvertised at the start, but are groomed to overdeliver by the time they leave.AdvertisementNearing the end of a meteoric two-year run that has Kaminsky positioned as a favorite for national player of the year honors along with Duke’s Jahlil Okafor, Kaminsky — who leads the Badgers in scoring, rebounding and assists — is not a finished product.“He had a chance to look at a lot of backups who became pretty good players for us,” Ryan said. “But he’s taken it to another level.“He has picked up things and has been able to go to the next level of learning; where some guys maybe get to a point where they plateau, Frank’s still getting better.”Kaminsky is a study in perseverance and pushing through growing pains. Some have been physical. Others are borne in the fact that at points of Kaminsky’s career, he has not been considered good enough — only to turn around and prove that people have misjudged his talent.“I was never ‘the man,’ ” he said, referring to his days at Benet. “I was never the center of attention, and I think that’s what really made me who I was.”Ask Kaminsky where his transformation into Frank the Tank began, and he points to the private school that he did not want to attend and that he considered leaving before his sophomore year even began.Inside the school, where crucifixes and priestly portraits line the walls, Kaminsky endured an emotionally taxing two-year stretch when he went from a 6-foot-3 guard to a 6-10 junior ready to take on the world.The former Wisconsin assistant Howard Moore — credited with finding Kaminsky while he was recruiting and seeing what others did not — recalled the awkward teenager battling long arms and legs he did not know what to do with.Advertisement“The first time I saw him play, he couldn’t even get on the court,” Moore said.“But you saw this mold of clay that could be developed into something pretty nice.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

His abilities to handle, pass and shoot the ball were clearly evident. But when he was forced into a big man’s role, awkwardness took over.He missed layups. He rushed basic post moves, trying to stay out of his body’s way. As much as his father, Frank Jr. — a 6-foot-10 tower of a man who starred at Lewis University — tried to intervene with teaching sessions and one-on-one games, nothing came naturally.“A lot of times I would just leave the gym because I was so frustrated with myself,” Kaminsky said. “I wasn’t progressing the way I saw myself progressing.”Frank Jr. refused to ease up. Raised on Chicago’s tough South Side, he once told Kaminsky to “either stop crying or go play soccer” after he did not make the travel roster for an A.A.U. trip at 15. His father called that car ride home the defining moment of his son’s basketball development. Kaminsky remembered it being “frustrating more than anything.”Frank Jr. and Kaminsky’s mother, Mary — a former Northwestern volleyball player — raised their three children to fend for themselves. For Kaminsky, that included basketball.“I never babied him,” his father said. “There were times — even at Wisconsin — when he would be upset because he didn’t get to play. I would tell him the same thing: ‘Who’s got your spot?’ ”Tomorrow, Frank Jr. would say, “take it from him.”Kaminsky preferred not to be so gruff. He wanted to play — both at Benet and Wisconsin — but did not want to step on upperclassmen’s toes. By the end of his junior season, playing under Benet Coach Gene Heidkamp, the kid who once could not get on the floor emerged as one of Illinois’ top prep players.All of the work and tough love from his father and his A.A.U. coaches were paying off.“He’s a self-made man,” said Alex Flood, a Benet classmate.AdvertisementFrank Jr. remains Kaminsky’s toughest critic. When Kaminsky became visibly frustrated after missing three easy shots and committing two turnovers during Wisconsin’s Big Ten quarterfinal victory over Michigan, he knew not to make eye contact with his father.“My sisters tell me after the game how crazy he is in the stands,” Kaminsky said. “I try to block it out. I know he will be in the hotel lobby waiting to tell me how I played.“More times than not, it will be what I did wrong.”Inside Heidkamp’s fourth-floor classroom — decorated by pennants representing the programs of former players — a series of team photos hangs on the wall. One shows Kaminsky surrounded by a Benet squad after a playoff win. The photo’s border includes signatures of each player, including Kaminsky’s in the left-hand corner.The photo, along with the red Wisconsin pennant hanging among the others, serves as evidence of hard work’s rewards. Like Moore, Heidkamp was always sure Kaminsky could play, but he also knew the young and sometimes awkward player would need developing. Heidkamp scoffs at characterizations that paint Kaminsky as an aloof big man who finished as a second-team all-state selection, but who could not walk and chew gum at the same time.“Maybe, possibly, some people got it wrong,” Heidkamp said, smiling.Moore added, “No one saw this coming.”Kaminsky loves that part of the story. Even now, doubters have not backed down. Many look at Kaminsky’s unorthodox style and still see the clumsy kid rather than the reluctant college superstar. Kaminsky bristles at such notoriety, constantly telling his former classmate Flood, “Being famous is stupid.”At heart, Kaminsky is a big kid who would stay at Wisconsin if he could. He is the kid who celebrated Wisconsin’s Big Ten tournament title and chronicled every moment with a GoPro video camera strapped to his chest. But it has been the journey, more than the goofiness, that has defined him.“I love the way I’ve had to work through all my problems and my struggles to come out better than I was before,” he said. “I view it in a way that maybe not everyone else views it.”A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: 7-Foot Badger Takes Pride in Growing Up.
