Juventus, which leads Serie A and is in the Italian Cup final, received a lift from the return of the playmaker Andrea Pirlo from injury after a three-week absence.The second leg of the quarterfinal will be next week in Monaco.MADRID RIVALS DRAW Goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a series of outstanding saves to help Atlético Madrid hold Real Madrid to a 0-0 draw in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal.In a repeat of last season’s final, the cup holder Real Madrid enjoyed most of the possession and virtually all of the chances — only to leave with everything still to do in next week’s second leg at home.The draw, contested in windy conditions at Atlético’s Vicente Calderón stadium, meant that Coach Diego Simeone’s side has been unbeaten in all seven derby matches this season against Madrid — winning four and drawing three.Atlético has not conceded a goal at home in the Champions League since a 4-1 win over Milan in March last year.U.S. WOMEN’S TEAM CHOSEN Defender Christie Rampone is on the United States’ roster for the Women’s World Cup for the fifth time, joined by goalkeeper Hope Solo and the newcomer Morgan Brian.
