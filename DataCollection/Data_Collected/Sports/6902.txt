It sounds like a punch line: Fred Wilpon, the majority owner of the Mets, is the new chairman of Major League Baseball’s finance committee.Wilpon was a victim of Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme and has slashed the payroll of a team that has struggled significantly with debt. Faced with a cash shortfall in 2010, the Mets borrowed $25 million from Major League Baseball.Commissioner Rob Manfred — whose predecessor, Bud Selig, was a strong Wilpon ally — defended Wilpon and clarified his responsibilities.“I understand the whole Madoff thing,” Manfred said, “but before and since, Fred Wilpon was an extraordinarily successful businessman. The committee — the finance and compensation committee — really deals with two issues, principally: executive compensation, which he’s more than capable of dealing with, and a central office budget. Obviously, to be a successful businessman, you have to know how to budget.”M.L.B. has two separate investment committees that are not under the purview of Wilpon’s committee, Manfred said, and an audit committee that investigates possible fraud or inconsistencies in financial statements. He said Wilpon had experience on the committee he was now leading.“If you really understand which committees do what, I don’t see it as an issue,” Manfred said. “He understands how the budget process in baseball has worked, and he’s more than qualified to fill that role.”A version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2015, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: M.L.B. Defends Wilpon and His Financial Role.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
