The Copa América Centenario, the showcase soccer tournament that was nearly derailed by the FIFA corruption scandal, will take place in the United States as scheduled in 2016.Officials from Conmebol, the South American confederation that runs the championship; Concacaf, the confederation that governs soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean; and U.S. Soccer, which will serve as the host country, made the announcement Friday night.The confirmation came after months of negotiations to dissociate the event from contracts that had bound it to a handful of marketing companies connected to executives who have been indicted in the United States on charges of bribery, money laundering and fraud after a Justice Department investigation.U.S. Soccer had refused to move ahead as host unless those agreements were scrapped, raising the possibility that the tournament — expected to feature stars like Lionel Messi of Argentina, Neymar of Brazil and Luis Suárez of Uruguay — might not be played at all.AdvertisementThe biggest obstacle — a marketing agreement with a company called Datisa — was removed last Friday.The Copa América, the world’s oldest international soccer championship, doubles as the South American championship and has always been held on that continent. But in 2014, officials from Conmebol, Concacaf and U.S. Soccer announced a special Centenario tournament that would be played in the United States to mark the event’s 100th anniversary and would be expanded to include teams from Concacaf.AdvertisementThe tournament will be played June 3-26, roughly concurrent with the 2016 European Championship in France (June 10-July 10).A version of this article appears in print on October 24, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: 2016 Copa América Tournament Will Be Held in U.S.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
