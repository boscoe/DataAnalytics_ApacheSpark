StephensonBernard Lagat, in his return to the event he has owned for more than a decade, did not disappoint the local fans jammed into the 168th Street Armory’s New Balance Track & Field Center in Manhattan on Saturday.The 40-year-old Lagat did not pull off a surprise and win the Wanamaker Mile at the Millrose Games for the ninth time. Nevertheless, in finishing fourth in the meet’s signature event, Lagat broke the world record for runners 40 and older with a time of 3 minutes 54.91 seconds, blowing away the old record of 3:58.15 held by his longtime rival Eamonn Coghlan, who was in attendance and congratulated him afterward.Matt Centrowitz, the 2012 Wanamaker Mile champion, held off Nick Willis of New Zealand to win the race in 3:51.35, with Willis finishing in 3:51.46. Patrick Casey finished third in 3:54.36. Ten of the race’s 13 starters broke four minutes.Centrowitz had joked with Lagat before the race that Lagat would get more attention than the race winner if he broke Coghlan’s record.“I felt that right after the finish, when I saw them crowning Bernard, while I was still trying to figure out what I ran,” Centrowitz said. “But obviously, 3:54 as a 40-year-old, that’s a pretty big deal.”Lagat said: “I’m going home so content with what I did today. Really happy. Because, if you look at it, I hadn’t done a mile, indoor, for a long time. And coming back and doing 3:54, after four years of not running — to me, that is not bad.”In fact, Lagat had not run an indoor mile since 2010, when the Millrose Games were at Madison Square Garden and he won the Wanamaker Mile for the eighth time to surpass Coghlan’s seven titles. Since then, as a concession to getting older, Lagat has concentrated on running longer races. But when he turned 40 in December, he and the Millrose organizers thought there was an opportunity for him to return to the race and pursue the 40-and-over record.Earlier in the evening, the packed house at the armory had a scare when Ashton Eaton, the Olympic decathlon champion, went over the padded wall at the end of the sprint track after finishing the 60-meter hurdles and fell over backward. Eaton had come in third in a tight race. As the runners decelerated and slammed into the wall, he climbed it, his backside hitting the top, and he fell over the wall and out of view. The crowd was silent for a moment until Eaton popped up from behind the wall and leapt over the fence and back onto the track.“Man, that was crazy,” Aleec Harris, who won the race in a personal-best 7.50 seconds, said of Eaton’s fall.Eaton finished third in 7.51 after he was outleaned at the finish line by the second-place finisher, Jason Richardson, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in the 110 hurdles. Richardson was also clocked in 7.51.Eaton stayed on the track to compete in the men’s long jump, in which he finished third, with a leap of 25 feet 3 ¼ inches. Damar Forbes won the event, with a jump of 26 feet 4 ¼ inches, and Will Claye, the 2012 Olympic bronze medalist and a favorite in the event, was second, with 26-3 ¾.Eaton’s wife, Brianne Theisen-Eaton, finished third in the 60 hurdles, behind the winner, Sharika Nelvis, and the runner-up, Jasmin Stowers.The crowd got to see a world record in the men’s 500, a rarely run event that is not recognized by the International Association of Athletics Federations. Brycen Spratling won the race in 1:00.06.“When I saw the time, I mean, I was disappointed. I really wanted to go 59,” Spratling said. “But if that’s the best time ever run, and I just missed out, I’m O.K. with it.”Shannon Rowbury of Nike Oregon Project won the women’s Wanamaker Mile in a time of 4:24.32, easily beating out her club teammate Treniere Moser, who finished second in 4:27.49. Mary Cain, an 18-year-old Bronxville native who was the defending champion in the event, finished eighth in 4:31.31.In other events, Phyllis Francis of Nike Track Club won the women’s 400 in 53.14, passing the Olympic gold medalist Sanya Richards-Ross on the final straightaway. Richards-Ross finished second in 53.71, in what she said will be her only indoor meet this season. Erik Sowinski of Nike outdueled Robby Andrews of Adidas to capture the men’s 1,000, winning in 2:21.18, with Andrews clocking 2:21.23. Sally Kipyego of Nike Oregon Project won the women’s 3,000 in 8:41.72, and Lopez Lomong won the men’s 5,000 in 13:27.60, ahead of Ryan Hill (13.27.80).Murielle Ahouré of Ivory Coast took the women’s 60 in 7.05 seconds, the best time in the world this year, and Marvin Bracy won the men’s race in 6.53. Jesse Williams took the men’s high jump, beating out Mike Mason. Both jumped 7-7, but Williams had fewer misses. Ekaterini Stefanidi of Greece won the women’s pole vault, clearing 15-1.Advertisement
