Instead of seven Thursday night games and one on Saturday, during Week 16, CBS will produce and televise the first eight games of the “Thursday Night Football” schedule, which will continue to be simulcast on NFL Network. The remaining games in the Thursday package, which will be carried only on NFL Network and the local stations of the teams that are playing, will also be produced by CBS.The league’s goal in selling a half-season package was to broaden the appeal of the games from a cable network that appeals to football fans to a broadcast network with a wider appeal and stronger marketing capabilities. And it worked.The eight games on CBS averaged 16.1 million viewers, 89 percent more than the comparable games on NFL Network in 2013. But the eight other games, which appeared only on NFL Network and the local stations of the teams that were playing, averaged 8.5 million, up a more modest 8 percent from 2013. The deal with CBS, which was completed Friday, kept the Thursday night package from being bid upon by all broadcast networks, as it was last year.“When a partner works as well as we did with the N.F.L., you’d like to think there’s an opportunity to extend the relationship,” McManus said, adding that CBS had told the league that it was willing to sign a longer-term deal but that the league had chosen to stay with a one-year contract. The league holds the option to extend the contract into 2016.The new arrangement includes a provision for CBS to create programming that could be shown on CBS, NFL Network or CBS Sports Network.Advertisement
