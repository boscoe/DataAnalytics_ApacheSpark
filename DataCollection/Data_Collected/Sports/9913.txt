Tournament NotebookBy Brendan PruntyButler’s second-leading scorer, Roosevelt Jones, will be available to play against Notre Dame on Saturday.Bulldogs Coach Chris Holtmann told reporters at his news conference on Friday afternoon that there was no reason for Jones — who sustained a sprained left knee in Thursday’s opening victory against Texas — to sit out.“We anticipate that he’s going to play,” Holtmann said. “He’s gotten around-the-clock treatment, so we certainly anticipate he’s going to play. To what extent he’s going to be, it’s still yet to be determined because, obviously, it’s been a quick turnaround, and we haven’t seen him out on the floor. So we anticipate he’s going to play.”Holtmann did not get into specifics about Jones’s injury, but he said there that was no permanent damage and that Jones would not risk further damage by playing.Jones, a 6-foot-4-inch guard, averages 12.4 points a game, but he scored only 6 in 29 minutes of action in the victory against the Longhorns.Jones is regarded for his defense and his passing vision, but what really stands out is his offensive skill set: He seldom tries a jump shot.He went 0 for 2 on jumpers Thursday.Advertisement
