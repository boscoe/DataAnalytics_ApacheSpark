CreditJames Hill for The New York Times        YEKATERINBURG, Russia — The noise inside the arena is deafening. Thousands of Russians in off-brand tracksuits and snow pants are shouting and beating inflatable foil batons together as Diana Taurasi, perhaps the greatest women’s basketball player in the world, dribbles across the court.It’s a March evening in this mining city, which straddles the border of Europe and Asia, and 4,000 locals have come to see Taurasi’s team, U.M.M.C. Yekaterinburg, play Orenburg Nadezhda in the quarterfinals of the EuroLeague, the top women’s professional basketball league in Europe. In the upper deck, groups of miners and factory workers who have been bused in from the provinces stomp their feet, blow horns and bang on drums. Most of them work for various subsidiaries of the Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company, the multibillion-dollar metal producer that owns the team.“Vperyod! Vperyod!” they shout in unison. Forward! Forward!Deftly, fluidly, her aquiline features fixed in airtight concentration, Taurasi drives the lane, pivots around a pick set by her teammate Candace Parker and maneuvers past the 6-foot-4 frame of DeWanna Bonner to sink a perfect left-handed layup. “Tau-ras-eee!” booms a thickly accented announcer. Dancers in four-inch stilettos and tiny sequined bikinis take the court and begin fitfully bumping to the Romanian dance hit “Toca-Toca,” their long, layered hair swishing back and forth. The miners go wild.It is a bizarre spectacle, but it is one that Taurasi has grown used to. This is her seventh winter playing in Russia, her third at U.M.M.C. Like many of the W.N.B.A.’s top players, she spends the off-season abroad, playing in places like Yekaterinburg, Moscow and Istanbul, where she earns far more than she can make at home. For nearly a decade, Taurasi has been grinding out an almost continuous cycle of basketball seasons, from Europe to the United States and back, taking off a week or two a year at the most — maybe not even in Olympic years.AdvertisementThis year, Taurasi, a 32-year-old California native, announced that she would not join the Phoenix Mercury, her longtime W.N.B.A. team, for the 2015 season as they attempt to defend their title but would sit out the summer in accordance with the wishes of her Russian team. The move was unwelcome news for the W.N.B.A. and has drawn attention to the huge gap between what the league offers its top players and the increasingly lucrative opportunities they have overseas. Here, in Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia, Taurasi has made herself at home in what still sometimes seems like a strange parallel universe.“We’re like hired assassins over here,” Taurasi said the day after the Nadezhda game over brunch in the glass-walled dining room of the Yekaterinburg Hyatt.Advertisement“I guess I don’t want to say that too loud these days,” she added, scanning the room in mock secrecy. “Visas revoked!”Taurasi was wearing warm-up gear, and her hair was slicked into a tight bun at the back of her head, her signature hairstyle, which has inspired its own popular Twitter handle: Diana Taurasi’s Bun. U.M.M.C. had won the game the night before, dominating Nadezhda in the second half, and Taurasi planned to spend the rest of her day off at the Hyatt’s penthouse luxury spa chipping away at the $3,000 gift certificate that she, like each of her teammates, received from the team for Christmas.“It’s really just a world of extremes. You have the Hyatt, and then you have the Industrial Revolution over there,” Taurasi said, gesturing out the window at a row of dilapidated Soviet-era high rises. “You have all this money, and then you have the setup every Sunday in our gym parking lot. You got the one guy cooking the chicken. You got the other guy selling the goat cheese.”If Taurasi had not been an athlete, she might have been an entertainer. The magnetic intensity that makes her impossible to overlook on the court transforms in person into a comic knockabout charisma. She can lob a wisecrack with the same well-timed, ambidextrous precision that has made her passing skills legendary, and she has the habit of repeating a word or phrase until it takes on a hilarious absurdity: “The thing about Russia?” she says, “Everyone is Russian. They’re just Russian. They’re Russian.”The view from the table looked over the frozen Iset River to the golden onion domes of the Church on Blood in Honor of All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land, built over the cellar where Russia’s last imperial family, the Romanovs, were assassinated by the Bolsheviks. Beyond it, over the horizon, are the Ural Mountains and, after that, five million square miles of Siberian sprawl.Born to AdjustTaurasi was born a world away, in sunny Chino, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb. Her mother is Argentine, and her father, a retired machinist, moved from Italy to Argentina as a child. She and her sister spoke Spanish at home with their parents, who moved to the United States three years before Taurasi was born. In a way, she said, seeing them adjust to their new country prepared her for life overseas.Advertisement“Did they love everything America had to offer? Were they like, ‘Oh my god, it’s the American dream?’ No,” she said. “But you know what? They went to a different country. They respected it. You don’t have to like everything. You don’t have to agree with everything.”Living in Russia for the better part of the year, Taurasi has had to make her share of adjustments. Russian winters are cold and relentless, and especially for someone who does not speak the language, the country can be a harsh, forbidding place. Of course, the Russians have adopted certain coping methods.“I’ve probably drunk enough vodka for a village,” Taurasi said. With the weather as poor as it is, she added, and nothing to do, one “might as well be hung over.”“And you can’t not drink. You must drink. It’s just part of the world here. Any Russian team: You win, you drink. You lose, you drink.”Her team is close-knit socially. The players hang out together a lot, going for sushi and drinks at a local nightclub where men perform in drag as Cher and Lady Gaga. Recently, they have taken up skeet shooting. But it is still hard being in a place so foreign, so far from friends and family.And then there is the political situation. Over the past season, Taurasi has watched relations between Russia and the United States sink to their lowest point since the Cold War. In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, sanctions imposed by the West and the crash of the ruble, anti-American sentiment is now the highest it has been in decades, with more than 80 percent of Russians holding a negative view of Americans, according to a recent poll by the independent Levada Center.“Little by little, you do feel a little of the American resentment,” Taurasi said. “Like they feel like we’re taking their bread.”A few days before the Nadezhda game, Russia was yet again at the center of international news when the politician Boris Y. Nemtsov, an opposition leader, was gunned down in central Moscow a few days before a planned protest against Putin’s policies.Advertisement“They’re never going to find him,” Taurasi said of the gunman, with the reflex cynicism of a longtime Russia resident. “And if they do, they’ll pin it on some guy from Chechnya.” (A few days later, two Chechen men were arrested and charged.)A Brush With ViolenceThe story hit all too close to home for Taurasi, who was dealt a blow in 2009 when Shabtai von Kalmanovic, the flamboyant oligarch and former KGB spy who recruited her for his team Moscow Spartak in 2006 and became a kind of father figure, died in a hail of bullets while sitting in the back of his Mercedes S500. No one was ever apprehended for the killing.“That was a terrible day,” Taurasi said. “We were going to the Beyoncé concert that night, so we were all meeting at his office, where we would always go.” But when she arrived, she said, “the door was closed, and you know when you just get this weird, weird feeling?“When they told us, we couldn’t believe it. It was a shock.”Yet for the most part, Taurasi looks back fondly on her time playing for Spartak, which she helped win four straight championships alongside her longtime friend Sue Bird, with whom she also played college basketball at Connecticut. Kalmanovic loved his players and lavished them with personal attention.Taurasi tells a story of a time, on the eve of a team trip to Paris, when Kalmanovic tossed her a roll of 15,000 euros and told her to go shopping. She went out clubbing that night with her teammates and woke up the next morning to the awful discovery that the cash was gone.On her way to the airport, Taurasi called Kalmanovic to apologize. When they met, “he walks over, gives me another 15 grand,” Taurasi said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He comes to some of the games and celebrations, but for the most part, he simply foots the bill from afar. If anything, though, U.M.M.C. maintains an even more lavish style than Spartak did. The team charters private jets and caters lunch between its two daily practices. Taurasi has her own interpreter, a round-the-clock driver and a sleekly renovated, rent-free two-bedroom apartment with panoramic views of the city.In the W.N.B.A., by contrast, she flies coach on 6 a.m. Southwest flights with connections in Atlanta or Dallas. She is her own driver, and nobody caters lunch. The league uses a system of collectively bargained salary caps that limits the entirety of a team’s wage expenditure, which means that Taurasi, one of the W.N.B.A.’s few superstars, cannot earn more than the league maximum of $109,500, aside from modest bonuses. By contrast, U.M.M.C. pays her close to $1.5 million per season.AdvertisementFinancial OpportunityTaurasi’s decision to sit out the W.N.B.A. season this year has drawn attention to some of the shortfalls of the American system. Unless the league restructures its wage scale or introduces other incentives, it risks losing other standout players to a bullish international market.“I really didn’t do it to make a stand,” Taurasi said. “It was a very personal choice. My agent said it would be financially irresponsible not to do it.“And you know, that’s very taboo for athletes. It’s like, you’re an athlete — you shouldn’t think about that. Oh really? I shouldn’t think about when I’m 40 and I can’t walk cause my knees are busted? Who’s going to want to hire me in the business world? I have no work experience. And this is my profession. Why shouldn’t I try to make the most money I can?”Which is not to say that she has no misgivings about leaving her team in the lurch.“I’m sad about it, because I love playing in Phoenix,” she said. “I love playing with my teammates. It’s where I’ve been for the last 10 years.”Candace Parker, a forward for the Los Angeles Sparks who has played for U.M.M.C. Yekaterinburg since 2010, said: “Honestly, anybody has to respect it. I mean, people look at this as our off-season, but this is our season, and the W.N.B.A. is our off-season. This is where you take care of your family.”Todd Troxel, an assistant coach for both U.M.M.C. and the Mercury and a close friend of Taurasi’s, said: “I just think the W.N.B.A.’s taking advantage of their loyalty and banking on them playing no matter what. It’s a really hard, long season, and these players get the hell beat out of them, and they make pennies. They’ve kept doing it kind of just to keep women’s basketball alive. I can’t see LeBron or these N.B.A. guys doing that.”Taurasi expanded on that thought. “I mean, we have the best basketball players in the world hands down, and we have to go to China? To Russia?” she said. “To all these places where we’re always saying, Oh, how terrible? I just don’t get that.”Of the 15 teams in the Women’s EuroLeague, a small number have the resources to attract and nurture talent at something close to the level of U.M.M.C. Each team is allowed only two non-Europeans, but players skirt the rule by taking on European citizenship and agreeing to play for their new country’s national team. On U.M.M.C. alone, Deanna Nolan, who spent nine years playing for the Detroit Shock, has held a Russian passport since 2008, and the Virginia-born Kristi Tolliver recently became a citizen of Slovakia. Other players, like the star forward Maya Moore, compete in China.AdvertisementFor the most part, the teams are bankrolled by billionaire industrialists who have no hope or expectation of ever turning a profit. Even after nearly a decade in the European system, Taurasi herself has trouble explaining the economics of it.“You can’t get your head around it,” she said. “Like all these people get into the games for free. When we go home, people still don’t get it. They’re like, ‘What’s the point?’ ”The short answer? It’s all about public relations.“U.M.M.C. is a giant company, and we have subsidiaries all around Russia,” said Maxim Ryabkov, Yekaterinburg’s general manager. “People in Siberia, in the Northern Caucasus, they can relate to our company better, and then they will relate better with their job. Russia is not really so much into charity, but these kinds of socially oriented projects? Every big company wants to have one.”Generous state subsidies and tax breaks are other major factors that distinguish the European league system from its American counterpart.All the perks the team provides for the women, Ryabkov said, are “just fair treatment for the players who are legends on this planet.”Accepting a ‘Lonely Life’The next morning, Taurasi and Troxel were in a black sedan headed north of Yekaterinburg to the rural mining town of Verkhnyaya Pyshma, where U.M.M.C. has its team gym. They practiced there before flying out to Orenburg for Game 2 of the quarterfinals, in which they trounced Nadezhda and advanced to the EuroLeague’s Final Four, thanks largely to Taurasi’s 20 points and 7 assists.Troxel has been coaching Taurasi for nearly nine years — in Phoenix, Moscow and now Yekaterinburg. They have a brother-sister relationship built on a near-constant stream of gleeful mutual ridicule. Taurasi often refers to the 5-9 Troxel as “the little guy” and likes to use Photoshop to place his head on ill-suited bodies. On this day, it was that of the Russian basketball star Andrei Kirilenko.“He’s almost just a 6-8 version of you, Todd,” Taurasi said.Taurasi looked out the window as the landscape turned increasingly bleak: industrial plants spewing exhaust, a fenced-in lot full of disused military vehicles, vast frozen fields punctuated by run-down cottages.“I mean, yeah, we go to practice, fly to games and all that,” Taurasi said after a few minutes of silence. “But at the end of the day, you’re in the middle of nowhere with hardly anyone to talk to. It’s a lonely life. And it’s hard, ’cause everything ends up being long distance. I was thinking about my parents, and 10 years have gone by, and really, I haven’t seen them at all. People are starting to get old in my life. My sister’s got two kids, 6 and 4, and I don’t even remember them growing up, ’cause you know, you’re just not around.”AdvertisementShe looked off into the distance for a few seconds and then seemed to snap herself out of it.“I still wouldn’t trade it,” she said, leaning back in her seat, “ ’cause this is what I love to do.”An article on Wednesday about Diana Taurasi’s experiences playing professional basketball in Yekaterinburg, Russia, misidentified the church there that is built over the cellar where the Romanovs were assassinated. It is the Church on Blood in Honor of All Saints Resplendent in the Russian Land — not the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, which is in St. Petersburg.A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Where the Money Is.
