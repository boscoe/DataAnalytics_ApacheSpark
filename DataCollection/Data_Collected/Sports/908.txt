RoundupBy The Associated PressFor the second week in a row, the N.F.L. acknowledged an officiating error in a nationally televised game.This time, the problem was twofold: 18 seconds were incorrectly run off the clock late in the fourth quarter Monday night in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ 24-20 victory at San Diego, and none of the game officials noticed it.In a statement emailed Tuesday, the league spokesman Michael Signora said that “an error by the clock operator” after a touchback on a kickoff allowed the extra time to tick away, and “it is the responsibility of the side judge to supervise the timing of the game.”In last week’s Monday night game, a 13-10 home win by Seattle over Detroit, an official missed a late-game call, giving the Seahawks the ball even though one of their defenders had knocked a fumbled ball out of the end zone, which should be a penalty. Despite the error in San Diego, the Steelers drove downfield in time to score the go-ahead points on the final play from scrimmage, a 1-yard run by Le’Veon Bell.DEATH IS RULED ACCIDENTAL The death of the former N.F.L. and Iowa safety Tyler Sash last month was a result of an accidental overdose from mixing two powerful pain medications, and a history of painful injuries was a contributing factor, a medical examiner said.Additional studies will look at whether Sash, 27, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repetitive trauma that has been found in several former N.F.L. players. Sash, who as a rookie helped the Giants win the Super Bowl in the 2011 season, was found dead at his home in Oskaloosa, Iowa, on Sept. 8.
