Between a defense that is harder to score on than any in the N.F.L. and an offense that can stretch the field, the Bengals started 8-0 and looked nearly unbeatable. Then the Houston Texans beat them soundly and now they go on the road to face a red-hot Cardinals team.Mike Iupati, the left guard who is charged with protecting the Cardinals’ aging and frail quarterback and running back, was taken off the field in an ambulance last week with a neck injury. Arizona says he has been cleared to play, but if he is unable to go, or is limited, it could affect the Cardinals’ game plan.The Bengals have a comfortable lead in the N.F.C. North, and remain one of the better teams in the league, but they appear on their way to following an eight-game winning streak with a two-game losing streak.PICK: CardinalsAdvertisement
