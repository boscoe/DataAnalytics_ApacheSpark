Of little comfort to Baltimore fans is that all of the team’s games thus far have been close, winnable ones. Still, Harbaugh is not making any excuses.“It’s disappointing to lose these close games the way we’re losing them,” Harbaugh said after last week’s loss to the 49ers. “The bottom line is we’re not good enough to win them right now.”One of the few bright spots for the Ravens in 2015 has been the play of wide receiver Steve Smith, who continues to put up great numbers. With Smith set to retire at the end of the season, some are calling on the Ravens to try to trade him to a title contender. One of them is Smith’s former team, the Carolina Panthers. Unfortunately, the two sides have not gotten along well since they split, so that’s probably an unlikely move.On the other side, the Cardinals appear firmly in control of the N.F.C. West and are 15-4 at home under Coach Bruce Arians. Quarterback Carson Palmer is having one of his best seasons — he threw for 400 yards in a game for the eighth time in his career in a loss to Pittsburgh last week. Look for them to get back on track in this one if they can get their running game, which was held to under 100 yards for the first time this season against Pittsburgh, going again this week.PICK: CARDINALSAdvertisement
