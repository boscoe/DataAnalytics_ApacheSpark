The signing of a journeyman pitcher to a minor league contract does not ordinarily raise much interest in the hot stove league.But when the pitcher is Joba Chamberlain and the team signing him is Cleveland, the jokes practically write themselves.Chamberlain has spent nine years in the league, mostly as a mop-up man, but an incident in Cleveland in his first season created the most indelible image of his career.Just 21 years old for most of the 2007 regular season, Chamberlain pitched 24 innings of middle relief for the Yankees and gave up only one earned run. The Yankees took great care to protect his arm, and his E.R.A. was an improbable 0.38, the lowest in almost 100 years for a player throwing that many innings.AdvertisementThe impressive cameo earned him a postseason spot for a division series against the Indians.The Yankees were blown out in Game 1 in Cleveland, but led by 1-0 in Game 2 in the seventh inning when Chamberlain took over for Andy Pettitte. Chamberlain got out of a jam in that inning, but things turned sour in the eighth.AdvertisementA swarm of tiny bugs descended on the field. Actually, “swarm” is an understatement; it was more like a biblical plague. The stadium’s proximity to Lake Erie was blamed for the appearance of the midges, which were said to be in a mating swarm.Chamberlain was rattled by the bugs and repeatedly asked for time to shoo them away.“Many insects are attracted to lights, and the stadium lights are bright enough to broadcast an attractive signal to insects across the region,” Gavin J. Svenson, the curator of invertebrate zoology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, said some years later. “Their attraction to Joba’s face may have been less a matter of his smell or sweat, but of the sheer numbers of the flies in the stadium, with some looking for a place to land and rest and Joba serving as a good place that evening.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Indians pitcher Fausto Carmona (now known as Roberto Hernandez) seemed unperturbed by the bugs, and the Indians went on to win the game in the 11th.The Yankees lost the series in four games, their third straight division series loss. After the season, the team offered Manager Joe Torre a reduced contract, which he declined, ending his run of 12 years at the club, which included four world championships and zero losing records.Chamberlain the phenom evolved into not an All-Star but a journeyman major leaguer, never exceeding nine wins or three saves in a season. A bad ankle injury sustained in a trampoline accident in 2012 did not help.After seven years with the Yankees, he had a brief stint with the Tigers and even threw five innings for the world champion Royals in September this year, posting a 7.94 E.R.A.The incongruity of Chamberlain’s calling Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field) home prompted a statement from the team and an official reply from the Yankees, who seem to be able to laugh about it now:
@Indians @Joba_44 Oh, NOW you take care of the bugs …        Chamberlain is 30 now and would be a long shot to contribute greatly to the Indians. He might not even make the team. But more than a few fans will be hoping the city that seemed to derail his career can be the site of a comeback.A version of this article appears in print on December 2, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Hoping to Work Out Bugs by Signing With Indians.
