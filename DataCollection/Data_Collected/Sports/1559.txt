Week 7 scores and highlightsAs if a 2-4 start weren’t bad enough, the Saints were personally touched by the troublesome crime wave that has made headlines in New Orleans, and nationally, of late — masked bandits have been robbing employees and patrons of restaurants and bars at gunpoint, and a wealthy French Quarter resident established a private police force to patrol the streets — when Joe Vitt, the team’s linebackers coach, tore an Achilles’ tendon and broke a wrist fending off car thieves.“Joe Vitt is on the injury report,” Saints Coach Sean Payton told the news media. “He’s on a little scooter. You’ll see him out there.”On the bright side for New Orleans, the team is coming off its most impressive outing of the season — a 31-21 victory against Atlanta — and the Colts are probably still trying to shake off the humiliation of the worst fake punt of all time.PICK: SAINTSAdvertisement
