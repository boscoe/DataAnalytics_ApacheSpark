The Chicago Cubs’ four-game triumph over the St. Louis Cardinals on TBS had the largest audience of all four league division series, with 5.5 million viewers, followed by the Mets-Dodgers series with 5.3 million, also on TBS, a good omen for the Cubs-Mets matchup in the National League Championship Series.The two American League division series on Fox Sports 1 did not attract audiences nearly that size, in part because Canadian cities like Toronto are excluded from Nielsen’s calculations. The series between the Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers averaged only 2.4 million viewers. The Kansas City Royals’ four-game series win over the Houston Astros drew 3.1 million viewers.It seems a certainty that the Mets-Cubs series will draw a bigger audience than the Toronto-Kansas City series not only because of their large markets, but for the pent-up fervor of their fans, especially those who root for the Cubs.The last time the Cubs were in the N.L.C.S., in 2003 against the Florida Marlins, the seven-game series on Fox attracted an average of 16.8 million viewers, the most in the decade. The Marlins’ 9-6 win in Game 7 was seen by 26.5 million viewers.A version of this article appears in print on October 17, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: 2 N.L. Series Score Higher Than A.L. in TV Ratings.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
