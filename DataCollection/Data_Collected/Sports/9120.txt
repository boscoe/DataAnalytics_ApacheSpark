In the process, she scrapped plans to send one to New York for the $400,000 Gotham Stakes, held Saturday.Hours before Ocean Knight was to board a flight from Florida on Tuesday, in advance of a storm that dropped eight inches of snow on Aqueduct, Banke decided against sending the colt to the track, which has had 14 equine fatalities and 15 cancellations in 46 scheduled racing days since the winter meet began on Dec. 3.“The most important thing is the safety of the horse,” said Kiaran McLaughlin, who trains Ocean Knight, the 3-year-old son of a two-time horse of the year, Curlin.The change meant that Banke’s Stonestreet Stables competed against itself in the $350,000 Tampa Bay Derby at Tampa Bay Downs on Saturday. Carpe Diem, the runner-up in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and an early 8-5 favorite, won the Derby for WinStar Farm and Stonestreet Stables in his 3-year-old debut. Ocean Knight, after two victories in two starts, finished up the track.At Aqueduct, El Kabeir, owned by Zayat Stables, won the Gotham over a muddy track.As brutal as this season has been at Aqueduct, racing officials continue to point to winter racing as a necessity.“Is racing in winter the most optimal time to be doing it? No,” said Martin Panza, the New York Racing Association’s senior vice president for racing operations. “But there is a side to it, and that side is that it creates a lot of jobs, and those jobs are taxpaying jobs for the state.”A 2012 study commissioned by the New York Horse Racing and Agriculture Industry Alliance found that racing and the extensive breeding program around it had an estimated $4.2 billion impact on the economy of New York State and was responsible for roughly 33,000 full-time jobs.“It would be foolish, based on one of the worst winters we’ve had in decades and decades, to start making judgment calls as to why we are doing winter racing,” said Richard Violette Jr., president of the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association.Violette has about 30 horses training in New York. But he, too, chose to stay away with his top horse, Upstart, who is regarded as a top Kentucky Derby contender. Upstart is being prepared at Palm Meadows Training Center in Boynton Beach, Fla., and being pointed toward the Florida Derby on March 29 as his final prep race.At Aqueduct, a 25-person grounds crew, supplemented by additional workers, labored to get the track into shape for the Gotham, a Grade III prep race intended to put some horses on the road to the Derby.Glen Kozak, vice president for facilities and racing surfaces, said work began at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday with an emphasis on clearing snow to improve drainage. He estimated that a few hundred tons of sand were added to the surface. The track was twice harrowed throughout the night.Track officials said they did not have estimates on how much revenue had been lost as a result of the 15 cancellations — by comparison, there were seven days lost last winter — or the costs associated with the extraordinary amount of maintenance required.Violette said Aqueduct should consider installing a synthetic surface if “there is evidence that a synthetic track would provide us with a safer surface on which to race.”Mike Repole, a New York native and a high-profile owner, questioned whether Aqueduct, an antiquated track in Queens next to a bustling casino, was worthy of investment. He favors expanding the casino and turning nearby Belmont Park, a more inviting venue in Nassau County, into a year-round site.“It would be better for the fans, the horses and the horsemen,” he said.Advertisement
