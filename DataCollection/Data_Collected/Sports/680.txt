Bears (1-3) at Chiefs (1-3)1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 9.5N.F.L. Week 5 scores and highlightsWhen the Bears were driving late to try to win their first game against the Raiders last week, many fans were probably bracing for a backbreaking Jay Cutler interception to dash their hopes. The popular narrative is that Cutler folds in the clutch, but this time he led his team downfield, setting up Robbie Gould’s winning field goal, and he did so playing on an injured hamstring and without his top weapon, wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who is expected to return for the first time since Week 1.The Chiefs limp into the game having lost three straight, leading many to question whether they were overrated entering the season. But it should be noted that their losses have come against undefeated teams: the Broncos, the Packers and the Bengals. The Chiefs sort of snatched defeat from the jaws of victory against Denver, so they may not be as bad as their record.PICK: CHIEFSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
