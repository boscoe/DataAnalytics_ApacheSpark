Pierre-Paul, whose right hand was seriously damaged in a Fourth of July weekend fireworks accident, must first pass a physical and reach an agreement on the financial details of a new contract.Pierre-Paul, who had his right index finger amputated and sustained injuries to two other fingers, has not practiced with the team for several months. Pierre-Paul was hoping to get on the field when he met with the Giants in September. But team officials declared that his recovery from his injuries was not sufficient and sent him back to his Florida home for more rehabilitation. If Pierre-Paul is deemed fit to resume his football career this week, there is still the matter of what the Giants will be willing to pay him for the rest of the season. Pierre-Paul could begin practicing but not be ready for games for several weeks, which means his salary might also be dependent on how many games he plays. There could also be performance incentives in the contract.The Giants have been saving about $871,000 every week that Pierre-Paul does not play this season, which is a prorated portion of what Pierre-Paul would have made if he had signed the contract he was due when he was designated the Giants franchise player this spring. The worth of the remainder of that contract is about $8.7 million, a sum the Giants are probably not going to pay for a player whose ability to contribute is ambiguous.A compromise deal would most likely have to be worked out. If Pierre-Paul does not sign by Nov. 17, he cannot play the remainder of the season.Advertisement
