Most of the talk about the case focused not on safety or success, but on the team’s financial stability and survival and the legality and business ethics of breaking contracts.Van der Garde’s lawyers successfully defended his right to drive for Sauber in an Australian court, but then a settlement between the team and driver was reached, ending his bid and clearing the way for the team to move ahead with its two preferred drivers.Now, as the series heads to its second race of the season, the Malaysian Grand Prix in Sepang this weekend, there is a renewed focus on the sporting and wider safety issues raised by the case.The Sauber team at first responded to van der Garde’s lawsuit by saying that it would refuse to put lives at danger — his and those of drivers racing against him — by allowing a driver to use a car that he had not tested and that had been set up for a different driver.But others in Formula One, such as Christian Horner, director of the Red Bull team, contested that argument.“Look, we have two guys getting into a car that hasn’t even run so far this year, so I think it’s a fairly weak argument,” Horner said, referring to the Manor Marussia team, a late arrival in the series, which is preparing to run two drivers in cars that have not yet been tested.At the same time, he added that he didn’t think doing so “would be particularly healthy” without the long-cultivated relationships that exist within teams.He was referring to the behind-the-scenes work that goes into building strong relationships between two drivers, between a driver and his engineers, between the team and driver in general. Without that cohesion, there can be none of the essential teamwork that can make a difference between success and failure on the track.Red Bull considers driver adaptation so important that it created a junior team, Toro Rosso, where its future young drivers gain experience and learn Red Bull methods before the best of them move up to the parent team.Red Bull hired Daniel Ricciardo from Toro Rosso last year. The Australian needed little adaptation, winning three races in his first season. This year, after the four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel — who had also once driven at Toro Rosso — left Red Bull for Ferrari, the team brought in Daniil Kvyat, last year’s Toro Rosso rookie, to replace him beside Ricciardo.“The good thing about the drivers that graduate from Toro Rosso,” Horner said, “is that they are really embedded in a lot of the systems and programs we have within Red Bull Racing anyway — the simulators, the engineers that they are working with.”“They are known around the factory, and through the times that they spend with the team,” he added. “So through Ricciardo’s case and now Kvyat’s, that has made their transition a bit easier.”Kvyat said the three winter testing sessions in February in Spain were important to learn to adapt and work better with his team and engineers.“With a new engineering group we try to learn as much as possible about each other,” he said, “and I think we did well.”Each driver’s race engineer is the closest person with whom he works and is the person who best communicates the driver’s needs to the rest of the team. Drivers tend to develop a close working relationship with the race engineer, communicating with him in the garage, by radio during a race and in post-race debriefs. Drivers have known to be edgy on race weekends if their usual engineer is for some reason absent.Romain Grosjean, a French-Swiss driver at the Lotus team, changed his race engineer over the winter and is now working with Julien Simon-Chautemps, a Frenchman who had previously worked with his teammate, Pastor Maldonado.“The habits with a new engineer are very important,” Grosjean said. “It’s very positive that we had the winter testing to work together and begin to learn.”“The other positive side is that it is my fourth year at Lotus and so the team knows me,” he added. “And Julien, who worked on the other side of the garage, also knew me, and I think the fact that we were the two French people also helped us to move more quickly into the stage of understanding each other.”Sergio Pérez, a driver at the Force India team, noted that drivers aim for continuity within a team from year to year. He said they prefer to stay more than one season in order to learn how to work within the team, with the engineers and with the other driver.He and his teammate, Nico Hulkenberg, are both driving again this season at Force India.“I think that really helps to have two experienced drivers, two drivers having worked for the team for a second year with the team,” he said. “I know the team very well, I know which one I need to ask in case I need anything.”“That really helps when you have continuity with a team,” Pérez added. “I experienced that with Sauber, but I didn’t have the opportunity to do that with McLaren. But now that I have this opportunity to go for a second year, as a driver it is what you are looking for — to have some continuity with a team to really exploit your full potential as a driver.”Sometimes bad driver-team chemistry can be overlooked, though, if a driver is good enough or has something the team wants in particular. The Spanish driver Fernando Alonso’s return to McLaren this season is such a case.The two had a disastrous relationship in 2007 when Alonso and his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, battled each other both on and off the track. But even worse, Alonso clashed with the team management, claiming that he and Hamilton were not being treated equally by the team. As a result, Alonso left McLaren after only one season.But the team has rehired him this year. He will drive alongside Jenson Button as the team sets out on a renewed relationship with the Honda engine provider.Button said the two past world champions and their experience of 250 Grands Prix and several teams between them were particularly valuable for the development of the new Honda hybrid engine. The Japanese constructor enters the series a year after the other engine manufacturers introduced their new-generation engines.“We have been in completely different teams and worked with many different engineers and aerodynamicists and engine engineers,” Button said of Alonso and himself.“Even in the first test, in terms of the drivability in the engine, the changes from the first test to the second test when we only did sort of 60 laps in the first test, we had massive gains in drivability and now the drivability is as good as anything I drove last year,” he added. “So that is really good to see big steps forward, and you can only get that from experience.”But Ricciardo said that even in situations like his — he first spent two years with Toro Rosso before moving to Red Bull last year — the period of learning to work within the team during his first year at Red Bull will have helped him to perform even better for the team this year.“I’ve moved along a long way and I’m a more evolved driver and have a bigger impact in the team, obviously spending the 12 months in the team that I have now,” Ricciardo said.“It’s all there on the table, I think, ready for us to use and pursue, to put up another strong fight,” he added.Advertisement
