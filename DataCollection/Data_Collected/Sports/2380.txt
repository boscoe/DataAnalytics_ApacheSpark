SYDNEY, Australia — Japan fullback Ayumu Goromaru, one of the standout performers at the Rugby World Cup, has snubbed his country’s new Super Rugby team, the Sunwolves, to join the Queensland Reds next season.Goromaru scored 24 points, including a superb late try, to cap an outstanding performance when the Brave Blossoms beat two-time champion South Africa in the biggest upset in the history of test rugby.The 29-year-old showed equally impressive defensive skills with a brilliant try-saving tackle on Scotland winger Tommy Seymour in Japan’s second match and scored 58 points in four matches during the tournament.“I have followed the Queensland Reds for many years and am looking forward to joining the squad and meeting my new teammates,” Goromaru said in a news release, referring to the franchise based in Brisbane, Australia.Advertisement“Following my experiences at the Rugby World Cup, I’m looking forward to the chance of proving myself at Super Rugby level.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
