With back-to-back games of three rushing touchdowns since then, people are learning his name quickly.“Opportunity is everything,” Freeman told reporters after the game.Freeman was forced into a starting role last week when Tevin Coleman broke a rib. The 2014 fourth-round pick powered the Falcons to victory over the Dallas Cowboys with 141 yards and 3 scores. This week the game was never in doubt, with Atlanta running up a 42-0 lead before eventually beating the Houston Texans 48-21. Freeman ran for 68 yards, had 81 yards receiving, and ran in 3 more touchdowns despite spending much of the second half on the bench once the score got out of hand.It was just eighth time since 1960 that a player has scored three rushing touchdowns in consecutive weeks, according to ProFootballReference.com, with Freeman joining a group that includes LaDainian Tomlinson (who holds the N.F.L. record with three consecutive games), Priest Holmes (who did it twice), Marshall Faulk, Stephen Davis, Terry Allen, Joe Morris and Jim Taylor.Freeman’s addition to the list is shocking considering that before last week, Freeman had just 2 rushing touchdowns in 18 career games.“I’ve always believed in myself,” Freeman said. “But it’s hard to get a feel when you’re not playing. I have to get in a rhythm, and then the confidence comes.”The 23-year-old Freeman is only 5-foot-8, but he has proven remarkably versatile as a runner and receiver. With 149 yards from scrimmage this week, he now has 448 for the season.Earlier this week, the Falcons made a largely symbolic point of promoting Freeman over Coleman on the team’s depth chart even though Coleman is still injured. Considering Freeman leads the N.F.L. in touchdowns, the promotion should stick whenever Coleman returns.Advertisement
