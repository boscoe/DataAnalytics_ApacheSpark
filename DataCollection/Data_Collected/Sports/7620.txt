Alex Rodriguez is scheduled to meet with Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman and perhaps other front office officials before spring training.Rodriguez is coming off a 162-game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs and wants to make a face-to-face apology before the season. It was not clear when or where the meeting, which was first reported by The Boston Globe, would take place.Rodriguez requested a meeting with the Yankees in November, after he met with Rob Manfred, then the incoming baseball commissioner. Because Rodriguez had litigation pending against the team, Yankees officials declined, telling him they would not meet with him unless he withdrew the lawsuits. Since then, they have been withdrawn.Rodriguez also met with Manfred last month before Manfred took over as commissioner, and Manfred said that because Rodriguez had served his penalty, he was welcome back to baseball.The Yankees, who still owe Rodriguez $61 million over the next three years, have marginalized Rodriguez since the 2014 season ended by re-signing third baseman Chase Headley and saying publicly that Rodriguez, who turns 40 on July 27, will not be the starting third baseman. He is expected to compete for time at designated hitter and come off the bench — depending, of course, on how he performs in spring training. A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees to Meet With Rodriguez.
