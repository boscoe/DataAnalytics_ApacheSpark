Texans (2-4) at Dolphins (2-3)1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 4N.F.L. Week 7 scores and highlightsWhen they fired Joe Philbin and promoted Dan Campbell, the Dolphins went from being the N.F.L. team with a coach who most resembled a mathematician to being the team with a coach who most resembles an active player. Jacked and intense, Campbell appears to have given the team — which many thought was too wired like the mild-mannered Philbin — an immediate energy jolt, as the Dolphins routed the Titans, 38-10, on the road in their first game under the new coach. It’s now up to Campbell to keep the fire under his team lit.“The challenge now is for these guys to not start patting themselves on the back,” Campbell said. “We’ve been notorious for that around here. We get a big win, and then a lull the next week.”Brian Hoyer appears to have won the starting quarterback job in Houston after completing 24 of 36 passes for 293 yards and no interceptions in relief of Ryan Mallett last week, helping the Texans snap a three-game losing streak.PICK: DOLPHINSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
