But it turns out that she was a he. Track stewards suspended three people and fined another after determining there was no intentional wrongdoing in a chain of mistakes that allowed the wrong horse to run under a different name last month at Hollywood Gamingâ€™s Mahoning Valley Race Course near Youngstown. The horse that won by nearly eight lengths, Leathers Slappin, who was in a neighboring stall to Ruby Queen, was disqualified, but the error was not discovered until after the bets were paid out. A $2 wager on Ruby Queen to win paid off $220. Advertisement
