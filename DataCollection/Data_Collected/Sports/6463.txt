Phil Jackson’s professional basketball career began more than 45 years ago, and for almost all of it, with Jackson as a player and a head coach, his teams have had records above .500, often way above it. But Jackson, who has won 14 rings — two as a Knicks player, 11 as the coach of the Chicago Bulls and the Los Angeles Lakers, and one as the coach of the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball Association — now finds himself in unimagined depths in his first full season as the Knicks’ top executive.
