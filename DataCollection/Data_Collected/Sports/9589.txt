GREENSBORO, N.C. — A young but talented Duke team entered the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament as a favorite to win. The outcome was not quite what many expected.Heard this one before?A year ago, Duke, led by the freshman Jabari Parker and the sophomore Rodney Hood, lost to Virginia in the A.C.C. final. The game later seemed to be a harbinger of the team’s shocking loss to Mercer less than a week later in its N.C.A.A. tournament opener.This season’s Blue Devils, with the freshmen Jahlil Okafor, Tyus Jones and Justise Winslow, entered their conference tournament at Greensboro Coliseum last week on an 11-game winning streak. They extended it to 12 before falling to Notre Dame, 74-64, in the semifinals on Friday.So what does that mean for the tournament ahead? That depends on whom you ask. After Friday’s loss, Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski showed his displeasure with the comparison between this year’s team and last year’s.Advertisement“We’ve won 29 games and have been one of the best teams in the country with four freshmen and eight guys,” he said. “I like my team. We’re ready to go to war in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and we’ll take what the consequences are of our efforts. And each team is different. Each team, each season is different.”AdvertisementStill, his team will ultimately be judged, just as it was last year, on how well it plays in the N.C.A.A. tournament, and that will again depend on how quickly Duke’s young players can learn. They received plenty of lessons against Notre Dame.“We started off poorly, and Coach tried to warn us before the game that this is a game where we might get off to a slow start,” said Okafor, projected to follow Parker, the No. 2 overall choice in last year’s N.B.A. draft, as an early pick.Okafor, who pointed out that Krzyzewski called a timeout in the game’s first two minutes, added, “We had to figure out a way to get each other going when things like that happen.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            It was not just the youngsters who struggled: The senior guard Quinn Cook was 2 of 12 from the field.He and the other veterans on the Blue Devils, the South Region’s No. 1 seed, know what to expect when the tournament begins. The freshmen are already adjusting to the reality of March.“No matter how good you are, how good you have been, if you let up for 15 minutes or too many plays in a row, it could all end,” the junior Amile Jefferson said. “All it takes is one game. That’s why March is so beautiful and so cool.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Wildcats — who wound up winning the conference’s regular-season title — are among the nation’s most prolific offensive teams, finishing sixth in scoring average.St. John’s has been one of the most enigmatic teams in the country — loaded with talent and senior leadership but equally capable of looking completely lost, as it did in the Big East tournament. Then on Sunday, the Red Storm suspended their center, Chris Obekpa, for two weeks for violating team rules. Without him, St. John’s will be missing the fifth-best shot-blocker in the nation.AdvertisementGeorgetown is 2-5 in the N.C.A.A. tournament since reaching the Final Four in 2007, and Eastern Washington won at Indiana this year.
