But after it was announced Sunday that he would take a leave of absence, reports emerged that some Trojans assistants believed Sarkisian had not been sober during U.S.C.’s 42-14 win at Arizona State on Sept. 26.Sarkisian was 12-6 at U.S.C. and has an overall head-coaching record of 47-35. The Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pacific-12) play at No. 14 Notre Dame on Saturday night. Their offensive coordinator, Clay Helton, will serve as the team’s interim head coach.Advertisement
