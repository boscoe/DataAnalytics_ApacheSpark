The Patriots are the highest-scoring offense in the N.F.L. and are third in the league in passing. The Giants’ defense is the worst in the N.F.L. and ranks second to last against the pass. To make matters worse for the Giants, their secondary, which has been hobbled most of the year, is more unhealthy than usual. Cornerback Prince Amukamara will not play because of a pectoral muscle pull, leaving Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie as the only cornerback with any kind of pedigree to match up against Brady’s wiliness. The Giants have also not exhibited an ability to cover slot receivers the caliber of the Patriots’ Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola.And then there is tight end Rob Gronkowski going against the Giants’ linebackers or the rookie safety Landon Collins. The last time the Giants faced a skilled veteran quarterback, Drew Brees threw for seven touchdowns.Number to watch: 40.8That’s the percentage of successful third-down conversions by the Giants this season. If they are going to win Sunday, that conversion rate may have to be about 75 to 80 percent, especially with all the no-huddle offense the Giants like to run. If the Giants’ offense puts the Patriots’ offense on the field too often, the game could get out of hand early.Quotation of the Week: ‘Maybe we’ll put three guys on him; I don’t know.’STEVE SPAGNUOLO, the Giants’ defensive coordinator, when asked how the Giants planned to contain Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski.Advertisement
