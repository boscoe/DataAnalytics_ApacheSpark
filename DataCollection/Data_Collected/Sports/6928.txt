Kansas found a solution for Texas’ size and muscle: pinpoint passing and nearly flawless handling of the basketball.Ruthlessly efficient on offense and able to match the No. 17 Longhorns’ physical effort under the basket, the No. 11 Jayhawks claimed a key Big 12 Conference road win, 75-62, on Saturday.The freshman Cliff Alexander had 15 points and 9 rebounds, and three other Jayhawks scored at least 12 points. Kansas (16-3, 5-1) had just three turnovers — none in the second half — tying a school record set in 1966.“This is a huge road win for us — it was big,” said Brannen Greene, who scored 14 points and made four of Kansas’ six 3-pointers.AdvertisementKansas Coach Bill Self compared Texas’ size to that of No. 1 Kentucky, a team that blew out the Jayhawks by 32 points in November.Advertisement“Against Kentucky, we shied away from it,” Self said. “Today, we didn’t.”Isaiah Taylor scored 23 points for Texas in his best game since returning from a long layoff because of a broken wrist. But the Longhorns (14-5, 3-3) showed little offensive flair beyond his scoring. Taylor had just one assist as Texas’ big frontcourt all but disappeared for long stretches of the game.Cam Ridley, a 6-foot-9, 285-pound center who averaged nearly 15 points during the previous two games, took one shot in the second half and four over all. The freshman Myles Turner, who is 6-11 and entered the game as Texas’ leading scorer, scored 8 points on 4-of-11 shooting, but Turner, the Big 12’s best free-throw shooter, did not get to the line.“We’re one of the biggest teams in the country, and we don’t take advantage of it,” the senior forward Jonathan Holmes said. “I don’t understand it.”The loss was a tough blow for Texas’ conference title hopes, which could all but disappear if the Longhorns lose at the league co-leader Iowa State on Monday night.Texas did what it could to energize its home crowd. The Longhorns’ mascot, Hook ’Em, was lowered about five stories down to the middle of the court, and thousands of balloons were released from the rafters just before tipoff.The Longhorns then raced to an 11-2 lead, but Kansas, which has won 10 consecutive Big 12 titles, was not rattled by a little showmanship.The Jayhawks slowly broke down Texas’ zone defense with 3-pointers before picking it apart from the inside. Perry Ellis scored 8 points, and Alexander had consecutive dunks to help Kansas to a 32-30 halftime lead.AdvertisementThe teams traded the lead seven times in the opening minutes of the second half. A Holmes 3-pointer put Texas up, 42-38, but the Jayhawks responded with an 8-0 run behind consecutive 3-pointers from Wayne Selden Jr. and Greene.Greene’s final 3-pointer pushed Kansas’ lead to 6 with a little less than seven minutes to play, and the Jayhawks steadily pulled away.TEXAS TECH 78, IOWA STATE 73 Devaugntah Williams scored a career-high 22 points, and Toddrick Gotcher had 17, leading host Texas Tech over No. 9 Iowa State for its first Big 12 Conference win of the season.Fans swarmed the court after the game.Gotcher made five of Texas Tech’s 11 3-pointers. Williams, a junior transfer, added three 3-pointers.The Red Raiders (11-9, 1-6) led for most of the game and were up by 74-68 when Iowa State’s Georges Niang made a desperation 3-pointer from the corner with 43 seconds remaining.Gotcher and Williams each hit two free throws to help keep Texas Tech ahead.Monte Morris scored 20 points, and Matt Thomas added 12 for the Cyclones (14-4, 4-2).Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
