It will be the first playoff matchup between a team that went 8-0 at home and one that went 8-0 on the road. It is a rematch of sorts of the so-called Ice Bowl, the N.F.L. title game played on Dec. 31, 1967. Green Bay is expected to be frigid on Sunday, though not as cold as it was for the Ice Bowl, which had a minus-46 wind chill at kickoff. Dallas’s Tony Romo will be trying to distance himself from his reputation, and DeMarco Murray will be trying to prove that his N.F.L.-leading rushing output in the regular season was not a fluke.But the top story involves Aaron Rodgers’s left calf. The Packers described his injury as a slight tear and a significant strain sustained in Week 17. Rodgers has played effectively through the pain, but he has acknowledged that he will not be at 100 percent. Against a Cowboys offense that seems particularly well suited to cold weather, Green Bay will need everything it can muster.Rodgers may never be confused for Michael Vick in terms of mobility, but he is far more nimble in the backfield than he gets credit for, finding a great deal of success when throwing outside the pocket. If that ability is impaired, this game could become quite difficult for the Packers.But based on the way Rodgers played on the injured leg in a win over Detroit, Green Bay should advance.Pick: PackersTimes are Eastern.
