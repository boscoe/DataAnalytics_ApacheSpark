The Oakland Athletics traded third baseman Brett Lawrie to the Chicago White Sox for the right-handed pitcher J. B. Wendelken and the minor league left-hander Zack Erwin on Wednesday. Lawrie hit .260 with career highs of 16 home runs and 60 R.B.I. in his lone season for the A’s and stayed off the disabled list for the first time in five major league seasons. Oakland had a full infield after acquiring shortstop Jed Lowrie from Houston on Nov. 25.■ Second baseman Chase Utley and the Los Angeles Dodgers completed a one-year contract. Utley, 36, was obtained from Philadelphia on Aug. 19 and hit .202 with three home runs and nine R.B.I. in 34 games with the Dodgers. His hard slide into second base during a National League division series broke the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. Utley was suspended for two games, a punishment that was held in abeyance pending an appeal by the players’ union.A version of this brief appears in print on December 10, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: A’s Trade Third Baseman.
