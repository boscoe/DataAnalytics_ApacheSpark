Houston Manager A. J. Hinch did not know late Monday evening if center fielder Carlos Gomez could play at all for the Astros in their first playoff appearance since 2005. A rib muscle strain nagging at Gomez was threatening to linger into the postseason.But early Tuesday, Hinch roused Gomez with a one-question phone call: Is the guy nicknamed Go-Go ready to go?The gamble to reinsert the incandescent Gomez into the lineup, even at less than 100 percent, paid off handsomely when he homered on the first pitch from Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka in the fourth inning, giving Houston a two-run lead in the American League wild-card game at Yankee Stadium. The Astros won, 3-0.“That’s why we played him,” Hinch said. “That’s why we waited to play him at this stage.”AdvertisementGomez’s ability to serve as a catalyst for the Astros’ offense was just one reason Hinch felt compelled to get Gomez back into the lineup after he had missed 17 of the last 20 games of the season.AdvertisementAdditionally, Gomez, 29, is an emotional spark. His animated attitude between the lines has been known to ruffle some opponents, including the Yankees.

Girardi took issue with how Gomez flipped his bat in a 9-0 game.But that has not stopped Gomez from maintaining his antics. True to form, Gomez spun his bat in an exaggerated fashion after his home run, a high slider from Tanaka that hung up and over the inside portion of the plate. The ball sailed into the bullpen in left-centerfield.As Gomez rounded the bases, he clearly enjoyed the second postseason homer of his career. He patted his helmet, kissed his hands, crossed his chest, smiled and skipped around the bases like a kid leaving school for summer break.“He was awesome tonight,” outfielder Colby Rasmus said. “He’s been a little banged up, but for him to come out tonight and hit that home run, play great defense, he’s a big part of our team.”The Astros’ collective youth, at least relative to the Yankees, was viewed as both an advantage and disadvantage. Gomez was one of only nine players with postseason experience. But Hinch said before the game that his team was loose, and Gomez certainly helped relieve the tension with the Astros’ second homer of the night. Rasmus also took Tanaka deep, on the first pitch of the second inning.The cushion was plenty for starter Dallas Keuchel, who allowed three hits in six innings.The left intercostal muscle strain that had sidelined Gomez during the regular season did appear to return in his third at-bat, in the sixth. After a vicious cut on a swinging strike, Gomez grimaced twice, but he remained in the game until the ninth.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But Hinch said he believed that it was a stage that Gomez could shine on.“He gave us everything he had,” Hinch said.That Gomez was playing in the postseason in New York was an interesting turn of events. Gomez, who began his career with the Mets, nearly returned as the centerpiece of a July trade between the Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers for shortstop Wilmer Flores and pitcher Zack Wheeler. After details of the deal leaked onto social media — and Flores, upon hearing of it, was reduced to tears on the field — the trade fell through when Mets executives grew concerned about Gomez’s hip.The Mets wound up trading for Yoenis Cespedes instead, and Gomez was dealt to Houston. History appeared to shine more positively on the Mets’ move: Cespedes became an overnight sensation for the Mets, while Gomez hit .242 in 41 games for the Astros.But Houston can say now that Gomez helped them advance past the Yankees and on to Kansas City for an American League division series.“I know baseball people say the Houston Astros is probably not going to make it,” Gomez said. “But here we are.”A version of this article appears in print on October 7, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Playing Hurt, Astros’ Gomez Grins and Bears It, and Hits Crucial Homer .
