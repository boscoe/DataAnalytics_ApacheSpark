Andrew Wiggins scored 16 points, and Ricky Rubio had 15 assists.Brook Lopez had 20 points, 12 rebounds and 5 assists for the Nets, who dropped their fifth straight.“It’s nothing X’s or O’s or anything like that,” Lopez said. “It was just energy and effort.”Coach Lionel Hollins blamed himself for not having the Nets ready for the 1 p.m. start, but he offered an explanation that was similar to Lopez’s.Kevin Garnett was scoreless but grabbed seven rebounds in his first visit to Brooklyn since the Nets dealt him to Minnesota at last season’s trade deadline for Thaddeus Young, who had 12 points on Sunday.The Timberwolves led nearly the whole way. They were up by 10 after one quarter, and that was still the lead after three. In the fourth, a 12-3 spurt featuring two 3-pointers from Kevin Martin turned the game into a 91-72 rout.Martin had 16 points, and his fellow reserve Zach LaVine scored 10 as Minnesota’s second unit outscored the Nets’ bench by 48-30.Advertisement
