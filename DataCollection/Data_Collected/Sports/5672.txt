After years of waiting for the left-hander Manny Banuelos to fulfill his potential, the Yankees gave up on him, trading him to the Atlanta Braves for the right-handed pitcher David Carpenter and the left-hander Chasen Shreve. Banuelos joined the Yankees organization in 2008 but never reached the major leagues despite his promising ability.The Yankees were in need of a proven right-handed reliever after trading Shawn Kelley to the Padres last week. Carpenter, 29, had a 3.54 earned run average and three saves in 65 appearances for Atlanta last year. Shreve, 24, made his major league debut last year and had an 0.73 E.R.A. in 15 games. He had a 3.22 E.R.A. over five minor league seasons.A version of this brief appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees Trade a Former Top Prospect to the Braves.
