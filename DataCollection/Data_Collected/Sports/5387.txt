All they have to do to stay alive is beat a 14-0 team with 10 Pro Bowl players.Chief among those stars is Cam Newton, who last week became the first quarterback in N.F.L. history to have 300 passing yards, five passing touchdowns and 100 rushing yards in a game, according to ProFootballReference.com.There is a possibly apocryphal quotation attributed to the former San Francisco 49ers Coach Bill Walsh that said: “Joe Montana was a product of the system. Dan Marino was the system.” Marino may truly have been the system, but Newton is the revolution to that system that has been predicted for years. Where Randall Cunningham, Michael Vick, Colin Kaepernick and a host of others could run and throw, Newton and Russell Wilson have truly mastered a blend of the two that is effective for winning games rather than just looking great in highlight films. Adding to Newton’s credentials is that he is inflicting all this damage with an unspectacular group of wide receivers.On the other side of the ball, Josh Norman is one of the few cornerbacks who can slow the Falcons’ star receiver Julio Jones, and the Panthers’ celebrated linebackers should have no problem containing running back Devonta Freeman.Pick: PanthersAdvertisement
