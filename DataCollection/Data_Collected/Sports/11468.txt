After Derick Brassard whipped Madison Square Garden into a frenzy by scoring before some fans even reached their seats, and after Ryan McDonagh added another goal later in the opening period, the Rangers shackled Pittsburgh over nearly the final 34 minutes to take a one-game-to-none lead heading into Game 2 on Saturday.In result only, the opener played to type — the mighty Rangers, who set franchise records for victories and points, defeating the rickety Penguins, who staggered into the playoffs wobblier than a one-legged wheelbarrow. But as in most intradivision matchups, there is a deep and unforgiving history between these teams, and it mattered not that Pittsburgh, after going 4-9-2 in its final 15 games and needing to win at woeful Buffalo in the season finale to even qualify for the playoffs, was perceived as having greater odds of drawing blackjack after hitting on 20 than winning this series.The Penguins still had Sidney Crosby, and they still had Evgeni Malkin, and for those reasons alone the Rangers considered them dangerous. Still do, even after silencing Pittsburgh’s high-scoring pair on Thursday, limiting Malkin to two shots and Crosby, whose 19:11 of ice time led his team’s forwards, to one.“You want to try to outnumber them as much as you can,” said Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault, and that is what his team did, daring the Penguins’ lesser lines to shine.Henrik Lundqvist stymied them all, saving 24 of 25 shots as he continues to round into form after missing 25 games with a vascular injury. He said he felt sharp, and he benefited from strong defense played in front of him by a group whittled to five for the final 9 minutes 29 seconds after the stalwart Dan Girardi did not return after being struck in the face by a puck. Vigneault did not have any updates on Girardi’s condition, other than to say that he was being seen by a dentist.Upon his return, perhaps Girardi will feel as energized as Rick Nash, who was weakened by the flu and could not practice Wednesday. But early in the first period, the national anthem had barely ended when Nash collected a nifty cross-ice pass from Girardi and rifled a slap shot, hard and low, from the left wing.The Rangers practice this sequence often, and Nash was not aiming to score so much as force the goalie, Marc-Andre Fleury, into kicking the rebound toward the slot. Fleury redirected the puck onto the stick of Brassard, who one-timed the rebound to score the second-fastest goal to begin a playoff game in franchise history.“Got a lucky bounce,” Brassard said, smiling.For Brassard, it was the continuation of a superb regular season in which he set career highs with 19 goals and 60 points. For Fleury, it was a dreadful mistake magnified by time and place. As the Rangers celebrated, Penguins defenseman Ian Cole glided alone toward Fleury and tapped him with his stick, as if to settle him.“We didn’t bring it early enough tonight,” said Penguins defenseman Ben Lovejoy. “We feel like we can beat them.”Fleury held firm as the Rangers kept firing, outshooting Pittsburgh, 13 to 5, and overwhelming the Penguins’ diluted defensive corps with their speed and skill while turning the middle of the ice into an extension of the offensive zone. Only one of Pittsburgh’s top four defensemen played, and it was not Kris Letang, among the best in the league, who is sidelined indefinitely with a concussion.The Rangers did what Pittsburgh could not — make crisp outlet passes, inflict pressure, play disciplined hockey. Four penalties produced four Rangers power-plays, which generated one goal, McDonagh’s rocket of a one-timer through a Brassard screen with 4:44 remaining in the first.It was 2-0, and at the opposite end of the ice Lundqvist crouched, ready as always, waiting for the shots that never seemed to come. Lundqvist made one smart save — a pad-stop on Steve Downie off a two-on-one down low — before encountering a bit of turbulence in the second.With the Rangers unable to clear the zone, the Penguins peppered shot after shot at Lundqvist. The puck, after a scramble in front, squirted free to Blake Comeau, who drew Pittsburgh to within 2-1 with 13:45 left in the period.The Penguins continued to crash Lundqvist’s crease and create traffic, but they did not have the puck enough to capitalize — not then, and not in the third period.The Rangers since the season began have confronted this sort of persistence from teams seeking to measure themselves against the reigning Eastern Conference champion, and they have handled it well, especially against the Penguins. Since falling behind three games to one against Pittsburgh in their playoff series last year, the Rangers have won seven of eight against the Penguins, and after a Game 1 victory Thursday, the postseason is bursting with promise and possibility.Advertisement
