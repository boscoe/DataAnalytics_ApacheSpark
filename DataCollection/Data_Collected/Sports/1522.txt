Dolan, the chairman of Madison Square Garden, and Isiah Thomas, president of the Liberty, revisiting a 2007 sexual discrimination lawsuit involving a former team executive in an interview this week with HBO Sports. In 2007, a federal jury ruled that when Thomas was the Knicks’ president, he engaged in sexual discrimination against the executive, Anucha Browne, who settled with the Garden for $11.5 million.Thomas maintained on “Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel” that he had never harassed Browne, and Dolan suggested that Browne had fabricated part of her testimony. “I think it’s important, whether it’s Isiah Thomas or Jim Dolan, that they let the world, sports fans, know how they feel,” Silver said. “I think especially in the case of Isiah Thomas — I’ll focus more on him because he’s actively involved in the Liberty, with the W.N.B.A., right now — I think that for our fans or people who follow the industry, I think it’s important that you represent yourself publicly.” He said he valued transparency and did not necessarily view the rehashing of old issues as a negative thing.“While I think name-calling doesn’t help, that to the extent that there are issues that haven’t been addressed directly historically, and he’s an active part in one of our leagues, I actually think it’s beneficial that he be out there and frankly expose himself to the scrutiny of the media,” Silver said of Thomas.Silver, speaking at a news conference after the N.B.A. owners’ meeting in New York, also confirmed on Friday that the league was conducting an investigation into the reported confrontation this month between Knicks Coach Derek Fisher and Memphis Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes at the Los Angeles-area home of Barnes’s estranged wife, Gloria Govan. Silver declined to specify a timeline for when the investigation would be finished.Advertisement
