Bills (6-7) at Redskins (6-7)1 p.m. Line: EvenLast season, the Bills had the defense no one wanted to play against. It led the N.F.L. with 54 sacks, was sixth in interceptions and tied for 10th in fumble recoveries. Led by Mario Williams, Marcell Dareus and Jerry Hughes, the team added Coach Rex Ryan, a defensive specialist, and was expected to get even better.But through 13 games, the Bills have 19 sacks, ranking 30th in the N.F.L. They are also 13th in total yards allowed per game.“Literally I can count — this will be my first time that I’ve ever been considered maybe the weakness of the team, the way I coach defense,” Ryan told reporters. “But we haven’t been up to what we anticipated, any of us, fan base, myself, players, everybody.”Needing to win the rest of their games to have a realistic chance at the playoffs, the Bills this week will have to contend with Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, who has had a passer rating higher than 100 in five of the last seven weeks (including a perfect 158.3 in Week 10) and has his team tied for first place in the N.F.C. East. The Redskins have not won consecutive games since Weeks 7 and 8 last season, but that streak should end Sunday.PICK: RedskinsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
