These teams are so woeful that there has been talk that one (or more) might break the league’s futility mark, the legendary 9-73 record of the 1972-73 Sixers.That abysmal team actually included a Hall of Famer, Hal Greer, though he was 36 and a bench player. Its top scorer was guard Fred Carter, who eventually coached the team for a season and a half in the 1990s, going 32-76. His backcourt mate was a rookie, Freddie Boyd, who was thrown into the starting lineup and shot under .400. He never played as many minutes again and was out of the league at 27. Early in the season, with the team 0-10, the Sixers tried to turn things around by acquiring a big man from the Lakers, 32-year-old LeRoy Ellis, who may not have been delighted to leave a team that would win 60 games and make the N.B.A. finals. It did not help, and the team went on to be 0-15 and later 3-38. A bizarre run of five wins in seven games in February put it at 9-60, but 13 straight losses to end the season established the famous mark.Though the 2011-12 Charlotte Bobcats had an even lower winning percentage (.106 compared with .110), it came in a strike-shortened season; no team has ever matched the Sixers’ miserable record over the full 82 games. (The Bobcats played 66 and won only seven.)At first glance, this season’s five-game winners may seem to be strong candidates to match or break the ’72-73 Sixers’ mark of futility. This season’s Sixers have dropped or traded their most productive players, and are playing youngsters and journeymen while promoting the team with a campaign called Together We Build. Plenty of commentators see it simply as tanking, to try to land a better draft pick.Last season’s rookie of the year, Michael Carter-Williams, is shooting 38 percent. A bright spot off the bench, Alexey Shved, who had some good, subtle advanced statistics, was promptly traded for Ronny Turiaf, a second-round pick and the rights to a Ukrainian playing in Spain.The Timberwolves, playing a brutally tough Western Conference schedule, are building around the No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins, who at 19 does not yet seem ready to be a star. Ricky Rubio and Kevin Martin are hurt, and Gorgui Dieng is getting serious minutes.And what more can you say about the Knicks? Troubled by injuries and struggling with a new offensive system, the team seemingly gave up on the season Monday by trading J. R. Smith and Iman Shumpert and cutting Samuel Dalembert, three rotation regulars.But these are not the first teams to threaten the record of the 1972-73 Sixers. Many have come close. All have failed.One of the first was the 1982-83 Rockets, who had just traded Moses Malone to the Sixers. Philadelphia won the championship. The Rockets started 0-10 but managed to win 14. The 1986-87 Clippers, featuring the second-year center Benoit Benjamin, were 4-31, but won 12 in the end. The 1988-89 Heat, an expansion team, lost their first 17, but got their act together late and won 15. The 1997-98 Nuggets, whose top scorer was 34-year-old Johnny Newman, were 3-40 and 5-58, but won 11 for the season.Most recently, the 2009-10 Nets began 0-18, the worst start to an N.B.A. season ever, and at one point were 7-63, but won five of their last 12 to finish 12-70. So why have none of these putrescent teams knocked the Sixers off their perch? And why have so many played well, or at least better, very late in the season?Regression to the mean — exemplified in this case by the tendency of all teams, good and bad, to move closer to average — is one factor. Another is that teams that are nearing such an ignominious record often become highly motivated to avoid breaking it.In 1992-93, the Dallas Mavericks had a good shot to tie the Sixers’ record when they stood at 9-71. Needing to win one of their last two games, they won both. Jim Jackson, a rookie who had held out for most of the season, scored a career-high 32 points in the first of those games, and the highly motivated team clawed out a close win over a poor Timberwolves team. “It was good to get No. 10 so we won’t have to hear about it anymore,” Jackson said after the game.Another advantage poor teams have late in the season is that their superior opponents, locked into playoff spots, may rest starters or not play with midseason sharpness. In their finale after that Timberwolves win, the Mavericks beat an elite Houston Rockets team that had won 11 in a row, but had little to play for.Not to be outdone, the 1993-94 Mavericks, who fielded players called Fat (Lever) and Popeye (Jones), were 1-23 and 2-39 but managed 13 wins in the end.This season’s three five-win teams have another advantage. They get to play one another. The Knicks have three more games against the Sixers, and both teams have a game remaining with the Timberwolves. Unless the rules of basketball are changed, someone will have to win those games.Expect to see that 9-73 record in the books for years to come.Advertisement
