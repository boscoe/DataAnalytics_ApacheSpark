The woman who accused the former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston of sexually assaulting her in 2012 filed a lawsuit against him on Thursday, two weeks before the N.F.L. draft.In the lawsuit, which was filed in a state court in Orlando, the former Florida State student Erica Kinsman accused Mr. Winston of “forcible rape.” Ms. Kinsman had previously identified herself in the recent documentary “The Hunting Ground.”Mr. Winston, who won the Heisman Trophy and led the Seminoles to a national championship during the 2013-14 season, was never questioned by the Tallahassee Police Department. Prosecutors ultimately declined to charge Mr. Winston, who said the encounter was consensual.John Clune, a lawyer for Ms. Kinsman, said Thursday that Ms. Kinsman was not trying to affect Mr. Winston’s draft stock or future income, but that she wanted to hold him accountable.Advertisement“This is not about trying to get the most money out of Jameis Winston,” Mr. Clune said.Had Mr. Winston been criminally charged, Mr. Clune added, “or if he had been found responsible and expelled, the need to do something like a civil lawsuit would have gone way down, and would not necessarily have been something we would have pursued.”AdvertisementIn January, on the day that Winston declared for the draft, Ms. Kinsman sued Florida State, which had cleared Winston in December of violating the student honor code. Ms. Kinsman said in federal court that the university had violated her right to a welcoming educational environment under Title IX.Florida State’s president, John Thrasher, said that lawsuit contained “meritless allegations.”“Evidence will show that through its confidential victim advocate program, F.S.U. did everything the plaintiff asked for, and that the assertions F.S.U. shirked its Title IX obligations are false,” he said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed.
                The former Florida State student Erica Kinsman filed a lawsuit in state court in Florida against Jameis Winston, the former Florida State quarterback, and accused him of “forcible rape.”            David Cornwell, Winston’s lawyer, issued a statement early Friday calling the lawsuit a “stunt.” “Mr. Winston welcomes the opportunity to clear his name with the truth,” he added.The N.F.L. declined to comment Thursday.Gil Brandt, the former longtime vice president for player personnel with the Dallas Cowboys and a current analyst for N.F.L. Media, said that without new substantial allegations, the lawsuit was unlikely to affect Mr. Winston’s draft stock.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I think everybody was satisfied.”Brandt added that, in his opinion, Mr. Winston was one of the five best players in the draft and that it would not surprise him if the Buccaneers or the Tennessee Titans, who hold the No. 2 pick, selected him.The civil lawsuit filed Thursday seeks damages under four outlawed areas of behavior: sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress. It requests a jury trial and monetary damages.The 12-page complaint retells Ms. Kinsman’s account of the night of Dec. 6, 2012. At the hearing in December, Mr. Winston delivered a five-page account of the night that denied sexually assaulting Ms. Kinsman.Mr. Winston was briefly suspended from the Florida State baseball team in 2014 after acknowledging stealing $32 worth of crab legs from a supermarket, and he was suspended for the Seminoles’ football game against Clemson last fall after he shouted an obscene phrase in the student union.AdvertisementThe rape allegation against Mr. Winston became a lightning rod for the issue of sexual violence on campus. President Obama’s administration has made a point of addressing that broader issue, launching the “It’s On Us” campaign in partnership with, among others, the N.C.A.A.An article on Friday about a lawsuit filed against the former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston by the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her referred incorrectly to the Tallahassee Police Department’s investigation. Winston was never questioned; it is not the case that he “was not questioned by the Tallahassee Police Department until nearly two weeks after it learned of the allegation.”A version of this article appears in print on April 17, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Woman Sues Winston Over Rape Accusations.
