Lions (0-3) at Seahawks (1-2)8:30 p.m. Eastern, ESPNLine: Seahawks by 10 ½Kam Chancellor’s importance to the Seahawks has as much to do with the fear he instills in opposing players as it does with actual tackles or interceptions. A wide receiver struggling to break free from Richard Sherman’s coverage knows that even if he manages to find an opening in the middle of the field, he will pay the price for it when Chancellor crushes him.The strategy fell apart when Chancellor held out for the season’s first two games in hopes of securing a new contract. He returned to the team in Week 3 without a new deal, but Seattle’s 0-2 start gave him leverage to renegotiate after the season.Detroit’s quarterback, Matthew Stafford, has struggled to get things going, throwing five interceptions in his team’s winless start, and with Chancellor taking away the middle of the field, that number could grow.Marshawn Lynch is listed as questionable for Seattle, but the team is in good hands with Thomas Rawls and Fred Jackson if Lynch is unable to play.Pick: Seahawks BENJAMIN HOFFMANA version of this article appears in print on October 5, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Monday’s Matchup.
