Panthers at Seahawks8:15 p.m., Line: Seahawks by 11When the 2010 Seahawks became the first division winner with a losing record, they were able to quiet their critics by beating the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints in the playoffs. Although it would be fun if defending champion Seattle came full-circle and was eliminated by the league’s second sub-.500 division winner, the chances seem rather slim.The Seahawks’ rough start to the season has been long forgotten, as they have won six consecutive games. Their defense has rediscovered its dominant form, and their offense has hardly missed a beat without Percy Harvin, who was traded to the Jets after two years as more of a concept than anything tangible.If Carolina’s season ends Saturday, it should still be considered a success as the Panthers showed remarkable resilience, starting 3-8-1 but winning a wild-card playoff game. Last Saturday, the Panthers’ defense, which has found its mojo, held Arizona to 78 total net yards of offense, setting an N.F.L. record. That should come with a huge asterisk because the Cardinals were forced to use the third-stringer Ryan Lindley, who might have been the worst quarterback to ever start a playoff game.Russell Wilson is considerably better than Lindley, and Carolina’s unusual run should come to an end.Pick: SeahawksPicks do not reflect the betting line.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition.
