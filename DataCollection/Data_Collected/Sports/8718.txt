The Chicago Bulls expect Derrick Rose to return this season after having surgery Friday to repair a medial meniscus tear in his right knee.General Manager Gar Forman said Rose, a star point guard, would be out four to six weeks. Forman described the procedure as minor and said that Rose was able to bear weight on his legs.Rose played in only 10 games last season before having surgery for a similar injury in November 2013, cutting short his long-awaited comeback from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.He had the meniscus reattached in that operation. This time, the team physician Dr. Brian Cole removed the damaged part of the meniscus.AdvertisementROCKETS 102, NETS 98 Terrence Jones scored a season-high 26 points, James Harden made the tiebreaking free throw with 43 seconds left and followed it with a jumper, and host Houston edged the Nets.Mason Plumlee and Deron Williams had 15 points apiece for the Nets.CLIPPERS 97, GRIZZLIES 79 Chris Paul had 19 points and 13 assists, DeAndre Jordan added 15 points and 22 rebounds, and visiting Los Angeles topped Memphis.Zach Randolph led the Grizzlies with 20 points and 10 rebounds, while connecting on 10 of 18 shots.PELICANS 104, HEAT 102 Alexis Ajinca made the go-ahead layup with 26 seconds left and scored a career-high 24 points to help host New Orleans outlast Miami.Eric Gordon scored 20 points, and Tyreke Evans had 19 points and 11 assists for the Pelicans.BULLS 96, TIMBERWOLVES 89 Host Chicago used another big night by Jimmy Butler to thump Minnesota.Butler had 28 points and 12 rebounds.Kevin Martin scored 18 points for the Timberwolves.JAZZ 104, NUGGETS 82 Derrick Favors had 21 points, 10 rebounds and 3 blocks, Trey Burke came off the bench to score 19 points, and visiting Utah ran away from Denver.
