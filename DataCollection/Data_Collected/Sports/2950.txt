Dolphins (3-5) at Eagles (4-4)1 p.m. Line: Eagles by 6.5N.F.L. Week 10 scores and highlightsIt took awhile to get going, but the Eagles appear to have gotten their swagger back. They have won three of their last four, with Chip Kelly’s offense piling up yardage and points in those games; the Eagles have averaged 438 yards and 28 points per game in their last four.The Dolphins appear to have been dealt a reality check in the last couple of weeks after winning two straight after Joe Philbin was fired as coach. After blowing out the Titans and the Texans under their new coach, Dan Campbell, Miami has been beaten handily by the Bills and the Patriots in its last two games.PICK: EaglesWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
