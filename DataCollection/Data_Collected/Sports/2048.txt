AdvertisementSupported byBy Benjamin HoffmanSeattle Seahawks (3-4) at Dallas Cowboys (2-4)4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 6At least the Cowboys have an excuse for their poor play. Their offense is reliant on quarterback Tony Romo and wideout Dez Bryant, and both have been sidelined during a four-game losing streak.Bryant may return this week, but he will be trying to learn the tendencies of a new quarterback, Matt Cassel, and he will do so while being harassed by a Seattle secondary that has given him fits over the years.The Seahawks have been a mess all season, and can no longer blame Kam Chancellorâ€™s two-game holdout, but they were able to maul the 49ers last week, and they face a similarly incompetent opponent this week, so they should get back to .500 even if the win will do nothing to change the minds of doubters.PICK: SEAHAWKSAdvertisement
