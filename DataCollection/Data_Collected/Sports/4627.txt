Chargers (3-9) at Chiefs (7-5)1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 10N.F.L. Week 14 scores and highlightsThe Chiefs will be vying for their seventh victory in a row, while the Chargers have lost seven of eight, included a 33-3 shellacking at home to the Chiefs in Week 11. On paper, the Chargers stand little chance, but a road game against a red-hot division opponent appears to be just the type of game in which a little Philip Rivers magic could come into play. He will have a healthy Antonio Gates at his disposal, and has performed well away from home, throwing for 1,104 yard with nine touchdowns and no interceptions in his last three road games. Do not be surprised if Rivers pulls a rabbit out of his cowboy hat.PICK: ChargersWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
