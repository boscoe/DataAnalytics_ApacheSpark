CHICAGO —  As the Mets clinched their first pennant since 2000 on Wednesday, their 8-3 victory over the Cubs came with sobering news. Yoenis Cespedes, their star slugger, exited the game in the second inning with a sore left shoulder. The severity of the injury and how it occurred were not immediately clear, but after the game, Manager Terry Collins indicated it was not serious.“They didn’t think there was any damage,” Collins said. “They thought an injection would calm it down in a day, so he’ll be ready. We’re going to work out on Friday, and I’m sure he’ll be ready for that.”Speculation swirled after the injury, because Cespedes had been spotted playing golf at a Chicago-area course earlier in the day, according to a report from a local NBC affiliate. An avid golfer, Cespedes often seeks out courses to play when he is on road trips.Cespedes has been one of the driving forces for the Mets all year. During the regular season, he was a dark-horse candidate for the Most Valuable Player Award. In the division and championship series, he batted .265 and had a double, two home runs, and seven R.B.I. in nine games.“You’re looking at the balls he’s beat out for infield singles, the throws, the defense, the stolen base last night, and now he’s starting to swing the bat,” Collins said before the game, when asked about how well Cespedes was playing. “He’s got all the tools it takes to be the kind of player everybody says he is. And right now, on this stage, he’s starting to show it off.”Luckily for the Mets, they clinched early enough so that Cespedes can rest his aching shoulder. The Mets have five full days off before the World Series begins Tuesday.A version of this article appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Sore Shoulder Puts Cespedes Out of Game In 2nd Inning.
