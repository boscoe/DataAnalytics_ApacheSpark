Mike Trout led the American League in four traditional categories last season. Three — runs, runs batted in and total bases — helped him win his first Most Valuable Player Award. The other reflected the reality that, in this era, even the game’s best player can be a leader of the strikeout parade.Trout, the Los Angeles Angels’ center fielder, led the A.L. in strikeouts, with 184. He enters the season with one goal for improving his game.
                What makes a baseball record unbreakable? Sometimes the game changes and that puts a record out of reach. Sometimes an exceptional performance is too dominant to be matched. When the two combine, the record could last for centuries.            “Cut down the strikeouts,” said Trout, who would like to do so by half. “You’ve got to set your goals high. You can’t say, ‘I’m going to cut it down a quarter.’ Just try to get on base and go from there.”But those may be contradictory ambitions. Jerry Dipoto, the Angels’ general manager, said he did not want Trout to attempt to change too much.Advertisement“I don’t know if it’s humanly possible to cut the strikeouts in half, as deep as he runs counts, because I don’t want to see him sacrifice his on-base to do that,” Dipoto said. “But Mike knows the strike zone. For him, it’s one area that he got very prone to chasing, and Mike is a disciplined hitter with a good enough idea of the strike zone that he’s going to figure it out.”That area is clear to pitchers and scouts. Trout destroys low pitches, and his totals last season in homers (36), R.B.I. (111) and total bases (338) were career highs. But he is prone to chasing high fastballs. “Belt up, he has a hole because he’s got that uphill swing,” said one A.L. advance scout, who was granted anonymity so he could candidly share his team’s reports. “But most guys don’t like to pitch up there, even with fastballs, and nobody tries to throw a breaking ball up there.Advertisement“So the odds are stacked in his favor because he’s only got one hole, and pitchers aren’t used to going after that spot. If you can get three fastballs in there, that’s the only way to get him, and don’t bother messing with a breaking ball up there because you’re throwing it slower and giving him a chance to catch up. He strikes out a lot more now than he used to, but to me, it’s a big whatever. The trade-off for the extra power is fine.”Of the 21 others who have struck out 184 times in a season, not one has followed up by playing a full year and cutting his strikeouts by half. Then again, Trout is unlike almost any player who came before, and he is only 23 years old.“I don’t think the norm for Mike is going to be those gaudy, high strikeouts, but what he did is he traded aggression to gather more power, and it worked,” Dipoto said. “Now he has to figure out how to balance the scales a little bit. I will bet on Mike Trout, whatever it is we’re talking about.”A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on Page SP10 of the New York edition with the headline: M.V.P.
