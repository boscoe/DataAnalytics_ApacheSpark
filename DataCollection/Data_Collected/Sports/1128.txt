Chiefs (1-4) at Vikings (2-2)1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 4N.F.L. Week 6 scores and highlightsThis could have been a matchup of aging running backs who could still get things done, but a torn anterior cruciate ligament ended Jamaal Charles’s season and may have sunk what has been a disappointing season for Kansas City. The team’s defense is strong enough to keep it in games, even against a rejuvenated Adrian Peterson, so expecting a total collapse is probably unwise, but if a few losses pile up in the coming weeks, it may be hard for the players to stay motivated.PICK: VIKINGSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
