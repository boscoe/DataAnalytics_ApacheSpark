Neither he nor Forde traveled with the team to Texas.It has not been unusual for Oregon to be without one or more of its top players this season. “We will ride,” Helfrich said during the title game’s media day. Wide receiver Bralon Addison missed the season, and injuries on the offensive line were widely blamed for Oregon’s sole loss, a 31-24 home defeat to Arizona on Oct. 2.Oregon (13-1) has won its last four games without tight end Pharaoh Brown, who had 25 catches for 420 yards and six touchdowns before a leg injury sidelined him. In the Rose Bowl, the College Football Playoff semifinal against Florida State, Oregon was without wide receiver Devon Allen, who hurt his knee on the opening kickoff. “We’re able to play with the next man up,” said safety Erick Dargan, the Ducks’ leading tackler.It helps that Oregon has had stability at quarterback with Marcus Mariota, the Heisman Trophy winner.“We have a bunch of highly skilled guys that are very confident in what they’re doing,” Helfrich said. “Marcus is confident in those guys, and we’re confident in those guys.“We’ve been tested in that realm of guys not being available for whatever reason all season long, and our guys have stepped up.”Helfrich would not say more about Carrington or Forde.Of missing players, Helfrich added, “If all we did was sit around and complain about that and whine about that, we wouldn’t be here.”Advertisement
