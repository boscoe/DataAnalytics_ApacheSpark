Louisville announced Friday that Coach Rick Pitino would skip next week’s Atlantic Coast Conference media session on the advice of lawyers because of allegations by the escort Katina Powell that the former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee hired dancers for sex parties. McGee has resigned as an assistant coach at Missouri-Kansas City, saying he could no longer do the job as he fought the allegations.■ Prosecutors in Michigan said that the former Michigan State star Mateen Cleaves, now a television analyst, was the subject of a sexual assault investigation but that he had not been charged.A version of this brief appears in print on October 24, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Pitino to Skip Media Session.
