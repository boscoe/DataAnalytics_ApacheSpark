He said Holm would like to fight Miesha Tate, the No. 2 contender, in the interim.The Los Angeles Times reported that White responded to this with a sarcastic, “We’re real concerned with his opinion.”The U.F.C. keeps its top fighters under contract and has a great deal of control over who fights whom. While that often gives fans the matchups they want to see, fighters are not always delighted with whom they are told to face.Because she sustained head injuries in the Holm fight, Rousey was suspended for 180 days by the U.F.C., although that could be lifted if she has a negative CT scan.Of a possible Rousey rematch, Holm told The New York Times last month: “She’s going to come back. She’s mad that it’s not her title anymore. I’ve got to be twice as ready as last time.”Advertisement
