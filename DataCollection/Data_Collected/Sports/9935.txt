With 13 seconds to play, the Crusaders bungled their final possession and could not get a shot off. Instead, Evan Smotrycz, a senior forward for the Terrapins, came up with the ball as the clock expired and the buzzer sounded in the Midwest Region game. The fourth-seeded Terrapins — which missed four of their final five shots — were paced by Melo Trimble, Dez Wells and Jared Nickens, who combined for 42 points. Despite a strong display of shooting (including a 9-of-21 showing from behind the 3-point arc), Maryland was challenged in a game it was heavily favored to win. After falling behind early, Valparaiso — which has not won in the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1998 — used a 19-4 run that seemed to bolster its confidence. They trailed, 31-27, at intermission, but played as if they had finally found their footing in the rugged and tightly contested second half.Valparaiso was led by a pair of freshmen in Alec Peters, a rangy forward, who scored 18 points and made four 3-pointers, and Tevonn Walker, a quick guard, who added 14 points. Maryland will play No. 5 West Virginia on Sunday in the round of 32.Advertisement
