SEATTLE —  About halfway through the first half, Seth Tuttle, Northern Iowa’s star senior forward, crashed toward the basket during an inbound play, received the ball midair and missed the easy basket. No matter. He got his own rebound and tossed the ball a few feet to the junior guard Paul Jesperson, who made the layup.After several upsets Thursday of good-but-not-great teams by decent-but-not-good ones, there was something refreshing about No. 5 seed Northern Iowa’s 71-54 win over No. 12 Wyoming. Northern Iowa was plainly the better team.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            The Panthers dominated the first half, heading to the locker room ahead by 11.Midway through the second half, though, Wyoming mounted a run, at one point outscoring the Panthers, 14-0, and cutting its deficit to 7.But Northern Iowa restarted and played the Cowboys to a draw from there, trading baskets and locking up the win.The Panthers were methodical, befitting a team that averaged 21.2 seconds per offensive possession, according to KenPom.com. They play with something like two four-man platoons, the fifth man being Tuttle. He had 14 points and 9 rebounds and played all but six of the game’s 40 minutes. Typically as much a facilitator as a scorer — he is third on the team in assists per 40 minutes — he had several attempted assists that were errant, resulting in slowed-down plays or turnovers.For the outmatched Cowboys, the key players were the senior forward Larry Nance Jr., who had 16 points, a team-leading seven rebounds and two big-time blocks in the second half, and the senior guard Charles Hankerson Jr., who scored 15 points.A version of this article appears in print on March 21, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition.
