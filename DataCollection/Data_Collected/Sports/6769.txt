Jane Helser recently retired after working for nearly 50 years at the Wilson Sporting Goods factory, the source of the N.F.L.’s handmade footballs.ADA, Ohio —  The first day Jane Helser went to work sewing footballs at the Wilson Sporting Goods factory in town, Lyndon Johnson was building his Great Society, Johnny Unitas was tossing passes for the Colts, and Apollo 11 was three years from landing on the moon.Helser, then 19, worked at a bakery near her home in this farm town about an hour south of Toledo. But she wanted to buy a new car, so she took a higher-paying job at the Wilson factory, where her older sister, Lucille, and Lucille’s husband, Merle, worked.Jane Helser knew little about football or factories. But thanks to her mother and some home economics classes, she knew how to use a sewing machine. That was enough to get a job sewing the footballs used in the N.F.L.For the next 48 years, as presidents, football players and moon missions came and went, Helser worked four 10-hour shifts every week, stitching leather panels together, four at time, to form the bodies of footballs that would be used in games that she rarely watched.

According to reports by ESPN and others, the N.F.L. found that 11 of the New England Patriots’ 12 game balls were underinflated during their rout of the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday in the A.F.C. championship game. The balls were approved by a referee before the game but were checked again at halftime. They were reinflated after they were found to have lost about two pounds per square inch of pressure.AdvertisementThe scandal, which some have called Deflategate, has caused some to wonder how and when the balls were deflated after they met the N.F.L.’s exacting specifications and were shipped from the Wilson factory here. Helser said the Wilson employees had done their jobs.Advertisement“When it leaves our factory, they may have trouble with a bladder every once in a while with losing some air,” she said. “But when they have 11 out of 12 balls losing air, it’s not Wilson’s fault. I’m sure when it left our factory here in Ada, it was as good as it could be.”Despite reports that the cold weather or a player spiking the ball might have led to the deflation, the only way to remove that much air that quickly would be to put a needle in the valve and to let the air seep out, said Kevin Murphy, who runs the American football division at Wilson.Wilson, he said, goes to great lengths to ensure the N.F.L. balls do not leak, even in extreme heat or cold. Every ball has a special three-ply urethane bladder inside, and during production, the balls are filled with 100 pounds of air pressure and then deflated to 13 pounds, the amount required for game balls.
                N.F.L. officials are investigating whether the Patriots violated league rules by using footballs that were not properly inflated during the A.F.C. championship game against the Colts on Sunday.            Michael Signora, a spokesman for the league, said the N.F.L. was “continuing our review and will provide information as soon as possible.” To the 130 workers in the Wilson factory, the scandal may as well be occurring in a distant universe. In their low-slung factory the size of a big-box store, they use production techniques refined over decades to eliminate imperfections and meet the league’s exacting specifications. And once the balls are shipped to teams, the workers cannot control what is done to them.Instead, they are turning their focus to the Super Bowl. Now that the Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks have secured berths in the Feb. 1 game, the workers are racing to finish the roughly 10,000 commemorative footballs that are made for the game and are sold for about $130 each.Yet for the first time since Vince Lombardi led the Green Bay Packers to victory in Super Bowl II, Helser is not on the front lines. Having retired last summer, she now works only on special projects like the Super Bowl. At 67, she has lost some of the hand strength needed to manipulate the stiff leather panels, which are cut from large slices of cow hide cured to Wilson’s specifications by Horween, a leather company in Chicago.“It was time,” she said, adding that she made about 150 balls a day on average. “I was going to do it last year, but then I decided that physically I was ready, but mentally I wasn’t.”AdvertisementHelser’s nearly half-century of sewing footballs, though, is just one chapter in the N.F.L.’s most enduring business relationship. Wilson has been the exclusive manufacturer of footballs for the league since 1941.Almost 75 years later, much is the same. According to N.F.L. rules, the ball must weigh no more than 15 ounces and must be in the form of a “prolate spheroid” that is 11 to 11 ¼ inches long and 28 to 28 ½ inches around at its widest. A urethane bladder inside the ball is covered by a tan pebble-grained leather case.“The look, feel and size of the ball hasn’t changed,” Murphy said. “The last thing we want is all sorts of records to be broken” because the company altered something.The production process has not changed much, either.The leather arrives each Monday from Chicago, where Horween tans it to Wilson’s specifications. The hides are 22 square feet, about the side of a cow, and have been cured in a secret milky, tacky liquid created for Wilson. Before the leather gets to Ada, it is pounded to give it a pebbly feel, and tiny W’s are embossed on the leather to ensure authenticity.The hides are laid on a table, and a metal form is pressed down to cut out oval panels, which are then weighed and matched for color consistency. A thin layer of leather is peeled off the backs of the panels to reduce their weight.After they are stacked in sets of four, the panels are stamped with the N.F.L. logo and other design features. Mesh linings made out of rubber and cotton are then affixed to the panels to help the ball maintain its shape.The panels are sewed inside out in halves, perhaps the most difficult job in the factory. The halves are then sewn together with heavy thread to make an inside-out football, which is put in a steam box to soften the leather and is stretched. The seams are rolled to flatten them.Lacers turn the balls outside in, stuff a rubber bladder inside and push a nipple through a small hole so the balls can be inflated. Laces are added using an awl. The ball is overinflated to stretch the seams and is deflated to its designed weight.Advertisement“I still get goose bumps when I grab a game ball,” Murphy said. “It’s the perfect shape, feel and smell.”N.F.L. balls are just a small part of the production at the factory. In all, about 700,000 leather balls a year, between 3,000 and 4,000 a day, are made in Ada, with about half of them shipped in the spring to high schools and colleges. (Nonleather balls are produced in China.)Although Wilson says it controls about 70 percent of the game-ball market, companies like Nike have pushed in. This makes Wilson’s exclusive N.F.L. agreement even more important.“The N.F.L. is a big deal for us because if you get a product like that in the hands of the best players in the world, it’s huge,” Murphy said.As part of its partnership with the league, Wilson provides a certain number of balls at no cost to each team, which can order extras as needed. All equipment managers have their own ways of breaking in the footballs, and quarterbacks have their preferences, too. Before each game, each team brings 12 of its footballs to the officials, who inspect and initial them. Balls can be used in games only three times.To avoid pumping balls to make them more buoyant — an advantage for kickers — teams are given so-called k-balls before each game that are used specifically on kicking plays.For the Super Bowl, the Seahawks and the Patriots will each get 108 balls and will take 54 to the game. Wilson, though, will make its money — and then some — by selling commemorative balls with the N.F.L. logo to shops around the country.Wilson will also set up a demonstration booth where fans can see the balls made. Though she is retired, Helser will help run that booth and will attend her 10th Super Bowl afterward. She is particularly fond of Peyton Manning, but the teams in the game are of less interest. She prefers to admire her handicraft.“When I’m at a Super Bowl, and I walk in that stadium at kickoff time, and I see that football sitting down there on that field, way down there on the field, I say, ‘I sewed that football,’ ” she said.A version of this article appears in print on January 22, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Handing Off to the N.F.L. for 48 Years.
