Powell’s lawyer, Larry Wilder, said via text message that she would meet with the N.C.A.A. as part of its investigation into whether McGee paid her $10,000 for 22 shows at the players’ dormitory between 2010 and 2014. Because the commonwealth attorney’s office may be moving toward criminal charges against Powell, Wilder said, “It is no longer in her best interest to forgo meeting with the N.C.A.A. and sharing all of the demonstrative evidence.” ■ The N.C.A.A. is moving its March Madness selection meeting to New York City. The meeting to set the bracket had been held in Indianapolis and, before that, in Kansas City. Joseph Castiglione, chairman of the Division I men’s basketball committee and the Oklahoma athletic director, said the move, which begins in March, was intended to raise the profile of the session.
