The Jets have accused the Patriots of tampering because of comments that Robert K. Kraft, owner of the Patriots, made Monday about Darrelle Revis, the star cornerback who signed with the Jets this month.The move, confirmed by a person who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, comes after Woody Johnson, owner of the Jets, was formally accused of tampering by the Patriots because of comments he made about Revis late last year while Revis was playing for the Patriots. That, however, was before Revis became a free agent. Johnson said at the time that he would love to have Revis on the Jets. The league has yet to rule on that charge.On Monday, Kraft was asked about why the Patriots were unable to keep Revis from leaving. “We thought we made a very competitive offer, and I speak as a fan of the New England Patriots, we wanted to keep him, wanted to keep him in our system,” Kraft told reporters.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
