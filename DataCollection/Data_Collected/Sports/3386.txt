Week 11 scores and highlightsThe Seahawks probably lost any chance at a division title when they fell to Arizona last week, and a home game against the lowly 49ers should give them ample opportunity to take out their frustrations on a rival. Conveniently, the 49ers offer no threat on offense, and no resistance on defense, so Seattle has an opportunity for a slump-busting game. Even the 12th Man fans, reeling from a home loss, should get to have fun forcing Blaine Gabbert into numerous false starts and delays of game.PICK: SeattleAdvertisement
