RoundupBy The Associated PressErik Karlsson is not the biggest fan of three-on-three hockey, but he came through in overtime to cap the Ottawa Senators’ comeback win on Saturday night.Karlsson, a defenseman, scored after a cross-ice pass from Bobby Ryan 3 minutes 34 seconds into the extra period to lift the Senators to a 3-2 victory over the Islanders.Mike Hoffman had forced overtime by scoring with 37 seconds left in regulation after Ottawa trailed by two earlier in the period.“We found a way to get it tied late, and the guy on my team that hates three-on-three the worst enjoyed it tonight,” Senators Coach Dave Cameron said of Karlsson.Mark Stone also scored for the Senators, and Karlsson had two assists. Craig Anderson, making his 10th consecutive start, had 29 saves.“I think I said it numerous times: He’s an elite goaltender, and he’s a big part of our success,” Cameron said of Anderson.Matt Martin and Josh Bailey gave the Islanders a 2-0 lead before Ottawa stormed back.Jaroslav Halak stopped 26 shots for the Islanders, who had a four-game winning streak end but recorded a point for the seventh consecutive game (5-0-2).“There’s a lot of things that happen in a game,” Islanders Coach Jack Capuano said. “You can’t fault the guys for their effort, but the way that it unfolded at the end, it had nothing to do with their work ethic or their structure.”Capuano added that the Senators “just got the bounces that they needed.”The Islanders opened the scoring 1:49 into the game when Martin picked up a loose puck near the top of the right circle and fired a shot that deflected off the leg of Senators defenseman Mark Borowiecki and past Anderson.Ottawa went on the power play twice in the first period but was held to four shots.An aggressive forecheck by the Islanders held the Senators in their own zone for much of the second period.The Islanders went on the power play for the first time 5:15 into the third period when Mika Zibanejad took an ill-timed penalty for slashing. They capitalized on the opportunity, making the score 2-0 at 7:02.MAPLE LEAFS 4, BLUES 1 Nazem Kadri scored twice, and Roman Polak had two assists to lead Toronto past host St. Louis, his former team.Brad Boyes and P. A. Parenteau also scored for the Maple Leafs, who had lost two straight and five of six. Garret Sparks stopped 27 shots for his second career victory.HURRICANES 3, CANADIENS 2 Jeff Skinner scored his second goal of the game late in the third period, lifting Carolina at home over Montreal.Joakim Nordstrom also scored, and Cam Ward stopped 36 shots for the Hurricanes.JETS 2, CAPITALS 1 Mark Scheifele scored with 20 seconds left in overtime to lift Winnipeg over visiting Washington, ending the Capitals’ season-high six-game winning streak.Scheifele scored after Jacob Trouba cycled down low with the puck. Trouba passed to Scheifele in the left face-off circle, and Scheifele fired the puck past Braden Holtby on his glove side. Washington Coach Barry Trotz challenged the goal, saying Jets forward Blake Wheeler was offside, but it stood.KINGS 5, PENGUINS 3 Jake Muzzin had a goal and two assists during a four-goal second period for Los Angeles, which held off Pittsburgh for its third consecutive victory.Milan Lucic scored twice as the Kings earned a fifth straight home win. Drew Doughty and Christian Ehrhoff also scored for the first-place Kings.WILD 3, AVALANCHE 0 Darcy Kuemper stopped all nine shots he faced in relief of the injured Devan Dubnyk, and Minnesota beat visiting Colorado.Dubnyk left a scoreless game with a lower-body injury midway through the second period after making 11 saves.
