The summary noted that Haskell did not receive the information until 40 minutes after he had to submit his lineup on FanDuel.The summary did not address how, or why, Haskell possessed that information.DraftKings declined to say whether the law firm was investigating allegations that two other employees, Jon Aguiar and Rick Sawyer, had access to nonpublic data.The F.B.I. and the New York attorney’s general office are investigating whether employees of DraftKings and FanDuel used predatory tactics to win money from casual customers on one another’s sites. In addition, The Associated Press reported Monday that Georgia regulators were questioning whether the companies could operate under the state’s tight restrictions on gambling.The F.B.I. inquiry is also examining whether DraftKings encouraged and accepted deposits and bets from states where the contests were prohibited, according to fantasy players who said they had been contacted by agents. The information under review includes a post by Jon Aguiar, an executive in charge of developing high-volume fantasy players, on a public thread informing players how to deposit funds and play in contests in states and countries where the games are prohibited.Nevada regulators ruled Thursday that daily fantasy sports should be considered gambling, not games of skill, and ordered the websites to suspend operations until the companies and their employees received state gambling licenses.FanDuel and some smaller rivals did so, but a spokeswoman for DraftKings said it was making an exception for some of its customers in Nevada, acknowledging that “players who had already entered games on Thursday” were able to continue to play “until games close and are paid out on Monday night, regardless of their location.”In addition, the Nevada-based blog Legal Sports Report said it was able to enter daily fantasy sports contests on DraftKings from a Nevada I.P. address — something it was unable to do on rival sites such as FanDuel.A. G. Burnett, the chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said that he was aware of DraftKings’s stance and that his agency was monitoring the situation.As state and federal investigations continue and class-action suits alleging fraud pile up — there are at least 10 so far — the fallout is having an impact on business. The total participation and spending for both DraftKings and FanDuel fell on Sunday for the first time this N.F.L. season, according to SuperLobby, an independent site tracking the industry’s guaranteed-prize games.DraftKings posted 3.76 million entries in guaranteed prize pools on Sunday, compared with 4.14 million the week before; total entry fees dropped to $22.86 million from $25.05 million. FanDuel had 3.27 million entries on Sunday, compared with 3.38 million a week earlier; entry fees dropped to $19.93 million from $20.58 million.“The daily fantasy sports industry experienced a reality check yesterday,” David Copeland, SuperLobby’s chief executive, said in a statement Monday.Advertisement
