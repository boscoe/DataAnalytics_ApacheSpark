We rarely hear about all the athletes passing through New York City who have a peaceful, enjoyable time at a nightclub. A private table, a little dancing, maybe some adult beverages ... a lovely night out before heading to practice in the morning. Occasionally, however, night turns into morning and everything gets a bit messy. In the most recent incident, Chris Copeland, a former Knick who now plays for the Indiana Pacers, was stabbed in the abdomen during an argument early Wednesday at the club 1 Oak in Chelsea. New Yorkâ€™s nightlife scene has seen plenty of other fracases over the years involving pro athletes. Can you identify the sports figure who participated (allegedly, in some cases) in each of these?
