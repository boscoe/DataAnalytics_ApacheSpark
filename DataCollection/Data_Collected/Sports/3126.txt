Bowles said that the reports on Fitzpatrick’s recovery were promising and that he was hopeful Fitzpatrick could at least resume practicing in a limited capacity upon his return.Before Fitzpatrick had his thumb repaired Friday, he and the Jets were told that as long as the surgery proceeded without complications, he would heal quickly enough to avoid missing a game.Bowles said that he would monitor whether Fitzpatrick’s surgery affected his ability to receive the snap from under center and to hand off the ball, and that he expected to make a decision after Friday’s practice.“If he doesn’t practice all week,” Bowles said, “he’s not playing.”Bowles sounded optimistic that Antonio Cromartie, who missed Thursday’s loss to Buffalo with a deep thigh bruise, would be available against the Texans. But Bowles suggested that another member of the Jets’ injury-ravaged secondary, safety Calvin Pryor, must prove that he can return.Pryor said Monday that he expected to play after sitting out the last three games because of a high ankle sprain.“I’ll believe him after Wednesday and Thursday,” Bowles said. “He ran around, but he ran straight.”Advertisement
