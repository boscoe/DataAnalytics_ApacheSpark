CreditBrendan Bannon for The New York Times        ERIE, Pa. —  For Connor McDavid, an 18-year-old center for the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League and the most anticipated N.H.L. prospect in decades, compliments accrue as steadily as goals and assists.The Otters’ assistant coach Jay McKee, who played 13 seasons as an N.H.L. defenseman, has been known to pull out his phone on the bench during games to record a clip of McDavid’s dazzling play.Tim Murray, general manager of the Buffalo Sabres, a self-described “glass-half-empty guy” not given to giddy appraisals, said he has not seen a better junior player. “I watch him too much and I think too much about him,” said Murray, who has been scouting teenage N.H.L. prospects for 23 seasons. “I wish I could help myself.”Sherry Bassin, the Otters’ 75-year-old owner who possesses a lifetime of hockey memories and a voice like an old record, scratchy and faint, recalled that the Hockey Hall of Famer Dale Hawerchuk, who coaches the O.H.L. rival Barrie Colts, said of McDavid: “He skates like Bobby Orr. He has the vision of Wayne Gretzky. And he handles the puck like Mario Lemieux.”AdvertisementYet the oddest and perhaps highest form of praise concerns the N.H.L. teams presumed to be giving something less than their best effort late in the season in order to finish last in the standings and improve their chances of selecting McDavid first in the N.H.L. draft in June.AdvertisementAccording to the odds of an N.H.L. draft lottery, the team finishing last will have the greatest chance (20 percent) of receiving the No. 1 pick, but will select no worse than second, a slot most likely reserved for the standout Boston University center Jack Eichel, another so-called generational talent.Murray’s Sabres occupy the inside track to the top prospects after losing, 4-3, in overtime to the Arizona Coyotes on Thursday. With 48 points entering the weekend, and eight games left in the season, Buffalo ranks 30th in the N.H.L., while Arizona sits in 29th place with 54 points. The teams play one another again Monday night.The bizarre race to the bottom has riveted and divided fans at First Niagara Center in Buffalo, where a sign in the upper deck Thursday read “# Pray for McDavid,” and many in attendance actually cheered the Sabres’ loss. Meanwhile, The Buffalo News has been running a graphic in its sports section each day called “McEichel Derby,” featuring the bottom-of-the-league standings, accompanied by the statistics of McDavid and Eichel.Murray, architect of an inferior roster, has made no secret of his desire to add the 6-foot-1, 187-pound McDavid to the Sabres.“You go through a year like this, it’s tough,” Murray said. “I feel bad for our players, I really do. It’s been a tough year. I’m the type of G.M., as everybody can see, I’ve traded away a lot of good players for the simple fact we have to get better. Our time’s the future. This guy I call our franchise-changing player.”For his part, McDavid has handled the attention and expectations with equanimity, steady offensive production and characteristic reserve.Despite missing six weeks with a broken hand, injured during a November fight, he finished third in scoring in the O.H.L. with 120 points, including 44 goals in 47 games. In January, he helped Canada win the world junior championship in Toronto, tying for the tournament lead with 11 points in seven games.Advertisement“It was an unbelievable feeling,” McDavid said in a voice so low and flat that reporters had to lean in close to capture his words. He added: “If anything, it drives you more to try to get back to that feeling and experience it. For myself, personally, that was the greatest moment of my life, for sure.”As the Otters’ team captain, McDavid will try to duplicate the euphoria in pursuit of a championship for Erie, which lost, 3-2, to the Sarnia Sting on Thursday in the first round of the best-of-five playoff series. Erie won Game 2 on Friday, 3-1.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Afterward, hordes of fans have routinely waited outside in subzero temperatures for an autograph or a photo.Eventually, the Otters had to hire more security while on the road to escort McDavid to the team bus.“He cannot sign for hundreds of people while the bus is waiting and we need to get to the next city,” said McKee, the assistant coach.Given the unwavering hype and attention McDavid faces, his teammates and coaches have been quick to point out that his personal qualities remain underappreciated.“People don’t really see that he’s a regular kid,” said Dylan Strome, a center on the Otters who is expected to be selected in the first round of the draft, and McDavid’s best friend. “We like to have fun, too. We play mini-sticks all the time. We play poker pretty much every day, play video games, hang out, go out to eat. We just have fun.”McDavid would seem well suited to poker. He keeps his emotions mainly in check.“In the room, he will show emotion,” said Erie’s head coach, Kris Knoblauch. “He will call his teammates out. He’ll ask for them to be better, and also pat them on the butt and say, ‘Good job.’ ”The ice is another matter.A practice this month provided a study in contrasting styles. During a drill, McDavid dashed up the ice, his legs whirring like electric mixers. Handling the puck as if shuffling a deck of cards, he twice put it beneath the stick of Kurtis MacDermid, a 6-5, 222-pound defenseman, then streaked in on goalie Devin Williams, who saved his high shot.AdvertisementMacDermid, 21, bellowed obscenities that echoed through the empty arena before swatting a water bottle off the half boards in a rage.Having failed to score, McDavid shook his head and muttered to himself. He circled back to the bench for a squirt of water and a few minutes of quiet contemplation, a routine he repeated throughout the 90-minute practice.He was operating on the principle espoused by Theodore Roosevelt, speaking softly and carrying a big stick.A version of this article appears in print on March 29, 2015, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: The Next Great One Draws a Crowd.
