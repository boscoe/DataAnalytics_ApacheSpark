Week 11 scores and highlightsColts quarterback Matt Hasselbeck was once so confident in his ability that after winning an overtime coin toss, he blurted out, “We want the ball and we’re going to score!”The same player was asked to assess his currently ability before making the start this week in place of the injured Andrew Luck. His tone was different.“I know my limitations, so that might be my strength,” Hasselbeck told reporters. “But I have a lot of limitations.”Despite those limitations, Hasselbeck, 40, has helped account for two of the Colts’ victories, and getting a third may come down to what version of the Falcons shows up. At one point, they seemed like an offensive juggernaut, with Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and Devonta Freeman among the league’s best players. But three losses in four games — and a 10-7 win over the awful Titans their lone win — have the team coming out of its bye week with no one being sure what to expect.PICK: TossupAdvertisement
