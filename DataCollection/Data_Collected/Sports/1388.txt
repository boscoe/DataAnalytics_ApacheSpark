Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova ousted second-seeded Lucie Safarova from the Kremlin Cup, 6-1, 6-7 (2), 6-3, leaving Safarova vulnerable to being left out of the season-ending WTA finals next week in Singapore. Top-seeded Flavia Pennetta, the United States Open champion, secured her spot in the final by defeating Daria Gavrilova, 6-2, 6-4.

The last spot will go to Safarova unless Carla Suárez Navarro reaches the final in Moscow, where she is the only remaining seeded player.A version of this brief appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Safarova Upset in Moscow.
