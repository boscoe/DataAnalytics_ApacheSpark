Week 14 scores and highlightsWhen these teams met in Week 8, a 16-10 Bengals victory, Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger threw three interceptions, including two in the final minutes. Still, Pittsburgh had a chance to win on the final play, but Roethlisberger overshot his receiver. With wide receivers Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant now back to full health, DeAngelo Williams running well and tight end Heath Miller possibly returning, look for Pittsburgh’s offense to give the Bengals’ stout defense a good test.The Bengals, after losing two in a row, to the Texans and the Cardinals, after an 8-0 start, appear to be back on track with consecutive dominant performances against the Rams and the Browns. And they did so largely without one of their major offensive weapons, tight end Tyler Eifert, who sustained a neck injury against the Rams. Eifert, who leads the league with 12 touchdown receptions, returned to practice during the week and appears ready to play, which bodes well for the Bengals because the Steelers have struggled to defend tight ends.This one is pretty close to a must-win for the Steelers if they hope to make the playoffs. If the season ended today, they would be excluded from the postseason, while the Bengals would have home-field advantage throughout.PICK: Steelers Advertisement
