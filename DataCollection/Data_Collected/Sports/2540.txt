By now, the eight-lateral kick return for Miami’s winning touchdown over Duke last weekend has joined California’s five-lateral “Play to Beat the Band” against Stanford in 1982 in college football lore.Is there actually a way to prepare plays like that?Coaches say end-of-the-game plays can be drawn up and practiced, but the preparation really does not mean much in the heat of the moment. Think of it as more like organized chaos.“At some point, it’s all hell broke loose, and someone’s got to run out there and make a play,” said Tennessee’s special-teams coordinator, Mark Elder.“You have your initial plan on what you’re doing, but at some point that thing turns into backyard football like when you’re 10 years old and you’re tossing the ball around.”
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            The consensus from interviews with coaches during the last week was that teams devote time in preseason practice — and a little bit of time every one or two weeks during the season — to working on how to run and defend plays like Miami’s, appropriately named Desperado.Advertisement“You can practice it, but you can’t do it organized,” Florida State Coach Jimbo Fisher said. “That’s instinct and intuition as you go.”AdvertisementSimple principles are emphasized.On the return team, there may be a six-man front, with three blockers on each side. The other five players spread out and try to trail the man with the ball, giving him options for throwbacks and laterals.Ideally, the ball carrier should lateral before getting hit — to avoid having a knee touch the ground and thus end the play — and to ensure the accuracy of the pitch. The play flows toward open field until a tackle is made or a running lane opens.The kick coverage team is generally coached to have four interior players chase the ball while the rest stay disciplined and make sure the play does not break to the outside.“It’s never the same play twice,” Nebraska’s special teams coordinator, Bruce Read, said. “It’s very ad-lib. So you’re never really able to simulate what’s going to happen.”The chance of success for the return team?“It’s a divine intervention when that stuff happens,” Oklahoma’s special teams coordinator, Jay Boulware, said.“I don’t care how much you execute it, how well you think you executed it in practice, until you get into a live situation with live guys trying to tackle you, you really never know how those plays are going to unfold and what’s going to happen.”Specific players are assigned to the last-gasp kick return teams, much like the receivers and defensive backs who make up the “hands” team that fields onside kicks.Advertisement“There’s a lot of ballhandlers on there,” Boulware said.As amazing as it was, Miami’s 75-yard touchdown that Corn Elder finished against Duke should not have counted. The Atlantic Coast Conference confirmed what many people saw last weekend: A Miami player’s knee was down as he threw one of the laterals, and officials missed a block in the back.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
