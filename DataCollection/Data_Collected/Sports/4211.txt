Seahawks (6-5) at Vikings (8-3)1 p.m. Line: EvenN.F.L. Week 13 scores and highlightsThe Seahawks lost Marshawn Lynch to a sports hernia in Week 10, and last week Jimmy Graham tore a tendon in his knee and is out for the season. Despite that, Seattle’s offense, which had been struggling, has come away with 100 points over the last three weeks.Continuing to succeed without two of the team’s biggest stars would seem difficult in any circumstance. But going on the road to face a Vikings defense that has led the way to six wins in the last seven games is too tall a task even for Russell Wilson, Thomas Rawls and Doug Baldwin, who have each played so well recently.Last week against Atlanta, Adrian Peterson ran for 158 yards and passed O.J. Simpson, Corey Dillon and John Riggins on the career rushing list, putting him in 18th place. Another effort like that would get him past only Steven Jackson into 17th place, but it would probably ensure a Minnesota victory.PICK: VIKINGSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
