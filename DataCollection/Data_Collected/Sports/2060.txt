On Saturday night, in his third regular-season game since then, he had a terrific performance against the Washington Wizards.Anthony scored 37 points to ruin the Wizards’ home opener as the Knicks beat the Wizards, 117-110.“It felt good,” said Anthony, who had shot 14 of 43 in the Knicks’ first two games. “It’s been a while since February. I keep saying it, but it’s been a while for me to kind of have this experience.” Anthony was 11 for 18 from the field — hitting eight straight shots at one point — and hit four of his five 3-point attempts.Washington failed in its attempt to start a season 3-0 for the first time since 2005-6.Bradley Beal, who scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half, led Washington, and John Wall had 25.The Knicks (2-1) won their second road game of the season. They won seven road games all last season.Anthony missed his first two field-goal attempts, then hit the eight straight, including four 3-pointers, before his next miss.After his first 3-pointer, Anthony trotted over to the Washington owner Ted Leonsis, who was seated near his team’s bench, and the two bumped fists.“He’s just a good guy,” Anthony said. “I’m just showing my respect for him.” Otto Porter, who tried to defend Anthony, found it frustrating. “It’s all about his rhythm,” Porter said. “Once he gets his rhythm, he’s hard to defend. He’s a different player this year.”The game was physical, featuring 62 fouls and three technicals. It was an extraordinarily long regular-season game: 2 hours 38 minutes.“The physical nature of the game — I thought that brought the best out of Melo,” Knicks Coach Derek Fisher said. “There was a composure and a poise to everything he did.”Advertisement
