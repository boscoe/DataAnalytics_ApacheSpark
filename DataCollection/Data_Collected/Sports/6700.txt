WPIX-TV will carry about 20 Yankees games annually under a multiyear deal that brings the team back to the station, its longtime broadcast home in the New York area, a person familiar with the negotiations said. The Yankees were on WPIX from 1951 to 1998, from Mel Allen and Red Barber to Phil Rizzuto and Bobby Murcer.The deal will unite the Yankees and the Mets on WPIX, Channel 11, and it creates a 45-game block of baseball programming that the station can use to promote its news and prime-time programming. Last year, the Mets extended their deal with the station through 2017. The teams shared a cable outlet in the 1980s when their games were shown on SportsChannel New York.The deal ends, for now, a game of musical stations that began after the 1998 season when the Mets left WWOR, Channel 9, their longtime home, for WPIX. The Yankees have been nomadic by comparison, moving from WPIX to WNYW, Channel 5; to WCBS, Channel 2; and then, in 2005, to Channel 9.Most of the rest of the Mets’ and the Yankees’ games are on their regional cable channels, YES Network for the Yankees and SNY for the Mets.Sports Business Journal was the first to report the Yankees’ imminent move to Channel 11.A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees to Return to a Former TV Home, 20 Times a Year.
