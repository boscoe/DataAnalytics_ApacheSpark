Week 10 scores and highlightsWhen these teams met in Seattle last season, Arizona was 9-1 and held a three-game lead in the N.F.C. West on the second-place Seahawks. Seattle won that game, 19-3, and did not lose again until falling to the Patriots in the Super Bowl. The Cardinals, though, lost three of their last five games and finished second in the division to Seattle. You can bet that the fact that this game marked a turning point for both teams last season is on the minds of their coaches heading into this one.It should be noted that the Cardinals lost quarterback Carson Palmer before that 2014 game, and his absence led to some unstable play at quarterback that contributed greatly to their late-season slide. Arizona is 19-4 in the last 23 games started by Palmer dating to 2013. The Seahawks’ Pete Carroll, who coached the 35-year-old Palmer at Southern California, has certainly taken notice.“Carson is playing phenomenal football,” Carroll said during the week. “He looks as good as he’s ever looked. The best I’ve ever seen him in all of the years he’s been out there playing.”In addition to Palmer, two other players in their 30s are experiencing career rejuvenations in Arizona: Chris Johnson, 30, and Larry Fitzgerald, 32. Written off by many as being on the downside of their careers, the two are playing some of their best football. Johnson is third in the N.F.L. in rushing yards, while Fitzgerald ranks eighth in receptions and ninth in receiving yards.If the Seahawks have any chance of making a late run to snatch the N.F.C. West title away from the Cardinals, it probably needs to win this game. Working in their advantage: Coming off a bye week, they will be near full strength for one of the few times this season.PICK: SeahawksAdvertisement
