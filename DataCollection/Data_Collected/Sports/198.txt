Carolina Panthers (3-0) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (1-2)1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 3The Panthers are undefeated despite playing most of the time without Luke Kuechly or Kelvin Benjamin. It is the type of perseverance the team has rarely been associated with, but Cam Newton has the Panthers just four wins short of the team’s division-leading total from last season. The team has endured another loss, with defensive end Charles Johnson sidelined, but a trade for Jared Allen should pay dividends soon even if he is limited this week.Newton has always enjoyed playing Tampa Bay, with a combined 16 passing and receiving touchdowns in six career games. That good fortune should continue.Pick: PanthersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
