Colts (6-8) at Dolphins (5-9)1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 2.5Occasionally a division is so justly maligned that it almost seems that it does not deserve a champion. For much of the season, that distinction belonged to the N.F.C. East, but the A.F.C. South has caught up.The Colts, still alive even after last week’s loss to the Texans, can keep things going with a win over Miami, but they may have to do it without Matt Hasselbeck, the 40-year-old backup quarterback who has done an admirable job filling in for the injured Andrew Luck. But according to Coach Chuck Pagano, Hasselbeck has been “beat up from the feet up” and a jaw injury has supposedly limited him to a liquid diet. If he cannot stay in the game, Indianapolis will have to turn to Charlie Whitehurst.Meanwhile, a quality team like the Jets is likely to miss out on the playoffs.Picks: DolphinsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
