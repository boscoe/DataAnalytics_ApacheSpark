1 p.m., FoxMatchup to Watch: Odell Beckham Jr. vs. Josh NormanFew cornerbacks have dared to play nose-to-nose at the line of scrimmage with Beckham this season, but that is usually a standard technique for Norman. It is doubtful that Norman will change his methods entirely against Beckham, the Giants’ fleet wide receiver, and that should lead to one of the best one-on-one matchups of the season. Beckham has 24 touchdown catches in 25 games, has set the record for most passes caught in the first two years of an N.F.L. career (176) and has topped 100 receiving yards in his last six games. Norman was not a full-time starter for the Panthers until this season, but he has been shutting down top receivers. With Norman as a shadow, Dez Bryant caught one pass for 6 yards, DeAndre Hopkins had one reception for 24 yards, and Julio Jones caught four passes for 33 yards. The Beckham-Norman confrontation should be the highlight of the game, and the stakes will be high because the Giants’ offense is built around Beckham’s big-play ability.Number to watch: 117That is how many points the Panthers have scored off turnovers this season. Carolina has created 18 more turnovers than it has committed, the best differential in the league.Quotation of the Week:‘I get it where everybody wants to focus on their 13-0 record. I want to focus on our chance to win the division. That’s where I’m coming from, and to beat a team of this stature, at this time of year, it could give you the kind of momentum you need going down the stretch. That would be outstanding.’TOM COUGHLIN, the Giants’ coach, on facing the undefeated Panthers.A version of this article appears in print on December 20, 2015, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Panthers at Giants.
