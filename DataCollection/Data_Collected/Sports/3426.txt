College football teams have been using virtual reality as a training tool, putting players in an interactive 360-degree environment without having to be on the field.A handful of programs are using it for a new purpose: recruiting.By slipping on a headset, recruits can see what it is like to be in the team huddle, listen to a coach’s speech, run down the tunnel before a game or tour the campus.It is as if they were making an official visit without leaving their homes.“Teams have all these hype videos that they push out; we are a hype video 2.0,” said Brendan Reilly, chief executive of EON Sports VR, one of a few virtual reality companies working with college football programs. “It’s the same exact content they’re capturing in those videos, but now it’s more compelling, more engaging and more interactive.”
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            The training aspect of virtual reality has become a big hit across college football, with teams using it to game plan against specific opponents; work on specific plays or defensive looks; and give players mental reps even when they are at home.AdvertisementNow teams are working with software companies to design virtual reality environments that showcase the best elements of their universities and the football programs. The main goal is to use the virtual campus to entice recruits to visit the actual campus.AdvertisementOne of the biggest hurdles coaches face in recruiting is trying to persuade targeted players to make official visits to their universities. If they can get them on campus, coaches believe, they will close the deal by showing off the campus and explaining their philosophies in depth. Fail to get them to visit and more than likely the recruits will play elsewhere.“Kids are trying to get all over the world to go see universities; you’ve got to bring your university to them and give them a reason to come look closer,” Kansas Coach David Beaty said. “I’ll be honest with you, before I came to K.U., I didn’t know it was like that. I was like, ‘Wow, this place is real.’ And you don’t know it until you come here. So that virtual reality piece I think is going to be helpful for us just to pique people’s interest to go, ‘I need to check that out, place is pretty nice.’ ”Virtual reality as a recruiting tool is a relatively new tactic. Nevada-Las Vegas, U.C.L.A., Kansas, Syracuse and Mississippi are among the universities entering the virtual reality recruiting world, and it figures to catch on fast.First, it is easy to use.The recruits need only a headset and a smartphone on which to download an app. The environments can be viewed on their phones in two-dimension or in stereoscopic 3-D with the headset. All it takes is a gaze with the headset at an icon at the bottom or in a certain direction and the viewer is off and touring.And the views are incredible.Using a specialized 360-degree camera, virtual reality companies like EON can capture every aspect of the environment, from front and behind the viewers to above and below them.“From a recruiting standpoint, you can show them everything you want to show them — basically have an unofficial recruiting visit from anywhere in the country as long as they have a smartphone and they can access us on the app,” said Drew Jennison, U.N.L.V.’s assistant recruiting coordinator.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They create detailed itineraries, which often do not allow for many deviations if, say, the recruit wants to spend extra time in the business building or the student center.Advertisement“When you’re on an on-campus visit, you’re all over the place,” Reilly said. “With virtual reality, kids can take it on their own pace, take in the scenery, have the experience what it will be like to be on that campus or what it’s like on game day. If a recruit that they’re truly trying get, he’s going to know what that’s like.”Most universities like to show off the same things: tours of the campus, the dorms, the football facilities, the weight room and the game-day experience. Each has a unique aspect it likes to showcase, too, like a pregame ritual or a game-day tradition.And whatever the environment, the technology can make it seem better than it actually is.“What’s cool is that people can choose what they want to see,” Jennison said. “Some kids might not really care about the library, but in virtual reality, everything kind of becomes cool. It shows things that aren’t that cool in a really cool way. There’s kids that are going to be excited about the library: ‘Whoa, 360 library!’ ”A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: New Use of Virtual Reality Adds Another Dimension to Coaches’ Recruiting Tactics.
