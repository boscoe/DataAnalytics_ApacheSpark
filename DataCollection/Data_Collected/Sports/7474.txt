I’ve been lucky enough to come to a lot of championships with perfect preparation, and I won medals. This is the one time where I’m unlucky with preparations, and I’m just going to take that for what it is.”In October, Svindal, 32, tore the Achilles’ tendon in his left leg while kicking a soccer ball with his teammates after a training session. Svindal, a two-time World Cup overall champion, has not yet competed this season and returned to snow only in mid-January. “Even if I don’t get a medal here, I will be happy,” said Svindal, who already has eight world championship medals, including three golds.Svindal has a long and complicated history with the Birds of Prey downhill course here, where he has 11 top-three finishes, including four victories. But he also had a season-ending crash in 2007, which required him to spend a month in the hospital.While on the sideline this season, Svindal has watched as Kjetil Jansrud, 29, has dominated the World Cup’s speed events, nabbing five victories and two second-place finishes. Watching Jansrud flourish has stirred mixed emotions in Svindal. “It’s cool because you obviously want your team to do well, but in one way, it’s been frustrating because being a part of a team that’s succeeding is a lot of fun,” Svindal said.Advertisement
