Fenway Park is the site of so much history for Alex Rodriguez, a polarizing figure in baseball but an especially antagonistic one here.It is where he had his face massaged by Jason Varitek, setting off a bench-clearing brawl. It is where he made his major league debut. It is where pitchers have hit him, where he has belted big home runs, where fans have booed him at every turn.So it was fitting that Rodriguez, the Yankees’ lightning-rod slugger, had a milestone moment here Friday night, hitting his 660th home run, tying him with Willie Mays for fourth on baseball’s career home run list.Rodriguez, appearing as a pinch-hitter, belted a pitch from Junichi Tazawa in the eighth inning over the left-field wall of Fenway’s fabled Green Monster. The solo blast put the Yankees ahead, and relievers Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller closed out the 3-2 victory.AdvertisementIt was the sixth home run of the season for Rodriguez, who, despite nearing his 40th birthday and returning from a yearlong suspension for performance-enhancing drugs, has been a surprisingly significant player for the Yankees as their regular designated hitter.AdvertisementWhen Rodriguez turned on Tazawa’s 3-0 pitch and drove it into the seats above the left-field wall, he jogged around the bases, almost expressionless, soaking in the stunned silence of the crowd. It was the first pinch-hit home run of his career.
            For nearly all of Alex Rodriguez’s career, he reached home run milestones at an earlier age than any of the game’s top sluggers. But on his way to tying Willie Mays’s career mark of 660, he had injuries and was suspended, and he fell behind the pace of the other hitters he is still chasing.        800Barry Bonds762700Hank Aaron755Babe Ruth714600Willie Mays660Alex Rodriguez660500400300When Rodriguez passed the 600 milestone at age 34, he seemed destined to become the next career home run king.2001002025303540AGE AS OF JUNE 30 EACH YEARsuspended, did not play800Barry Bonds762Hank Aaron755700Babe Ruth714Willie Mays660600Alex Rodriguez660500400When Rodriguez passed the 600 milestone at age 34, he seemed destined to become the next career home run king.3002001002025303540AGE AS OF JUNE 30EACH YEARsuspended, did not playMAY 1, 2015
When he reached home plate and made his way to the dugout, the Yankees had arrived at the top step to congratulate him. Brett Gardner removed Rodriguez’s helmet from his hands while his teammates slapped him on the back. Finally, when Rodriguez took a seat on the bench, he broke into a wide grin.Rodriguez, who was showered with beer by his teammates in the clubhouse afterward, became emotional while being interviewed on the YES Network.“Thinking about my girls, wondering if they’re up back home, my mom, people that stayed with me the last few years,” Rodriguez said. “Grateful, grateful to fans, to the Yankees, to my teammates, to Major League Baseball.”It took Rodriguez two weeks to hit the final two home runs to catch Mays. The milestone seemed to be a millstone for Rodriguez, who also struggled as he neared the 500th and 600th home runs of his long career. After Rodriguez went 0 for 6 with four strikeouts in a 13-inning loss to Tampa Bay on Wednesday, Manager Joe Girardi benched him Friday.“My job is not to be caught up in milestones in a sense, but to be caught up in what is the best lineup you can field that day,” Girardi said before the game. “But I do want to get it out of the way because as much as a player you try not to think about it, it’s impossible.”When the Yankees have played in Baltimore, Tampa Bay and Detroit, Rodriguez was booed, but it often seemed perfunctory. When Rodriguez was sent to the plate in the eighth, pinch-hitting for Garrett Jones, the boos were lusty.Advertisement“Those boos were pretty intense,” Rodriguez said. “It was pretty passionate.”When the count went to 3-0, Rodriguez recalled a conversation he had with Girardi after the final exhibition game: The manager wanted Rodriguez to be aggressive.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            “Over my career, I haven’t been a guy that swings 3-0,” Rodriguez said. “I looked at the coach, who gave me the green light, and then I looked at the manager, and then I literally looked who was hitting behind me.”Noting that the on-deck hitter was Stephen Drew, Rodriguez said, “I just kind of figured that 3-0 was going to be the best pitch I got.”Rodriguez seemed very interested in getting the ball from the fan who caught it, but when he was told in his postgame news conference that the fan was not interested in giving it back, Rodriguez shrugged.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

This milestone is a melding of both.It has created an awkward moment for the Yankees, who have told Rodriguez they will not honor the marketing agreement that calls for him to receive a series of $6 million bonuses for tying Mays (660), Babe Ruth (714) and Hank Aaron (755), and for tying and passing the career leader, Barry Bonds (762).The Yankees say that the agreement, which was reached in 2007, is void because Rodriguez’s use of performance-enhancing drugs will keep them from recouping the bonuses through the sale of merchandise connected to the events. Two years after signing the agreement, Rodriguez admitted using steroids. Six years after signing it, he was suspended for his role in the Biogenesis scandal.Asked before the game if he had any anxiety about what might happen with the bonus, Rodriguez said: “None. None.”He added: “I’ve learned my lesson. I’m doing things a different way now. I know those things will work themselves out. I’m just trying to focus on putting the ball in play — I struck out four times on Wednesday.”AdvertisementThe bonus issue almost seemed a moot point back in 2013, when Rodriguez, after a long rehabilitation for hip surgery, returned to play the final leg of the season even as he was being hit with a long drug suspension by Major League Baseball. He appeared diminished on the field and, as he appealed his suspension, he lashed out at the Yankees, the players’ union and baseball officials.Though the team has made mention of other recent milestones, such as Drew’s 100th career home run and Rodriguez’s passing Derek Jeter on the career runs-scored list, it did not, until recently, mention Rodriguez’s pursuit of Mays in its daily notes to the news media.Rodriguez is also closing in on 3,000 hits — he now has 2,956 — but because there is no disputed bonus tied to that achievement, the Yankees will presumably have no problem publicizing that pursuit as it heats up.For his part, Rodriguez has behaved well in his return. The only time he miffed the Yankees was when he showed up two days early to spring training without notifying them. He has consistently taken a humble public stance, saying he is happy to be playing a game he loves and that he was not sure what to expect this season. He has not expressed any displeasure about losing his third-base job to Chase Headley.“I wasn’t sure what to expect in spring training,” Girardi said last week. “But Alex is a worker, and he knows how to play the game. And he’s been a really smart player for a long period of time, so if there’s anyone who can figure it out quickly, it would be Alex.”Rodriguez’s performance has moved him into the good graces of many, but not all, Yankees fans. On the road, Rodriguez has been booed. As he noted recently, he has been a popular villain since 2001, when he signed a then-record $252 million free-agent contract with the Texas Rangers.“I’m going to have some good days, some bad days and some ugly days,” Rodriguez said recently. “What I want to do all year is just enjoy the game as much as I can.”An article in some editions on Saturday about Alex Rodriguez’s 660th career home run erroneously included one incident among the notable ones in which Rodriguez was involved at Fenway Park in Boston. The incident in which he slapped the ball out of Bronson Arroyo’s glove in a postseason game occurred at Yankee Stadium, not at Fenway Park.A version of this article appears in print on May 2, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: One More Act of Drama for Rodriguez at Fenway.
