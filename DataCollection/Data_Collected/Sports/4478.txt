Frick Award for broadcasting.McNamee had not received strong consideration in past ballots when he competed against more contemporary, familiar announcers. But he was an 18-member committee’s top vote-getter in a new system that alternates voting annually among three eras, including the earliest years of baseball broadcasting through the mid-1950s.He was one of 10 finalists in a group that included France Laux, Al Helfer and Bert Wilson. “Graham McNamee defined what it was to broadcast baseball games to a national audience,” Jeff Idelson, the Hall of Fame’s president, said in statement.McNamee, who called various sports and covered political conventions and numerous other news events, died at 53 in 1942.
