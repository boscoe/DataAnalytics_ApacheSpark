On one ordinary night everything might change for Bill Fong, an underdog bowler, as he begins to get strike after strike. Will he attain the “perfect series,” or buckle under the pressure?As a boy I used to bowl in a league. The bowling alley hadn’t quite been retrofitted with computerized scoring when I started, so you had to keep score by hand, with a grease pencil and an overhead projector. One day we wanted to figure out what the score would be if you got nothing but strikes. That would be 12 in a row, which we totaled up to a score of 300 — a perfect game. For us, getting the ball to stay on the lane without using bumpers was victory enough. Making a strike was usually a result of luck more than skill. To accomplish 12 of those, perfect shot after perfect shot, required a mental sharpness that was difficult to imagine.Fast forward some 15 years and I’m reading Michael J. Mooney’s D Magazine article about Bill Fong’s story and his night toward a series score of 900, three perfect games in a row. I didn’t know how it was going to end. I was expecting a man who had dedicated so much of his life to mastering his craft that he finally achieved one of the highest goals in his sport. I was on the edge of my seat reading about the final game. That was when I knew I had to tell Bill’s story on film, because it was that excitement and experience and his chase for perfection that I wanted to capture and share.This film premiered at the Miami International Film Festival in 2014.
