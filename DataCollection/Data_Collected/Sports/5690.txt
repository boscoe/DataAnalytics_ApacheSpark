TAMPA, Fla. — Once Wisconsin turned Melvin Gordon loose on Auburn, there was no stopping the nation’s leading rusher.Melvin Gordon rushed for an Outback Bowl-record 251 yards and three touchdowns, and Rafael Gaglianone kicked a 25-yard field goal in overtime to give No. 17 Wisconsin a 34-31 victory over No. 19 Auburn on Thursday.Gordon scored on runs of 25, 53 and 6 yards, bouncing back from a subpar performance in the Big Ten championship game, to threaten Barry Sanders’s single-season rushing record in the Football Bowl Subdivision.Gordon, who has said he will skip his final season of eligibility to enter the N.F.L. draft, finished with 2,587 yards in 14 games, second most in F.B.S. history. Sanders gained 2,628 in 11 games in 1988, when the N.C.A.A. did not include bowl results in a player’s statistics.AdvertisementNick Marshall threw for two touchdowns for Auburn, which also got a pair of scores on the ground from Cameron Artis-Payne. The Tigers (8-5) were unable to move the ball in overtime, though, and lost when Daniel Carlson’s 45-yard field goal hit the right upright and bounced away.AdvertisementJoel Stave threw a 7-yard scoring pass to Corey Clement for an early Wisconsin lead. The Badgers’ offense, however, did not really take off until it started feeding Auburn’s defense a steady diet of Gordon, who finished second in Heisman Trophy balloting.

His 27th rushing touchdown finished a six-play, 75-yard march. His 28th, on a carry up the middle on fourth-and-1, put the Badgers ahead, 21-17, late in the third quarter.Stave completed 14 of 27 passes for 121 yards. He threw two of his three interceptions in the first half, but that did not stop him from making a couple of big completions on a 64-yard drive the Badgers put together to send the game into overtime.With help from a 20-yard run by Gordon and an accompanying 15-yard penalty on Auburn for a late hit on the running back out of bounds, Wisconsin marched to the Auburn 11 before settling for Gaglianone’s 29-yard field goal.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Artis-Payne, who rushed for 126 yards, scored on a pair of 2-yard runs — the second giving Auburn a 31-28 lead.Both teams were coming off disappointing losses, Wisconsin falling, 59-0, to Ohio State in the Big Ten championship game and Auburn rolling up 630 yards total offense in coming up short, 55-44, against Alabama in the Tigers’ regular-season finale.The Badgers and the Tigers also went through some upheaval between those games and Thursday, with Gary Andersen’s abrupt decision to leave Wisconsin to coach Oregon State and Auburn firing defensive coordinator Ellis Johnson after yielding 539 yards to Alabama and finishing ninth in the SEC in total defense.Andersen’s departure brought Badgers Athletic Director Barry Alvarez back to the sideline on an interim basis to coach in a bowl for the second time in three seasons.Auburn wasted no time in hiring the former Florida coach Will Muschamp to lead the Tigers’ defense next season. He was on the field before the game, but not working while the interim defensive coordinator Charlie Harbison led the unit against Wisconsin.A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Wisconsin 34, Auburn 31.
