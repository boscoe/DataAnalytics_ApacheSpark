After only two teams were off in Week 4, there are four clubs with byes in Week 5 (CAR, MIA, MIN, NYJ). The good news is that only one of these teams has a quarterback who is strongly relevant in fantasy football. Looking at you, Cameron Jerrell Newton. A ton of players are underperforming in fantasy this season, which makes playing the waiver wire paramount.(Note: Ownership percentages are taken from Yahoo’s fantasy football statistics.)Michael Vick, Pittsburgh Steelers (18 percent)
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Vick didn’t have his greatest performance last Thursday night, and the Steelers made some really questionable play calls on offense. However, if you need a replacement for Newton, Vick definitely intrigues me because of the offensive system and the weapons around him. He has arguably the best running back in the N.F.L. behind him in Le’Veon Bell, a top-three wideout in Antonio Brown and a reliable tight end in Heath Miller. But Martavis Bryant also returns from suspension this week, which is huge. Remember, Vick hit Bryant for a 67-yard bomb in the preseason, showcasing some solid chemistry, as well as Vick’s arm strength. And while it’s no longer 2005, Vick still rushed nine times on Thursday, which is always a bonus in fantasy football. The Steelers head to San Diego this week, facing the Chargers’ solid secondary, but Josh McCown lit it up for 356 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday afternoon with nowhere near the talent around him that Vick has.Jay Cutler, Chicago Bears (25 percent)Sure, it was Oakland, and sure, Cutler turned the ball over twice, as he often does, but I still came away impressed with his first performance after returning from an injury. He threw for nearly 300 yards and two touchdowns without Alshon Jeffery in the lineup, and he led a nearly perfect final drive with about a minute left to put the Bears in position for a game-winning field goal. Now, if Alshon can finally suit up next week, Cutler will become an awesome play against a Kansas City pass rush that has been surprisingly weak, as well as a nonexistent secondary. The Chiefs are surrendering a league-leading 2.8 passing touchdowns per game this season, and nearly 70 percent of the total touchdowns they have allowed have come through the air. Cutler has solid weapons to exploit in this matchup.AdvertisementDuke Johnson, Cleveland Browns (31 percent)Staying with the Browns here, Duke Johnson had an impressive game Sunday. It was telling that he touched the ball 17 times, carrying it eight times for 31 yards and adding receptions nine of the 10 times he was targeted for 85 yards and a touchdown. The score was a beautiful wheel route in the back of the end zone, where Johnson shuffled his feet and stayed in bounds. In the last two games, Johnson has recorded 15 receptions, as the Browns seem to be figuring out how best to use him. Isaiah Crowell is still easily the between-the-tackles back, but Duke did out-touch Crowell, 17-15, and he even had a few short-yardage/goal-line looks. It appears Duke’s value is trending upward, and he continues to make the case for a larger role in the offense. Playing on a team that is severely lacking for pass-catchers (or any serious offensive talent), Johnson is definitely worth an add.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Anderson in the first or second round this summer, it’s time to worry. Hillman broke off a 72-yard touchdown run this weekend and carried the ball 11 times, the same amount as Anderson. After the game, Coach Gary Kubiak said his team would use both backs from there on out, and while neither have been very effective on a per-carry basis, Hillman is at least offering some big-play potential at the moment. The Broncos have kept Hillman around for a while, so they clearly like him, and it’s pretty convincing that Kubiak said they would use two backs, considering he’s always been a one-back type of guy. Hillman is an absolute must-add.AdvertisementAllen Hurns, Jacksonville Jaguars (18 percent)I never thought I’d say this, but you can safely drop the likes of Andre Johnson and Roddy White for Hurns, who had a monster game against the Colts, hauling in 11 of 15 targets for 116 yards and a touchdown. It was his second straight game finding the end zone, accumulating 180 receiving yards during that span. Jacksonville is going to be behind often this year, and through four weeks, it ranks eighth in the N.F.L. in passing attempts per game (39) and 11th in the league in passing play percentage (61.6 percent). Hurns has serious big-play upside, and Blake Bortles appears to be progressing a bit, so he’s definitely worth a look as a WR3 or WR4.Leonard Hankerson, Atlanta Falcons (19 percent)Another thing I never thought I’d say: Leonard Hankerson is the No. 2 receiver in Atlanta, ahead of the aforementioned White. He hauled in six of eight targets for over 100 yards and a touchdown, while Roddy White has just six catches for 92 yards — for the entire season. Hankerson clearly has a good understanding of Kyle Shanahan’s offense, as the two spent time together in Washington over the years, and he’s taking advantage of it. He has seen a healthy 29 targets to this point, catching about 60 percent of them from a pretty accurate quarterback in Matt Ryan. Sooner or later, opposing defenses are going to start double- and triple-teaming Julio Jones, which should continue to open things up for Hankerson to make plays. He’s not going away. Pick him up.Antonio Gates, San Diego Chargers (54 percent)I started this column thinking I wouldn’t have to write about Gates, but here he is, owned in less than 60 percent of leagues. He returns from suspension in Week 5, and there is no one Philip Rivers has ever trusted more in the passing game than Gates. Unless you own Rob Gronkowski, I’d consider grabbing Gates if he’s out there.Nick Raducanu is the owner of ProjectRoto.com and is a contributor to Rotoworld and 4for4.com.
