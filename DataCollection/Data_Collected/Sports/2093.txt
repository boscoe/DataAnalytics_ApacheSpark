Beholder, a mare with tactical speed, was scratched on Thursday after an examination revealed bleeding in her lungs.Stewards scratched Smooth Roller upon the recommendation of the Kentucky state veterinarian Will Farmer, who found a tendon issue in the left foreleg. Smooth Roller is a 4-year-old son of Hard Spun who was coming off an impressive 5¼-length victory in the Grade 1 Awesome Again on Sept. 26 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, Calif., in only his fourth career start. He was listed at 15-1 in the morning line.The absence of Beholder and Smooth Roller will almost surely cause the odds on American Pharoah, the first Triple Crown champion to participate in the Classic, to plummet. He was listed at 6-5 in the morning line.Based on past performances, Frosted looks to be the only other Classic starter in what is now a field of eight with the speed to keep American Pharoah and his jockey, Victor Espinoza, from getting loose on the lead. Frosted tried to do that in the Travers and faded to third, behind the late-running Keen Ice and American Pharoah.Advertisement
