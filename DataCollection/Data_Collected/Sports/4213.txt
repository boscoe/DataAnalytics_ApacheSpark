The club said the deal would be formally announced once Samardzija passes a physical that is scheduled for Tuesday. This marks the third large contract for a pitcher this week. David Price joined the Boston Red Sox on a $217 million, seven-year deal, then on Friday night Greinke chose the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Giants and the three-time defending National League West champion Los Angeles Dodgers, his former team. Greinkeâ€™s six-year contract has been placed at $206 million.Samardzija won 11 games this year for the Chicago White Sox for his first double-digit victory total in eight major league seasons, going 11-13 with a 4.96 E.R.A. in 32 starts. Samardzija, a 30-year-old right-hander, pitched 214 innings in 2015, the second-highest total of his career. Advertisement
