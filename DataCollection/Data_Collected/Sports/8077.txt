CreditBen Solomon for The New York Times        In a spectacle of lights, music, fancy sneakers and flamboyant athleticism, the N.B.A. on Sunday night presented what should be, barring a dramatic turn of events, the final notable professional basketball game to be played at Madison Square Garden this season.For the first time since 1998, and for the fifth time in league history, the All-Star Game made a stop in New York, infusing the arena with a dose of the basketball skill, celebrity presence and general sense of occasion it has lacked for the last three months, given the struggles of the hometown Knicks.The game capped a multiborough weekend spree of brand-sponsored parties, in-store promotional appearances, charity events and various activities vaguely related to basketball, some of which took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.In a leisurely game that grew mildly competitive only in the final minutes, the Western Conference beat the Eastern Conference, 163-158, in front of a well-dressed, sellout crowd. The N.B.A. distributed two-thirds of the tickets to its marketing and broadcast partners and affiliates, the participating players and the players’ union, as well as league alumni. The league said that around 1,800 credentials were issued to various media outlets.The bombardment of loud sounds and bright sights was relentless. Every stoppage of play was put to use. The casts of multiple Broadway shows did musical numbers during some of the extra-long timeouts. In others, celebrated retired players associated with New York basketball, including the current Knicks president, Phil Jackson, were honored at center court. Late in the fourth quarter, fans were encouraged to stand for a karaoke version of “New York, New York.” Almost no one did.AdvertisementThere was basketball, too, of sorts. Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder took 28 shots, scored 41 points and won the Most Valuable Player Award. LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers led the Eastern Conference with 30 points. It was the second time that an All-Star team exceeded 160 points; last year was the first.Advertisement“It was a spectacular show of athleticism,” Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors said of Westbrook’s performance.Westbrook fell a point short of Wilt Chamberlain’s All-Star scoring record.“I was close, but he’s a great, and I’m happy to be close to him,” Westbrook said.The two squads skipped onto the court to warm up just before 8 p.m., tossing T-shirts into the still half-full stands as a gang of drummers hammered away to the beat of rap songs booming over the public address system. Twenty minutes later, on a large stage erected for the event, the singer Christina Aguilera appeared in a bedazzled, mechanical apple. The rapper Nas followed in work boots.The squad introductions came next. The coach of the Western Conference team, Steve Kerr, who turned down an offer from the Knicks last year to instead coach the Warriors, was the first person introduced and the sight of him provoked the night’s only round of boos. Carmelo Anthony of the Knicks was the final person to take the smoky stage, and he lingered for a moment to soak up the loud cheers. Then the Rockettes performed.Former President Bill Clinton was shown twice on the video screen during Queen Latifah’s jazzy rendition of the national anthem, drawing cheers from the crowd. Just before tipoff, Anthony, who was the lone representative in the game from the Knicks or the Nets, was handed a microphone on the court.“We have the greatest fans in the world, so thank you,” said Anthony, who shot 6-for-20 from the field. “New York City is the greatest place in the world as well.”The barrage of scoring began with John Wall throwing an alley-oop pass to James, who scored 15 points in the first quarter.AdvertisementNear the four-minute mark, in a rare show of defense, Pau Gasol of the Chicago Bulls swatted away 3-point attempt from Klay Thompson of the Warriors. Gasol quickly offered his hand to Thompson, as if to say sorry.The four members of the Atlanta Hawks — Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Al Horford and Kyle Korver — entered the game as a group midway through the first quarter, a reminder of team play on a night when individual fireworks were on display.Everyone was dunking. Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks completed his first alley-oop since 2004, according to the ESPN statistics department. Kyle Lowry, who has not dunked this season while playing point guard for the Toronto Raptors, had one on a putback.The teams combined for 83 points in the first quarter. The point total was 165 at halftime, at which point fans filtered onto the court to watch a pyrotechnic-heavy performance by the singer Ariana Grande, who was joined midway in her performance by the rapper Nicki Minaj.The showboating continued after halftime. James unleashed a double-pump, reverse dunk after catching a pass in midair. Curry sank an underhanded floater, off the glass with extreme spin, from several feet away along the baseline. Westbrook levitated for a one-handed dunk and hit his head on the backboard.As the game, somehow the peak of professional basketball at the Garden this season, crept toward its end, something resembling actual basketball broke out. In the final minutes, with teams within a few points, and at one stage tied, concerted defensive effort made its debut and offensive sets suddenly materialized. It was hardly enough, though, to erase the spectacle, on and off the court, that preceded it.A version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Pizazz Returns to Garden, and West Stars Shoot Their Way to a Win.
