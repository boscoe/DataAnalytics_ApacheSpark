When news broke last season that Mets pitcher Jenrry Mejia had been suspended for the second time in a matter of months after testing positive for the same performance-enhancing drug, the Mets reacted strongly. They sounded hurt and betrayed that a teammate would compromise their goals. David Wright described Mejia’s first failed test as selfish.The second failed test resulted in a 162-game suspension for Mejia and an infamous distinction: it tied him with Alex Rodriguez for the longest doping-related suspension in baseball history.On Wednesday, the Mets surprisingly tendered Mejia a contract for the 2016 season, a move that, if anything, seemed to be a smart fiscal decision.Though Mejia is not eligible to return until late July, the Mets will not have to pay his contract while he sits out. Mejia is eligible to participate in spring training and, when he returns, the postseason, should the Mets make it. If Mejia proves himself to be trustworthy, the Mets could add him as a low-cost reliever down the stretch.
                If so, we’d like to talk to you. We want to hear from you about what your experience was in watching Game 5, and specifically, the slide by the Royals’ Eric Hosmer that tied the game against the Mets in the ninth inning.            As the Mets’ closer in 2014, Mejia converted 28 of 31 save opportunities and posted a 3.65 E.R.A. He appeared in only seven games in 2015, in between suspensions. In the Winter League this off-season, Mejia has compiled a 4.09 E.R.A. in seven games as a starter.AdvertisementThe Mets also tendered contracts to Addison Reed, Josh Edgin, Carlos Torres, and Ruben Tejada, the infielder who became a fan favorite when he broke his leg trying to turn a double play in the division series, when the Dodgers’ Chase Utley slid violently into second base.AdvertisementPADRES HIRE MCGWIRE The former home run king Mark McGwire says it’s “a great challenge” to be hired as bench coach of the San Diego Padres.McGwire becomes the right-hand man for the rookie manager Andy Green after spending the last three seasons as hitting coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Before that, McGwire was hitting coach of the St. Louis Cardinals for three seasons following a hiatus after his steroid-tainted playing career ended.“As a player I pretty much went through anything a player could ever wish upon as far as success, and all the failures,” he said. “You learn how to be a man through adversity and failure. The game is built on failure.”Green said everyone he spoke to about McGwire had the same “No. 1 distinguisher, which is that he has the ability to connect with all players of every background.”In 2010, McGwire admitted he used steroids when he broke baseball’s single-season home run record by hitting 70 in 1998.

He hit .262 with 22 homers and 64 R.B.I. in 142 games in 2015 with Arizona and the Mariners. Clevenger batted .287 in 30 games with the Orioles in 2015.AdvertisementRiefenhausen, dealt by Tampa Bay to Seattle in a six-player trade last month, was 1-0 with a 6.30 E.R.A. in 24 games with the Rays over the last two seasons. (AP)ROYALS PASS ON HOLLAND The World Series champion Kansas City Royals declined to offer Greg Holland a 2016 contract, making the former All-Star closer a free agent for the first time as he recovers from Tommy John surgery.Holland is not expected to pitch next year after undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery late in the season, causing him to miss the Royals’ run to the title. Before his injury, he had established himself a dominant closer, posting a 1.21 E.R.A. two years ago and a 1.44 E.R.A. in 2014.Holland pitched through elbow trouble part of last season, and had a 3.83 E.R.A. with 32 saves before he was shut down.
