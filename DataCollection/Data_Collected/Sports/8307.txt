That data can be used to determine whether a player might need to come out of a game or whether game rules should be changed.Kevin Guskiewicz, an expert on brain trauma who was coordinating the research, said the committee collected data on about 11,000 impacts during the 2013 season but had difficulty determining the location and severity of the impacts. The committee, he said, wants more time to determine if there is a better system available.The N.F.L. Players Association, he added, questioned whether the data would be kept private and not used against a player.“There was not an agreement by some of the individuals, so we thought it was best to take a time out and see what systems work most reliably,” he said. Dr. Robert Cantu, another member of the committee, said he thought the data was not reliable enough.“Because there is such concern about the sensors, this might not be the most prominent time to be doing this study,” Cantu said.Cantu said the sensors the league had used were less accurate when the helmets were not hit squarely. “It showed that if you hit the center of gravity perfect, they are pretty accurate,” he said. “The further you get away from the center, you don’t have the accuracy.”But researchers who have collected data for years said the league was being too careful.Stefan Duma, who runs the biomedical engineering department at Virginia Tech and has helped develop a helmet rating system, said that while the sensors on the market had flaws, they were accurate enough.“I continue to think that while not perfect, the sensors are valuable and give reasonable data that is useful,” he said.Even with a 10 or 20 percent error rate, the sensors provide data that can be used to determine whether helmets should be improved or rules governing certain plays, like kickoffs, should be changed. The sensors can also be used to analyze head hits in sports like soccer and hockey.While Duma said he was not familiar with the N.F.L.’s reason for suspending the program, he said the league and the players’ union might be ambivalent about the sensors because they could show that players were receiving more blows to the head than was commonly thought.Duma said he feared that the N.F.L.’s decision, which was first reported by Sports Business Journal, could dampen research efforts by others.“It’s a concern because this release will get tremendous traction, and it doesn’t acknowledge all the good things that have happened,” he said.Advertisement
