Cincinnati Bengals (6-0) at Pittsburgh Steelers (4-3)1 p.m. Line: EvenThe division rivalry between the Steelers and the Bengals has often felt more like bullying, with Pittsburgh always seeming to find an extra gear. But the Andy Dalton who enters Heinz Field on Sunday is not the same player who has gone 2-6 against the Steelers.Dalton is completing 67.4 percent of his passes while throwing for 14 touchdowns with just two interceptions. The passing efficiency has helped the Bengals score 30.3 points a game, third highest in the N.F.L. behind New England and Arizona.The X-factor is the health of Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who has been out since Week 3 with a strained medial collateral ligament. Despite having some of the best skill players in the game, the Pittsburgh offense has been punchless with Michael Vick and Landry Jones under center. If Roethlisberger is out, or if he is limited enough to be vulnerable to the pass rush, the Bengals should stay unbeaten. But if Roethlisberger plays the way he did before his injury, it may be a far different story.PICK: BENGALSWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
