PHOENIX —  To gain membership in the N.F.L.’s most exclusive subculture, no formal application process is required. No paperwork need be sent or interview aced. As Marcus Burley learned on Aug. 30, all he had to do was show up.Hours after joining the Seattle Seahawks in a trade with the Indianapolis Colts, Burley, a cornerback, was accompanied to his first meeting by his fellow defensive backs.Scanning the room, he saw the players who make up the most dominant position group of the N.F.L.’s most dominant defense. He saw Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman and Byron Maxwell. He stood up and introduced himself.“You’re part of us now,” they told him.Right then and there, Burley was initiated into the Legion of Boom. That is what the Seahawks’ peerless secondary calls itself, and not just the All-Pros like Sherman and Thomas or a Pro Bowler like Chancellor or a starter like Maxwell.AdvertisementThe L.O.B. is an inclusive bunch, comprising everyone who has played defensive back in Seattle over the last three seasons. The newest members are Burley, now with his fifth organization, and Steven Terrell, who try to remain in good standing every day.Advertisement“We take it very seriously,” said Terrell, a second-year safety. “It’s a standard. That’s how they explained it to me.”Who’s going to win? What color will Katy Perry’s hair be? What about the commercials? Make your Super Bowl picks and predictions and share your ballot with your friends.Those expectations have been shared in locker rooms and on airplanes, at the training table and especially on the practice field, where the competition, Burley said, is the fiercest he has seen. Never had Burley or Terrell played for a secondary, they said, that has instituted a system of fines for indiscretions like muffed interceptions or missed tackles.“We don’t know how long we’ll be together, and we don’t know how long you’ll be with us,” said Kris Richard, Seattle’s defensive backs coach. “But what we do know is the moment that you arrive, we have the opportunity to impact you. You’re only as strong as your weakest link, and we don’t have a weak link. If we’re all strong, then you owe it to your brother or the guy behind you to prepare him.”Terrell has been released and re-signed three times since training camp ended, starting out on the practice squad before joining the 53-man roster for good three weeks ago. He has played little this season — only 24 defensive snaps — so it was in practice where he has applied all that he has learned from Chancellor, whose locker is beside Terrell’s.“I think the biggest thing is going through the gantlet,” Chancellor said. “You’ve got to work hard and prove that you’re a hard worker.”Which Terrell has done. When he makes a play, some of the other Boomers race over to celebrate with him.“In my mind, I didn’t see myself as one of them,” Terrell said. “I thought, that’s something you have to earn. I still don’t consider myself on that level with them, but they let me in.”

In that game, against the Green Bay Packers, the starting nickel corner Jeremy Lane sustained a serious groin injury, and Burley replaced him. Burley’s performance in the game and over the season endeared him to his teammates.Advertisement“He already had that mind-set,” Maxwell said, adding: “He’s just a tough guy. He’s very fiery. He’s one of us.”By us, Maxwell means all those who came before and have left Seattle, players like Walter Thurmond, Will Blackmon and Chris Maragos. Sherman speaks of them in reverent tones.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Browner has an L.O.B. tattoo, plays trivia on his smartphone against Sherman and attended their youth camps and charity events. Brown said he would aim for Sherman’s bum elbow and Thomas’s balky shoulder, and he told his teammates to do the same.“That’s just a part of the game,” Browner said, and Sherman, when asked, agreed.And so is the ritual that the Boomers perform before they run out of the tunnel — two hand slaps and a head butt. Before the preseason opener in Denver, Terrell just stood there until he was told about it.Burley had a similar experience a few weeks ago, when Chancellor walked over to him in the locker room. He wanted to tell Burley something important. He wanted him to know about the secret handshake.“I can’t show it to you,” Burley told a reporter. “You’re not in the Legion of Boom.”No, but Burley is. Once a Colt. Now a Seahawk. Next year unknown. Forever in the Legion of Boom.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: In Seattle’s Fierce Secondary, New Members Make the Cut.
