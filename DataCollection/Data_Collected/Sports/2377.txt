In turning defense to attack, imposing City’s global collection of stars in a confident and cohesive way, this was a display of power that will resonate with every team that wants to win the tournament.Two City players, Raheem Sterling and Wilfried Bony, scored their first goals in the Champions League. Fernandinho, one of the team’s Brazilians, capped that by setting up a goal, then soaring to head one of his own and by giving such an all-round performance of midfield strength and running that no man on the field could live up to.The word live has a different meaning for Juve’s Lichtsteiner.The Swiss player’s reputation as a willing runner, an athlete who would shuttle back and forth down the right flank until opponents were simply exhausted by him, was interrupted in a most alarming way on Sept. 23, when he came off the field in Italy complaining of breathlessness.He was diagnosed with a condition commonly known as an irregular heartbeat, or a heart flutter. The doctors could fix it, they said, with a simple procedure, an operation that would keep him sidelined for one month.On Tuesday, one month and one day later, Lichtsteiner asked to play in the Champions League away match at Borussia Mönchengladbach.Despite having had only two training sessions with the team, he got his wish. “I never dreamed of a game like this,” he said after he sprinted to the goalmouth to score the equalizing goal in a 1-1 tie.“The team was short, and I just wanted to win,” Lichtsteiner said. “But given that we were a man down, we can be satisfied with the result.”Lichtsteiner, 31, is proof of the advances in medical science and a change of thinking, because little more than a decade ago, he might have been advised to retire from professional sports.Instead, on his 50th game in the Champions League, he tapped in his first goal in the competition.The slight pity is that Juventus, wearing bright pink instead of its traditional black and white stripes, didn’t look like Juve.Similarly, Manchester City took to the field in Seville clad not in its customary light blue, but from head to toe in a fluorescent yellow. These are commercial times, changed times, and someone, somewhere, imagines that there is a marketing dollar to be made out of turning players into mannequins to sell jerseys.This, however, was the genuine article, a City playing to its strengths — arguably for the first time since it entered the Champions League through the financial backing of the Abu Dhabi government, which began in 2008.The change in tactics and self-determination that we saw in Seville might well be City’s turning point. The club has barely made a secret of the fact that it has been pursuing Pep Guardiola, the current Bayern Munich and former Barcelona coach, to help its search for Champions League fulfillment.However, Manuel Pellegrini, the Chilean who has overseen City’s hitherto nervous progress in the tournament, went boldly into the Seville caldron on Tuesday.“I changed because I wasn’t happy with the way we played before,” Pellegrini said. “Tonight, I’m more than happy. We scored three goals, we had three or four clear chances to score more, and I think we played a complete game — physically, technically, tactically.”Unai Emery, the Sevilla coach, put it more succinctly. “Manchester City was great,” he said. “I cannot complain.”Nor could anyone who watched. This was a City playing to the sum of its talents, despite the fact that its two finest forwards, the striker Sergio Agüero and the playmaker David Silva, remain sidelined with injuries.Pellegrini’s response was, we are wounded but we go forward, unafraid of Sevilla’s reputation in Seville, undaunted by the critics. It was simply a question of rearranging the roles of the players at his disposal.Leaving Kevin De Bruyne on the bench, the coach outfoxed Sevilla by lining up with two fast wingers, Jesus Navas and Sterling, using their speed on either side of Bony, the center forward.The real change, though, was in midfield, where everyone presumed that Fernandinho and Fernando would be two Brazilian anchors, allowing Yaya Touré to push up.In fact, it was Fernandinho who exercised the freedom to dash forward as he used to with Shakhtar Donetsk, the Ukraine club he joined as a 16-year-old.Fernandinho created the opening goal with an artful pass to Sterling, who scored with calm precision. The Brazilian was then involved, three times, in a move that involved just about every City player in slick, one-touch soccer that shell-shocked Sevilla.And it was Fernandinho who finished it off with a high leap and an accomplished header.Two goals up in just 11 minutes, City wobbled slightly when Benoît Trémoulinas, a defender-turned-striker, sneaked in to make it 2-1.Sevilla had won its previous 10 European games in this stadium. The roar of the crowd was deafening: How would City react?The answer was to go back on the front foot, to carve out a third goal, for Bony and to outplay a daunting opponent in its own domain. A new force, a potential European champion, has been unleashed.Advertisement
