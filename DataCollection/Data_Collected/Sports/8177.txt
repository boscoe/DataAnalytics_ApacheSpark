Wozniacki, seeded third, led by 5-2 in the third but struggled to close. ■ Sam Querrey, a semifinalist last week in Memphis, injured his back midmatch and retired from the Delray Beach Open in Florida while leading Alejandro Gonzalez, 6-3, 1-2. “It was just one sudden movement, and I jerked my back,” said Querrey, who will have an M.R.I. exam before deciding whether he can represent the United States in the first round of the Davis Cup against Britain in Glasgow from March 6 to 8. He added: “I’ve had this before, and it’s gotten better in a week. I’m just bummed because I played so well last week.” (AP)Advertisement
