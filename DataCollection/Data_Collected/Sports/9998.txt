LOUISVILLE, Ky. —  Kentucky center Willie Cauley-Stein sat on a bench in the Wildcats’ locker room wearing a T-shirt featuring the menacing face of the Incredible Hulk and talked about Cincinnati’s menacing play.The Bearcats, known as fierce defenders who can be combative, tried their best to maul No. 1 Kentucky, and that created an emotional caldron inside KFC Yum Center.“If teams come in and their sole purpose is to rough you up, well, you can’t settle for jumpers,” Cauley-Stein said. “You got to go back at them and let them know, you roughing us up isn’t going to do anything — we’re still going to come at you.“It kind of demoralizes them. As the game goes on, they’re like, ‘Hey, man, we’re trying to beat them up’ — like, ‘It’s not working.’ ”AdvertisementPushing back, Kentucky (36-0) suffocated the Bearcats for a 64-51 victory Saturday in the round of 32 of the N.C.A.A. tournament. The game, in the Midwest Region, was played in front of an announced 21,760 fans, most of them clad in the blue of the Wildcats.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Kentucky made just 37 percent of its field-goal attempts and was outrebounded by 45-38, but its lack of efficiency on offense did not matter as it blocked nine shots and held Cincinnati (23-11) to 32 percent shooting.AdvertisementCincinnati was leading by 24-23 late in the first half when the 7-foot Cauley-Stein made a point about shoving back. Taking a pass from the wing, he roared in with a two-handed dunk that knocked down the 6-foot-8 Bearcats freshman Quadri Moore, who was called for a foul.Cauley-Stein’s teammate Trey Lyles walked past Moore, who was sitting on the floor, and glared at him. After a timeout, Cauley-Stein made the free throw to complete a 3-point play, and the Wildcats stayed in the lead for the rest of the game.“They were trying to make us play a game that we didn’t want to come out and play,” said Karl-Anthony Towns, a 6-11 Kentucky freshman. “We did some of that the first half, and that’s why it was close. The second half, we went back to what we wanted to do, and we didn’t let them change the game for us.”Aaron Harrison led Kentucky with 13 points, and Lyles added 11, but this game was about Kentucky’s covering every piece of the floor on defense and not giving Cincinnati many clear looks at the basket. The Bearcats had 21 offensive rebounds, but too many times they tried to take the ball right back up to the basket against Kentucky’s huge defenders.“When you get a rebound, you can’t be stubborn and just go back up,” said Larry Davis, Cincinnati’s interim coach. “You got to realize, I’m surrounded — throw it out. That was the game plan.”The Bearcats took a 4-2 lead two and a half minutes into the game and, for the next 11 minutes, kept the score even or in their favor.AdvertisementThe crowd howled at the Cincinnati players simply for playing hard and berated the officiating crew. It hardly seemed a neutral site for an N.C.A.A. tournament game.“Yeah, it was Rupp Arena, I think,” Cincinnati center Octavius Ellis said, referring to Kentucky’s home court.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Not only did Kentucky’s frontcourt foursome — each player 6-10 or taller — prevent clear looks at the rim, but the Wildcats’ guards, playing man-to-man defense, stayed fastened to their marks.Cauley-Stein’s dunk put Kentucky ahead with 2 minutes 46 seconds left in the first half, and the Wildcats stretched their lead to 31-24 by the intermission. It was no easier in the second half for Cincinnati; the Bearcats cut the gap to 5 points, at 39-34, with 14:11 to play, but it might as well have been 25, as difficult as it was for them to score.Cauley-Stein said that he had been trying to ignore the adulation for the spotless Wildcats but that it had been hard to avoid. He said he had changed the television channel five times in his hotel room Friday night because he kept encountering Kentucky highlights. He finally landed on a channel showing the animated comedy “Family Guy” and stayed there the rest of the night.His point was that the Wildcats were not an entitled team admiring themselves in the mirror and raking in all the praise, and he was right. A team too impressed with its own work could have been flattened by the bruising Cincinnati delivered Saturday. Instead, Kentucky pushed back and then rolled on.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP7 of the New York edition with the headline: Cincinnati’s Defense Raises Pressure, but Kentucky Doesn’t Crack.
