New York City F.C. named the French World Cup winner Patrick Vieira as its coach Monday, plucking him from a developmental role with its parent club, Manchester City, to try to improve on a disappointing first season in Major League Soccer.Vieira, 39, replaces Jason Kreis, who was fired last week after N.Y.C.F.C. (10-17-7) missed the playoffs in its inaugural season. The team said Vieira had signed a three-year contract.The job will be Vieira’s first as a professional first-team head coach; he has been the coach of Manchester City’s top youth team since June 2013 after a decorated playing career with Arsenal, Juventus, Internazionale and, in his final seasons, Manchester City. He won the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European championship as a member of France’s national team.The team he will take over in New York will be unlike any of those. New York City F.C. struggled for consistency, especially defensively, and any immediate changes to address its deficiencies will be complicated by M.L.S.’s salary cap and player acquisition rules, which in past years have proved frustrating to foreign coaches unfamiliar with the league’s business model.Vieira will also not start in his new role until Jan. 1, meaning that some of the biggest roster decisions will occur before he is in place.N.Y.C.F.C. said he would travel to New York to meet his new players this week.A version of this article appears in print on November 10, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: New York City F.C. Signs New Coach for Its Second Season.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
