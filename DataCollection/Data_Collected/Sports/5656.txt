There is no shortage of story lines surrounding Thursday’s Cotton Bowl between Baylor and Michigan State, perhaps the most compelling bowl game outside the College Football Playoff semifinals.■ Baylor, which the playoff selection committee ranked fifth, plays in the Big 12, the only one of the so-called Big 5 conferences not represented in the playoff.■ Bears Coach Art Briles, who was born in Texas and has coached only in that state, was intrigued to learn that Michigan State Coach Mark Dantonio was an El Paso native.■ The starting quarterbacks, Bryce Petty of the Bears and Connor Cook of the Spartans, became friends off the field last summer.Advertisement■ The teams have played only once: Michigan State beat Baylor, 28-10, on Sept. 28, 1968, at Spartan Stadium.■ Michigan State (10-2), No. 8 in the committee’s rankings, allowed the seventh-fewest yards in the Football Bowl Subdivision this season while Baylor (11-1) led the F.B.S. in yards and points per game.While the teams may present a contrast in styles when they meet in Arlington, Tex., their universities have one major thing in common: Each has a stadium called McLane.Michigan State is home to McLane Baseball Stadium, and Baylor’s football field is McLane Stadium. In each case, the Texas billionaire Drayton McLane Jr. — a member of Baylor’s class of 1958 and the Michigan State business school’s class of ’59 — and his wife, Elizabeth, made a donation that merited the honor.In October, when asked about the prospect of the teams’ playing each other, Drayton McLane politely demurred. It seemed too unlikely.Advertisement“I never dreamed that would occur,” McLane said this week in a phone interview.It is difficult to say whether McLane is the only person with sports complexes named after him at two alma maters. It is not unheard-of for one person to feel an affinity for two universities: The best-selling author John Grisham, for instance, donated his papers to Mississippi State, from which he graduated, but endowed the prestigious writer-in-residence program at Mississippi, near where he used to make his home in Oxford.Typically, though, boosters boost one place above all others.“I am sure they exist, but having a hard time thinking of big-timers that double up,” Joel Maxcy, a sports economist at Temple University, said in an email. “Seems they are mostly loyal to just one.”McLane has certainly been more loyal to Baylor over the years. He grew up in Cameron, Tex., and by adolescence, he had chosen to support the Bears over the Longhorns, the Aggies or any other college teams that might captivate young Texans. He attended Baylor on the basis of his fandom and his Baptist faith.One McLane stadium inspired the other. Several years ago, Michigan State contacted McLane, the principal owner of the Houston Astros at the time, about a gift for a new baseball stadium. He and his wife made a $4 million donation, and McLane Baseball Stadium at Kobs Field opened for the 2009 season.“The real key was, it was right in the heart of the campus, and the students related more effectively to it,” McLane said of the ballpark.By contrast, Floyd Casey Stadium, the Baylor football team’s longtime home until 2013, is a couple of miles south of Baylor’s campus in Waco. McLane said the distance “really took away from students getting involved.”Baylor’s football team — used to years of also-ran status in the Southwest and Big 12 Conferences — gained momentum after Briles was hired ahead of the 2008 season. The team has since featured a Heisman Trophy winner, Robert Griffin III, and earned at least a share of the last two conference championships.McLane, a onetime chairman of Baylor’s board of directors, tried for several years to initiate a capital campaign for an on-campus stadium, initially to no avail. Eventually, it was packaged with a much larger campaign that included a $100 million scholarship fund, a pet project of Baylor’s president, Kenneth W. Starr.The site for McLane Stadium — just across the Brazos River from Baylor’s campus — became available after George W. Bush decided that his presidential library would be at Southern Methodist, in Dallas. McLane, who had taken over his father’s grocery distribution business, made a gift (he did not disclose the amount) to secure the land.AdvertisementThe stadium, which cost $266 million, is a snug horseshoe, with columns lining the top in a manner reminiscent of Soldier Field. It seats about 45,000, small for a major college stadium, and features a man-made cove off the Brazos, where fans are encouraged to “sailgate.”The stadium looms over Interstate 35, the well-traveled highway that connects San Antonio and Austin with Dallas — which is of no small importance, Briles said.“Some 8-year-old girl or boy is going to be sitting in the back seat,” Briles told reporters in July. “They’re going to say: ‘Mama, or Grandmother, man, look at that place. That place is beautiful. Where is that?’ And she’s going to say, ‘Baylor.’ And then, so for the rest of their lives, they’re going to associate Baylor with excellence.”McLane, the eponym, can be found at most home games in his box, which is a couple of floors below the presidential suite, almost at field level.
                We’ve published maps showing where fan support for one team begins and another ends for baseball and basketball. Now we’re pleased to offer another one: the United States according to college football fans.            So on Thursday, which team will he root for? Since the bowl pairing was announced on Dec. 7, both sides have sought his affection.“We sent Mr. McLane a bunch of Michigan State gear,” Michigan State’s president, Lou Anna K. Simon, said.McLane said Briles had sent him a travel bag stuffed with Baylor apparel.McLane, who will attend the game with his two sons, two daughters-in-law and five grandsons, tipped his hand as to his rooting interest.“I have been a Baylor fan since I was about 6 or 7 and a Michigan State fan when I was 21, and I live in Central Texas,” McLane said. “So I’m going to possibly be cheering for Baylor. But I’ll be happy no matter what happens.Advertisement“Does that make me sound like a politician?”A version of this article appears in print on January 1, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Alluring Matchup in Cotton Bowl Has One Man’s Name Written All Over It.
