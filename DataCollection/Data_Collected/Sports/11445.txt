But not the 36-year-old Pacquiao, who has managed to find time to be a recording artist, an action movie star, a basketball player and a congressman in his native Philippines, where his fame and popularity are unmatched.Pacquiao’s latest recording, released in honor of the upcoming Mayweather fight, is a heartfelt ballad titled “Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino,” or “I Will Fight for the Filipinos.”The music video, for which Pacquiao is credited as director, intercuts boxing footage, scenes from typhoon damage in the Philippines and shots of Pacquiao in the studio, singing earnestly.The song has created a stir in some unlikely places: Jimmy Kimmel has proclaimed himself a fan and tried his his best to sing it on his show.Mayweather’s own chief contribution to pop music is a spoken-word cameo on “Undisputed” by the rapper Ludacris (“These boys will smile in your face and stab you right in the back,” he advises).By contrast, Pacquiao is an easy-listening troubadour, profoundly sincere on another ballad, “Para Sa’yo Ang Laban Na’to,” or “This Fight Is for You,” as he sings “Gagawin ko ang lahat para sa’yo” (“I would do anything for you.”)Pacquaio seems to be an aficionado of mellower pop, choosing Katy Perry for his entrance music for fights against Brandon Rios in 2013 and Timothy Bradley in 2014, though he switched to “We Will Rock You” for his most recent fight, against Chris Algieri last November.Pacquiao has also covered one of the treacliest of ’70s classics, “Sometimes When We Touch.” Still, his crooning seems to have found favor in his karaoke-mad country.Pacquiao has also starred in several movies, notably 2009’s “Wapakman,” in which he improbably plays a septic tank repairman turned superhero. In addition to action scenes in which he disarms thugs and fights off sexy robots, Pacquiao also shows off his acting chops in Tagalog and English in some tender moments with children and a rueful parting at an airport.Last June, the 5-foot-6 Pacquiao was named a player-coach for the expansion Kia Carnival of the Philippine Basketball League.In the season opener in October against the Blackwater Elite, Pacquiao played six minutes but recorded only a turnover. After another scoreless game in December, he had his breakthrough on Feb. 18 against the Purefoods Star Hotshots, scoring a point on a free throw in four minutes on the floor.One Hotshots player, Daniel Orton, a former N.B.A. first-round pick for the Orlando Magic out of Kentucky, questioned Pacquiao’s basketball credentials after the game, setting off an uproar.“Everyone is angry at him,” the top administrator of Orton’s team, Rene Pardo, told ABS-CBN news. “It is like he went to the United States and insulted the name of Martin Luther King.”Orton was duly released by the Hotshots and wound up with the Idaho Stampede, which just finished a 9-41 season in the N.B.A. Development League.Pacquaio has also parlayed his enormous popularity at home into a political career. He first ran for Congress in 2007 in the district where he grew up. The campaign was hastily thrown together, and he was easily beaten by the incumbent.But in 2010 he ran again, this time in his wife’s hometown, and won by a large margin, nearly doubling his opponent’s vote total. In 2013 he held his seat, running unopposed.His extracurricular activities seem to have cut into his legislating time, and political opponents have faulted him for consistently recording low attendance rates in Congress.Pacquiao has shrugged off the criticism,  saying that rather than sit around making laws, he is acting to help people.It remains to be seen whether Pacquiao’s many ventures will distract him from the approaching fight in Las Vegas. But when he gets in the ring against Mayweather, only one Pacquiao will matter: the boxer.Advertisement
