The decision by the Seattle Seahawks to throw the ball on second-and-goal from the 1-yard line, trailing the Patriots by 4 in the closing seconds of the Super Bowl on Sunday, will go down as an infamous blunder. A team with Marshawn Lynch, one of the best goal-line running backs in football, instead opted for a far riskier option, and Malcolm Butler made them pay, intercepting the ball at the goal line to effectively end the Seahawks’ hopes of winning a second consecutive Super Bowl.Coach Pete Carroll took responsibility for the call after the game. So did his offensive coordinator, Darrell Bevell. Whoever actually made the call, the decision joins an ignominious list of the worst coaching decisions in sports history. Where the decision ranks will be decided by history, but if it wants to have staying power, it might need a nickname.■ Marty Mornhinweg’s overtime call: The stakes may have been far lower, but few coaches are more associated with one decision than Mornhinweg, who chose to give his opponent the ball to start overtime in a 2002 game. The Detroit Lions coach felt the wind direction trumped getting the ball, and that his kicker would give him a distinct advantage, but his team never got a chance as the Bears kicked a field goal to win the game before the Lions touched the ball.

Lee/The New York Times        ■ McNamara leaves Buckner on the field: It had become common practice for the Boston Red Sox to take Bill Buckner out of games in the final innings for a defensive replacement. The veteran had trouble moving around because of various injuries, but John McNamara, Boston’s manager, reportedly let Buckner stay on the field at the end of Game 6 of the 1986 World Series in hopes of letting him celebrate on the field with his teammates. A ground ball to first base went through Buckner’s legs as the Mets stormed back to win Game 6 and eventually the World Series.Advertisement■ Little’s bullpen decision: In the final act of the Curse of the Bambino, Grady Little, the manager of the Boston Red Sox, decided to stick by his ace, Pedro Martinez, with Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series on the line. Boston was up, 5-2, in the 8th inning, and the team was five outs from the World Series when Martinez melted down. Little visited the mound after Martinez allowed three consecutive hits but decided to leave Martinez in the game. Jorge Posada then hit a two-run double to tie the game, which the Yankees won in extra innings.■ Dressen lets Branca face Bobby Thomson: Ralph Branca of the Brooklyn Dodgers was on short rest having thrown 135 pitches just two days before, and had a terrible personal history with Bobby Thomson, the Giants’ slugger. But Chuck Dressen, the manager of the Dodgers, summoned Branca to the mound in the National League tiebreaker where he proceeded to give up what is still known as “The Shot Heard Round The World”. Branca proved to be a great sport, as he spent years appearing with Thomson and autographing pictures of the famous home run.Advertisement■ Bob Gibson calls for a run: On the previous play, the Giants had taken a knee, running the clock down, but clinging to a 17-12 lead over the Eagles with 20 seconds left to play in a 1978 matchup. Gibson, New York’s offensive coordinator, decided the team should attempt a run. Larry Csonka reportedly asked to not be given the ball, but he got it anyway, fumbling it on the handoff, and Herm Edwards of the Eagles picked up the ball and ran for a 26-yard game-winning touchdown that has come to be known as the “Miracle at the Meadowlands.”A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page D9 of the New York edition with the headline: Seattle’s Call Joins List of Big Gaffes in Sports.
