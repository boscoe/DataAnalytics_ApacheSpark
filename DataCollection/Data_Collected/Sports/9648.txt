The New York Cosmos will play in Cuba in June, but it may prove difficult for their fans to join them on the trip.The Cosmos confirmed on Monday that they would play the Cuban national team in an exhibition game on June 2 in Havana, becoming the first American pro sports team to visit the island since the United States government announced in December that it would begin the process of restoring full diplomatic relations with Cuba.The only obstacles that remain, team officials said, are logistics. The Cosmos’ chairman, Seamus O’Brien, said the club had received assurances that it would have no difficulty obtaining visas for its trip — a process that is not complete — and added there was no chance that the absence of those approvals would scuttle the match. But he acknowledged that fans and others traveling outside the official party, a group that would include even the players’ family members, could face tougher hurdles in attending.Tourist visits to Cuba are still banned under the United States government’s embargo, and while new regulations announced on Jan. 16 have made travel to Cuba easier than at any time in the past half-century, fans looking to attend a soccer match cannot simply book a plane ticket and go.AdvertisementAs a result of the new rules, Americans no longer need to apply for a license to travel; instead, there are 12 categories of travel allowed, including visits to close relatives, student travel and participation in sports competitions, but not necessarily the viewing of them.AdvertisementO’Brien said the Cosmos still hoped to take a group of its fans to the match, but he described the process to make that happen as “unresolved,” with a little more than 10 weeks until the game.“We’re going to try, we’re going to push, but I’m not going to push beyond our welcome,” O’Brien said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The team has already played preseason exhibitions in Hong Kong and El Salvador this year.OLYMPIC SITES FIFA and Olympic organizers announced Monday that matches at the 2016 Rio Olympic soccer tournament would be held in six Brazilian cities: Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Salvador, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Manaus. With the exception of the new Olympic stadium in Rio, all the stadiums confirmed Monday hosted matches during the 2014 World Cup.The most surprising inclusion was that of Arena Amazônia in Manaus; FIFA had originally opposed using it because it is more than 1,800 miles from the main Olympic park in Rio.Soccer is the only Olympic competition scheduled to be played outside Rio. Manaus remained on the list because of fears that the fields at the five other stadiums might not stand up to the wear and tear of the two-week Olympic tournament. The field includes 16 men’s teams and 12 women’s.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
