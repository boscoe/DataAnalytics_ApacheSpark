Fabuluje said in a statement he was informed that he tested positive for an amphetamine after taking a supplement that did not list any banned substances on the label.Ferguson was placed on injured reserve last month because of a knee injury. He appeared in four games, with one start, this season after playing in all 16 games as a rookie in 2014. He will begin serving his suspension immediately.BRIDGEWATER IS BACK Minnesota Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater returned to full participation in practice, a significant step in his recovery from a concussion.Bridgewater was hurt as he slid in front of St. Louis Rams cornerback Lamarcus Joyner, whose shoulder-first hit caused Bridgewater’s head to hit the turf early in the fourth quarter during a game last week. Bridgewater was expected to start Sunday at Oakland.RAIDER RETURNS Oakland running back Latavius Murray practiced for the first time since sustaining a concussion and was optimistic about his chances of playing against Minnesota.Four days after being forced out of a game in Pittsburgh after a hit by Steelers safety Mike Mitchell, Murray took part in drills with Oakland’s first-team offense and showed no lingering effects. GIANT OUT FOR SEASON Will Beatty, the Giants’ starting left tackle who tore a pectoral muscle lifting weights in May but was expected to give the team a late-season lift when he returned to uniform this month, will be sidelined for the remainder of the year with a different injury: a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder. Beatty was injured while rehabilitating his pectoral muscle.With his muscle tear healed, Beatty had returned to practice in recent weeks and was trying to see if he could play through the shoulder discomfort. But Coach Tom Coughlin said Thursday that Beatty would need surgery for the shoulder injury and that his season was over.BILL PENNINGTONAdvertisement
