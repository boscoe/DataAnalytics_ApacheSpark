Frank Malzone, a six-time All-Star third baseman whose steady presence in the Boston lineup tied together two of the city’s baseball eras, linking Ted Williams’s Red Sox with Carl Yastrzemski’s, died on Tuesday at his home in Needham, Mass. He was 85.The Red Sox announced his death.Malzone played with the Red Sox from 1955 to 1965, not a period of distinction for the franchise — the team never finished higher than third — even though it was led by two future Hall of Fame outfielders: Williams, who retired in 1960, not having played in a World Series since 1946, and Yastrzemski, who arrived in 1961 and finally led the team to a pennant in 1967. As one Boston hero passed the torch to the other, Malzone was a stalwart supporting player for both.He was remarkably durable, playing in more than 150 games in seven consecutive seasons, including 475 games in a row. In the 1957 season, he played 42 more games at third than anyone else in the American League, handling so many more chances that he led the league in both errors and fielding percentage.As a hitter, Malzone swung a solid if not spectacular right-handed bat. His career average was .274, but he batted .280 or better in five of his first seven full seasons, 1957 to 1963, and knocked in more than 90 runs three times, including 103 in 1957.AdvertisementHe made the All-Star team in each of his first four full seasons. In the second of two All-Star Games in 1959 (from 1959 to 1962 there were two All-Star Games annually), he hit a home run off the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Don Drysdale, a future Hall of Famer, and in his last All-Star appearance, in 1963, he batted cleanup for the American League.AdvertisementEarly in his career, Malzone was perhaps the best defensive third baseman in baseball. He won a Gold Glove in 1957, when that annual award made its debut and was given to just one player at each position in the big leagues. From the next year on, a Gold Glove has been given to the best fielder at each position in each league; Malzone won the American League award in 1958 and 1959, and if Brooks Robinson — who won the next 16 in a row while playing for the Baltimore Orioles — had not come along, he might have picked up a few more.“We’re not only happy with Malzone; we’re practically hysterical about him,” Mike Higgins, a former Red Sox third baseman who managed the team from 1955 to 1962 and was known as Pinky, told The Saturday Evening Post in 1957. “I couldn’t carry his glove. Neither could anyone else I can remember. He’s the best third baseman I’ve ever seen.”No other Red Sox third baseman has won a Gold Glove. No Red Sox third baseman has hit more home runs than the 131 Malzone hit with the team or has had more than his 716 runs batted in.At the end of his career, Malzone played one season as a reserve for the California Angels.Frank James Malzone was born in the Bronx on Feb. 28, 1930, and grew up a Yankees fan. His father was an Italian immigrant who worked for the New York City water department.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

No power.”Malzone played baseball at Samuel Gompers high school and began his professional career not long after his 18th birthday with a Red Sox minor league affiliate in Milford, Del. He lost most of the 1950 season to an ankle injury and was in the Army in 1952 and 1953.He made his major league debut in September 1955 and had 115 plate appearances for the Sox in 1956 before becoming the starting third baseman the next year. Williams was finishing out his career, and by the time he retired after the 1960 season, Malzone was a team leader.“When I first came to the big leagues in 1961, Frank was the guy who took me under his wing,” Yastrzemski said in a statement provided by the Red Sox. “I struggled when I first came up, and he took care of me and stayed with me. He was a real class guy, a very caring guy, and I owe him a lot.”After his retirement as a player, Malzone worked for the Red Sox as a scout and instructor. He married Amy Gennerino, whom he met in 1949 while playing in Oneonta, N.Y, in 1951. She died in 2006. The Red Sox said Malzone was survived by four sons, Frank, Paul, John and Jim; a daughter, Anne O’Neill; eight grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.An obituary on Thursday about Frank Malzone, the All-Star third baseman for the Boston Red Sox, misstated the year in which he played 42 more games at third base than anyone else in the American League. It was 1957, not 1959.A version of this article appears in print on December 31, 2015, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Frank Malzone, 85, Star Fielder for Red Sox.
