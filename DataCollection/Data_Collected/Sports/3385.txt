Packers (6-3) at Vikings (7-2)4:25 p.m. Line: EvenN.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsThe Packers have won four consecutive N.F.C. North titles, as much because of their own talent as the lack of quality competition in the division. But as Green Bay has encountered a rough patch, losing three games in a row, the Vikings have been chugging along and last week pulled ahead of the Packers in the standings with their fifth consecutive win.If the Packers had a hard time scoring against the porous Detroit defense, they may not have a prayer against Linval Joseph and the Vikings. Minnesota has allowed an N.F.C.-low 17.1 points a game thanks to a crushing interior defense led by Joseph that takes away the run while also harassing opposing quarterbacks.Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is listed as questionable, but he is expected to play. Even if he does, Minnesota seems like the better team.Pick: VikingsWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
