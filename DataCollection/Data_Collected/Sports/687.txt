Week 5 scores and highlightsThe Rams are perplexing, and have been for a couple of seasons, losing games they should have won, or, as they did last week against Arizona, pulling out a victory when they should have lost. The Rams handed the Cardinals their first loss of the season, and they will be trying to do the same thing this week in Green Bay, where the Packers have won 11 in a row and have looked unbeatable at times.If the Rams manage to win, you can bet that their formidable pass rush will play a significant role. St. Louis has a front four that seems capable of rattling Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who has not thrown an interception at Lambeau Field since 2012.The Rams’ offense is suddenly dangerous, too. Running back Todd Gurley is showing signs of being the player he was in college before blowing out his knee. Add to that a corps of explosive receivers capable of making big plays and you’ve got a recipe for an upset.PICK: RAMSAdvertisement
