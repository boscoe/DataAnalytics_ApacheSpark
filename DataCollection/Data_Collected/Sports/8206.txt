TAMPA, Fla. —  Preparing to make a highly scrutinized return to baseball after a long suspension for drug use, Alex Rodriguez issued a brief, handwritten statement on Tuesday afternoon to say he was sorry for his behavior.It was Rodriguez’s first public comment on the matter since he issued a defiant statement in January 2014, the day his suspension went into effect. Back then, he said the charges against him were false. Thirteen months later, writing in cursive in an apparent attempt to add a personal touch, Rodriguez demonstrated some contrition.While not directly admitting to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, the matter at the heart of his suspension, he tacitly acknowledged that the record 162-game penalty against him had been warranted and said that the misdeeds had been his own.“To the fans,” his statement began. “I take full responsibility for the mistakes that led to my suspension for the 2014 season. I regret that my actions made the situation worse than it needed to be. To Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the players association and you, the fans, I can only say I’m sorry.Advertisement“I accept the fact that many of you will not believe my apology or anything that I say at this point,” the statement added. “I understand why, and that’s on me.”AdvertisementThe timing of the statement coincided with the release of an article in ESPN the Magazine. In it, Rodriguez suggested that in recent seasons he had actually been given placebos, and not performance enhancers, by Anthony Bosch, the former head of the Biogenesis clinic in Miami. On Tuesday, Bosch was sentenced to four years in prison for his activities with Biogenesis.
                Alex Rodriguez issued a hand-written statement Tuesday apologizing for his behavior that led to a season-long suspension for performance-enhancing drugs.            “Only a dope like me would do that stuff and have the two worst statistical seasons of my career,” Rodriguez said in the article.Rodriguez was not the only major leaguer who turned to Bosch, and his now-defunct clinic, to gain access to banned substances. Twelve other major leaguers did so as well, and were also suspended by baseball, but not with the severity to which Rodriguez was subjected. And only Rodriguez attempted to get out of his punishment.It is unclear what Rodriguez has planned for the next stage of his return, and whether it will include a formal news conference before his anticipated arrival here next week for the start of spring training. It also remains to be seen what questions he might be willing to answer when he does finally engage in some sort of face-to-face session with the news media.The Yankees have forbidden him to use their spring training complex to hold a formal news conference, mindful, perhaps, of the uproar he created there in 2009, when he admitted, to an assembled throng of reporters, that he had used steroids earlier in his career.This time, the Yankees concluded, it would better for that scene to play out in the Bronx, at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees told Rodriguez that that was their preference, but Rodriguez has now ruled out that option, saying in his statement that it was “gracious” for the Yankees to suggest he go the Bronx but that he was not going to take them up on the offer.“I decided the next time I am in Yankee Stadium, I should be in pinstripes doing my job,” the statement said.AdvertisementSo where will Rodriguez answer whatever questions he is willing to answer? If he decides on an informal setting, he could simply do it at his locker in the Tampa clubhouse, though that would certainly disrupt the Yankees’ routine.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            For that reason, team executives were not particularly pleased with Tuesday’s developments. They were hoping an extensive news conference by Rodriguez, away from Tampa, might shift the focus back to baseball. Now they are not sure what comes next.The statement on Tuesday echoed similar apologies Rodriguez had already made to Major League Baseball, the Yankees and the players association earlier this month, not only for using drugs provided by Bosch but also for the combative and litigious approach he took while initially trying to avoid a suspension.“I served the longest suspension in the history of the League for PED use,” Rodriguez said at one point in the statement. “The commissioner has said the matter is over. The players association has said the same. The Yankees have said the next step is to play baseball. I’m ready to put this chapter behind me and play some ball.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But in the hours following the arbitrator’s adverse ruling on his suspension, on Jan. 11, 2014, Rodriguez was breathing fire. He issued a statement that day saying, in part: “I have been clear that I did not use performance-enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I will take this fight to Federal Court.”He added at the time, “No player should have to go through what I have been dealing with, and I am exhausting all options.”And yet by the end of that month, Rodriguez had admitted to federal prosecutors in the Biogenesis case that he had indeed used Bosch to provide him with performance enhancers. By that point, he had also decided to drop any effort to challenge the arbitrator’s ruling in the courts. From there, he proceeded to serve out his season-long suspension and, more recently, begin his series of apologies.Tuesday’s statement, and apology, came six years to the day after Rodriguez held a news conference at the Yankees’ facility in Tampa to acknowledge that he had used a cousin to help him obtain and use steroids during a period between 2001 and 2003, when he was playing for the Texas Rangers.AdvertisementAt the time, Rodriguez explained his behavior as being the “silly and irresponsible” actions of a “young guy.”Now he is old, at least by baseball standards. He turns 40 in July and will attempt to play this season with two surgically repaired hips after missing all of the 2014 campaign and much of 2013 as well, when he was rehabilitating from his second operation.Recognizing all that, the Yankees are not counting on him for much this season except the inevitable distractions. During the winter, they signed Chase Headley, a third baseman, to a four-year extension, leaving Rodriguez without a position, except that of designated hitter, assuming he even hits enough to justify a spot in the lineup.Nevertheless, Rodriguez still has three years and $61 million guaranteed remaining on his enormous contract, plus extra marketing clauses that theoretically could earn him an additional $6 million apiece in bonuses if he can reach various milestones on the career home run list.The first of those milestones is Willie Mays’s total of 660 home runs. Rodriguez, with 654, is just six away. The Yankees have informed Rodriguez they do not intend to honor the bonus payments because they were part of a separate marketing agreement that was not part of his 10-year contract and that, as a drug violator, he is no longer marketable.Whether the Yankees’ stance will be upheld if Rodriguez challenges it is in question. Whether Rodriguez will ever get to 660 is not a certainty, either. The only thing for sure at the moment is that the long-running Rodriguez saga is back in full bloom.A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Exchanging Sword for Pen, Rodriguez Apologizes to Yankees and Fans.
