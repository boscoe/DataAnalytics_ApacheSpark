In the process, Fenninger, 25, successfully defended her World Cup giant slalom title. She finished 22 points ahead of Maze over all. Maze, 31, who is approaching the end of her career, gave Fenninger a necklace as a gift after the race.“I was really nervous at the start,” Fenninger said. “Then I tried to do what I love. I was always thinking about that: ‘You love it, and you have to do it.’ I’m happy that I can live my dream.”Lindsey Vonn placed third, having captured the downhill and super-G trophies in a stunning comeback season after two knee injuries. ■ Severin Freund of Germany won the overall ski jump World Cup title by the slimmest of margins, claiming the crystal globe on a tiebreaker rule after matching Peter Prevc of Slovenia in the season-long points standings. Freund finished seventh in the season-ending ski flying competition in Planica, Slovenia, but he had more wins than Prevc, with nine. ■ Heather Richardson clinched the women’s overall speedskating World Cup title at the last meet of the season, in Erfurt, Germany.
