Young finished with 16 points and 11 rebounds, while Jarrett Jack and Shane Larkin each had 14.Al Horford scored 18 points for the Hawks. Paul Millsap had 17 and Kyle Korver added 13.“My mind-set when I got the ball was I was going to score the ball,” Young said about his drive to the hoop. “I potentially knew I was going to the free-throw line, so I was prepared for that also. But, at the end of the day I can say we won the game.”Despite the Hawks tying a season-high with 17 turnovers, Sefolosha’s 3-pointer with 41 seconds left gave them an 88-86 lead before Jack tied the score on a short jumper with 33 seconds left.After Young hit the winning free throws, he knocked away Sefolosha’s inbounds pass to Horford as time expired.“We initially said that coming out of the timeout we were going to switch everything,” Young said. “Switch everything. Switch everything. We knew if Kyle Korver couldn’t get in there they would try and lob it in to Horford and let him make a play.”Neither team led by more than 4 points in a sloppy first quarter when they combined for 14 turnovers, eight by the Hawks, who led 19-17 after the first 12 minutes.“I give Brooklyn credit,” Hawks Coach Mike Budenholzer said. “They played well. They forced the turnovers. We didn’t take care of the ball.
