Week 13 scores and highlightsOver the last four games, Houston’s defense has performed the way many thought Buffalo’s would when Coach Rex Ryan was hired. The Texans have allowed only 8.8 points a game in a four-game winning streak, and last week held the high-powered New Orleans offense to 6 points.The Bills, despite plenty of talent on both sides of the ball, have been a mess. Their defense, expected to be the biggest strength, is ranked 19th in the N.F.L. with 355.9 yards allowed per game.“I’ve never been in this situation,” Ryan told reporters. “I think the worst I’ve ever been in this league is 11th. I’m not going to press the panic button. But we’ll see. Obviously, we’ve got to improve.”PICK: TEXANSAdvertisement
