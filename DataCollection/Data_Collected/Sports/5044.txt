Eliminated from the playoffs, they have double-digit losses for the first time in quarterback Philip Riversâ€™s career. They may be playing their last game in the city this week, with a proposed move to Los Angeles looming, and while they have created many fond memories, it has been a while since they have added a new one. Miami is hardly a great team, but with a chance to finish with a .500 record, the Dolphins at least have more to play for.PICK: DolphinsAdvertisement
