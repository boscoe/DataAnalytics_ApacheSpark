He has surpassed 100 yards receiving in three of his team’s six games and last week became just the fifth player since 1960 to have 500 or more receiving yards in his first six games. He needs 103 yards this week to have the most for a player through seven games, but that will be a difficult task should the Jets choose to cover him with Darrelle Revis.That is just one of the subplots of a game that should engender far more interest than could have been anticipated before the season. The Jets look rejuvenated under Coach Todd Bowles, and the Raiders are fun to watch for the first time since Rich Gannon took Oakland to Super Bowl XXXVII.The Raiders’ defense has allowed an N.F.L.-worst 303.8 yards a game, but it has limited the damage by allowing just 11 touchdown passes while compiling seven interceptions. Opposing quarterbacks have averaged a rating of just 89.2, which leaves Oakland tied for 13th in the league with New England. That could be bad news for Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has moved the ball well but has a tendency to turn it over at inopportune times.PICK: RAIDERSAdvertisement
