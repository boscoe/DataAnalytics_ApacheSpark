The trustee blocked his attempt to swap out their shares in the teams from the trusts. Renee, Rita and Ryan then filed a lawsuit in New Orleans that said that Benson was mentally unfit to oversee his businesses, and sought to put Renee in charge of his assets.In his filing, Benson promised to pay $556 million for Renee, Rita and Ryan’s minority stakes in the teams. The shares do not come with voting rights, which means they are worth less than those with voting rights.Renee Benson and her children said in a statement released Wednesday that “we are pleased that so far we have been successful in our steps to protect our beloved father and grandfather during this time in his life.” They added that they “have every intention of carrying on our father and grandfather’s legacy for future generations by continuing to support the city of New Orleans, the Saints, and the Pelicans, as we have consistently done in the past.”Advertisement
