Two prospects from the United States ski team were killed in an avalanche Monday while skiing near their European training base in the Austrian Alps.The team said the skiers — Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19 — died near Sölden, the annual site of the season-opening World Cup race.Berlack, from Franconia, N.H., and Astle, from Sandy, Utah, were part of a group of six skiers descending from the Gaislachkogel, a mountain, when they left the prepared slope and apparently set off the avalanche. The other four skied out of the slide and escaped unhurt.Officials in the Tyrolean region said an avalanche alert had been declared for the area after days of heavy snowfall and mild temperatures.Advertisement“Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport — both on the racecourse and skiing the mountain,” said Tiger Shaw, the president and chief executive officer of the United States Ski and Snowboard Association. “Our hearts go out to the Berlack and Astle families, as well as to their extended sport family. Both of them loved what they did and conveyed that to those around them.”Berlack grew up racing in New Hampshire and had been a student-athlete at Vermont’s Burke Mountain Academy. He was named to the so-called development team for potential World Cup racers after recording top-20 finishes at the 2013 United States national championships and a spring tryout camp.Astle was invited to train with the development team after posting strong early-season results, including two top-10 finishes in NorAm Cup races last month in Canada.AdvertisementThe deaths of Astle and Berlack have left the United States ski team “in shock,” its Alpine director, Patrick Riml, said in Zagreb, Croatia, where the American slalom team was preparing for a night race set for Tuesday.A version of this article appears in print on January 6, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Two American Skiers Die in Austria in Avalanche.
