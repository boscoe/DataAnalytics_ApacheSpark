AdvertisementSupported byN.H.L. RoundupBy The Associated PressAntti Raanta was just looking to get a win in his Rangers debut. He did much more than that.Raanta stopped all 22 shots he faced to become the fourth goalie in franchise history to get a shutout in his first start with the team, leading the Rangers to a 4-0 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Monday night at Madison Square Garden.With his fourth career shutout, Raanta joined Hal Winkler (1926), John Ross Roach (1928) and Marcel Paille (1957) as the only goaltenders to blank opponents in their first starts with the Rangers.“The only thing I was thinking was to win,” said Raanta, who was playing for the first time since being acquired from Chicago in a draft-day trade in June. “Our guys defended so well.”Marc Staal, Mats Zuccarello, Jesper Fast and Viktor Stalberg scored for the Rangers, who ended a three-game winless streak (0-2-1) after opening the season with three wins.Martin Jones finished with 24 saves in his first loss of the season as the Sharks lost their second straight after opening the season with four wins. Jones had allowed just two goals in the Sharks season-opening winning streak and came in leading the N.H.L. in goals-against average (0.49), save percentage (.982) and shutouts (two).Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault opted to keep the same forward lines and defense pairings that scored only once in the 2-1 overtime loss to the Devils on Sunday.Vigneault’s choice paid immediate dividends as Staal scored his first of the season 10 minutes 36 seconds into the game. The Rangers continued to attack in what was the team’s most complete performance of the season.While Raanta did not have to work especially hard, his toughest stop occurred early in the second period as the Rangers were killing a five-on-three Sharks power play. San Jose center Joe Thornton tried a quick shot from along the goal line as Patrick Marleau drove the net, but Raanta kicked the puck away. The save was significant when Zuccarello scored his fourth of the season later in the period.Fast had a breakaway goal 3:47 into the third period.Stalberg’s goal with 3:16 left ended the scoring.COYOTES’ VITALE SIDELINED Arizona placed center Joe Vitale on injured reserve with an upper-body injury and recalled forward Matthias Plachta from Springfield of the American Hockey League. Vitale was injured in Saturday’s game against Boston after a fight with the Bruins’ Kevan Miller.Plachta, a 24-year-old from Germany, appeared in three games with Springfield this season.KINGS’ PRACTICE WOES  Los Angeles’s practice schedule is tentative these days while power shutdowns plague the neighborhood around its training complex.The Kings were forced to cancel the on-ice portion of practice Monday for the second time this month because the ice at the Toyota Sports Center was not playable.Advertisement
