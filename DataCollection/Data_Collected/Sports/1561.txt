Eagles (3-3) at Panthers (5-0)8:30 p.m. Line: Panthers by 3N.F.L. Week 7 scores and highlightsFour games into the 2015 season, the Eagles were 1-3 and fans were calling for Coach Chip Kelly’s head. Speculation ran wild about which college program Kelly might helm next year after receiving his walking papers in Philadelphia. But with two straight wins, including a 27-7 throttling of their division rival Giants, the Eagles sit atop the N.F.C. East. Their offense, which struggled mightily in its first four games, averaged 472 yards in its last two (it averaged only 294 in its first four).In short, the Eagles are looking like the Eagles many expected coming into this season. And they are doing it despite the poor play of quarterback Sam Bradford, who tossed three interceptions against the Giants and is second in the league in interceptions over all with nine. Bradford does not seem to have any grasp on what his problems are.“If I knew, I would stop throwing them,” Bradford said after beating the Giants. “It is something that I never really had a problem with in my career. I have never thrown a lot of interceptions, so this is kind of new to me.”Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, on the other hand, has looked like an M.V.P. contender of late, especially after leading his team to victory in Seattle last week with two late drives after trailing by 20-7. It should be noted that he is doing it with a group of receivers the average N.F.L. fan probably could not identify in a lineup, outside of maybe tight end Greg Olsen.PICK: PANTHERSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
