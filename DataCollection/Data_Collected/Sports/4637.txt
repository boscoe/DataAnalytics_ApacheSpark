There is no rodeo family quite like the Wrights, with their steady supply of champion saddle-bronc riders, and the winning tradition has now passed to a new generation. Rusty Wright  — the 20-year-old son of Cody Wright, the world champion in 2008 and 2010  — was among those competing for the cherished gold buckle until the very end at the sport’s championship event, the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas, which concluded Saturday night. CoBurn Bradshaw, 21, who married into the Wright family, was the saddle-bronc rookie of the year and more than doubled his 2015 winnings over 10 nights of competition. Jake and Spencer, last year’s world champion, were there, too. And with Cody and other Wright brothers still among the world’s best, and with the emergence of a second generation that promises to be just as good, the first family of saddle bronc seems to have a tight grip on its sport.
