The Federal Office of Justice said those documents were being reviewed to determine whether they were relevant to the American inquiry.ISL was found to have routinely bribed top sports officials, including Sepp Blatter’s predecessor as FIFA president, João Havelange, before falling into criminal bankruptcy in 2001. The American investigation of the ISL scandal, which plunged FIFA into crisis at the time, is believed to be targeting Mr. Blatter.Last week, in a separate case, FIFA’s ethics committee barred Mr. Blatter from the sport for eight years. Michel Platini, the president of UEFA, which oversees soccer in Europe, was also suspended.The Swiss authorities also said they had frozen $80 million in assets in 13 bank accounts. “The U.S. authorities can apply to have these assets handed over if they have a legally valid and enforceable seizure ruling from a U.S. court,” the Federal Office of Justice said.The Swiss also said four men in their custody, some of them arrested in May during an early-morning raid at a luxury hotel in Zurich, continued to oppose extradition to the United States.Advertisement
