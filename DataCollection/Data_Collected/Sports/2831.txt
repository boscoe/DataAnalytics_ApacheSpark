RoundupBy The Associated PressSergey Kalinin scored a power-play goal with 2 minutes 27 seconds left and the Devils beat the Blackhawks, 3-2, Thursday night in Chicago for their second victory over the defending Stanley Cup champions in a week.With Patrick Kane off for high sticking, Corey Crawford stopped Kyle Palmieri’s shot from the left circle. But Kalinin was alone at the edge of the crease and slipped the rebound in the net.“The game-winner was great,” Devils Coach John Hynes said. “We have him now net-front on the power play, which he earned.”Kalinin spent the past five seasons in Russia’s K.H.L. and is happy about the opportunity he’s getting with the resurgent Devils.“When you play more, when coach and team trusts you, it’s more power for you,” Kalinin said. “You feel more comfortable on the ice, and try to create things.”Adam Henrique and Palmieri scored in the second period to put the Devils ahead, Cory Schneider made 27 saves and the Devils rebounded after a 2-0 loss to St. Louis on Tuesday night. The Devils have won three of four — including a 4-2 win over Chicago last Friday night — and are 9-3-0 after starting 0-3-1.The Chicago rookie Artemi Panarin scored from a sharp angle with 6:41 left in the third to tie the score at 2-2. Kane assisted on that one and scored a 5-on-3 goal in the first period to extend his point streak to 11 games. He has eight goals and 11 assists during the run.Crawford stopped 19 shots, and the Blackhawks lost for the third time in four games. They’ve only won two of their last seven.Kane opened the scoring after the Devils defense pair of John Moore and Damon Severson were both sent off for minor penalties on the same play.Kane beat Schneider with a high shot on the short side from the right circle for his 11th goal, completing a crisp passing sequence with Jonathan Toews and Teuvo Teravainen across the top of the crease.Henrique and Palmieri connected in the second to give the Devils a 2-1 lead.Henrique fooled Crawford from 35 feet out 59 seconds into the period to the score at 1-1 with his team-leading eighth goal. With the Blackhawks’ defense backing in, Henrique snapped off a quick shot from the middle and beat Crawford high on the stick side.Palmieri slipped behind Chicago’s confused defense, streaked to the net and popped in a loose rebound from the edge of the crease with 2:59 left in the period to put the Devils ahead.Crawford stretched to his left to make a glove save on Kalinin’s quick shot from high in the slot, but couldn’t handle the puck or recover in time to stop Palmieri after the veteran Chicago defenseman Brent Seabrook and the rookie Viktor Svedberg got crossed up on coverage.Panarin tied the score with his third goal in two games moments after Crawford made a point-blank pad save on Mike Cammalleri. Panarin finished Chicago’s rush by beating Schneider with a quick shot high on the stick side.SABRES 3, PANTHERS 2 Cody Franson scored a tiebreaking goal late in the second period, Sam Reinhart added a power-play goal early in the third, and visiting Buffalo held off Florida.Brian Gionta also scored for the Sabres, and Rasmus Ristolainen had two assists.WILD 3, HURRICANES 2 Jason Zucker scored his second goal of the game with 1 minute 10 seconds left in overtime night, giving Minnesota a win on the road over Carolina.Minnesota had to kill an overtime power play to set up the winner.CAPITALS 5, FLYERS 2 Jason Chimera had two goals and an assist to lead Washington to a victory at slumping Philadelphia.Washington’s Alex Ovechkin remained one goal shy of becoming the top Russian-born goal-scorer in N.H.L. history, tying Sergei Fedorov at 483 career goals.MAPLE LEAFS 2, PREDATORS 1 Peter Holland scored the only goal in a five-round shootout to give Toronto a victory at Nashville.Tyler Bozak scored in the third for the Leafs, and James Reimer turned aside all five Nashville attempts in the tiebreaker.AVALANCHE 3, BRUINS 2 Matt Duchene broke a tie in the third period with his sixth goal in five games, and Colorado beat the Bruins in Boston.Colorado won back-to-back road games for the first time this season.LIGHTNING 3, FLAMES 1 Steven Stamkos scored a go-ahead power-play goal in the third period, Ben Bishop stopped a personal five-game losing streak, and Tampa Bay beat visiting Calgary.SENATORS 3, CANUCKS 2 Bobby Ryan and Chris Wideman had power-play goals, Erik Karlsson also scored, and Ottawa won at home against Vancouver.Advertisement
