Tyler Johnson led a Tampa Bay rally late in regulation, then scored 2 minutes 25 seconds into overtime to lift the Lightning to a 3-2 victory over the host Detroit Red Wings on Thursday night, evening their playoff series at two games each.The Red Wings led by 2-0 in the third period before Johnson, a center, scored with 5:26 remaining. He then assisted on Ondrej Palat’s tying goal 77 seconds later.Early in overtime, defenseman Victor Hedman led an odd-man rush from the right side and slid the puck across the goal mouth. It deflected slightly off goalie Petr Mrazek, but Johnson was able to shoot into an open net from a tough angle for his fourth goal of the series.Gustav Nyquist and Joakim Andersson scored in the second period for Detroit. Andersson’s goal came in an awkward fashion, as Tampa Bay goalie Ben Bishop knocked it in off the crossbar.AdvertisementMrazek is the only goalie who has shut out Tampa Bay this season, having done so late in the regular season and in Game 3 of this series. He was holding the Lightning scoreless again before Johnson skated in on the left and beat him at the short side of the net to make it 2-1.AdvertisementThen Johnson sent in a perfect pass from the right, and Palat only needed to redirect it past Mrazek to tie the score with 4:09 remaining.The opening goal came after Detroit’s Justin Abdelkader gave the puck to Henrik Zetterberg, who slid the puck to Nyquist for a tap-in in front of the net.The Red Wings were more lucky than good on their second goal. Andersson’s shot bounced routinely off Bishop and into the air, but when Bishop tried to bat away the puck with his stick, he instead accidentally knocked it back off the crossbar.The puck fell to the ice and, with defenseman Jason Garrison unable to clear it, slowly slid into the net.After Detroit’s two goals in the second, the Lightning pushed forward toward the end of the period, but Mrazek stymied them.His counterpart, Bishop, appeared frustrated early in the third and was called for a tripping penaltyBut the Red Wings did not score on that power play. After a scrap near the glass with 7:28 left, it appeared as if the Lightning might be losing their composure, but there proved to be enough time for a comeback.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
