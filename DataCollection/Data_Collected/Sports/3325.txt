SCOOBA, Miss. — For months, reporters have called Clint Trickett wanting to talk about football and, more specifically, about football safety. Some called soon after he announced his retirement as a player last December, when he revealed that he had sustained five concussions in 14 months in the previous two seasons as West Virginia’s starting quarterback — the last one a year ago Friday. Others have called more recently, prompted by the coming release of the film “Concussion,” in which Will Smith plays the doctor who helped identify a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma.But Trickett is not interested in talking about head trauma.“Everyone knows it’s a dangerous game,” he said. “I could tell right off the bat they wanted a negative spin.”As football is criticized for the physical and  sometimes fatal toll it takes on those who play it, many people in the United States continue to be enthusiastic about watching and playing it, despite its brutality, or perhaps because of it. Trickett is among them.Soon after his retirement, Trickett, 24, accepted a job here as the quarterbacks coach at East Mississippi Community College. The son of a coach and the brother of two coaches, he now grooms talented prospects to play the game that he cannot.

It’s made me who I am.”AdvertisementHe added: “People saying, ‘Would you want your son to play football?’ Well, yes. Absolutely!”AdvertisementWhen Trickett was a boy, his family’s household was organized along military lines. The three sons — Travis, 30; Chance, 27; and Clint — called their father, Rick, who had served in Vietnam with the Marines, “Sir.” Disrespect was not tolerated.Like many military households, those of college football coaches are itinerant. The Tricketts’ stops in the towns where Rick earned his living read like an atlas of the game: Carbondale, Ill., where Rick met his wife, Tara; Hattiesburg, Miss.; Starkville, Miss., 50 miles up the road from Scooba, where Clint was born; Auburn, Ala.; Memphis; Baton Rouge, La., where Rick coached under Nick Saban; Morgantown, W.Va.; and Tallahassee, Fla., where Rick has been the offensive line coach at Florida State for nearly a decade.Playing football was not required of the Trickett boys. What was demanded was finishing things they had started.“We never quit anything,” Clint Trickett said. “I wanted to quit soccer at an early age. I told my dad, ‘I don’t like it.’ He goes: ‘I don’t like soccer, either. I don’t want you to play soccer. But you ain’t quitting it. You’re finishing out the season.’ ”Clint Trickett drew a direct line from that upbringing toward his toughness as a player on the football field. A slight 158 pounds as a freshman at Florida State, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference rookie of the week after throwing three touchdown passes against Clemson in his first game as a starter.But he struggled to keep up his weight — he later learned that he had celiac disease — and with the strain of playing where his father coached. Still harboring a soft spot for West Virginia, where Rick Trickett had coached for a good chunk of Clint’s childhood, and spying in Coach Dana Holgorsen’s offense a scheme that fit his cannon arm, he transferred.In his first start, in 2013, Trickett was hit on his throwing shoulder. Through grit and cortisone, he played the rest of the game, passing for more than 300 yards in an upset of No. 11 Oklahoma State. He went on to play several more games despite the injury, which required surgery in the off-season, and later that year, he was knocked unconscious against Texas. That concussion caused him to miss the rest of that game and the next, after which he acknowledged that he had also sustained a concussion in an earlier game that season but had not told trainers about it.AdvertisementRick Trickett grew concerned that his son would take the never-quit ethos he had instilled in him too far.“That’s what I worried about,” he said. “Clint, he’s so tough, such a competitor, he might say that he’s O.K. when he’s not O.K.”He added: “I want what’s best for Clint. It’s still just a game.”It can be easy to hide a concussion, according to Clint Trickett. Just keep your mouth shut.“Seriously, that’s the best way,” Trickett said. “Stay away from people who’d think you have one. Keep quiet. Just try to go out there and function.”When West Virginia played Maryland last season, a hit on the first drive gave Trickett another concussion. For a time, he said, he could not see out of the outer half of his left eye. Yet he did not mention the problem to anyone; instead, he passed for more than 500 yards and four touchdowns in a 40-37 victory. “Barely remember the game,” he said.As questions about player safety and head trauma have gained prominence, college training staffs have worked to be assiduous in identifying players experiencing concussionlike symptoms. In many cases, however, the decision on whether a player should be allowed to compete still depends on the honesty and cooperation of the player.“A lot of it’s based upon not just him but athletes’ being honest with us,” said Dave Kerns, West Virginia’s football trainer for the past 21 years. “It’s huge. Do you have a headache? They say no. We’ll converse with them back and forth, and sometimes guys can mask things and they’re not fully honest with us, and we don’t know the difference.”West Virginia employs a concussion examination, developed by X2 Biosystems, that is used by N.F.L. teams, Kerns said. But he acknowledged that no system was perfect.Advertisement“Everybody who got hit in the head — if you took the time to sit them all down, take a postconcussion test — that’s all we’d be doing,” Kerns said. “It is a violent game. Hits to the head occur.”Trickett’s final hit came just before the end of the first half of a game against Kansas State last Nov. 20. Flushed out of the pocket, he forced a throw that was intercepted. Trickett ran down the defender and tripped him up, but after bouncing up off the turf, he knelt for several seconds, rose slowly and walked away.Afterward, Trickett said, he felt “in a fog, haze.” At halftime, he spoke little and avoided the training staff. He also vomited. But he returned to the game, and in the second half he led another drive (and threw another interception) before calling for members of the medical staff.Within a minute, Kerns declared that Trickett would not return to the game. Weeks later, on the eve of the Mountaineers’ appearance in the Liberty Bowl, Trickett’s symptoms — pain, headaches, dizziness — were still so pronounced that West Virginia would not even let him begin the five-step protocol that might have cleared him to play.Fearful for his long-term health, out of college eligibility and eager to start the coaching career he had always seen as his future, Trickett announced he had played in his final game. There would be no chance at the N.F.L., the Canadian Football League or anything else.“It was tough on him then,” Jared Barber, a West Virginia linebacker and friend of Trickett’s, said recently. “Definitely still tough on him now.”Right after his retirement, his mother, Tara, suggested, the head trauma had taken its toll. “I think there was a period of time where he had trouble remembering things,” she said. “His temper was short. He didn’t have a lot of patience.”Trickett attributed the anger to the realization that he could no longer play football, but also to a specific incident that he said was worse than the concussions themselves: sitting in a Memphis hotel room with some teammates and watching a newscaster report that he had “quit” football.Advertisement“You’re getting forced to say that you can’t play in these games,” Trickett said. “You hide these concussions from the trainers to keep yourself out there on the field. You played through your junior year with the shoulder through so much pain, getting shots pregame, halftime, just to be able to function. Then your career ends, and it’s saying that you ‘quit.’“And you’re just like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ ” he added. “That’s the last thing I’d ever do.”In Trickett’s messy, windowless office at East Mississippi Community College, where a miniature refrigerator is stocked with Red Bull, one wall is adorned with cards and letters from various coaches — a not-too-subtle reminder of why players come to this forested campus not far from the Alabama state line.E.M.C.C. could be called the Alabama of junior colleges. It has won three of the past four National Junior College Athletic Association championships. A two-year college, it has a simple sales pitch: It is a springboard, no matter whether you were rising or falling when you arrived. (After De’Andre Johnson, a Florida Mr. Football, was seen on video slapping a woman at a nightclub and was dismissed from Florida State’s team, Trickett helped persuade him to enroll at E.M.C.C. Johnson, a quarterback, hopes to play next season.)Trickett is here because the program is a springboard not only for players. With his playing résumé and family ties — besides his father, his brother Travis is Samford’s offensive coordinator, and his brother Chance is Louisiana Tech’s recruiting director — he probably could have scored a graduate assistant job at a large Division I program. But the notion of jumping immediately into a role with more responsibility appealed to him.And E.M.C.C. is a welcome place for a coach who values football’s intrinsic toughness. Inside its stadium is a statue of the college’s former coach Bob Sullivan, whom Sports Illustrated labeled “the toughest coach there ever was.” In that article, Frank Deford reported that Sullivan’s teams of the 1950s and 1960s were the last in the country to use leather helmets.Football and America have come a long way since then, but in places like Scooba, and in football-loving families like Trickett’s, negotiating the line between health and grit can be complex. For as long as he coaches here, Trickett said, he will be looking for the type of player he was while taking seriously his responsibilities as a steward of these young men’s futures.“You want a guy who’s going to be a competitor and want to be out there,” Trickett said.He added, “I’m not saying I want a guy who’s not going to tell me if he has a concussion, but a guy who’s going to want to not leave the field.”A version of this article appears in print on November 20, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Retired, but Never Quitting.
