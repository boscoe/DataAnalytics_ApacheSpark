Rams (4-6) at Bengals (8-2)1 p.m. Line: Bengals by 10There is no such thing as a good loss, but having a senseless penalty play a big factor in a defeat has to make the sting that much harder to take. On Monday night, before a prime-time audience, the Bengals stormed back against the Cardinals and had tied the game, but as quarterback Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense worked their way into field-goal range, they got a huge boost when Domata Peko, a defensive tackle for Cincinnati, was penalized for calling out a fake snap count. The free yardage helped set up a winning field goal for Arizona and gave the Bengals their second consecutive loss after starting the season 8-0.After the game, the Bengals were furious about the call, and they may carry some of that emotion into this week. The pieces are all there for Cincinnati to be a top team, but how well they deal with adversity should offer a clue as to how serious they should be taken as a Super Bowl contender.Pick: BengalsWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
