When the winner of the New York City Marathon crosses the finish line on Sunday, some of the slowest finishers are likely to be running their third miles, just inside Brooklyn.
With 50,000 runners in 2014, there were far too many participants to begin the race all at once. As runners were sent off in waves, some moved faster and some slowed down, causing the field to mix and even out over time. At the front, elite runners break away and get far ahead of the pack.The first year the New York marathon used waves was in 2008, when the field was divided in three. Until then, the average time it took for a runner to run from the start line to the finish line, known as the net time or chip time, tracked closely with the gun time, which is the time from the first start signal until a runner crosses the finish line.Since the marathon started setting off in waves, average net time has remained steady while average gun time has gotten longer, meaning more people are on the course later in the day.In the first New York City Marathon, there were only 55 finishers, and none were women. Since then, the participation rate for women has steadily climbed to about 40 percent.Connie Brown, 71, has run in 36 of the marathons, the most of any woman in New York City Marathon history. She has not missed one since her start in 1978, when fewer than 10 percent of finishers were women.That was also the year the Olympian Grete Waitz ran her first New York City Marathon. She came in first, and went on to win eight more times after that, taking home more wins than anyone else and setting three world records in the process.BrazilCanadaUnited States2.7%Venez.48 percent of all runnersin last 10 marathonsArg.PeruCol.Mexico1.8%Japan1.4%SpainIrelandGermanyItalyFranceChina5.4%7%6.7%AustraliaDenmarkSwitzer-landBritainNorwayNetherlandsSweden5.9%3.9%SouthAfricaBelgiumFranceUnited States7%48 percent of all runnersin last 10 marathonsItaly6.7%Britain5.9%Germany5.4%Netherlands3.9%SwitzerlandSpainSwedenIrelandNorwayMexicoCanadaDenmarkBelgium1.8%2.7%BrazilArg.Col.JapanAustraliaSouthAfricaChina1.4%ChileVenezuelaPeruThe United States has had, by far, the most participants in the marathon. But the race is also a big draw internationally: In the past 10 marathons, about half of finishers ran for another country.France, Italy and the United Kingdom have had the most finishers outside the United States. Canadians, who have the shortest commute, are down at No. 6. Europe and North America account for 92 percent of all runners.An American has not won the marathon since 2009, when Meb Keflezighi, a 2004 Olympic silver medalist who was born in Eritrea, finished in 2 hours 9 minutes 15 seconds. The last winner born in the United States was 30 years before that, when Bill Rodgers won in 1979.Keflezighi is a Californian; the last time a New Yorker even cracked the top 10 was when Gordon Bloch took sixth place in the 1992 marathon.Participants in the marathon have run the gamut from 8-year-old Wesley Paul, who ran the marathon in 1977 in 3 hours and 31 seconds, to 93-year-old Josef Galia. In 1981 the official minimum age was set to 16. It increased to 18 in 1988.While most runners are ages 20 to 50, there are big spikes at milestone ages like 40 and 50.Most of the racers you see in the marathon are not the elite runners. The fastest pack in the New York City Marathon starts earlier, runs faster and rocks coveted low-number bibs.The elite runners are closer in age to 30 than to 40, largely from another country and run about two hours faster on average than everyone else.The great mass of runners behind them are closer to 40 than to 30, mostly men and mostly from the United States. Every once in a while, though, someone in that pack beats their lower-bibbed cohorts, like the Brazilian Jovadir Acedo, who took 18th place in 2013.The New York City Marathon is not the race you want to run to set a world record. In contrast to other marathons, like Berlin’s, the course in New York City has not changed significantly since 1976. No men’s world record has been set on this course, and the last women’s world record was set by Grete Waitz in 1980.Running time02:40Grete Waitz from Norway set world records in 1978, 1979 and 1980.Fastest women inNew York City marathon02:3002:20Women world recordsFastest men inNew York City marathon02:10Two world records set in 1981 were disputed because the course was 151 meters too short.Men world records02:0019801985199019952000200520102014Running timeGrete Waitz from Norway set world records in 1978, 1979 and 1980.02:40Fastest women inN.Y.C. marathon02:30Women’s worldrecords02:20Fastest men inN.Y.C. marathon02:10Men’s worldrecords02:001980’85’90’95’00’05’10’14Source: New York Road Runners (NYRR)Advertisement
