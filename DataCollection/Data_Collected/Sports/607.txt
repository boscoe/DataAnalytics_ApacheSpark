Colts at Texans 8:25 p.m., Eastern time, CBSQuarterback  Andrew Luck and Matt Hasselbeck (IND) — The Texans rank 11th against the pass, having allowed an average of 238 passing yards per game, but have yielded the eighth most fantasy points (22.7 F.P.P.G.).AdvertisementLuck returned to practice this week and expects to play, but both he and Hasselbeck, who was 30 of 47 for 282 yards and one touchdown against Jacksonville last week, are listed as questionable. If Luck plays, start him with confidence.Advertisement“If I’m playing, I do not expect to be hindered,” Luck told reporters Tuesday.UPDATE: Luck will not start Thursday night for the Colts. Hasselbeck will. This is obviously not good news for any Colts receiver, but Hasselbeck can still be a servicable QB2 for the desperate.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

T.J. Yeldon managed 105 yards on 22 carries last week against them. Foster is set up for his first big fantasy performance of 2015.Wide Receiver T.Y Hilton/Donte Moncrief (IND) — Houston held Julio Jones in check (four catches on six targets, 38 yards) last week, but in doing so allowed Leonard Hankerson to drop 103 yards and a score (16 F.P.s). An opposing receiver has managed at least 10 fantasy points against Houston in three straight weeks.DeAndre Hopkins (HOU) — The Colts have allowed the sixth most fantasy points to the position. Hopkins is averaging 14.7 F.P.P.G. and currently ranks as the fifth best wide receiver. He has proved himself to be Texans QB-proof, so start him with no hesitation.Tight End Dwayne Allen/Coby Fleener (IND) — Allen is expected to return this week from his concussion, making Fleener a tough start despite his 83 yards and one touchdown last week.The Sablich Brothers have provided award-winning fantasy football advice for The Times since 2010.
