Masahiro Tanaka threw for 34 minutes on level ground in his first workout of the year at the Yankees’ minor league complex in Tampa. “He looked good,” his teammate Ivan Nova said. “I’m sure he worked really hard. The way he handled it, unbelievable.”Tanaka missed two and a half months last year while rehabilitating a partially torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, managed to avoid surgery and returned for two late-September starts.Signed to a $155 million, seven-year contract, Tanaka was 13-5 with a 2.77 ERA in 20 starts.A version of this brief appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Tanaka Throws in Tampa.
