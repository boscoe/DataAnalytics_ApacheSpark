Matt Williams was the 2014 manager of the year, leading the Washington Nationals to a 96-66 record and a playoff berth.On Monday, he was fired. The contracts of all seven coaches were also not renewed.The dream season of 2014 turned into a nightmare in 2015, as the Nationals were by acclamation the biggest underachievers in baseball.Widely predicted to win its division, or even the World Series, the team led by four and a half games at one point, but collapsed to finish 83-79. Bryce Harper had a Most Valuable Player Award caliber season, and starter Max Scherzer had another fine year, with two no-hitters, but most of the rest of the team underperformed. The team’s $164 million payroll was the sixth highest in the majors.Starting with the team’s division series loss to the San Francisco Giants last fall, Williams’s in-game strategy was frequently second-guessed, most notably his rigid use of the bullpen. The decision to have Anthony Rendon bunt on a 3-1 count against the Mets in early September also drew mockery.AdvertisementThe terrible year reached its nadir on Sept. 27 when Jonathan Papelbon, a closer acquired in midseason just as the team’s fortunes were fading, grabbed Harper by the throat in a dispute over hustle. Papelbon was then sent out to pitch the ninth inning, gave up five runs and lost the game.AdvertisementWilliams initially defended pitching Papelbon, but later backed down, saying he had not been aware of the extent of the fight, though it happened in the dugout.
            I hope Matt Williams wasn't fired by people on the other end of the dugout, because it may take him hours to hear about it.        Williams is not the first manager to be fired so soon after winning a Manager of the Year Award. Joe Girardi was fired by the Marlins after leading a young, low-paid team to a surprising 78-84 record. Six weeks later he was named manager of the year.Williams, a good-hitting third baseman for the Giants, Indians and Diamondbacks from 1987 to 2003, replaced Davey Johnson as Nationals manager before the 2014 season, after a stint as a coach for the Diamondbacks. Even after the playoff loss, his success that year seemed to set him up for a promising career.But after the debacle of 2015, few were surprised that General Manager Mike Rizzo dismissed him Monday. Also going in the clean sweep are the coaches Randy Knorr, Steve McCatty, Rick Schu, Bobby Henley, Tony Tarasco, Matt LeCroy and Mark Weidemaier.A version of this article appears in print on October 6, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Nationals Fire Williams and His Staff.
