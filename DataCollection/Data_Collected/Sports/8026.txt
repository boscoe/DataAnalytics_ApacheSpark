The team will, however, exercise contract options on the veteran linebackers Calvin Pace and Jason Babin.The Jets had until Monday to make a decision on Johnson, whose $500,000 option bonus would have kicked in if he had remained on the roster past that date. Johnson, whom the Jets signed last April, was set to make a base salary of $3.5 million, with a salary-cap hit of about $5.25 million. Johnson, who turns 30 in September, will now cost only around $1.75 million against the cap. Advertisement
