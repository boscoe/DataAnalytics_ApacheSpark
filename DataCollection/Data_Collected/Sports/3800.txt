Steelers (6-4) at Seahawks (5-5)4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 3.5In Thomas Rawls’s college career, which he split between Michigan and Central Michigan, he ran for more than 100 yards in a game only five times in four years. In 10 N.F.L. games, only four of which he has started, Rawls, 22, has done it three times.Last week, he became the sixth-youngest running back since 1960 to run for 200 yards in a game in which he exploded for 209 in a 29-13 victory over San Francisco. He also had a career-high 46 yards receiving, giving him more than 250 yards from scrimmage. Not bad for a player who went undrafted.While Marshawn Lynch is among the best running backs ever to play, Rawls has been the better option for Seattle for much of this season, and he will get a chance to show if he is capable of being the Seahawks’ primary running back after Lynch was forced to undergo surgery for a sports hernia that could keep him out for several weeks.The first test for Rawls as an every-down back will be a Pittsburgh defense that is ranked fifth in the N.F.L. in rushing yards allowed per game and is tied for seventh in fewest yards allowed per rush. Only two running backs — the Ravens’ Justin Forsett and the Chiefs’ Charcandrick West — have topped 100 yards against the Steelers this season, who have allowed just three rushing touchdowns.Rawls seems good enough to challenge the Steelers’ defense, but considering how easily Pittsburgh moved the ball last week despite Ben Roethlisberger’s movement being limited by the use of a padded shoe to protect a sprained left foot, the score may reach a point in which a running back will not be enough to keep Seattle in the game. And if this turns into any sort of shootout, the Steelers, with their outstanding wide receivers, tight ends and running backs, will have the advantage.Pick: SteelersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
