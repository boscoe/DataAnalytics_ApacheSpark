COLLEGE PARK, Md. —  They were undefeated at 30-0 and perhaps under-respected, too, with a low seeding that left them feeling like the oddest underdogs in recent N.C.A.A. tournament memory.But whether disillusioned or motivated, Princeton women’s basketball team had a clean slate to work with on Saturday morning when it resumed one of the winter’s most compelling stories and advanced it into spring.It helped, certainly, having President Obama seated six rows behind the Tigers’ bench, amid a sea of orange. And though he wore a perfectly diplomatic brown sweater, sentimentality had clearly led him to the Xfinity Center. His wife’s niece Leslie Robinson is a freshman forward for the Tigers, who felt touched by the grandeur of it all, beating ninth-seeded Wisconsin-Green Bay, 80-70.Eighth-seeded Princeton (31-0) joined the 1998 Harvard team as the only Ivy League women’s programs to win N.C.A.A. tournament games. The Crimson, as a No. 16 seed, knocked off Stanford that year in a memorable upset. The Tigers’ circumstances are entirely different.AdvertisementThey felt scorned by the N.C.A.A. tournament selection committee’s decision to seed them eighth, despite a No. 13 ranking in the latest top-25 poll, and despite entering the tournament as only the fifth unbeaten midmajor women’s team in history. Coach Courtney Banghart mostly complained about the Tigers’ not being given an opportunity to host early-round games, instead being relegated to Maryland, where they will face the top-seeded Terrapins (31-2) on Monday night.AdvertisementTo Banghart, it was a bothersome slight to midmajor programs in a sport where deep runs by underdogs have practically been reduced to folklore. So the Tigers wore that banner on their sleeve, and the stands were filled with T-shirts beaming “30-0” and “Got Your Six” — the team’s unofficial motto, which refers to a military term for guarding a soldier’s blind spot.“I think this has become America’s team,” Banghart said.The sentiment seemed validated by the president’s appearance, which Banghart tried to keep hidden from her team shortly before the game. The president sat next to his brother-in-law Craig Robinson, a former forward for the Princeton men’s team. Players said it was not difficult to remain focused, although forward Annie Tarakchian joked that she once resisted the urge to point in the president’s direction after making her free throws.“Anytime you have the president in your fan base,” guard Michelle Miller said, “I think you automatically win that contest.”During a frenetic first half, Princeton obliterated Green Bay on the boards, at one point outrebounding the Phoenix, 16-2, while also hitting six of its first eight 3-point attempts to run out to a 27-19 lead. But the Tigers lapsed into a shooting slump toward the end of the half, missing seven of their final nine shots. And five turnovers over the final 5 minutes 15 seconds allowed Green Bay to get back into the game. The Phoenix led, 35-34, at the half.“I don’t think we played well in the first half,” Banghart said. “But they just got better.”Indeed, the Tigers’ defensive energy picked up, and after getting outscored in the paint, 22-10, in the first half, they made a much more concerted effort to get to the hoop. A 1-of-11 drought by Green Bay midway through the second half allowed the Tigers to build momentum, and a 12-point lead, 60-48, with 8:55 remaining.Green Bay’s defense forced 19 turnovers, but the Tigers more than doubled the Phoenix’s output on the glass, 49-22, while holding their opponents to 40.9 percent shooting.AdvertisementGreen Bay had only nine field goals in the half before a layup by Kaili Lukan cut its deficit to 4 points with two minutes remaining.“I thought we got good looks,” Phoenix Coach Kevin Borseth said. “That’s part of the game — we’ve got to be able to make those.”
                Women’s N.C.A.A. bracket.            A steal by Tarakchian with 1:31 left was pivotal, and it led to a layup for Alex Wheatley at the other end to put the Tigers ahead, 73-65. A missed layup by Lukan with 19 seconds remaining ensured that Princeton could begin celebrating.Banghart, coaching in her fifth N.C.A.A. tournament game since arriving at Princeton in 2007, dashed along the bench hugging every player. Players ran into the stands to hug family members, and Banghart did as well, embracing as many people as she could.“It’s something that we’ll remember forever,” she said. “To win a tournament game, it’s not easy against anybody. We knew it was going to be an enormous challenge.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

She acknowledged feeling inordinate pressure to perform.“I know this is a really good story,” Banghart said. “And I didn’t want it to end.”Princeton’s first-year athletic director, Mollie Marcoux, was a varsity soccer and hockey player at Princeton, giving her an empathetic perspective on what it has taken for these Tigers to reach this point.It required a break from practices on Monday and Tuesday for midterms, and a handful of players are still in the middle of finishing their senior theses.“They’re fantastic athletes,” Marcoux said. “You know they’re going to be good students, but do you know how great they are at basketball? I think we proved that today.”But the team has one thing on its mind now: keeping the winning streak rolling.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: As Obama Watches, Princeton Reaches 31-0.
