The court said the First Amendment “forbids government regulators to deny registration because they find the speech likely to offend others.”Writing for the majority, Kimberly A. Moore, a judge on the appeals court, said: “It is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment that the government may not penalize private speech merely because it disapproves of the message it conveys.”The ruling overturned a previous decision by a three-judge panel of the court that had upheld the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s rejection of the band’s application.And it was viewed as a something of a victory by the Redskins. “We’re pleased with the decision,” said Lisa Blatt, a partner at Arnold & Porter who is part of the Redskins’ legal team.The decision is being closely watched for its implications in the team’s higher-profile case, in which it is attempting to reverse the trademark agency’s cancellation of the six registered trademarks to the Redskins name.The Redskins, who have rejected calls by Native American groups and President Obama to change the name, have made similar arguments in court as the band’s, that the government could not decide what names would offend others. The frontman for the band, Simon Shiao Tam, said in court filings that the band chose the name to undercut slurs about Asian-Americans that band members heard in childhood, not to promote them.The continued registration of their trademarks is largely a symbolic issue for the Redskins — as is their legal battle to keep from losing them, nearly 50 years after getting one for the first time.Winning the case, in the team’s view, carries benefits in its public relations campaign asserting that the name is not offensive, and that it has the right to continue to use it.As a legal matter, a trademarked name, like the Redskins, or a slogan, like Nike’s “Just Do It,” does not have to be registered, but doing so provides various benefits. They include a central place to inform others that the trademarks exist; the ability to sue infringers of the trademark in federal court; and the right to have the United States Customs Office police the importing of infringing goods.Legal experts said the Federal Circuit’s ruling could be considered, but not necessarily followed, by the appellate court for the Fourth Circuit, which is hearing the Redskins’ appeal of the government’s pending withdrawal of their trademark protection.“The Fourth Circuit could say the Federal Circuit is prestigious but we’re not bound by their precedent,” said Jane Shay Wald, partner emeritus at Irell & Manella in Los Angeles. “It can say, ‘We don’t agree with what you said.’ ”If the Fourth Circuit’s ruling is the opposite of the Federal Circuit’s, the Supreme Court will probably have to resolve the constitutional issue.“The Supreme Court’s job, among others, is to determine constitutional questions and try to promote harmony among the different parts of the United States,” Ms. Wald said.Still, Tuesday’s ruling was considered a major one in trademark law — the striking down of a provision of the nearly 70-year-old Lanham Act that deals with disparaging or offensive trademarks.“The majority opinion is a very broad rejection of the proposition that the federal government can refuse registration or use of a trademark based on whether certain groups find the mark to be disparaging,” said Jeremy Sheff, a law professor at St. John’s University School of Law who specializes in intellectual property. “It was exactly on that basis that the Redskins’ marks were canceled.”Whatever happens in the appeals court to the Redskins’ registered trademarks, the team’s use of its name is not in jeopardy. Although it symbolizes racism and intolerance to some, and has inspired groups to demand that it be replaced, the Redskins’ owner, Daniel Snyder, has vowed never to drop it. He has fought a public battle to prove the name does not offend all Native Americans. And he has the backing of the N.F.L., which has been paying the costs of defending the trademarks.Advertisement
