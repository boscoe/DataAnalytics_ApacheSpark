But not even Ferrari itself expected to win the second race of the Formula One season, the Malaysian Grand Prix on Sunday, its first victory since the Spanish Grand Prix of 2013.With both superior speed and strategy, the Italian team took the lead after Lap 4 of the 58-lap race and became the first team to beat the dominant Mercedes team on strength alone since the beginning of last year.For Sebastian Vettel, who won the race, the victory came in only his second race for the team he dreamed of racing for since he watched his idol, Michael Schumacher, drive the red car as he peered over the fence at its test track in Fiorano, Italy, as a child when he was there for a go-karting competition.“When I grew up, Michael was my hero,” said Vettel, of the German who is recovering from a head injury suffered while skiing in France more than a year ago, and who won 72 of his record 91 victories for the Ferrari team. “And I speak for all of the kids at the go-kart track at the time in Germany — we were looking up to him and when he turned up every year and to look after us a little bit, it made our lives.” He described Sunday’s victory as “very, very emotional.”It was Vettel’s fourth victory in Malaysia and the 40th of his career, but his first since he won the Brazilian Grand Prix at the end of 2013, the year he took his fourth drivers’ title at the Red Bull team.Last year, Mercedes and its two drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, won 16 of the 19 races, with Hamilton winning the drivers’ title. Two weeks ago, the two Mercedes drivers again came in first and second in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, with Vettel finishing a distant third, and it looked like another predictable season of domination by the German team.But the track in Australia is not typical, and Ferrari’s promise shown at the winter testing was evident at the circuit in Sepang. Hamilton and Rosberg finished second and third. Both said they did not lose race; Ferrari won it.“I gave it everything I could; we did as a team,” said Hamilton, adding of Mercedes: “I knew coming in this weekend they had made a step; I didn’t know how big, but they were obviously too fast for us today.”The Mercedes team director, Toto Wolff, agreed, and suggested that perhaps Mercedes had not been working hard enough after all its success.“It is maybe the wake-up call that we needed,” said Wolff. “It is going to make us work harder.”The Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen suffered a puncture during a small collision at the start of the race, but still managed to finish in fourth position after qualifying in 11th after bad luck during a rainy qualifying session. James Allison, the Ferrari technical director, echoed the work theme as the reason for the team’s resurgence. “It’s straightforward,” said Allison. “Do lots of work for a long time, and the results come.”“Every team works hard, but Ferrari works hard with the weight of history on its shoulders as well, and the weight of expectation of all of Italy,” he added.Ferrari had finished in fourth place in the series last year, a position it had occupied only one other time in the previous 20 years.Last year, the only team and driver to beat Mercedes was the Red Bull team, where Vettel then raced, but it was his teammate Daniel Ricciardo who took the three victories that Mercedes failed to win. But each time it was because of a breakdown or mistakes by the Mercedes drivers, whereas the race in Malaysia was won by clear, if slight, superiority of the Ferrari over the Mercedes.Vettel had started in second position, with Hamilton on pole and Rosberg in third. Vettel took the lead after both of the Mercedes cars, and most of the others, made an early pit stop after the safety car was brought in to neutralize the race when the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson got caught in gravel after Lap 4.It was a smart strategic move that allowed Vettel to stay out longer and build up a lead on his first set of tires. He would make only two pit stops in total, compared with three pit stops by Mercedes and all but one other driver. The Ferrari was also easier on the tires in the extreme heat, with air temperature of 91 degrees and a track temperature of 140, which enabled it to stay out longer and race faster.“They struggled with the heat today more than they expected, and we struggled with the heat less than we expected,” said Vettel, of Mercedes. The Ferrari victory overshadowed a bit of history that was made farther back with the seventh place finish by the Dutch driver Max Verstappen, who, at 17, became the youngest driver ever to score points in a Formula One race, two years younger than the previous record holder, Daniil Kvyat, who is now 20.Advertisement
