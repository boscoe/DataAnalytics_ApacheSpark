COLUMBUS, Ohio —  It took Oklahoma 35 minutes to realize it was bigger and taller than Dayton. Once it finally did, the No. 3-seeded Sooners fended off the 11th-seeded Flyers, 72-66, on Sunday night at Nationwide Arena to advance to the round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. tournament. They will play Michigan State, the No. 7 seed, on Friday in Syracuse.After trailing for much of the second half, Oklahoma clamped down on defense and overpowered its smaller opponents to pull away late in the game. “I think everybody just locked down and took care of their assignments,” said TaShawn Thomas, the 6-foot-8, 242-pound senior forward who seemed to best embody his team’s considerable advantage in size.The Sooners survived two costly cold spells and a raucous pro-Flyers crowd that jeered them during pregame introductions. The sophomore guard Jordan Woodard led Oklahoma with 16 points, and Buddy Hield, the Sooners’ star guard and the Big 12 player of the year, scored 15 points and had a critical block in the final minute of the game that seemed to sap Dayton’s waning spirits.“He put the ball right in front of me, so I just blocked it,” Hield said, referring to the Dayton freshman guard Darrell Davis.AdvertisementWoodard added, “He made a hustle play, winning play for us down the stretch.”Meanwhile, Dayton — for whom the game was the third in five days, although all of the games were on its campus or about an hour’s drive away — wobbled, wavered and finally cracked in its attempt at a late comeback. The Flyers, who have fielded a roster with six scholarship players this season, played down the role of fatigue. “We don’t get tired,” said Scoochie Smith, a sophomore guard. “We’re still not tired. Won’t be tired.”AdvertisementBut Coach Archie Miller said fatigue had complicated matters against the bruising Sooners.“I think, to start the game, our legs weren’t under us,” he said.Indeed, Oklahoma opened the contest with a barrage of 3-pointers; their first 15 points were on five long balls. They raced out to a 9-point lead, and it looked as if they might run the Flyers out of an arena draped in red and blue.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Still, Jordan Sibert, a senior guard and the Flyers’ captain, kept a blowout at bay as he ducked and dodged defenders while trying to will his team back into game. So did Smith, a point guard, who tried his best to steady a frazzled club on defense.But the Sooners stayed hot early. They made seven 3-pointers in the first 12 minutes of the game. Their passes around the perimeter were crisp. And when Dayton had an answer away from the basket, the Sooners’ size underneath bruised the smaller Flyers.There was a turning point midway through the first half, though, when Dayton switched to a feisty zone defense that seemingly befuddled the dominating Sooners.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

On offense, Sibert and Smith — who combined for 17 points in the first half — led a furious charge that chipped away at the deficit. The Flyers trailed by 34-32 at halftime, but hope abounded inside an arena full of Flyers fans who had “taken over Columbus,” as Miller put it.That flood of momentum carried over into the second half as the Flyers leapt in the air for rebounds and dived on the floor for loose balls. “I did think we fought hard to get back,” Miller said. “And I think the rest of the game was much more like ourselves.”In particular, Dayton was lifted by Davis, a skinny, 6-foot-4, 168-pound guard who scored 15 points and made five 3-pointers. The Flyers surged ahead by as much as 9 points with 13 minutes to play as the crowd’s cheers pulsed through the stands.AdvertisementAfter Davis feathered in his third and fourth long balls of the night, he backpedaled, howled and pointed at the court with his index finger as if to remind Oklahoma they were surrounded by a crowd that was decidedly against them.But not even that was enough to will Dayton past the Sooners, who held the Flyers scoreless for almost 10 minutes in the second half.“We just trusted each other,” Thomas said. “We made some big-time plays."Lon Kruger, the Oklahoma coach, added, “I think the key is to calm down and stay poised.”A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Oklahoma Outmatches Feisty Dayton.
