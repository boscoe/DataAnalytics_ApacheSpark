WELLINGTON, New Zealand — When New Zealand Coach Steve Hansen suggested in the middle of the Six Nations that rugby was in danger of becoming boring with its showcase World Cup just months away, most people would have agreed with him.Up until the final weekend of Europe’s premier tournament, the games were lacking in both excitement and tries.It took a chaotic Super Saturday, when the Six Nations championship was decided on the final day on points differential, to bring the teams into life.Wales, Ireland, England and France knew they needed to score tries to win the trophy, and none held back. A total of 27 tries were scored in a 221-point blitz across the three matches. Ireland ended up as champion.AdvertisementThe Six Nations has resisted adding bonus points for scoring four tries or more in a game, something done in both the major Southern Hemisphere competitions — Super Rugby and the Rugby Championship.AdvertisementIf the Six Nations did embrace the concept of extra points for scoring tries, then the free-flowing, attacking rugby seen regularly in the Southern Hemisphere could become a staple in the north.Hansen, whose All Blacks team will defend its World Cup title in England later this year, may have made his comments to stoke the flames before the Cup. He is a coach who is not afraid to use mind games to unsettle opponents.But he did have a point. Fans will not want to watch endless kick-and-chase tactics or scrum resets at the World Cup; they will want to be entertained.The final round of the Six Nations showed that a usually more conservative team like Ireland — and to a lesser extent England and Wales — can turn on the creativity when it has to, but more often it chooses the safer route.New Zealand, Australia and increasingly South Africa are more ambitious on attack and prefer to play more with the ball in hand or take a more aggressive approach with their kicking games.Hansen also said that getting a “positive” attitude from coaches and players was critical to ensuring that the messier aspects of rugby — the breakdown after a player is tackled and the scrums — were cleaned up. By that he meant that teams needed to stop looking at using negative tactics, often involving rule infractions, to get an advantage in those two areas.At the breakdown, those tactics include entering a ruck — when players of both teams are contesting for ball possession after a tackle — from an offside position or a player leaving his feet to illegally slow the attacking team.AdvertisementIn many situations, kicking becomes the first option, because it is safer than giving away a penalty or losing possession while trying to run the ball back at the opposition. But it is also less entertaining.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
