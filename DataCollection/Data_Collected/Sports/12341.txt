BOSTON —  A little more than 12 hours after Alex Rodriguez tied Willie Mays for fourth on baseball’s career home run list, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman made it clear that the team would not be paying him a bonus for doing so.“We have the right but not the obligation to do something,” Cashman said to reporters before Saturday’s 4-2 win over the Red Sox. “And that’s it. It’s not ‘you do this, you get that.’ ”With that assertion, Cashman became the first team executive to acknowledge publicly what the Yankees have said privately for months: They have no intention of paying Rodriguez $6 million in exchange for the rights to market his home run feat, a payment that would also come with a 50 percent penalty because the team is already over the luxury-tax threshold.“I think I’ve clarified it,” Cashman said when asked point-blank if the team would be giving Rodriguez the bonus.AdvertisementRodriguez dressed in an auxiliary room after Saturday’s game and left the clubhouse without speaking to reporters. He has generally avoided answering questions about thorny issues, particularly his past drug use or the bonuses in connection with his moves up the home run list.But as he spoke with reporters before Friday’s game, he indicated that he was not likely to contest his case in the court of public opinion.Advertisement“I’ve learned my lesson,” Rodriguez said. “I’m doing things a different way now. I know those things will work themselves out.”Outfielder Brett Gardner, the longest-tenured Yankee after Rodriguez, said Saturday that he did not expect the matter of the bonus to be divisive.“He doesn’t seem too worried about it,” Gardner said. “His locker is right next to mine, and that’s not something he seems to be too worried about, so I’m not going to be worried about it, either. He’s going to stay focused on what he’s got to do on the field, and we’re hopefully going to keep playing well together and have a good year.”If Rodriguez’s return from a forced sabbatical has been a series of minor miracles — nearing 40, he is still able to hit home runs and play occasionally in the field without injury or embarrassment — the greatest one may be that he has not brought a circus with him.The player who embarked on a scorched-earth campaign against the Yankees toward the end of 2013 season has thus far been an upstanding clubhouse citizen.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            “He’s said all the right things, he’s going about his business in all the right ways, and obviously he’s performing on the field for us and helping us win games,” Cashman said. “That’s all we’ve ever wanted.”AdvertisementLess than two years ago, as Cashman stood at Fenway Park, he characterized his interactions with Rodriguez as “hello, goodbye and that’s it because anything else, I don’t want to be distorted, to be quite honest.”On Friday night, Cashman was in the clubhouse congratulating Rodriguez on his 660th home run, the one with which he tied Mays.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In both cases, we’re honoring the contract.”Asked if Rodriguez felt the same way, Cashman said, “I have no idea.”The Yankees have argued that Rodriguez’s suspension last year — he had to sit out the whole season for using performance-enhancing drugs — undermined their ability to market the milestones. If Rodriguez disputes the Yankees’ interpretation of the deal, the players’ union could file a grievance.“The union is prepared to intervene on Alex’s behalf,” the spokesman Greg Bouris said in an email.Cashman said: “The great thing about contracts, if there’s any dispute, there’s mechanisms for anybody who has any misunderstanding or misinterpretation; there’s procedures in place to have people determine if there is any misunderstanding. We don’t believe there is any misunderstanding.”There was no misunderstanding on the part of Red Sox fans. Rodriguez was booed vociferously again Saturday. The man who caught Rodriguez’s home run ball Friday, identified by The New York Post as Mike Shuster, a 25-year-old financial adviser from Warwick, R.I., refused to give the ball to Rodriguez.AdvertisementEddie Fastook, the Yankees’ executive director for security, made his way into the stands when Rodriguez stepped into the on-deck circle. When Shuster caught the home run ball, Fastook and Red Sox officials quickly reached him. He was offered bats and jerseys from either team but declined.Fastook said the only time that someone had refused to exchange a ball was in 2013, when two fans at Yankee Stadium secured the ball from Ben Francisco’s first home run as a Yankee. He has not hit one in the major leagues since.Inside PitchThe Yankees right-hander Ivan Nova on Saturday pitched in his first game since having elbow ligament replacement surgery a year ago. He allowed an infield hit and struck out one in one and a third innings in an extended spring training game, throwing 18 pitches. He appears on schedule to be back in June.
