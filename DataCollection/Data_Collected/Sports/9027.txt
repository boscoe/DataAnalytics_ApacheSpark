Driscoll said she and Busch argued in the bedroom of the motor home before he grabbed her by the face and neck and slammed her head against a wall three times.But Driscoll did not file charges until early November. She testified that she feared the incident might affect a continuing child custody battle with her former husband in Maryland.Driscoll filed for a no-contact order in November, which was the subject of four days of hearings in December and January. During the family court hearing, Busch and others testified that Driscoll made far-fetched claims of being a covert operative for the federal government and a trained assassin.Despite granting the no-contact order, a family court commissioner said Driscoll had presented false testimony that conflicted with that of a chaplain who saw her immediately after the alleged assault and said he saw no marks or bruises on her. The judge nevertheless said he did not believe Driscoll’s false testimony amounted to perjury or intentional falsehood.The judge also concluded that Busch did not appear to be a prototypical batterer who uses violence to subjugate or control, but that the incident instead was most likely a ”situational” event in which Busch was unable to cope and to control his tendency to act out violently in response to stress and frustration, causing him to ”snap.”Busch’s lawyers have asked the family court commissioner to reopen the hearing.Advertisement
