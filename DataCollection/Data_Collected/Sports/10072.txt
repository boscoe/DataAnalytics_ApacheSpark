CHARLOTTE, N.C. —  Mike Krzyzewski knows as well as anyone what it takes to win a college basketball national championship. He already has four. Could this be the team that brings No. 5?Although his Duke team is only two games into this year’s N.C.A.A. tournament, he is beginning see the right signs. These Blue Devils might have a shot.“A couple of things — one, we’re healthy — hopefully, we stay healthy,” Krzyzewski said Sunday after his top-seeded Blue Devils made surprisingly quick work of eighth-seeded San Diego State, 68-49, in a South Region round of 32 game at Time Warner Cable Arena. “They’re not mentally tired, they’re not physically tired. They’re together. We have talent. We’re getting older by experience.“It’s a young group of kids that have really had a great season, and they still want to get better. So you’ve got a chance — we’ve got a chance.”AdvertisementDuke’s next opponent will be Utah in the round of 16 in Houston. Ultimately, the No. 1 seed and favorite Kentucky is likely to stand in the way if the Blue Devils (31-4) can advance to the final. So there is a long way to go.But if Duke’s future in this tournament depends on its young players, Sunday’s display was a promising sign. Center Jahlil Okafor, projected to be an early first-round draft pick in June, scored 26 points, including 18 in the first half, when the Blue Devils took control of the game. Another freshman, Justise Winslow, added a double-double with 13 points and 12 rebounds. The senior Quinn Cook scored 15 points.“I played against big players before, but I haven’t played against anybody that big with that skill set,” Skylar Spencer, the Aztecs’ 6-foot-10 forward, said after defending Okafor.Okafor was coming off a solid 21-point performance in an 85-56 victory over No. 16 seed Robert Morris on Friday, but he faced the wrath of Krzyzewski during that game when he showboated a reverse dunk in the second half and missed it. Robert Morris went on to close to within 10 points before Duke pulled away.There were no slips for Okafor against San Diego State (27-9). And maybe he had a better sense of the intensity needed in this tournament. At one point in the first half against the Aztecs, he finished a fast break with an emphatic dunk, punching his fist into the air and clapping his hands as he went back on defense. The basket gave Duke a 24-11 lead with 7 minutes 53 seconds to go before halftime.AdvertisementAsked what he had learned from Friday’s victory, he said: “Just the game’s never over. We had a huge lead with Robert Morris and they cut it down to 10, and we kind of felt the pressure of that game and we learned that from this game and we never let up. The entire game we stayed together, we kept competing.”It wasn’t quite over even after Duke built a double-digit lead against San Diego State, either. When Malik Pope made two 3-pointers, the Aztecs were able to pull within 44-37 with 12:42 to go. The run was short-lived, though. Duke restored its lead to double digits with a 3 by Cook with 11:58 remaining, and the Blue Devils slowly pulled away.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “Okafor is a load, he’s hard to guard,” San Diego State Coach Steve Fisher said. “I think we gave him two, three, four that were too easy, but he’s good. He’s very, very talented. And again, he’s not the Lone Ranger. Winslow can play. They’ve got a terrific team, and they played like a No. 1 seed today.”Winston Shepard had 13 points to lead San Diego State, which had entered Sunday second in Division I in scoring defense (53.5 points per game) but had struggled on offense throughout the season. The Aztecs shot 32.8 percent from the field against Duke, which earned its 14th win in 15 games. Fisher acknowledged after the game that several members of the team and their families had come down with illness, although he said that had nothing to do with the loss.The last time Krzyzewski and Fisher had met in the tournament was the 1992 championship game, when the Blue Devils beat Michigan’s Fab Five, coached by Fisher, for the national title.Asked to compare Duke’s freshman crop, including the starting point guard Tyus Jones and the reserve guard Grayson Allen, with the Fab Five, Fisher said: “They’re very, very good. I don’t like to compare anything, but they are a talented, well-coached group that compete hard, and that’s what you have to do, no matter whether you’re a freshman or a senior. But they’re very, very good.”Of course, the Fab Five never won a national title. Can Duke’s four freshmen pull it off? We’ll see.A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Jahlil Okafor Helps Duke Cruise Past San Diego State.
