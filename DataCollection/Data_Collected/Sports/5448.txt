8:30 p.m., ESPNLine: Broncos by 3Two of the best teams in the A.F.C. playing in a prime-time game in the second-to-last week of the season should be among the most anticipated games of the year, but with A. J. McCarron and Brock Osweiler filling in for Andy Dalton and Peyton Manning, the excitement has been ratcheted down.That discredits each team’s defense. The Bengals have allowed 17.4 points a game, and the Broncos are just behind them at 18.5, numbers that will increase the pressure on the young backup quarterbacks.Osweiler has performed well while learning on the job, and he is certainly further along in his development than McCarron, but Denver has been outscored, 36-0, during the second half of its past three games. So even if the Broncos build an early lead, the Bengals cannot be counted out.Pick: BroncosBENJAMIN HOFFMANA version of this article appears in print on December 28, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Bengals (11-3) at Broncos (10-4).
