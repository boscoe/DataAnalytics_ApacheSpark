The problem is, those events are scheduled to be contested 75 minutes apart.To facilitate Felixâ€™s pursuit, USA Track and Field recently petitioned the governing body of the sport to amend the Olympic track program, which currently has the 200 preliminaries taking place just over an hour before the 400 final on Aug. 15.Felix, a six-time Olympic medalist, will not be deterred, though, should the rescheduling not happen. She still plans to try to make the United States squad in both events at the Olympic trials in July. Advertisement
