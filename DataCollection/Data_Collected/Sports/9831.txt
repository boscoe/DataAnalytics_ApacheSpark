Nephawe, a South African, anchors a hulking front line for the No. 15-seeded Aggies (23-10), the Western Athletic Conference champions who often dominate teams inside.Facing second-seeded Kansas in an intriguing Midwest Region first round game Friday, Nephawe expects nothing different, especially from himself.“I think I’m bigger and stronger than everybody,” Nephawe said, “so I think I will have an advantage over them.”The Aggies go 6-10, 6-9, and 6-8 across the front with Nephawe, the redshirt freshman Pascal Siakam and the senior Remi Barry. Their height and signature 3-2 zone defense could pose matchup problems for guard-oriented Kansas (26-8), especially with the top forward and leading scorer Perry Ellis recovering from a right knee sprain. Baylor usesd a similar zone in the Big 12, and Kansas won all three meetings with the Bears in this season.“I think it’s important we attack whatever defense we’re in right from the outset as opposed to kind of waiting to go see how it’s played,” Kansas Coach Bill Self said.Kansas fans hate being reminded of their team’s opening weekend, bracket-busting losses under Self — to Stanford last year, Northern Iowa in 2010, and Bucknell and Bradley back-to-back in 2005 and 2006. Plus, a loss Friday would wreck a potential intrastate matchup with Wichita State in the second round. The teams have not played since 1993.The 28-4 Shockers, of course, could losinge to Indiana (20-13) on Friday. Both teams did their best to deflect questions about it.“We’re doing our thing right now trying to beat the team that wears the red and white, not the blue, red and white,” Wichita State Coach Gregg Marshall said.Advertisement
