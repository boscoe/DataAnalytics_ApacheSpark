The Ducks play Ohio State in the College Football Playoff championship game on Monday in Arlington, Tex.Carrington, a redshirt freshman, made his first career start in the Ducks’ victory over Arizona in the Pacific-12 title game, finishing with seven catches for 126 yards and a touchdown.He also had seven catches for 166 yards and two touchdowns in Oregon’s Rose Bowl victory over Florida State on Jan. 1.Not having Carrington leaves the Ducks without two key wide receivers against Ohio State.Last week Oregon lost a redshirt freshman, Devon Allen, on the opening kickoff with a knee injury. Allen had 41 catches for 684 yards and seven touchdowns.The Ducks have also played the last four games without tight end Pharoah Brown, who went down with a season-ending leg injury against Utah.That leaves Oregon, which regularly uses three- and four-receiver formations, with Byron Marshall (66 catches for 834 yards), Dwayne Stafford (39 for 578), Keanon Lowe (25 for 359) and the freshman Charles Nelson (11 for 101) to rely on at wideout.Advertisement
