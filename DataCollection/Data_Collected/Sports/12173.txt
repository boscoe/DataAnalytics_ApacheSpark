Once it used to be older players looking for a decent lift to their retirement funds at the end of their international careers. Now players have barely started their international careers before they are off.Unable to match the staggering amounts being offered for their players by rich French, Irish and Japanese clubs, the big three Southern Hemisphere countries have had to change their approaches to player retention and selection.South Africa was the first to change its eligibility rules to allow overseas-based players to be available for Springboks selection.New Zealand muddied the waters with the option of “sabbaticals” for its most important and experienced players to keep them in the country. The players remained eligible to play for the All Blacks but were granted time off either to rest or to take a short stint at an overseas club. The star flyhalf Dan Carter was the first recipient in 2009 when he negotiated a sabbatical to join the French club Perpignan for six months.Since then other veteran players, including All Blacks captain Richie McCaw, Ma’a Nonu and Conrad Smith, have used their sabbaticals to take extended breaks or play in Japan.But New Zealand Rugby Union’s chief executive, Steve Tew, has said repeatedly that the selection criteria for the All Blacks will not change so as not to dilute the quality of domestic rugby, so players must be playing in New Zealand to be eligible.It means fringe All Blacks like Colin Slade, who will join the French club Pau for a reported 800,000 New Zealand dollars, or about $616,000 per season, later this year, and Charles Piutau, who will join the Irish provincial team Ulster in the European Pro12 league for about 1 million New Zealand dollars a season, will no longer be able to represent the All Blacks, once they shift overseas.Australia, until this month, had also stood firm, offering no opportunity to play abroad and still represent the Wallabies.But with a talent pool that is much shallower than those of either its trans-Tasman neighbor or its South African rival, a less well-established domestic competition and players leaving in droves, the Australian Rugby Union has done a back flip.First came the announcement that New South Wales Waratahs flyhalf Bernard Foley had been granted a three-year “flexible contract” that would allow him to play in Japan for two seasons while also still playing Super Rugby for the Waratahs and internationally for the Wallabies.Then last week the A.R.U. announced that overseas-based players who have played 60 test matches for the Wallabies and who have had a contract with the A.R.U. for at least seven years can play international rugby again.In addition, players wishing to return to Super Rugby in Australia would also immediately be available for the Wallabies if they signed a two-year deal.Currently only three players meet that 60-test, seven-year standard — utility back Matt Giteau and winger Drew Mitchell at Toulon and openside flanker George Smith at Lyon. All are now available for this year’s Rugby Championship and World Cup.Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has been one of the driving forces behind the change and said having a threshold was important.“Sixty caps is not easy to get to, and you must have really, really given to Australian rugby, and with that in mind we feel almost like you’ve earned your stripes,” he said.“We are not expecting anyone to say, ‘Well I’m getting over 60 caps and off I go.’ It’s part of a wider strategy around getting our top-up funding right and making sure we are getting the right players, and our world-class players can be paid accordingly to stay in Australia.”Cheika has no sympathy for any player choosing to leave Australian rugby who failed to meet the criteria. “They can stay and play in Australia,” he said.Sekope Kepu (52 tests), James Horwill (58) and Will Genia (58) have all confirmed moves to Europe after the World Cup, while Quade Cooper (53), who is currently injured, is believed to be close to signing a deal with Toulon.They will have only a shortened Rugby Championship and the World Cup to hit the 60-test mark.Others who are leaving, such as Peter Betham (two) and Nic White (19), have no chance of reaching that mark.Cheika, who is also head coach of the Waratahs, does not expect any resentment from those who turned down the big money being offered to stay in Australia and fight for a place in his team.“I don’t think anyone in Australia is going to complain about having a better national team,” he said. “When I was playing, I always wanted to play for Australia and I had to play behind Tim Gavin. He was being selected and I would go ‘he’s better than me and Australia is going to be a better team for that.’ So you can’t complain.”“That’s the nature of rugby,” he added. “Sometimes you’re in and sometimes you’re out.”Cheika has not spoken to Giteau, Mitchell or Smith since the announcement. But being able to select Giteau, in particular, is a huge plus for the Wallabies coach ahead of the World Cup, and the player was no doubt in the back of his mind as he pushed for change.Giteau can play flyhalf, inside center and in a pinch scrumhalf. He has played 92 tests for Australia and was the 2014 European player of the year.Waratahs openside flanker Michael Hooper, the current Wallabies captain, who will vie for selection against Australia-based rivals David Pocock, Liam Gill and now possibly also Smith, backed the changes.“I think it’s a good step forward,” Hooper said. “The fact is, you still have to be playing really good rugby overseas and then you have to get picked. You have to still be liked by the head coach. You can’t just go over and be having a holiday and get picked in the team. That’s what’s really good about the rules that have been put in place.”Of more concern for Cheika and Daryl Gibson, who will take over from Cheika at the Waratahs next year, are the flexible contracts and what the toll of playing rugby 12 months of the year will have on performance.By the time Foley’s contract ends, he will have played nonstop rugby for virtually four years.While the flyhalf is confident he can deliver for all his teams during that period, Cheika is less sure.“There is a player welfare issue around playing all year round,” Cheika said. “I’m not a massive fan of that, to be honest with you, because we want maximum performance.“There is no point having players playing for Australia if they are not ready to play at their best.”While Gibson understands the rationale behind flexible contracting he doesn’t want it to become the norm. Players juggling Super Rugby with playing in Japan would miss the Super Rugby preseason, which would hamper that year’s campaign.‘‘I’d be loath to set a limit, but certainly I wouldn’t want more than five players up there in Japan doing that,’’ he said. “It has a destabilizing effect.‘‘But if we want to keep players and one of the ways we can do that is giving them a sabbatical in Japan, then we do it. But, in my experience, players coming back from Japan either come back in really good condition or in need of a rest.’’Advertisement
