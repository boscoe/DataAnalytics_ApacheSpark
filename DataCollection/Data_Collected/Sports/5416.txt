At the beginning of the season, it was ferocious and led the league in fewest rushing yards allowed, but it has slowly slipped to 21st in run defense. Meanwhile, Adrian Peterson has regained his title as the N.F.L.’s premier running back, leading the league with 1,314 yards entering the weekend. If Peterson and the Vikings can force the Giants’ defense to stack the box, the already-depleted safeties and linebackers will be picked apart by the improving Teddy Bridgewater.NUMBER TO WATCH: 13That is Odell Beckham Jr.’s number, as well as the number of receiving touchdowns he has hauled in this year. His presence will be sorely missed, and it will be up to one of the reserve or lesser-known Giants receivers to get open for quarterback Eli Manning.QUOTATION OF THE WEEK:‘That guy breaks everything. You look on film, and it looks like he’s going to get tackled for a loss, and all of sudden he’s up the field for 25 yards. He’s just one of the great backs you’ll ever see.’Giants defensive end JASON PIERRE-PAUL, on Minnesota running back Adrian Peterson.Advertisement
