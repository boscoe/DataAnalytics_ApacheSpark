Packers (6-0) at Broncos (6-0) 8:30 p.m. Line: Packers by 3The only quarterback who seems to give the Broncos’ championship-caliber defense consistent trouble is Peyton Manning. He may wear the same color jersey as Von Miller, Brandon Marshall and the rest of the Denver defenders, but Manning has been their worst enemy, with three interceptions returned for touchdowns accounting for 20 of the 102 points allowed by Denver this season. The team’s turnovers have led to 34 points over all, according to SportingCharts.com.The interesting thing about Denver is that if its quarterback were not named Manning, fans would very likely be lining up to praise the team instead of expecting the bottom to drop out.Take away expectations associated with a version of Manning that no longer exists and Denver is a team that has allowed an N.F.L.-low 281.3 yards a game and is second in the league in points allowed, with an average of 17. The Broncos’ rushing game has been almost nonexistent, so they have had to rely on an aerial attack that has produced a lot of yards but also a lot of turnovers, with a net result being a respectable 23.2 points a game. Focus on their defense, rather than their quarterback, and they have the makings of a poor man’s version of the 2002 Tampa Bay Buccaneers or the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, teams that won Super Bowls.November should reveal whether the Denver defense has what it takes to carry the team or if it has been benefiting from subpar competition. The Broncos start the month playing Green Bay and end it playing New England.AdvertisementThe Packers are the team the Broncos envisioned themselves being when the season started. No one is questioning Green Bay’s perfect record. Aaron Rodgers has continued to produce despite numerous injuries to his wide receivers and running backs. The team’s defense is the only one that has been harder to score on than Denver’s, with an average of just 16.8 a game.AdvertisementThere are some cracks in Green Bay’s veneer, with Rodgers having come back to earth a tad since his remarkable Week 3 performance against Kansas City, Eddie Lacy continuing to nurse a sore ankle and a defense that, while excellent, is probably playing over its head. Still, Green Bay has an advantage even on the road.PICK: PACKERSBengals (6-0) at Steelers (4-3) 1 p.m. Line: EvenThe division rivalry between the Steelers and the Bengals has often felt more like bullying, with Pittsburgh always seeming to find an extra gear. But the Andy Dalton who enters Heinz Field on Sunday is not the same player who has gone 2-6 against the Steelers.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The passing efficiency has helped the Bengals score 30.3 points a game, third highest in the N.F.L. behind New England and Arizona.The X-factor is the health of Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who has been out since Week 3 with a strained medial collateral ligament. Despite having some of the best skill players in the game, the Pittsburgh offense has been punchless with Michael Vick and Landry Jones under center. If Roethlisberger is out, or if he is limited enough to be vulnerable to the pass rush, the Bengals should stay unbeaten. But if Roethlisberger plays the way he did before his injury, it may be a far different story.PICK: BENGALSJets (4-2) at Raiders (3-3) 4:05 p.m. Line: Jets by 1The Raiders’ rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper is making an easy transition to the N.F.L. He has surpassed 100 yards receiving in three of his team’s six games and last week became just the fifth player since 1960 to have 500 or more receiving yards in his first six games. He needs 103 yards this week to have the most for a player through seven games, but that will be a difficult task should the Jets choose to cover him with Darrelle Revis.That is just one of the subplots of a game that should engender far more interest than could have been expected before the season. The Jets look rejuvenated under Coach Todd Bowles, and the Raiders are fun to watch for the first time since Rich Gannon took Oakland to Super Bowl XXXVII.The Raiders’ defense has allowed an N.F.L.-worst 303.8 passing yards a game, but it has limited the damage by allowing just 11 touchdown passes while compiling seven interceptions. Opposing quarterbacks have averaged a rating of just 89.2, which leaves Oakland tied for 13th in the league with New England. That could be bad news for Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who has moved the ball well but has a tendency to turn it over at inopportune times.AdvertisementPICK: RAIDERSSeahawks (3-4) at Cowboys (2-4) 4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 6At least the Cowboys have an excuse for their poor play. Their offense is reliant on quarterback Tony Romo and wideout Dez Bryant, and both have been sidelined during a four-game losing streak.Bryant may return this week, but he will be trying to learn the tendencies of a new quarterback, Matt Cassel, and he will do so while being harassed by a Seattle secondary that has given him fits over the years.The Seahawks have been a mess all season, and can no longer blame Kam Chancellor’s two-game holdout, but they were able to maul the 49ers last week, and they face a similarly incompetent opponent this week, so they should get back to .500 even if the win will do nothing to change the minds of doubters.PICK: SEAHAWKSBuccaneers (2-4) at Falcons (6-1) 1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 7 ½It is a good sign if a team does not confuse winning games with playing to its full potential. The Falcons have already matched last season’s victory total, but their play has been sloppy over the last few weeks and Julio Jones clearly noticed.“We are just in a funk,” Jones told reporters last week. “We have to get out of it. We have to keep battling and keep going and keep trying to get better and fix these things.”If Atlanta can solve its recent turnover problems, the offense will be downright scary. Quarterback Matt Ryan and Jones were already among the game’s best tandems, and Devonta Freeman has put himself on the shortlist of the league’s most effective running backs with his 931 yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns, both leading the N.F.L.Tampa Bay is improving, and Jameis Winston has realized that Mike Evans is a formidable weapon, but Louis Murphy is on injured reserve and Vincent Jackson may be out, leaving the Buccaneers without enough offense to keep up.PICK: FALCONSCardinals (5-2) at Browns (2-5) 1 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 4 ½The Cardinals continue to evolve with their suffocating defense no longer carrying the burden for the team’s success. Carson Palmer has continued his late-career resurgence, working effectively with Larry Fitzgerald and John Brown, while Chris Johnson has given Arizona an unexpectedly dangerous running game. Also lurking for opposing defenses is David Johnson, a rookie running back and return specialist who is a threat to score anytime he touches the ball.AdvertisementPICK: CARDINALSGiants (4-3) at Saints (3-4) 1 p.m. Line: Saints by 3Saints games this season have yielded a combined average of 800.8 yards and 49.4 points between New Orleans and its opponents. It should be more of the same this week, with the Giants looking incapable of slowing opposing defenses while relying on turnovers to lead them to victory. The game figures to feature a lot of points, and it may come down to which team makes fewer mistakes. With the way the Saints have played over the last two weeks, they should be able to take care of business at home.PICK: SAINTSLions (1-6) at Chiefs (2-5) 9:30 a.m. Line: Chiefs by 4 ½Matthew Stafford has thrown for 661 yards, six touchdowns and just one interception in the two games since he was benched because of his poor performance in a Week 5 loss to Arizona. But last week the team struggled to keep up with Minnesota, so Jim Bob Cooter was promoted to offensive coordinator in place of the fired Joe Lombardi. The first test of Cooter’s offense will come in London against a tough Kansas City defense, but with the Chiefs missing Jamaal Charles and possibly Jeremy Maclin, the Lions could win for the second time in three weeks after opening the season 0-5.PICK: LIONS49ers (2-5) at Rams (3-3) 1 p.m. Line: Rams by 9 ½The 49ers have struggled in many areas, but none more so than on the offensive line, which has failed to protect quarterback Colin Kaepernick to the tune of 25 sacks. On the road in St. Louis, it could get worse. The Rams are third in the N.F.L. with 23 sacks, eight and a half of them from the tandem of Aaron Donald and Robert Quinn.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            “Colin’s our quarterback, no controversies,” Coach Jim Tomsula told reporters last week when asked if he would consider a change.Tomsula’s confidence in his choice may come from no one else’s being willing to line up under center and get hit so often.PICK: RAMSVikings (4-2) at Bears (2-4) 1 p.m. Line: EvenAlshon Jeffery, quarterback Jay Cutler’s favorite wide receiver, will be back for Chicago. But the Minnesota defense is one of the stingiest in the N.F.L. Chicago’s defense has proved relatively easy to score against, and it is riddled with injuries. That combination could help the Vikings end a seven-game road losing streak against the Bears.PICK: VIKINGSChargers (2-5) at Ravens (1-6) 1 p.m. Line: Ravens by 3Philip Rivers is on pace to shatter the N.F.L. record for passing yards in a season, and he has thrown 209 passes in the last four games alone. The Ravens have been soft against the pass, allowing an average of 283 yards through the air, and Rivers should only build on his league-leading totals.PICK: CHARGERSTitans (1-5) at Texans (2-5) 1 p.m. Line: EvenIn two games against similarly struggling teams, the Texans defeated Jacksonville and Tampa Bay by a combined score of 50-29. In their other five games, against stronger opponents, they have been crushed by a combined 170-104, a total that would be far more lopsided if Atlanta and Miami had made serious attempts at playing defense in the second half. (It was hardly necessary as Atlanta had a 42-point lead after three quarters and Miami was up, 41-0, at halftime.)AdvertisementThe good news for Houston is that Tennessee is still struggling to figure things out. The bad news is that Arian Foster is out for the season.If Marcus Mariota started for Tennessee, the Titans should have come away with a victory, but on Friday he was declared out. With Zach Mettenberger forced to start, the outcome is anyone’s guess.PICK: TITANSPicks do not reflect the betting line.
