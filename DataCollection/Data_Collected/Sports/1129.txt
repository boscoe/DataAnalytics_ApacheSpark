Dolphins (1-3) at Titans (1-3)1 p.m. Line: Titans by 1N.F.L. Week 6 scores and highlightsRemember Week 1 when Ryan Tannehill was working his way into the conversation of franchise quarterbacks and Marcus Mariota was a rookie sensation who threw four touchdown passes in a win? These teams have done a lot of losing since then.The Dolphins are a veteran team with a defense that theoretically has the talent to succeed even if that gets harder to believe every time they take the field. Mariota has a bright future, but he may endure a fourth consecutive loss.PICK: DOLPHINSWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
