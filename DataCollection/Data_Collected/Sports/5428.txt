SATURDAYRedskins (7-7) at Eagles (6-8)8:25 p.m. Line: Eagles by 3With a victory, the Redskins will win the N.F.C. East for only the second time in the last 16 seasons. An eighth victory would also guarantee that Washington will finish with at least a .500 record, thus avoiding a losing team winning the division for the first time since the N.F.L.’s Capitol Division became the N.F.C. East in 1970.For that to happen, Kirk Cousins will have to win a third consecutive game for the first time in his career. But playing against an underperforming and depleted Philadelphia defense, a red-hot Cousins seems very likely to thrive even as the Eagles will be fighting to stay in playoff contention.It would help Cousins considerably if DeSean Jackson were healthy. Jackson looked like his old self last week while hauling in 8 catches for 153 yards, including a spectacular 77-yard catch-and-run that would look familiar to the Eagles fans who watched him pull off plays like that from 2008 to 2013. Jackson did not practice Wednesday with foot and knee injuries, but he is expected to play.Pick: RedskinsSUNDAYPatriots (12-2) at Jets (9-5)1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 3To secure home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, New England has to win one of it two remaining games. It can do that by dealing a crushing blow to the Jets’ playoff hopes this week, or by beating the lowly Dolphins next week in an otherwise meaningless game. Since the Bill Belichick-led Patriots have consistently proved to be the N.F.L. equivalent of pro wrestling’s heels, expect the Patriots to do everything they can to take care of business against the Jets.AdvertisementWhile the Jets have played numerous close games against their division rival in recent years, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has a 21-6 career record against them. He has thrown 38 touchdown passes in the 27 games, and also has three rushing touchdowns, his highest total against any team.Advertisement“Hopefully, he gets traded at some point in time,” Calvin Pace, a Jets linebacker, joked to reporters this week. “Trade him to the N.F.C. somewhere.”The Jets’ quarterback, Ryan Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, has been a revelation for the Jets, and has made the offense something to fear by using Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker to their fullest potential. But Fitzgerald comes into the game with a 1-7 career record against the Patriots, thanks largely to 17 interceptions, eight more than he has thrown against any other opponent.
                Tree diagrams representing the full range of outcomes for teams that are in or have a shot at the N.F.L. playoffs.            There may be a bright future for the Jets under Coach Todd Bowles, and Fitzpatrick may be the quarterback to guide them for a few years, but expecting them to stay alive by beating the Patriots when New England has something to play for may be asking for too much too soon.Pick: PatriotsPanthers (14-0) at Falcons (7-7)1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 7The Falcons, despite a monumental collapse, have yet to be eliminated from playoff contention. All they have to do to stay alive is beat a 14-0 team with 10 Pro Bowl players.Chief among those stars is Cam Newton, who last week became the first quarterback in N.F.L. history to have 300 passing yards, five passing touchdowns and 100 rushing yards in a game, according to ProFootballReference.com.There is a possibly apocryphal quotation attributed to the former San Francisco 49ers Coach Bill Walsh that said: “Joe Montana was a product of the system. Dan Marino was the system.” Marino may truly have been the system, but Newton is the revolution to that system that has been predicted for years. Where Randall Cunningham, Michael Vick, Colin Kaepernick and a host of others could run and throw, Newton and Russell Wilson have truly mastered a blend of the two that is effective for winning games rather than just looking great in highlight films. Adding to Newton’s credentials is that he is inflicting all this damage with an unspectacular group of wide receivers.On the other side of the ball, Josh Norman is one of the few cornerbacks who can slow the Falcons’ star receiver Julio Jones, and the Panthers’ celebrated linebackers should have no problem containing running back Devonta Freeman.AdvertisementPick: PanthersPackers (10-4) at Cardinals (12-2)4:25 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 4.5Coaches have a tendency to heap praise on players who have unexpected success. But Cardinals Coach Bruce Arians may want to look around before complimenting his rookie running back David Johnson, a third-round pick out of Northern Iowa who has thrived filling in for the injured Andre Ellington and Chris Johnson.“He’s worked hard his whole life,” Coach Bruce Arians told reporters this week. “He had jobs at Northern Iowa cleaning latrines and working in the cafeteria. This is a very mature young man who’s paid his dues. He’s not like a guy who’s been given everything, highly recruited and they have a sense of entitlement. You have to be very aware of those guys.”Arians should be aware of those highly recruited players, since his team has quite a few of them. His quarterback, Carson Palmer, was the No. 1 overall pick in 2003 after winning the Heisman Trophy for Southern California in 2002. The Cardinals have plenty of other so-called “glory boys” like Larry Fitzgerald (No. 3 pick in 2004) and Patrick Peterson (No. 5 in 2011), along with a host of other celebrated first-round selections on offense and defense.But regardless of whether Arians may be attributing too much to Johnson’s humble beginnings, the fact that Johnson has rushed for 378 yards and three touchdowns in three weeks as a starter has done a lot to keep the Arizona offense in balance.A true test of the team’s depth may come this week, however, with cornerback Tyrann Mathieu out against the Packers and quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Pick: CardinalsRams (6-8) at Seahawks (9-5)4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 14.5Coach Pete Carroll used some creative language while insisting the Seahawks were not going to take the week off despite having a wild card locked up and no chance of winning the division.“I really don’t believe that you should ask players to take a break,” Carroll told Seahawks.com. “I think they’ve got to go. If we decide not to play guys for a different reason, that could happen. That’s not going to be because we’re going to take a step off the gas pedal right now.”The Rams generally give the Seahawks a fight, but if quarterback Russell Wilson is active, the rest of the roster might not matter. Wilson has been on fire during a five-game winning streak, with 19 touchdown passes and no interceptions. Ten of those touchdowns have gone to Doug Baldwin, who injured a hamstring last week and is listed as questionable.AdvertisementPick: SeahawksTexans (7-7) at Titans (3-11)1 p.m. No betting line.Colts (6-8) at Dolphins (5-9)1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 2.5Occasionally a division is so justly maligned that it almost seems that it does not deserve a champion. For much of the season, that distinction belonged to the N.F.C. East, but the A.F.C. South has caught up. After the Texans defeated the Colts last week, they are in control, and could clinch a .500 record with a win over lowly Tennessee. But with a revolving door of quarterbacks that includes Brian Hoyer, T.J. Yates and Brandon Weeden, the Texans are hard to take seriously as a playoff contender regardless of the star power they have on defense or the presence of DeAndre Hopkins.The Colts, still alive even after last week’s loss, can keep things going with a win over Miami, but they may have to do it without Matt Hasselbeck, the 40-year-old backup quarterback who has done an admirable job filling in for the injured Andrew Luck. But according to Coach Chuck Pagano, Hasselbeck has been “beat up from the feet up” and a jaw injury has supposedly limited him to a liquid diet. If he cannot stay in the game, Indianapolis will have to turn to Charlie Whitehurst.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            Meanwhile, a quality team like the Jets is likely to miss out on the playoffs.Picks: Texans and DolphinsSteelers (9-5) at Ravens (4-10)1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 11.5It is hard to imagine this season going worse for the Ravens, who have 19 players on injured reserve but were on their way to irrelevance long before the injuries.As the Ravens wait for the season to end, they will have to endure a week against a dominant Pittsburgh offense that is playing as well as it has in recent memory, even without the star running back Le’Veon Bell. Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown, Martavis Bryant and DeAngelo Williams have the Steelers dreaming of a seventh Super Bowl ring, and the Ravens are just a small speed bump on the road.Pick: SteelersBrowns (3-11) at Chiefs (9-5)1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 13A Kansas City victory in combination with a loss by the Steelers or the Jets would put the Chiefs in the playoffs after a 1-5 start exacerbated by the season-ending injury to Jamaal Charles. Taking care of their part of that equation should be easy for the Chiefs against a woeful Browns team that averages just over 18 points a game and has allowed more than 30 in six of their last seven.Pick: ChiefsGiants (6-8) at Vikings (9-5)8:30 p.m. Line: Vikings by 5The Vikings are still jockeying for a playoff spot, and the Giants, with fleeting playoff hopes of their own, will play without the suspended wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. That, along with the game being in Minnesota, should be enough to tip the balance in favor of the Vikings, even if they are far from healthy.AdvertisementAs good as Beckham has been for the Giants, being suspended for such an important game is the type of thing that tends to follow a player.Pick: VikingsJaguars (5-9) at Saints (5-9)4:05 p.m. Line: Saints by 3.5With his streak of 4,000-yard passing seasons secured, and his team eliminated from playoff contention, there is no reason Drew Brees should try to play on a severely injured foot. The fact that the Saints have not ruled him out is a testament to Brees’s competitiveness.The Saints are always tougher at home, but Blake Bortles has the Jaguars clinging to playoff dreams, and an injured Brees, or a healthy Matt Flynn, should not stand in the way of Jacksonville’s first six-win season since 2008.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It would typically be brutally cold, with snow and ice on the field. This weekend, the National Weather Service is predicting a game-time temperature of about 51 degrees, with early-morning rain having moved on by kickoff. So the harshest conditions the Bills may be able to provide in Ralph Wilson Stadium consist of a slightly slippery field.Neither team is in the running for a playoff spot, but the Bills have a much more talented roster and should have no problem giving the Cowboys their first 11-loss season since 2002.Pick: BillsBears (5-9) at Buccaneers (6-8)1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 3The Buccaneers have had an unexpectedly nice run but last week were eliminated from playoff contention. There are clearly promising signs, like the emergence of quarterback Jameis Winston. Coach Lovie Smith has seemingly found a connection with the players that he can build on next season. That type of optimism is absent in Chicago, where a bad season has turned ugly. Smith, who coached the Bears the last time they made the postseason, could give his former team a fourth consecutive loss while keeping his own team’s hopes for a .500 season alive.Pick: Buccaneers49ers (4-10) at Lions (5-9)1 p.m. Line: Lions by 10.5Fans of the 49ers grew so frustrated with quarterback Colin Kaepernick that many called for him to benched. They got their wish, but it did not really help. Some of those fans have now turned to hoping that Coach Jim Tomsula will be fired. Others have called for a change in ownership. A team that was once the epitome of success has bottomed out, and there is little about the current roster or management to suggest that a turnaround is on the way.The Lions are guaranteed a losing record for the third time in four seasons, but their improved play recently at least offers a glimmer of hope for next year.AdvertisementPick: LionsMONDAY MATCHUPBengals (11-3) at Broncos (10-4)8:30 p.m. Line: Broncos by 3Two of the best teams in the A.F.C. playing in a prime-time game in the second-to-last-week of the season should be among the most anticipated games of the year, but Brock Osweiler and AJ McCarron filling in for Peyton Manning and Andy Dalton ratchets down the excitement.That unfortunately discredits each team’s defense. The Bengals have allowed just 17.4 points a game and the Broncos are just behind them at 18.5, numbers that will increase the pressure on the young backup quarterbacks.Osweiler has performed well while learning on the job, and he is certainly further along than McCarron, but Denver has been outscored by 36-0 in the second half of their last three games. So even if the Broncos build an early lead, the Bengals can’t be counted out.Pick: BroncosA version of this article appears in print on December 27, 2015, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Patriots, on Road, Hope to Clinch Home-Field Edge.
