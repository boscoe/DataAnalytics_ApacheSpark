Browns (3-10) at Seahawks (8-5)4:05 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 16The Browns looked much improved on offense last week, and with the possibility that Seattle will be without safety Kam Chancellor, they may have success going over the middle. But with the way quarterback Russell Wilson has been playing recently, it does not seem like anything can get in Seattle’s way. He has been playing without Marshawn Lynch or Jimmy Graham, and will now be without Thomas Rawls, but somehow he keeps getting stronger.PICK: SeahawksWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
