CLEVELAND — Kathy Vasturia knew how hard her son Steve was working. She could see him fighting through screens, chasing Ron Baker of Wichita State all over the floor, running nonstop and bouncing off shoulders, elbows and well-placed hips.Kathy Vasturia played basketball at Dickinson College and understood the difficulty this assignment presented for her son.“I’m enough of a basketball fan to know how good Ron Baker is,” she said. “I was watching Steve chase him, and I was thinking he must be so exhausted.”Baker was the Shockers’ top scorer, averaging 14.7 points per game, and teams usually use a variety of picks and set plays to get such scorers the ball, especially ones playing on the wing. Baker ran and Vasturia chased, while the other Shockers tried to physically impede his path. But he got through most of them, limiting Baker to 9 points on 2 of 10 shooting.AdvertisementVasturia, who is also an excellent outside shooter, scored 15 points as third-seeded Notre Dame (32-5) beat Wichita State, the No. 7 seed, 81-70, on Thursday in the round of 16.The next assignment is in the round of 8 against No. 1-seeded Kentucky (37-0) on Saturday night. Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey did not reveal whom Vasturia, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, would be guarding in that difficult matchup, whether it might be the 6-6 Devin Booker or the 6-6 Andrew Harrison. Any assignment will be tough, but Brey is happy that Vasturia will be part of the plan.“Steve Vasturia is the most underrated, not-talked-about guy,” Brey said Friday. “He guards the best perimeter guy, he makes every big shot, and now he’s driving to the ball and getting to the basket and getting fouled.”Vasturia grew up in Medford, N.J., outside Philadelphia. His father, John, played baseball and football at the University of Pennsylvania, and Kathy was a point guard at Dickinson. She plays down her individual accomplishments, however; she was a captain in 1983 and 1984 and was inducted into the Dickinson College Hall of Fame in 1994.“We had good teams,” she said modestly. “I think it was just a reflection of that.”When Steve and his brothers — one older, one younger — were young, the family played basketball in the cul-de-sac in front of their house. Kathy says there is no part of Steve’s game that he got from her — not his jump shot, not his ball-handling ability, not even his ability to fight through screens. It is all his.Advertisement“He was always a very focused, tough kid,” she said. “When he wanted to do something, he did it. But you could see, even as far back as sixth grade, he knew what he was doing on the floor. He could play.”But Steve does attribute one fundamental aspect of his game to his mother. He remembers the games they played on the street at home from years gone by, particularly some fiercely competitive free-throw competitions.“I would say I got toughness or competitiveness from her,” he said. “She was out there with us in the driveway. She was a great athlete, and same with my dad.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Vasturia said his mother could regularly hit seven or eight free throws out of 10. Steve now shoots at an 85.9 percent clip from the line, the best on his team and seventh in the Atlantic Coast Conference among players with at least 20 games.Vasturia averaged 9.9 points, but over Notre Dame’s last eight games, all victories, he has averaged 12.4 and has become a key member of a tough, underrated team.“Over the course of the year, I’ve gotten more confident and more comfortable playing in this offense and with these guys,” he said. “I think I’ve been able to make a larger impact once it’s come to tournament play.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            On the surface, Vasturia does not have the look of a rugged defender. Quite the opposite, Brey labeled him the baby-faced assassin, and opponents and teammates agree with the name.“People probably look at him and say, Here’s a 6-5 shooter, he’s probably not going to play any defense,” Notre Dame center Zach Auguste said. “But then he goes and locks down the best player on your team.”Vasturia also possesses a feathery touch to drop in pivotal 3-pointers, as he did in overtime in the round of 32 win over Butler, in which he scored a season-high 20 points.AdvertisementClearly, playing in the heated caldron of the N.C.A.A. tournament has not daunted Vasturia, who thrived in the highly competitive Philadelphia Catholic League at St. Joseph’s Prep. In his junior year, he led St. Joe’s to a Class AAAA state title and scored 35 points in the championship game, tying Wilt Chamberlain’s record.Wilt Chamberlain.“He’s obviously a huge name in basketball and Philadelphia,” Vasturia said. “That was a great night for me.”Another big name in New Jersey basketball that Vasturia would love to be compared to is Kelly Tripucka. Also from New Jersey, Tripucka starred in Notre Dame’s last Final Four appearance in 1978.“We haven’t done that in a long time in this program,” Vasturia said. “But we’ve overcome odds all season and gotten this far for the first time in a long time. It’s really been a team accomplishment.”That last bit, he definitely learned that from his mother.A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Modest, Like His Mother, and Tough, Like His Team.
