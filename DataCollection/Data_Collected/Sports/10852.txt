In February 1988, Billy Martin was about to turn 60 years old. A month earlier, he had been married for the fourth time, which equaled the number of times he had been fired by George M. Steinbrenner. But at spring training that year, Martin was again leading the Yankees. On his staff was a young coach, 31-year-old Buck Showalter, then a promising managerial star of the Yankees’ lower minor leagues.Showalter, who has since become a three-time winner of the American League Manager of the Year Award, was about to receive an eye-opening education watching as Martin embarked on his final season in baseball.It was Steinbrenner’s idea that Martin should mentor Showalter.“After a week of following Billy around I felt like I had never seen a baseball game before,” Showalter, a college all-American who had won two minor league championships as a manager, said in 2013. “He showed me everything I wasn’t seeing from the dugout.”The lessons came at Showalter in a steady stream.“He showed me a thousand things, like how he stole the other teams’ signs,” Showalter said. “It was about watching the other manager and the opposing catcher, but the opposing batters, too.Advertisement“Every team has the batter give a return signal to the third-base coach that acknowledges that a bunt, a steal or a hit-and-run is on. If you watch, you can pick up the return signal — the batter taps his cleats or touches the brim of his cap. The key is to watch closely early in the game when they’re not doing any of those things, then notice the differences later in the game when more of those kinds of plays are going on.”AdvertisementBy 1988, Martin had resurrected major league teams in Minnesota, Detroit, Texas, Oakland and New York (multiple times). His face had graced the cover of Time magazine under the headline “Billy Ball,” a term that was now trademarked. Off the field, Martin was watched warily — with good reason. On the field, his methods were dissected and mimicked by opposing managers.“He instructed the infielders in all these intricacies — how you should make tags with a V motion, not a U motion, because a V is quicker,” Showalter said. “He talked about how you should never reach for a throw and never catch it in front of the base. Instead, let it come to you; a thrown ball travels faster to the base than your hands can. He was a stickler for how to perform a rundown, and his big thing was not to catch and chase the runner with the ball in a rundown. The runner has got to go back to some base; let him come to you. Be patient and don’t panic.“He taught me to have my eyes darting everywhere, looking for something to use later in a game. Take a ball that one of your guys hits into the right-center-field gap. Billy said don’t watch the ball; you know it’s going to be a double or a triple. Watch to see if the pitcher is backing up third. Is the left fielder moving? Are the relay guys in the proper order? How are the outfielders’ and infielders’ arms? You have a checklist of things to look for that might tell you something that you can use later.“He had a saying: Preparation always shows itself in the spontaneity of the moment. Watch what the opposition is doing. Billy said you’ll learn something. You might not use it in that game, but some future game you will.”BUT MARTIN’S TUTORING of Showalter was just beginning. In March, the Yankees made a weeklong trip to the west coast of Florida, hundreds of miles from their spring training home of Fort Lauderdale.“I was the left-handed coach pitching batting practice, so they took me with them,” Showalter said.Showalter saw that the road version of Billy Ball meant another level of education. It could be light and funny and it could be dark and sad.AdvertisementDuring the first game of the trip, in Sarasota, Showalter did something that put him permanently in Martin’s good graces. The Yankees were tied with the White Sox in a game that went into the 10th inning. The Yankees’ Bobby Meacham was at first base when Chicago brought in a young reliever and former Yankees farmhand, Ken Patterson.“Billy starts screaming in the dugout, ‘Does anybody know this guy?’ ” Showalter said. “He meant Patterson.”Showalter, who had managed Patterson the previous season, said he knew the pitcher. Martin raced over to ask what Patterson’s move to first base was like.“I told Billy that Patterson actually has a phobia about throwing to first base,” Showalter said. “He can’t do it. It’s like the yips in golf. He will step off and fake, but he won’t throw it. He does it again and again. As soon as it came out of my mouth, I thought, What have you done?”Martin turned and ran to the top step of the dugout and yelled to the first-base coach, Mike Ferraro, “Make the pitcher throw over.”Meacham took a four-foot lead, then a six-foot lead. Patterson only faked to first base.Martin yelled, “Take a bigger lead.”Meacham moved eight feet off the base.“Bigger,” Martin yelled.Meacham was 12 feet off the base and Patterson was still only stepping off and faking a throw.“You could have rolled the ball to first base and picked Meacham off first base,” Showalter said. “Billy is loving this now because he knows he’s showing up the other manager. Finally, Patterson throws it, but it’s 10 feet over the head of the first baseman and Meacham goes from first to third base. Somebody hit a sac fly and we won.”AdvertisementMartin hugged Showalter, who retreated to the locker room and showered. He was planning to get dinner at a nearby McDonald’s. Instead, the third-base coach, Clete Boyer walked over.“Clete says to me, ‘You think you did pretty good today, don’t you, kid? Well, you screwed up,’ ” Showalter said. “Then he flipped me the keys to the car and told me Billy wants me to be part of that night’s dinner with the coaches. I was the designated driver. We were to leave at 7 p.m.”Then Boyer gave Showalter some other instructions.“He told me to go to the deli across from the team hotel at 6:30,” Showalter said. “He said that I should order a club sandwich and I should eat it right then.”Showalter said, “ ‘But we’re going to dinner at 7?’Boyer answered, “Just do what I tell you.”Showalter did as he was told, then drove the coaches to dinner and watched as round after round of drinks were ordered.

I was dumping my drinks in the potted plants to stay upright. At maybe 10 p.m., we got appetizers. I don’t know if we ever got dinner, and if we did it wasn’t until 11. Thank God for that club sandwich.”There was a lot of baseball talk at the dinner table — for a while at least.“Billy was holding court, moving the salt and pepper shakers around on the table to explain a trick play or something,” Showalter said. “He talked about how to always attack another team — don’t let them relax. And he talked about how to identify smart players because he said to me, ‘Buck, dumb players will get you fired.’ You could learn a lot before the fourth or fifth drink. But after that, things deteriorated. You saw the other side of things, which was a lot less fascinating.“I remember we eventually left the restaurant and went to a bar and then I was driving everyone home at 3 a.m.”Showalter said that the pitching coach, Art Fowler, Martin’s longtime drinking buddy, made him stop at a 7-Eleven to get ice cream and a six-pack of beer.Advertisement“But the next day, and I don’t know how, those guys were as fresh as a daisy,” Showalter said. “I was half their age and I remember telling my wife that I wasn’t going to survive the trip.”MARTIN’S 1988 YANKEES sprinted into the regular season, winning nine of their first 10 games. A fast start was always Martin’s goal, and those who had played for him before expected the intensity of the first two weeks.
                What makes a baseball record unbreakable? Sometimes the game changes and that puts a record out of reach. Sometimes an exceptional performance is too dominant to be matched. When the two combine, the record could last for centuries.            “Some of the new guys to the team, like Jack Clark and John Candelaria, were shocked at how different Billy was once the regular season started,” first baseman Don Mattingly said. “They were telling me in spring training how relaxed and easygoing Billy was.“Then the season started and they said: ‘Man, every game is intense. He never sits down in the dugout. He’s pacing and yelling even when we’re leading 8-0 in the ninth inning.’ ”With the Yankees’ brilliant start, the team had a stranglehold on first place that lasted for months. They were a potent offensive club, with Mattingly still in his prime, Rickey Henderson, Willie Randolph, Dave Winfield and Clark.But there were the usual issues, most notably Martin’s career-long trouble with the umpires.On May 6, the Yankees and their gleaming 20-8 record went to Texas for a three-game series with the lowly sixth-place Rangers. Texas was leading, 7-1, but the Yankees began the ninth inning by loading the bases with no outs. Mattingly was called out on strikes and then ejected when he argued the third strike call with the home-plate umpire, Tim Welke.When Martin ran onto the field, he was ejected, too. Martin reached into his full arsenal of umpire mistreatment tactics, throwing his hat and kicking dirt on the umpire with a flourish.Martin was even more upset when his Yankees rallied for five runs but fell short in a 7-6 defeat.After the game, Martin retired to the bar at the team hotel, the Arlington Hilton, where he had planned to meet Mickey Mantle and Mantle’s son Danny, and his coach Mike Ferraro. But the hotel bar was packed with Yankees fans.Advertisement“Isn’t there somewhere quiet we can go drink?” Martin asked Mantle, who said he knew just the place.The four men took a cab a mile down the road to Lace, Arlington’s only topless club. Lace featured hundreds of strobe lights that illuminated a smoky haze, with a throbbing music beat and a squad of dancers gyrating on the long rectangular bar.“This is the quiet place you talked about?” Martin asked a laughing Mantle.What happened inside Lace is something of a mystery despite multiple investigations. What is certain is that Ferraro escorted the Mantles home, which may have been Martin’s idea. But Martin was not supposed to be left alone.The other certainty is that at some time just after 1:30 a.m., Martin went to the men’s room.“My dad said that without any warning, two guys came into the men’s room and whacked him on the head with some kind of blackjack or hard object,” Martin’s son, Billy Joe, said. “My dad said he was knocked to the ground and remembers being punched and kicked and thrown out a side or back door to the place. He said to me, ‘I’ve never been jumped like that before.’ ”The police later conceded that someone hit Martin in the head with a blunt instrument. Every investigator, while never identifying Martin’s assailants, also agreed that Martin was pushed out a back door, where he was shoved into the raised stucco exterior of the building and the side of his head was dragged along the rough, serrated wall. The jagged, pointed pieces of concrete tore into Martin’s left ear. The ear was all but sheared off, and it bled profusely onto Martin’s shirt.Martin ended up in a taxi. His plan, he later said, was to sneak into the hotel unseen since by then most everyone had gone to bed. Martin would go directly to the trainer Gene Monahan’s room, where he figured Monahan could get him the help he needed.Unknown to Martin, about the same time, there had been a minor, smoky electrical blaze near the hotel’s sauna. A fire alarm had sounded, and while fire department officials quickly extinguished the small flame, every guest in the Hilton had been herded out the entrance to the hotel with the fire alarm. A few hundred people, including the players, coaches and reporters, were standing on a lawn and circular drive in front of the hotel. So was Steinbrenner, who had made the trip with the team. George had wrapped himself in a silk robe.That’s when an Arlington taxi pulled up. From the back seat of the vehicle emerged Martin, his shirt covered in blood. He was using a light jacket to hold his torn, battered ear to the side of his head. It was an almost incomprehensible sight.AdvertisementMartin looked around and admitted he had one thought: “You’ve got to be kidding me.”Steinbrenner, his robe straining against his legs as he ran, rushed over to Martin, who was brought into the hotel manager’s office off the lobby. Monahan dashed in behind him. Steinbrenner was giving orders and waving his arms.Soon Martin was taken to Arlington Hospital.“Billy was mostly upset that this might affect the season,” said Monahan, who accompanied Martin to the hospital but until 2013 had never described the events as he saw them. “He said to me: ‘Geno, we don’t need this. We’re in first place.’ And he kept saying, ‘I can’t go anywhere anymore.’ ”At the hospital, doctors prepared to use about fifty stitches, just for the ear wound. Martin also had a swollen eye, a gash on his cheek, ugly bruises on his shoulder and knee as well as a lumpy contusion on the back of his skull.This article comprises excerpts from “Billy Martin: Baseball’s Flawed Genius,” by Bill Pennington, a sportswriter for The New York Times.
