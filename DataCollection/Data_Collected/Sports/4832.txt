So the Mets will rely on him to retire lefties like Bryce Harper, the National League most valuable player and one of his former teammates.A version of this article appears in print on December 16, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Re-Sign a Left-Hander to Shore Up Their Bullpen.
