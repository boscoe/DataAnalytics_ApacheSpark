If the Texans break that streak, they will take sole possession of first place in the A.F.C. South, a division that is giving the N.F.C. East a run for its money as the least impressive in the N.F.L.It will be a matchup of backup quarterbacks, with T.J. Yates starting for Houston and Indianapolis hoping that Matt Hasselbeck is O.K. to go, but possibly having to rely on Charlie Whitehurst. The uncertainty makes the game hard to analyze, and it does not help that both teams have lost in consecutive weeks. But Houston seems more talented, so it may finally prevail on its division rivalâ€™s home field.PICK: TexansAdvertisement
