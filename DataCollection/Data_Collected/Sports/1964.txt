Check back Friday for analysis on Sunday’s games and Monday’s matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and the Carolina Panthers. You can also follow the Sablich brothers on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy.Dolphins at Patriots8:25 p.m. Line: Patriots by 7.5. Quarterback Ryan Tannehill (MIA) — The Patriots surrendered an average of 303.5 passing yards and 32 rushing yards and five total touchdowns to Andrew Luck and Ryan Fitzpatrick over the last two weeks. Over all, they are permitting 19 F.P.P.G. a week to the position. This is a plus matchup.Tom Brady (NE) — Miami served up plenty of garbage-time points to Brian Hoyer last week (273 yards, three TDs, 20 F.P.s), but played well over all in the previous two contests. It has yielded only 16 F.P.P.G., but Brady is matchup-proof.Running Back Lamar Miller (MIA) — New England limited the N.F.L.’s leading rusher, Chris Ivory, to 41 yards on 17 carries, thanks in part to the return of linebacker Dont’a Hightower. Opposing RB1s have averaged only 53 yards and one score over the previous four games. It’s a tough matchup, but you cannot sit Miller, who has 52 fantasy points over the past two games.AdvertisementDion Lewis (NE) — Lewis is expected to return this week, and you will want to make sure he is back in your lineup against Miami’s 30th ranked run defense, which is permitting 129 rushing yards per game.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Wide Receiver/Tight End  Jarvis Landry/Rishard Matthews (MIA) — The Patriots are considered the sixth best fantasy matchup for receivers entering Week 8. Landry is locked in as a fantasy WR2, while Matthews has emerged as a solid WR3 option considering he has seen the majority of snaps opposite Landry the last two games.Julian Edelman (NE) — Cornerback Brent Grimes shadowed the Texans’ DeAndre Hopkins in Week 7 and held him to six receptions for 50 yards. But this was good news for his teammate Nate Washington, who hauled in nine balls for 127 yards and two touchdowns. Consider Edelman as a low-end WR1 this week.Advertisement Jordan Cameron (MIA) — He has become a touchdown-dependent play and is a weak TE1 option against a Patriots unit yielding 3.3 F.P.P.G. to the position over the last three weeks (eighth worst matchup).The Sablich Brothers have provided award-winning fantasy football advice for The Times since 2010.
