Andy Murray won his first clay-court title Monday by beating Philipp Kohlschreiber, 7-6 (4), 5-7, 7-6 (4), in the rain-delayed final of the BMW Open in Munich. The top-seeded Murray, who was in his first final on clay, is the first British man to win a title on clay since Buster Mottram in 1976.■ Serena Williams needed just 58 minutes to beat a fellow American, Sloane Stephens, by 6-4, 6-0 and reach the third round of the Madrid Open. The top-ranked Williams broke Stephens four times and saved both break points she faced to secure her 25th straight win. She will next face either Victoria Azarenka or Ajla Tomljanovic.A version of this brief appears in print on May 5, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Tennis; Murray Earns His First Title on Clay.
