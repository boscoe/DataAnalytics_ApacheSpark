Corn Elder took Miami’s eighth lateral of a wild final kickoff return and brought it back 75 yards for a touchdown that gave visiting Miami (5-3, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) an improbable 30-27 win over No. 22 Duke.Thomas Sirk seemingly had given the Blue Devils (6-2, 3-1) the win by scoring on a sneak with six seconds left.But in a final sequence reminiscent of California’s unforgettable run through the Stanford band, Elder caught the last of eight laterals and zigged and zagged through the Duke coverage for the score.There was one problem: a penalty flag thrown on teammate Mark Walton for an illegal block in the back on Breon Borders at the Duke 25.AdvertisementBut after a long review, the officials determined that the block was to Borders’s side, and the touchdown stood.AdvertisementNOTRE DAME 24, TEMPLE 20 DeShone Kizer hit Will Fuller with a 17-yard touchdown pass with 2 minutes 9 seconds left, KeiVarae Russell picked off a pass to end the final threat, and No. 9 Notre Dame (7-1) escaped at Temple (7-1).The biggest game in the history of Temple’s program lived up to the billing.

But Leidner’s plunge was stuffed by Ryan Glasgow and Joe Bolden.OKLAHOMA STATE 70, TEXAS TECH 53 Mason Rudolph and J. W.
