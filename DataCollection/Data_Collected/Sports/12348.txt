So Alex Rodriguez has now hit 660 home runs, as many as the great Willie Mays and a total surpassed by only Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth. Rodriguez was supposed to get a $6 million bonus from the Yankees for this, but now he may not. An arbitrator may well decide.That is interesting, but only to a point. A really rich person will get a bit richer, or a really rich team will save some money. The Yankees have been careful not to hype the milestone, or to more than grudgingly acknowledge it, which is farcical but understandable. Rodriguez, as we know, brought this awkwardness on himself, with his decisions to cheat.By now, it seems most people are tired of that angle. Everybody knows what A-Rod did, nobody approves, but the vitriol is hard to sustain. He is playing again, and playing well, for a team that needs him. We still want to watch him when he comes to the plate. We are still entertained.
            For nearly all of Alex Rodriguez’s career, he reached home run milestones at an earlier age than any of the game’s top sluggers. But on his way to tying Willie Mays’s career mark of 660, he had injuries and was suspended, and he fell behind the pace of the other hitters he is still chasing.        800Barry Bonds762700Hank Aaron755Babe Ruth714600Willie Mays660Alex Rodriguez660500400300When Rodriguez passed the 600 milestone at age 34, he seemed destined to become the next career home run king.2001002025303540AGE AS OF JUNE 30 EACH YEARsuspended, did not play800Barry Bonds762Hank Aaron755700Babe Ruth714Willie Mays660600Alex Rodriguez660500400When Rodriguez passed the 600 milestone at age 34, he seemed destined to become the next career home run king.3002001002025303540AGE AS OF JUNE 30EACH YEARsuspended, did not playMAY 1, 2015
Rodriguez is a showman, often in a way that exposes the unseemly side of his character. We get that. But for all but one season, he has been allowed to take the field, and was thus a member in good standing of the baseball community. His statistics are real.AdvertisementMajor League Baseball does not pretend that what we see on the field never happened. Yes, the league denied Melky Cabrera a batting-title designation (at his request) after his drug bust in 2012, but players are never stripped of their actual statistics. Whether achieved with the help of spitballs or deadballs, segregation or amphetamines, Coors Field or steroids, the numbers are what they are. The context behind them is out there, if you want to find it.AdvertisementThe backdrop to Rodriguez’s feats will always overshadow the feats themselves. This is not exactly a shame — again, it was his choice to repeatedly use performance-enhancing drugs — but it does obscure just how remarkable Rodriguez has played.Yes, the home runs. But Rodriguez is also closing in fast on 3,000 hits. Only 28 players have done that. Some of the grandest names in history never made it, often because they walked so much: Ruth, Bonds, Ted Williams, Rogers Hornsby. Rodriguez has just one season with 100 walks, but getting on base has never been much of a problem. His career on-base percentage was .384 going into Friday’s game.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            Rodriguez has 2,956 career hits, and the Yankees could celebrate No. 3,000 without fear of having to pay for it. It is worthy of awe, if only for the other numbers that have gone with it, no matter what juicy potions helped produce them.Going into Friday’s game, Rodriguez had a career on-base plus slugging percentage of .942. Ruth, Williams, Bonds and Hornsby — plus others with fewer than 3,000 hits, like Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx — had higher figures. But the 3,000 club is still a pretty ritzy place to reside, and among its members, few can match Rodriguez.Just two players have had 3,000 hits and a higher OPS than Rodriguez: Stan Musial, at .976, and Ty Cobb, at .945. Rodriguez has many more homers than both. (Mays, to be fair, is just behind Rodriguez in OPS, at .941.)Rodriguez’s combination of extreme power, pure hitting skill and durability is rare. Only four players have reached 500 homers and 3,000 hits, the sparkly benchmarks for two of the game’s most revered numbers. Musial (475 homers), Dave Winfield (465) and Carl Yastrzemski (452) just missed. The four to do it are Aaron, Mays, Eddie Murray and Rafael Palmeiro.Palmeiro, of course, is in that disgraced category, after having tested positive for stanozolol in August 2005, his final season in the majors. He was suspended less than three weeks after reaching 3,000 hits.AdvertisementAfter the hit, Palmeiro — who finished with 569 homers and 3,020 hits — dismissed the idea of belonging in the company of Mays and Aaron.“You are talking about the two best players of all time,” he said, as quoted by MLB.com. “I am in a group with them, but that doesn’t mean I belong with them. Hank Aaron has 200 more than I do and Willie Mays has 100 more. They are in a class by themselves.”With Rodriguez nearing 3,000, the class will grow by one. He is a complicated one, who schemed and scammed on the journey to get there. But Rodriguez will arrive, probably very soon, with a statistical ledger unlike any the game has ever known.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
