Week 10 scores and highlightsDesperate to add weapons to their passing game, the Rams have signed the concussion-plagued wide receiver Wes Welker. They are among the leagueâ€™s worst teams at converting on third down this season and hope that Welker, something of a third-down catch specialist throughout his career as a slot receiver, can help in that regard. In their last three games, the Rams have attempted to convert on third down 37 times and have succeeded only four times.PICK: RamsAdvertisement
