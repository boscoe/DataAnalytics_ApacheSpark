The Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League ruled that California Area High School violated a rule that was meant to keep schools from fielding mixed-gender teams if the school provides teams for both sexes. The girl played on the team’s second doubles squad because the team started the season short one boy. California’s boys team still qualified for the playoffs with an adjusted record of 7-4.
