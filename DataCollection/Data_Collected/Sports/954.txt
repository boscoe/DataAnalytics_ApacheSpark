LOS ANGELES — In his office hours before Game 4 of their National League division series, when the Mets were leading the Dodgers by a game, Manager Terry Collins emphatically declared that Matt Harvey was done pitching for the series. Harvey had labored through five innings in a Game 3 victory, and the Mets had decided that it would be harmful to pitch him again.But on Wednesday, as the Mets flew here, Harvey told Collins that he would be able to pitch in the winner-take-all N.L.D.S. Game 5 on Thursday against the Dodgers. At his news conference, then, Collins indicated that Harvey could go one or maybe two innings if needed.In reality, though, it seems unlikely that the Mets, who will start Jacob deGrom, will use Harvey in a relief role. Harvey has never pitched out of the bullpen, for one, and the Mets have been cautious with him this season in his first full year back after Tommy John surgery. Including the postseason, Harvey has thrown 194.1 innings this season — the most he has ever thrown.So Collins’s change of heart appeared to be more of a gesture to show that Harvey was on board with his teammates.“We’re going to be smart about it,” Collins said. “We’re not going to be foolish and go right to Matt Harvey, say if Jake’s in trouble in the second inning. So I think we’ve got to be wise enough to know that this will be the first time he’s ever done something like this, too.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
