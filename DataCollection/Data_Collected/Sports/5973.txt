After a scoreless first period, Brassard gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead, making the game his third straight with a goal after a nine-game drought.Nash scored early in the third period by swatting home the rebound of a Kevin Klein shot from the slot after a poor clearing attempt by Sami Vatanen. The score gave Nash the 10th 25-goal season of his career, with more than half of the Rangers’ schedule still to play.Anaheim scored 10 seconds into a power play when a big shot from Beauchemin from the blue line beat a partially screened Lundqvist. Beauchemin has three goals in five games after a 24-game drought, dating to last season.But Beauchemin gave away the puck moments later to Zuccarello, who beat Bryzgalov for his first goal in 10 games. Moore added an empty-net goal.Bryzgalov was largely solid in a game that brought his career full circle. He was drafted by the Ducks in 2000 and came up through the organization, eventually backing up Jean-Sebastien Giguere on Anaheim’s Stanley Cup-winning team of 2007.Bryzgalov had not made a home start for the Ducks since Nov. 7, 2007, shortly before he was waived to make room for Jonas Hiller. Bryzgalov played for four teams over the past seven seasons.Advertisement
