In the production truck outside Madison Square Garden on Tuesday afternoon, nearly 20 members of the USA Network crew were preparing for the second night of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which was to culminate with awarding Best in Show to the dog judged worthier than its six rivals.Rebecca Chatman, the producer, ran down the order of the three-hour program, from when the announcers Mary Carillo and David Frei would “chitchat” about the sporting dogs to which notable dogs would be featured on-screen before judging to when to roll a feature about the treats that handlers carry in their pockets to reward the dogs in the show rings.Images of dogs illuminated nearly every screen inside the truck, except for a few that were showing a rerun of “Law & Order: SVU.”“We’ll push the judging more tonight,” Chatman said. “Mary will tee you up with some questions.”
                Do dogs really look like their owners? Put the theory to the test by trying to guess which dog from the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show belongs to which owner.            Frei, who is relied upon for an encyclopedic knowledge of breeds and the show’s long history, broke into a story about Hickory, a vizsla who won his breed and was competing Tuesday night in the sporting group.Advertisement“He belongs to jewelers who left out some loose diamonds, and when he was about 8 months old he ate them all,” Frei said. “The husband spent the next week following the dog around and recovered $8,000 of the $10,000 they were worth.” He did not say how Hickory got rid of the remaining jewels.AdvertisementNow in their fifth year together on the show, Frei and Carillo have developed a warm and lighthearted rapport that blends the depth of his canine background and her desire to expand her knowledge.“I’ve been reading that many terriers were white because when they were being bred, they wanted to be able to distinguish them from their prey,” she said during the meeting. “Is that worth a conversation?”Some were, said Frei, who added, jokingly, “So they wouldn’t get shot.”Carillo is mindful of the fine line between having fun while calling the dog show and mocking the dogs, one that was crossed so often by Fred Willard in Christopher Guest’s mockumentary “Best in Show.” She recalled her quizzical reaction to the sight of the small, mostly hairless Chinese crested in her first show (“David, I’ve got some questions?” she said), and wondering on Monday during hound group judging about Frei’s reference to “Plott people.”

I know I am. I love dogs. I love this event. I hope it’s clear that we’re crazy about these animals.”Chatman, a coordinating producer of NBC Olympics who produced segments with the figure skating commentators Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski at the Super Bowl, told the group that at some point in the program there would be a countdown clock to the start of Best in Show judging, the final event of the night. She also reminded Frei that he would describe each of the Best in Show competitors as they are introduced individually and are followed by a spotlight in the otherwise darkened arena.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Whether it ended punctually depended, in part, on whether judges during the evening resisted the urge to dawdle in their dog assessments. In some years, Best in Show judges have shown a penchant for delaying their decisions to draw out the drama, seemingly ready to pick a winner, but asking the finalists to take yet another lap around the Garden ring. Those excesses have largely been remedied in meetings with Westminster club and USA officials that include reminders that the show has to end at 11 p.m.For Chatman, the ultimate goal is not really about getting out on time.“What makes the show,” she said, “are dog faces.”A picture caption in some editions on Wednesday with an article about preparations of the USA Network television crew for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show misspelled, in some copies, the given name of the woman shown with a Great Dane named Niko and misstated her role in the competition. She is Mari Lynn Davisson, not MaryLynn, and she is the dog’s handler, not its owner.A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Meticulous Preparation Is for the Broadcasters, Too .
