CLEMSON, S.C. — Clemson faced a third-and-3 at the Florida State 7-yard line late in the first half when the Tigers’ star quarterback, Deshaun Watson, took the snap, stepped back and spiked the ball into the ground, thinking he had to stop the clock.The crowd groaned, and Coach Dabo Swinney stood on the sideline with his mouth wide open in disbelief as Watson lost track of the situation. Clemson was struggling offensively and trailing, 10-3.“A freshman mistake,” Tigers tight end Jordan Leggett said later, smiling broadly.Watson is a sophomore, and although he is a Heisman Trophy contender, he forced his team to settle for a field goal with 29 seconds left before the break in its biggest game so far this season.It was part of a shabby first half for Watson on Saturday, but he righted himself and rallied his team to a 23-13 victory in an Atlantic Coast Conference game.With the victory, the third-ranked Tigers, who were No. 1 in the first rankings from the College Football Playoff selection committee, clinched the Atlantic Division of the A.C.C. and earned a berth in the conference championship game, scheduled for Dec. 5.AdvertisementThe Tigers (9-0, 6-0) proved themselves an authentic Playoff contender by beating a team that had trounced them here, 51-14, two years ago and had beaten them in overtime, 23-17, last season in Tallahassee.AdvertisementIt looked as if Clemson was set for more misery when it was rocked on the second snap of the game by Seminoles running back Dalvin Cook, who dashed 75 yards for a touchdown and finished the first half with 157 rushing yards. But in the second half, the Tigers’ linebackers no longer looked like sitting targets for blocks, hemming in Cook, who had 194 yards for the game.No. 17 Florida State (7-2, 5-2) did not support Cook with an effective passing game. Quarterback Sean Maguire, who has been the backup for most of the season, completed 16 of 29 passes for 164 yards with one interception in place of Everett Golson, who had experienced concussionlike symptoms and did not play Saturday.The better quarterback, although he did not look like it early, was Watson, who rushed for a career-high 107 yards and passed for 297 and a touchdown.
                A look at the top players in contention for college football’s highest honor.            He badly overthrew Leggett in the middle of the field in the first quarter when it looked as if a reasonably accurate pass would have produced a touchdown. There was also a third-down pass, a flip to running back Wayne Gallman, that would have sustained a second-quarter drive, but Watson threw the ball over Gallman’s head.“I’m not a perfect quarterback,” Watson said.While he had not played perfectly over the first eight games of the season, Watson had played exceptionally well, completing 70 percent of his passes and accounting for an average of 290 offensive yards per game. He got his act together Saturday with the Tigers’ second possession of the third quarter.Trailing by 10-6, Clemson went on an 80-yard drive to take its first lead of the game, 13-10. Watson flipped a short screen pass to Deon Cain, who turned it into a 38-yard touchdown. Cain said that the play called for the Tigers to run a screen to either side of the field, and Watson picked the correct side. Cain went to the end zone practically untouched.During the drive, Watson ran for 15 yards to convert a third down. He was also 5 of 5 passing.The crowd finally came to life, along with an offense that was averaging 42 points a game.Advertisement“Your best player has to play well,” Swinney said. “We missed some layups.”On its next turn with the ball, Florida State finally converted a third down as it moved to the Clemson 24, and Roberto Aguayo kicked a 41-yard field goal to tie the game, 13-13, with 6 minutes 15 seconds left in the third quarter. F.S.U. converted just 2 of 12 third downs in the game.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They started a possession on their 8 and drove to the Florida State 17, leading to a field goal and a 16-13 lead with 7:23 to play.F.S.U. came right back with a long kickoff return. But on a fourth-and-1 at the Tigers’ 40, the Seminoles handed the ball to Cook, and he was hit by defensive end Shaq Lawson and then tackled by linebacker Ben Boulware for no gain.Clemson then went 60 yards in seven plays to put the game away. Gallman, who rushed for 103 yards, finished off F.S.U. with a 25-yard touchdown run. The extra-point kick made it a 10-point game with 2:34 to play.The crowd rejoiced over the win but also, perhaps, over the possibility that Swinney would be buying pizza for everyone Dec. 6. He has vowed that if the Tigers make the College Football Playoff then, he will host a pizza party.Swinney was talking food after the game but not pizza.“We have bigger fish to fry,” he said.Clemson still has to play Syracuse on the road and Wake Forest at home. Then there is its in-state rival South Carolina, as well as the A.C.C. championship game.“It’s good to be in control of our destiny,” Swinney said. “We just have to keep two hands on the wheel. This was a big one.”An article in some editions on Sunday about Clemson’s 23-13 football victory over Florida State misstated the number of yards Florida State running back Dalvin Cook gained in the game. It was 194, not 198.A version of this article appears in print on November 8, 2015, on Page SP4 of the New York edition with the headline: Passer Recovers and Puts Clemson in One Championship Game.
