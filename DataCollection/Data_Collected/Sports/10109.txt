COLLEGE PARK, Md. —  Perfection was at stake, but maybe even more significant, more alluring, Princeton had an opportunity to send shock waves through a tournament that rarely registers even a tremble.It had been six years since a No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. women’s bracket had lost before reaching the round of 16. Yet there was mighty Maryland — nestled amid the adoring faithful at its home court, Xfinity Center — looking slightly dumbstruck in the first half against undaunted Princeton.It was a 20-minute performance that had the aroma of an impending upset — shots were falling, passes were being deflected, the home crowd was hushed. The Tigers were looking as advertised: tireless, smart, well coached. The Terrapins were beginning to look pallid.But with halftime came a break in the momentum and a flip of the proverbial switch for Maryland, the top seed in the Spokane Region, which opened the second half on a 17-2 run. So Princeton’s spirited attempt at an undefeated season died softly Monday night, with an 85-70 defeat.Advertisement“They made history,” Coach Courtney Banghart said of her team. “I told them all you want to do in your life is leave a legacy and do something with impact. There’s not anyone on this team that doesn’t think they did both of those things.”AdvertisementTwenty minutes after the final buzzer, Princeton’s locker room had some red eyes but was mostly filled with satisfied smiles and laughter. How many teams can claim to have attracted the president of the United States and two Supreme Court justices to their first two N.C.A.A. tournament games? Only Princeton.Only Princeton entered Monday still unbeaten in Division I (other than Kentucky on the men’s side), having compiled one of the most memorable seasons by a midmajor program in recent memory. Still, without a win over a Top 25 program, the Tigers had had a hard time convincing the tournament selection committee that they were a legitimate contender. The committee seeded them eighth.That decision flummoxed some analysts and bothered Banghart, who knew her team would have to beat another historically successful midmajor program, Wisconsin-Green Bay, just to get an opportunity to face Maryland on its home court. She called the move “disappointing for the women’s game.”“These are two really good teams,” she said. “To grow as a game, you want to have your best games late in the season.”Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, each a Princeton graduate, sat in the stands, two days after President Obama had attended the Tigers’ tournament opener. Security for Monday’s game was intensified after a threat was made against Tigers forward Leslie Robinson, Obama’s niece. USA Today reported that an eight-minute voice mail message alerted Maryland’s athletic office before the contest that an armed man was driving around campus.
                Women’s N.C.A.A. bracket.            Banghart kept the news from Robinson until after the game, and she had forceful words about the threat.“Keep the freaks out of our gym, how about that?” she said. “Is that articulate?”The University of Maryland police said in a statement that their investigation found that the threat was unsubstantiated.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Tigers outscored Maryland, 28-6, in the paint in the first half.Maryland’s outside shooting was its saving grace, and as time wound down in the first half, a 20-foot jumper by the sophomore Shatori Walker-Kimbrough gave the Terrapins a 42-38 lead.Maryland then burst out of the second half with new verve, hitting six consecutive shots. The Tigers missed six straight as their deficit grew to 17.“We wanted to keep pushing, make or miss, and just wear them out,” Maryland Coach Brenda Frese said. “I think the physicality, the speed, getting up and down, that was really the difference in being able to extend that lead.”Maryland’s impressive shooting continued from there. The Terrapins wound up going 12 of 20 from 3-point range, including 7 of 8 in the second half.“If that’s what it takes to beat us, great,” the senior Tigers guard Blake Dietrick said. “We wish we could get that run back, but they were hitting shots in that stretch, and we were not.”In the locker room, Annie Tarakchian said nobody on Princeton’s side was second-guessing the low seeding or wondering how far the team could have progressed with a more favorable path.“You can’t pin us as a bitter group,” Tarakchian said. “We looked at everything as half-full, and whatever is thrown our way we were up to the challenge. We embraced this experience. This was an awesome game.”A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2015, on Page B8 of the New York edition with the headline: As Tenacity Wanes, Princeton Is Unable to Rescue Perfection.
