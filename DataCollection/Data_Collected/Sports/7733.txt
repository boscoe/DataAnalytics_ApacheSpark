CreditAndrew White for The New York Times        UNIONDALE, N.Y. —  Alex Klein’s minibus is painted the green and white of the Jets, but it is also festooned with orange and blue flags, towels and other accouterments.“Only real die-hard fans tailgate before hockey games,” said Klein, who usually parks his vehicle outside the Marriott Hotel that faces Nassau Coliseum, the Islanders’ home rink since 1972. “Sometimes you get rain, snow, cold, and you have to be ready.“But meeting new fans and hanging with friends, talking hockey — what could be better?”Klein, 48, a salesman from Roslyn, N.Y., is one of many fans celebrating the Islanders’ revival this season with a boisterous and windswept camaraderie. Their team, which took over first place in the Eastern Conference’s Metropolitan Division on Sunday, looks all but certain to head to the playoffs for the second time since 2007.During the team’s last postseason trip, in 2013, young fans got a taste of what Long Island was like in the early 1980s, the Islanders’ glory years, when the team won four straight Stanley Cups.AdvertisementTailgaters packed the sprawling parking lots around Nassau Coliseum three hours before the first home playoff game, a Sunday matinee against the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins.Advertisement“That atmosphere was absolutely amazing; we need to see that again this year,” said Craig Richardson, 44, a longtime fan who wears a bright blue wig to most games and also tailgates near the Marriott. “We’re true fans, and everyone knows us. We’re one big family. That’s the best part!”This year’s pregame parties have an added urgency because the Islanders will leave Nassau Coliseum after the season for Barclays Center in Brooklyn, a move that means the art of the tailgate will be lost.Barclays Center, unlike the Coliseum, is easily accessible by train, sitting above a transit hub that serves nine subway lines and the Long Island Rail Road, but parking is not so easy. That leaves little chance of recreating the atmosphere outside the Coliseum, a throwback arena reached mostly by car over the decades.“Especially because of the way they are playing, plus all the emotion this season, it really is a horrible feeling knowing they won’t be playing on Long Island next year,” said Richardson, who is from Seaford, a community in Nassau County about 10 miles from the Coliseum and about 30 from Barclays Center. “But still, I would rather they be in Brooklyn than Kansas City.”Many tailgaters at a recent game couldn’t help turning wistful about the Coliseum, a relic of an arena that has few amenities but offers an unobstructed view of the ice from every seat. That may not be the case at Barclays Center, which was built mostly for basketball.“The Coliseum is irreplaceable and will never be duplicated,” said Tom Marich of Jericho, N.Y., a fan since 1980, when the Islanders won their first Stanley Cup. “The whole noncorporate feel is what makes it special here.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It’s such a warming and comforting feeling seeing and talking to fellow fans before the games.”AdvertisementClad in an alternate blue jersey the Islanders wore for their outdoor game at Yankee Stadium last year, Klein, the fan from Roslyn, commiserated with a friend inside his bus before a recent afternoon game. When the conversation turned to Brooklyn, he mentioned that his weather-beating vehicle would often be resting in his driveway next season.“I’ll go to games in Brooklyn, but not as many as I would if they were on Long Island,” Klein said as his friend, Seth Polan, nodded in agreement. “I have a 60-inch-screen TV with surround sound, so that will get more use.”Many Islanders fans are hoping they will have opportunities in the future to resume their long-practiced tradition of tailgating. A renovation of Nassau Coliseum is scheduled to start after this season under the guidance of Bruce C. Ratner, the executive chairman of Forest City Ratner Companies and the Barclays Center developer.Under Ratner’s plan, the Islanders could continue to play six games at the Coliseum after the renovation is complete, but with the arena’s modernization also come dreams of a reversal and a more permanent return.“This is a great scene — always is and always has been,” said a shivering John Dinkelman, a New York City firefighter from Wantagh, N.Y., whose Islanders fandom extends back to the Stanley Cup years. “We definitely have fun out here. We just wish they would move back so we can keep doing this.”A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Bidding Farewell to Their Cold Patches of Pavement.
