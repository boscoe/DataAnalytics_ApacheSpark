As FanDuel braced for a court hearing that could determine the fate of daily fantasy sports in New York, the company demonstrated that it remained committed to advertising its website there.FanDuel is the title sponsor of the Legends Classic, a college basketball event that was held Monday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Fans attending that night’s games, between Louisiana State and Marquette and between North Carolina State and Arizona State, could not help noticing FanDuel’s presence.The company’s logo was plastered on the court, on the scorer’s table, on the video screen and across electronic billboards throughout the arena. There were even FanDuel seat covers, with the company’s name prominently displayed on the front and back of the teams’ benches.The Legends Classic, which concludes with two more games on Tuesday, is being held at a difficult time for FanDuel.AdvertisementOn Nov. 10, New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, ordered FanDuel and the rival website DraftKings to stop accepting bets in the state. A hearing to consider the order is scheduled for Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.Advertisement“We are following through on a commitment that we made months ago with a very good partner before the New York A.G. issued any letter or made any case against us,” a FanDuel spokeswoman said of the Legends Classic sponsorship.The spokeswoman added that the company was continuing to fulfill all sponsorship and advertising agreements it had made. FanDuel also has partnerships with the Nets, the Jets and the Buffalo Bills.Schneiderman has said that daily fantasy sports games constitute illegal gambling. FanDuel and DraftKings have argued that daily fantasy sports are games of skill and legal under state law.Last Tuesday, Schneiderman sought a temporary injunction in State Supreme Court against FanDuel and DraftKings. He said in court papers that daily fantasy sports were “nothing more than a rebranding of sports betting” and that they were “plainly illegal.”Later that day, FanDuel temporarily suspended New York residents from competing in paid contests. DraftKings continues to operate as usual and allow New Yorkers to play its games.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

We will press on and fight to ensure that your right to play fantasy sports is protected, not just in New York but across the nation.”Despite the incongruity of its location, the Legends Classic gave FanDuel some additional exposure. The first game, in which Marquette edged No. 22 L.S.U., 81-80, featured two of the nation’s top freshmen — forwards Ben Simmons of L.S.U. and Henry Ellenson of Marquette — and they guarded each other on numerous occasions. More than 50 representatives from N.B.A. teams were on hand to watch them.AdvertisementSimmons, a versatile, 6-foot-10 left-hander projected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2016 N.B.A. draft, grew up in Australia before moving to the United States to play for Montverde Academy, a prep school in Florida. He had 21 points, 20 rebounds and 7 assists on Monday.Asked if this was a big game because he was facing Ellenson in New York, Simmons said: “Definitely not. It’s just another game to me, another team that we have to beat. Clearly we didn’t do that. I think it was a good lesson for the team. I’d rather lose now than later. For us, it’s just a learning curve.”With L.S.U. trailing by 79-78, Simmons grabbed a rebound, drove down the court and made an acrobatic layup in traffic with 21.5 seconds remaining. After the Marquette junior guard Jajuan Johnson made two free throws with 10.8 seconds left, Simmons brought the ball up the court, passed it, got it back and passed it again to the sophomore guard Jalyn Patterson, who missed a 3-point attempt from the wing as the buzzer sounded.Ellenson, a 6-foot-10 forward who is also projected as an N.B.A. lottery pick, had 16 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with 1 minute 58 seconds left. “There was a lot of spotlight on us two, but it’s a team game in the end,” Ellenson said of himself and Simmons. He added: “I have a lot of respect for Ben’s game. I thought it was a good matchup between me and him. He’s a powerful driver. I knew I could just give him a step just because he doesn’t shoot as much, but he has great passing and stuff.”In the late game, Arizona State beat North Carolina State, 79-76, to advance to the tournament title game, set for 8 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday. North Carolina State will play L.S.U. in the consolation game at 5:30 p.m.The Legends Classic is the only tournament for which FanDuel is the title sponsor, but the company was also on display at the 2K Classic at Madison Square Garden over the weekend, and its presence was hard to miss. FanDuel’s logo was visible on both baselines alongside other advertisements, and the company was featured on a rotating basis on the scorer’s table.A spokesman for the Gazelle Group, a sports marketing company based in Princeton, N.J., that runs the Legends Classic and the 2K Classic, said the company would not comment about its partnership with FanDuel.On Sunday, during a timeout with 10 minutes remaining in a game between Duke and Georgetown, the video screen displayed FanDuel’s logo as the public-address announcer promoted the company.Advertisement“Go to FanDuel.com and enter promo code ‘Prime’ to get your $200 bonus,” he said. “That’s promo code ‘Prime.’ ”A version of this article appears in print on November 24, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Fantasy Sports Site Maintains Visibility Amid a Battle.
