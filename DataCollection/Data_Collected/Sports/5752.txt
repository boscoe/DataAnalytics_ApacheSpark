They didn’t give up,” said Lundqvist, who stopped 24 shots. “They kept working hard, even though they were behind four, even five goals.”Dan Boyle made the score 4-0 with the only even-strength goal in the first, and Carl Hagelin and Jesper Fast added second-period scores for the Rangers, who won for the 10th time in 11 games by scoring the most goals in a contest this season.Brassard, Boyle, Nash and Martin St. Louis all had 2 points for the Rangers, who are heading to California for three games beginning Wednesday at Western Conference-leading Anaheim.The trip will include a visit to Los Angeles, where the Rangers will face the defending champion Kings, who beat them in last season’s Stanley Cup finals.“It’s going to be a great test for us,” Lundqvist said. “Three really good teams, and obviously some memories out there. We’ll see how it feels walking into that building. I think we’re excited to go.”The Rangers did their damage early against goalie Michal Neuvirth, who started for the second consecutive night. He was pulled for Jhonas Enroth after allowing four goals on nine shots in a span of 12:34.Including a 5-2 win at Florida on Wednesday, the Rangers have scored 11 goals in two games.Advertisement
