Week 9 Scores and HighlightsMatchup to Watch: Giants cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie vs. wide receiver Mike EvansAlthough the spotlight would fall on defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul should he be activated for the game, the performance of Rodgers-Cromartie (6 feet 2, 193 pounds) looms larger after the Giants were torched for 505 passing yards in last Sunday’s 52-49 road loss to the New Orleans Saints. Rodgers-Cromartie will be asked to contain Evans (6-5, 231), who has 24 catches for 386 yards and one touchdown. Although Evans’s talents have been somewhat overlooked, he placed second to Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. among rookies last season with 1,051 receiving yards. The Giants’ task is made somewhat easier by the absence of Vincent Jackson, the Buccaneers’ second-leading receiver. He is out with a knee injury.Number to Watch: 9The Giants rank last in the N.F.L. with nine sacks and never got to New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, who carved them up for seven touchdown passes last Sunday. It will be imperative that the Giants pressure Jameis Winston, Tampa Bay’s rookie quarterback, or it could be another brutal afternoon for the secondary. Winston is showing he was worthy of being the top pick in the draft, throwing for four touchdowns with no interceptions and compiling a 110.5 passer rating in his last three games. He has showcased his powerful arm often enough to rank second in the league with 13.4 yards per completion.Quotation of the Week: ‘You can’t be looking in the rearview mirror. You go backward.’The Giants’ defensive coordinator, STEVE SPAGNUOLO, on the need to move on from last Sunday’s debacle, in which his unit surrendered 608 net yards.Advertisement
