Bush was president and Brett Favre was a bench warmer for the Falcons. It was 1991, and Detroit was in the midst of its first winning season since 1983. Green Bay was a bottom-feeding team badly in need of a permanent solution at quarterback.Since then, the Packers have been among the most successful teams in sports thanks to Favre and then Aaron Rodgers, but they have slumped to one win in their last five games. The Lions have not had nearly as much good fortune in the past two decades, but they have won three straight as they try to climb out of last place in the N.F.C. North. Beating the Packers again, after an 18-16 victory last month, is a must if Detroit is to have a realistic chance at a playoff berth. On talent alone, the Packers have a distinct advantage, but injuries have hindered their offense, and the Lions’ resurgent defense could give them trouble. “They’re playing complete,” Packers guard T. J. Lang told reporters this week. “They’re covering. They’re putting a lot of pressure on quarterbacks, and they’re doing a great job stopping the run.”Detroit’s standout performer has been defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, whose 11 ½ sacks are only three and a half short of the franchise record set by Robert Porcher in 1999. Green Bay’s offensive line is beaten up, and Ansah may be too much for the Packers to handle.Pick: Lions  BENJAMIN HOFFMANAdvertisement
