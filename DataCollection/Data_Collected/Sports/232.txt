Will Grier threw four touchdown passes to four receivers — all in the first half — and No. 25 Florida crushed No. 3 Mississippi, 38-10, at home on Saturday night to give Coach Jim McElwain a signature win in his first season.Grier, a redshirt freshman, battled a stomach virus for two days before the game, feeling so ill that the Gators (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) thought there was a chance Treon Harris might get the nod. But Grier started and was as sharp as ever against the Rebels (4-1, 2-1).“It’s a game of adversity,” Grier said. “You’ve got to deal with adversity and move on.”Grier completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards. He was poised in the pocket, precise with every throw and even closer to perfect than he was down the stretch against Tennessee last week.McElwain became the first Florida coach since Steve Spurrier in 1990 to open his first season 5-0.CLEMSON 24, NOTRE DAME 22 Deshaun Watson threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third, and Clemson’s defense stopped DeShone Kizer on what would have been a tying 2-point conversion as the No. 12 Tigers (4-0) held on for a home win over No. 6 Notre Dame (4-1).AdvertisementTigers linebacker B. J. Goodson had an interception and a fumble recovery to halt two fourth-quarter drives by the Fighting Irish. But the biggest stop was by defensive tackle Carlos Watkins, who brought down Kizer short of the goal line with seven seconds left. Clemson then recovered Notre Dame’s onside kick and closed out the victory.AdvertisementKizer rallied Notre Dame from a 21-3 deficit in the second half with two touchdown passes, the second one a 1-yard toss to Torii Hunter Jr.ARIZONA STATE 38, U.C.L.A. 23 Mike Bercovici passed for 273 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a score, and visiting Arizona State (3-2, 1-1 Pacific-12) got its season back on track by knocking off No. 7 U.C.L.A.
