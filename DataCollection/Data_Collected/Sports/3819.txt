Pugh is recovering from a concussion and was not expected to play, but the Giants had been hopeful about Richburg, who sprained his ankle in the Giants last game on Nov. 15. The veteran John Jerry will replace Pugh, and Dallas Reynolds, a longtime N.F.L. backup, will most likely be the center. The starting tight end Larry Donnell, who has a neck injury, has also been ruled out for Sundayâ€™s game. Advertisement
