NEW ORLEANS —  With less than two minutes left in the Sugar Bowl on Thursday night, Ohio State, ahead by 7 points and having just recovered an onside kick by Alabama, tried a deep pass along the left sideline — Ohio State’s sideline.Standing near the bench, Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten Conference for 26 years, sprinted a few steps toward the field to catch a glimpse of the ball as it hurtled through the air.The pass fell incomplete, but his actions were a sign of the investment that not only Buckeyes fans, but fans of all Big Ten teams, had in the outcome of the game.The Big Ten, a conference with a rich gridiron tradition, had taken a hit to its reputation recently as its teams struggled to adjust to the fast-paced style of play popularized in the Southeastern Conference, which recently won seven straight national championships.AdvertisementYet this week has been a huge one for the Big Ten, suggesting a reversal may be on the horizon: Coach Jim Harbaugh left the San Francisco 49ers to take over Michigan’s struggling program, and three Big Ten teams won bowl games on New Year’s Day, compared with only one victory by an SEC team.AdvertisementOhio State, with a third-string quarterback under center, knocked off No. 1 Alabama, 42-35, and will face No. 2 Oregon of the Pacific-12 Conference on Jan. 12 in Arlington, Tex. It will be the first national championship game under the College Football Playoff format, and surprisingly, it will be the first one contested without an SEC team since 2006. “It’s very exciting to get into the playoff and to win,” Delany said on the field after the game, just before scarlet and gray confetti began to fall. “We’ve been a lot on the other side of these things. We’ve got to tip our hat to those that beat us. And I tip our hat when we win.”The past few days have been among the best for the Midwest since Chicago’s two World’s Fairs. From the Quick Lane Bowl on Dec. 26 between Rutgers and North Carolina to the Sugar Bowl on Thursday, Big Ten teams were frequent underdogs during bowl season. Yet they have five bowl victories, including high-profile New Year’s Day wins by Wisconsin over Auburn and by Michigan State over Baylor, not to mention that victory by Ohio State over Alabama. The SEC is 6-5 in bowl games this season.“I had a guy send me a note, half-joking, saying this may be the most depressing day of the South since Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox,” said Paul Finebaum, whose radio show is the equivalent of the Southeastern Conference’s fireside chat. “Is that hyperbole? Of course.”He added: “Alabama is the bell cow. I just think because Alabama fans accept nothing less than the national championship, it hurts even more.”After the Sugar Bowl, Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer credited the Big Ten’s success with helping his team.“I think the tide turned a little bit when Wisconsin beat Auburn,” he said. “Everybody on our team knew that. I made sure they knew that.”He continued, “I think the Big Ten Conference, the conference that we’re a part of, certainly showed that it is getting better.”AdvertisementIt was about time, added Meyer, an Ohio native, “because at some point, it gets exhausting when you keep hearing and hearing, and then you start believing.”Perhaps most eloquent of all was Ohio State linebacker Darron Lee, the game’s most valuable player on defense.“RIP SEC,” he posted on Twitter early Friday morning.On Friday afternoon, during Finebaum’s weekday radio show, SEC faithful voiced frustration.

Everyone’s enjoying it so much.” The Big Ten had been having a particularly bad year. During the regular season, its teams went 6-11 against squads from the other four major conferences and also endured several losses to the Mid-American Conference. The Big Ten’s woes began early: On Sept. 6, Ohio State, Michigan and Michigan State lost on the same day for the first time since 1988. The struggles of Michigan — college football’s winningest program, which went 5-7 this season and lost its athletic director and coach in the process — left a particularly foul stench.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Teams in the Big Ten had won only two national titles since 1971, and only one during the 16-year era of the Bowl Championship Series. In recent years, one of its premier programs, Ohio State, lost its coach, Jim Tressel, and, for a time, its bowl eligibility because of N.C.A.A. violations. Another, Penn State, endured perhaps one of the worst scandals in sports history when the longtime assistant Jerry Sandusky was found to have sexually assaulted boys.The Big Ten’s decline can possibly be traced to Jan. 8, 2007, when top-ranked Ohio State — having beaten a strong Michigan team several weeks earlier — was routed by Florida, 41-14, in the B.C.S. title game. The game began the SEC’s streak of seven straight titles (the next year, Ohio State again lost the title game, this time to Louisiana State).Perhaps not coincidentally, Florida’s coach at the time was Meyer. After winning a second championship with the Gators, in January 2009, he stepped down after the 2010 season, citing health reasons and amid reports of an out-of-control locker room. He took over the Buckeyes before the 2012 season.AdvertisementNow, the high-profile victories and the hiring of a top-level coach at Michigan to oppose Meyer — which has some people dreaming of the days of Bo Schembechler and Woody Hayes — have many in the conference thinking that happy days are here again.Mike Riley, whom Nebraska hired from Oregon State at the end of the season, could relate.“It’s all cyclical,” he said.
                We’ve published maps showing where fan support for one team begins and another ends for baseball and basketball. Now we’re pleased to offer another one: the United States according to college football fans.            “We’ve gone through years of an identity crisis with the Pac-12, and we’ve always maintained we can be as competitive as anybody,” Riley said Friday, referring to his former conference. “It’s taken some time to prove that on the field, but that’s the beauty of college football.”The Big Ten may still have structural disadvantages, including a comparative lack of homegrown high school talent. Meyer, with his national prominence and ties to the recruiting-rich Southeast, provides a good antidote to this. (Running back Ezekiel Elliott, the Sugar Bowl’s most valuable player on offense, is from Missouri, whose flagship university is in the SEC.) Ohio produces, by far, the most top recruits of any Big Ten state, and unlike Michigan, Michigan State and Penn State, the Buckeyes do not compete with other in-state programs from the so-called Big 5 conferences.Meyer, who at Utah more than a decade ago helped innovate the spread offense that has taken over several conferences, knows how to recruit for what is typically referred to as SEC speed, and then he puts it to good use.“Obviously, they have really good personnel, and they’ve got guys who can fly,” Ohio State linebacker Joshua Perry said of Alabama. “But I think we’ve got some guys who can fly, too.”Perry, who had five tackles, pointed out that the four-team playoff could prove a better vehicle for putting the Big Ten back on the map than the two-team B.C.S. After all, if the B.C.S. were operating this season, the title game would almost certainly have featured some combination of Alabama, Oregon and Florida State — which is to say, no Big Ten team.On Friday, that notion was particularly painful for Alabama fans.“It’s also the reality of the playoff,” Finebaum said. “There’s such a drop-off. When you lose that semifinal game, it’s like you were never there.”Still, many supporters of the SEC were taking the loss in stride. It is one loss, they said.“There’s a lot the SEC has done,” said Eric Hyman, the athletic director at Texas A&M, who was previously at South Carolina. “They’ve competed on a high level consistently. The credibility hasn’t evaporated with one game.”AdvertisementFor now, the Big Ten and the Pac-12 can celebrate.“Everyone knows that we haven’t had our way for the last seven or eight years,” Delany said after the game. “So we had a good day. We should feel good about it, as disappointed as we’ve been. Narratives don’t change until the facts on the ground change.”A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Dazing SEC Titans, Big Ten Lives Up to Its Adjective.
