The two-time French Open finalist Robin Soderling is retiring because of illness. Soderling, 31, who ended Rafael Nadal’s 31-match winning streak at the French Open in 2009, has never fully recovered since contracting glandular fever in 2011, when he last played competitively. Soderling rose as high as No. 4 and reached the final at Roland Garros in 2009 and 2010.■ Australia will host the United States in their Davis Cup opener next year at Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club in Melbourne, the site of the Australian Open until the event moved to Melbourne Park in 1988. Kooyong’s show court, normally a hardcourt, will revert to grass for the Davis Cup tie, set for March 4-6.
