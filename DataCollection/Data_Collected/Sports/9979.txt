OMAHA —  They had one conversation about it. One. And it was not even formal.The way Wichita State Coach Gregg Marshall recalls it, he asked Kansas Coach Bill Self about reviving the long-dormant nonconference series between their two programs several years ago at a Rotary Club of Wichita event called Hoopapalooza. The teams last played each other in 1993, a 103-54 Kansas rout in Lawrence, long before either coach assumed his current job.“I said, ‘Hey, we should play,’ ” Marshall said.Self’s reaction?“He laughed it off,” Marshall said. “It wasn’t a negotiation or anything. I never called his office to follow up.”Marshall did not because he sensed the conversation would go nowhere. He and Self are acquaintances, not friends. Self described their relationship as cordial and professional. Kansas already plays one of the toughest schedules in Division I, and why would Self toughen it further? For Kansans, this is their Kentucky-Louisville standoff, natural geographic rivals who played only three times between 1948 and 1983, and only because they had to in the N.C.A.A. tournament.So Sunday, when the second-seeded Jayhawks (27-8) and the No. 7 Shockers (29-4) meet up in the Midwest Region’s second round at CenturyLink Center, geography meets reality at last. Thousands of Kansas fans are already in town, outnumbering Wichita State rooters, three to one, by the looks of Friday’s afternoon session, when both teams played.AdvertisementIt is a dream game for the Wichita State junior guard Ron Baker, a boyhood Kansas fan from Scott City, Kan., who hung a poster of the Jayhawks star Kirk Hinrich on his bedroom door.“Every morning I woke up, I saw Kirk Hinrich before I went to go brush my teeth,” Baker said.Kansas never seriously recruited Baker, who leads the Shockers in scoring. Self now calls that a mistake.“I’m just glad he didn’t,” Marshall said. “He’s got plenty of good players.”The game reunites Kansas forward Perry Ellis and Wichita State guard Evan Wessel, friends since middle school who won three state 6A titles together at Wichita Heights High School. Sunday, they may guard each other. Kansas offered Wessel a football scholarship, as a safety, but he chose basketball and Wichita State instead.“My heart was always with basketball,” Wessel said. “I’m glad they offered me the opportunity, but I’m glad with my decision.”Said Ellis, who spurned Wichita State for Kansas, “He’s a great guy, and it’s going to be fun to get to play against each other again.”AdvertisementTo a man, the Jayhawks reduced the game to the next step toward the round of 16, nothing more. Which makes sense. Kansas is the legacy program, the one with the five national championships, the arena named for a Hall of Fame coach, Phog Allen, and the court honoring the game’s inventor, James A. Naismith, the Jayhawks’ first coach and the only one with a losing record — 55-60.It’s a much bigger deal for Wichita State. Though no longer upstarts after four consecutive N.C.A.A. appearances and a Final Four run in 2013, the Shockers still come off as the brash hipsters taking on the establishment, the Joe Namath-led Jets to the Giants, circa 1968.“It’s exciting,” Baker said. “Every Kansas kid growing up wants to be in my shoes — small-town kid, playing against K.U.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Marshall gladly contributed to the hyperbole Friday afternoon, less than hour after the Shockers beat Indiana, 81-76, to advance. He called Sunday’s game the Battle of Omaha, a riff on the 1981 N.C.A.A. tournament game renowned to fans from the state as the Battle of New Orleans. The Shockers, with the future N.B.A. players Cliff Levingston and Antoine Carr, won, 66-65, in the round of 16, with the backup Mike Jones hitting the winning jumper with four seconds left.Before that, the teams had not played in 25 years. They met nine times from 1984 to 1993, with Kansas winning eight. But not since.“I’m not going to lie,” Self said. “I think there are certain games that are big, and I think this is one of those games that is bigger. I’m not going to sell it that way to the players or anything like that, but they get it. They know it’s a big game. They know it’s bragging rights in the state.”And here is the crazy thing: Wichita State, the lower seed, may be the better team. Fred VanVleet, who tied his career high with 27 points against Indiana, and Baker are among the best guard tandems in the country. Ellis has not been the same player since returning last week from a sprained right knee. He had only 9 points and 2 rebounds Friday against New Mexico State, when the Jayhawks rode nine 3-pointers to win by 75-56.“It’s obviously very emotional for our fans both ways, a great atmosphere for college basketball in general, and great for our state,” Wessel said. “But as far as the players go, it’s a chance to go to the Sweet 16, and that’s how we’re going to treat it.”A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: An Unfulfilled Rivalry Receives a Little Help.
