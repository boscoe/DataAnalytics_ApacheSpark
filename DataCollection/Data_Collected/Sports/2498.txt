Week 9 Scores and HighlightsThe Jets are looking to get back on the winning track after losing two straight on the road, to New England and Oakland, but they will have to do it with some injuries at quarterback. Coach Todd Bowles announced Wednesday that Ryan Fitzpatrick would start despite sustaining a torn ligament in his nonthrowing thumb last week. His backup, Geno Smith, is nursing a shoulder injury. Of equal concern is the Jets’ defense, which started the season strong but gave up 30 points or more in each of the aforementioned losses, while forcing no turnovers in either game.The Jaguars are a half-game out of first place in the A.F.C. South — which says everything you need to know about that division — and have the N.F.L.’s easiest schedule the rest of the way. The thought of a 5-11 or 6-10 Jaguars team hosting a playoff game in January is both ridiculously hilarious and wildly infuriating. And yet it could happen.PICK: JETSAdvertisement
