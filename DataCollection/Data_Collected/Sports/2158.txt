Sixty-five volunteers for New York Road Runners gathered early Sunday on the west side of Central Park to tackle an unusual job: stripping 52,000 metalized blankets from industrial-size rolls several hours before the start of the New York City Marathon.Piles of the blankets soon formed large, shimmering shrubs on the side of the road, about 100 yards beyond the finish line, where they awaited the sweat-soaked masses.“They’ve really become part of the mystique,” said Lee Troop, an elite-level coach.Heatsheets, as the branded blankets are known, have become synonymous with the marathon. Designed to help ward off hypothermia, the blankets are as much marketing vehicle as medical device. This year’s version, which measured roughly 6 feet by 4 feet and weighed three ounces, featured advertisements for United Airlines, Foot Locker and Tata Consultancy Services, the marathon’s title sponsor.But they were also keepsakes for finishers who trundled toward subway stations looking like giant, tinfoil-wrapped burritos. Peter Ciaccia, the race director, said he was still in possession of the first Heatsheet he had earned as a marathoner.AdvertisementDavid Deigan, the 74-year-old founder of Heatsheets, was stationed near the finish line with his daughter, Stephanie, the company’s director of events. Heatsheets are seemingly everywhere these days, having cornered about 95 percent of the marathon market in the United States, according to Lacie Whyte, the company’s vice president. But they were born in New York.Advertisement“So this is a big, big thing for us,” David Deigan said.In 1979, Deigan ran the New York City Marathon for the second time. As finishers snaked north along a path in Central Park, Deigan observed that race officials were handing out thin, metallic blankets. He took one. At the time, Deigan was a sales manager for a metalizing company that manufactured products used for aerospace insulation.“And lots of other things,” he said, “but I’d never seen it used for people. So I was kind of fascinated by what was going on.”A few months later, Deigan said, a co-worker received a phone call from Allan Steinfeld of New York Road Runners. Steinfeld essentially operated as the right-hand man for Fred Lebow, the marathon’s legendary co-founder, and Steinfeld wanted to know if the company would be willing to donate finish-line blankets in exchange for advertising.Deigan’s co-worker, who was a chain smoker and not particularly susceptible to the marathon’s charms, was unimpressed. Deigan, though, was intrigued. He called Steinfeld and presented an idea: Why not sell the advertising space on the blankets? He would be happy to manufacture them. Steinfeld invited Deigan to meet with Lebow the following day.When Deigan arrived for his appointment, he was greeted by Lebow’s personal assistant. She offered valuable advice.“She said, ‘You have about two and a half minutes with Fred, so know what you’re going to say — and say it with authority or you’ll be out the door in three minutes,’ ” Deigan recalled.Deigan wound up getting five minutes and left with an order for 8,000 blankets. His original design was fairly elaborate: two layers of metalized polyester and “all kinds of other stuff you don’t really need,” he said. (DuPont and NASA are widely credited with much of the early technology.) Deigan’s blankets were remarkably thin and nearly bulletproof.Advertisement“Totally unnecessary,” Deigan said. “But people could use them forever.”There were drawbacks, sadly. His original blankets were relatively expensive to produce and difficult to handle. They came in stacks but tended to stick together because of a static charge, so they had to be separated and rolled individually by hand. Deigan would sort them on a Ping-Pong table in his garage in Ridgewood, N.J.

Later, he used a plastic called polyethylene that was treated with aluminum on one side. Gone was the static charge. And because the plastic material could be perforated, the new and improved blankets came on huge rolls. They could be separated like paper towels. It was a success.“It put my kids through college,” said Deigan, who sold the company last year but remains involved.Caroline Rotich, a marathoner from Kenya, could not recall the first time she encountered Heatsheets, only that they had left an impression.“I was like, ‘What do you do with this?’ ” said Rotich, who placed 10th in the women’s field Sunday. “And then I saw everyone was covering themselves with it. So I did, too. And it was warm.”The human body’s temperature rises over the course of the marathon. Even after completing the race, marathoners continue to shed heat. But if the conditions are cold, they could lose that heat too rapidly and run the risk of hypothermia, a dangerous drop in core body temperature.“Your body is still trying to get rid of that extra heat, even though it’s colder outside,” said Dr. Alexis Colvin, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital. “You can become hypothermic if your body hasn’t quite re-established the balance between getting rid of the heat and keeping the heat in.”More than merely acting as a layer of insulation, Heatsheets work as a radiant barrier — a fancy way of describing how they keep people warm. The human body constantly emits low-level radiation. But if you take a reflective material, such as aluminum, and wrap it around you, more than 90 percent of the body’s own radiation will rebound off the material and strike your skin, triggering a thermal reaction.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bartoletti, 58, ran her 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday, which might sound like a lot until you consider that it was her 320th marathon over all — and, by her estimation, her 26th or 27th marathon this year.“But who’s counting?” she asked.Bartoletti, who teaches elementary school in the Pittsburgh area, tends to know the tricks of the trade. Before the start Sunday, she used an old Heatsheet — the one she had been awarded for completing the Columbus Marathon on Oct. 18 — to help stay warm.Bartoletti really likes the blankets, which she described as “the best thing ever.” She has an emergency supply of about a dozen at home, she said. She keeps one in her glove box in case her car breaks down. She even stows one in her carry-on luggage whenever she flies.“Sometimes the planes are cold,” she said.She also gives inexperienced marathon runners helpful hints. She asks them what they do with their blankets. Most say they plan to use it right after the race, then toss it in the trash.“No!” Bartoletti says. “Don’t throw it away!”Not everyone shares her passion. Brady Flanagan, 32, who entered his first New York marathon on Sunday, ran the Chicago Marathon last year. Upon finishing in Chicago, Flanagan took his Heatsheet, wore it for about 10 minutes and then discarded it. Did it do any good?“I don’t even remember, actually,” he said. “I was a little out of it at that point.”A version of this article appears in print on November 2, 2015, on Page F8 of the New York edition with the headline: Coated With Metal.
