The suspended FIFA president Sepp Blatter was treated at a hospital on Friday but was expected to be released shortly, his lawyer said. An adviser to Mr. Blatter said the incident was “related to stress.”“Because there have been media inquiries, I am announcing that President Blatter is in the hospital for a medical checkup,” Mr. Blatter’s lawyer, Richard Cullen, said in a statement. “He is fine and expects to be home shortly.”
                Scandal and accusations have dotted the FIFA reign of Sepp Blatter.            The adviser to Mr. Blatter, Klaus Stöhlker, said Mr. Blatter was seeking an evaluation from doctors and was “quite fine.” Mr. Stöhlker said reports that Mr. Blatter was ill had emerged after he canceled two media sessions this week.“He did not collapse,” Mr. Stöhlker said. “I was not with him, but someone else with him the day before yesterday said, ‘You don’t look so well,’ and told him to call the doctor.”Mr. Blatter, 79, was suspended by FIFA on Oct. 8 amid a corruption investigation by the Swiss authorities. FIFA’s president since 1998, he has appealed the suspension but has been prohibited from all activities related to soccer — including visits to his office at FIFA headquarters — until he is cleared. He has occasionally granted interviews in recent weeks but has otherwise kept a low profile in his native Switzerland.“I am expecting to see him back next Thursday and Friday,” Mr. Stöhlker said. “I don’t expect any issues.” (NYT)A version of this article appears in print on November 7, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: FIFA President Is in Hospital .
