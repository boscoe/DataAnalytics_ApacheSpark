Week 10 scores and highlightsThe Patriots have been a dominant team in the Bill Belichick era, but the Giants have been a thorn in their side. When the Patriots and the Giants last faced off in a regular-season game in New Jersey, in 2007, New England was on its way to a perfect regular season. The Patriots won that game, but the Giants went on to upset them in the Super Bowl a few weeks later and again in the 2012 Super Bowl. Giants Coach Tom Coughlin is 5-1 against Belichick.But the Giants enter the game last in the N.F.L. in total defense, and one has to wonder if they can contain an explosive Patriots offense led by quarterback Tom Brady, who has rarely looked better than he has through the first eight games of this season. Brady is no doubt licking his chops after watching film of Drew Brees shredding the Giants’ secondary for 505 yards and 52 points without being sacked in Week 8. Still, the recently returned Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul is confident his presence will lead to some changes.“They’re undefeated, but they have to come through here,” Pierre-Paul told reporters after practice on Wednesday. “We’ll get to the quarterback. I’m sure of it. I know I will.”Unfortunately for the Giants, Michael Strahan and Justin Tuck will not also be returning to suit up on Sunday.PICK: PatriotsAdvertisement
