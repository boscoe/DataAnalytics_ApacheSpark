Welcome to Week 4!The N.F.L. season is getting to the point where it is harder to find solid players on the waiver wire, but there are still a few gems out there. Whether he is a one-week fill-in or somebody worth holding on to has yet to be determined, but each of these players are worth adding this week.(Note: I am trying to hold to a 40 percent owned and under threshold on waiver pickups. If there is a player who is not listed below, he is likely to be above that threshold.)Derek Carr, RaidersDon’t look now, but the Raiders seem to have a pulse on offense (and a very strong one, at that). With some legitimate weapons around him in Amari Cooper, Latavius Murray and Michael Crabtree, Carr has been able to take a big step forward in his second N.F.L. season and is the 12th best fantasy quarterback thus far. While his 5-to-1 touchdown-to-interception ratio might be tough to sustain, he has an easy matchup against the Bears this week and should be considered as a fantasy starter for this week (and beyond).
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Michael Vick, SteelersWith Ben Roethlisberger set to miss at least four weeks — some reports have him returning near the six-week end of his timetable — Vick will be handed the keys to what many in the preseason were calling the best offense in the N.F.L. We all know Vick’s drawbacks (he is mistake-prone and not exactly durable), but he has never played with a collection of weapons like Le’Veon Bell, Antonio Brown and (starting next week) Martavis Bryant. As long as Vick stays upright, he should be able to provide QB1 numbers for fantasy owners as he fills in for Big Ben.AdvertisementAlso consider: Alex Smith, Jameis Winston, Blake Bortles, Ryan Fitzpatrick.Karlos Williams, BillsBefore the latest news about LeSean McCoy came out, the argument for Williams was that he was the only running back in the N.F.L. to score a touchdown in each of his first three games. Now that McCoy is doubtful for this week’s game against the Giants, Williams is not only a must add, he’s a must-start! His 7.8-yards-per-carry average is sure to decrease as he gets more work, but he should be picked up in every fantasy league.AdvertisementAntonio Andrews, TitansAndrews does not exactly have a superstar pedigree (and I’m not sure we should be targeting players in the Titans backfield), but we should never pass up an opportunity to grab a potential starting running back. While it is possible Ken Whisenhunt wakes up tomorrow and decides to start Bishop Sankey, Dexter McCluster, or Terrance West, Andrews seems to have the inside track. I’d like to see more out of him before I consider starting him in my fantasy lineup, but he averaged 4.1 yards per carry on 12 carries last week and found the end zone. He could be back on the waivers within two weeks, but Andrews should be added for now.Also consider: Thomas Rawls, Bilal Powell, Lance Dunbar.Marvin Jones, BengalsRemember two years ago, when Jones had touchdown receptions? You might have forgotten because he caught only nine balls in 2014, but the touchdown-maker is back with two scores in three games in 2015. With Andy Dalton taking the next step in his development, Jones is a must add and should be considered as a player to start this week against a Chiefs defense that is allowing the most fantasy points per game to opposing wide receivers.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He posted his second consecutive 100-yard game against the Bills last weekend. Sure, some of those yards came in garbage time, but fantasy points count the same either way and Matthews is a top 10 receiver in standard leagues. I would not trip over myself to get him, as his statistics are a little misleading, but he should be owned in all leagues just in case he is able to hold off Parker for the Dolphins’ WR2 spot.Also consider: Cecil Shorts, Jermaine Kearse, Cole Beasley, Ty Montgomery, Ted Ginn, Rueben Randle.Charles Clay, BillsWith Sammy Watkins looking as if he might miss at least a week, Clay is poised to get some more love in the Bills offense (he is already in the top 12 in targets among tight ends). Clay has scored a touchdown in two straight games and has seen a whopping 50 percent of the Bills’ red zone targets (fourth among tight ends). If you need help at tight end, Clay should be your top target.Richard Rodgers, PackersWith 12 points in standard leagues separating the second best and 11th best tight end, fantasy owners have been just throwing darts so far. One touchdown would put Rodgers among the 12 best at the position. With Davante Adams likely to miss some time, we’d like to see Aaron Rodgers rely on his tight end a bit more and you can certainly do worse than starting a player who will be catching passes from the N.F.L.’s touchdown leader.Also consider: Crockett Gillmore, Gary Barnidge, Jared Cook.Nick Raducanu is the owner of ProjectRoto.com and is a contributor to Rotoworld and 4for4.com.
