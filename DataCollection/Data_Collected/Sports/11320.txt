CreditDon Emmert/Agence France-Presse        Of all the impressive aspects of Jordan Spieth’s Masters victory on Sunday, one stands out: He did it wire to wire.Spieth was the fifth player in Masters history to be alone at the top of the leaderboard after every round. The last to do it was Raymond Floyd in 1976. The others were Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960 and Jack Nicklaus in 1972.Tiger Woods has had many memorable moments at Augusta National Golf Club, with four titles, but he has never led wire to wire. The closest he came was in his first victory, in 1997, when he took the lead after two rounds. He had trailed John Huston, Paul Stankowski and Paul Azinger after one.The term “wire to wire” originated in horse racing — a wire once stretched across the start and finish lines.Though the Kentucky Derby dates to 1875, only 22 times has the winner led wire to wire. The most recent was War Emblem in 2002.AdvertisementRacing fans sometimes have a bias against front-runners, who are often derided for having “cheap speed.” War Emblem got his share of that criticism, although he went on to win the Preakness. And two of the wire-to-wire Derby winners won the Triple Crown: Sir Barton in 1919 and Count Fleet in 1943.Advertisement(Although Seattle Slew is thought of as a front-runner, he broke slowly in his 1977 Derby victory and did not take the lead until just before the first turn.)Winning most auto races wire to wire is difficult because pit stops tend to shuffle the running order. It has never happened at the Indianapolis 500, although Billy Arnold led for 198 of the 200 laps in 1930, taking the lead on Lap 3 and never relinquishing it. The record for laps led in an Indianapolis 500 this century is held by Juan Pablo Montoya, with 167 in 2000.Spare a thought for Ralph DePalma, who took the lead at Lap 3 in 1912, eventually got five laps ahead of the field, then had a mechanical failure and came to a halt on Lap 199. Despite his and his mechanic’s effort to push the car to the finish, he placed 11th.Wire-to-wire wins are more common in Formula One, in which passing can be difficult. On Sunday, Lewis Hamilton won the Chinese Grand Prix wire to wire.In Major League Baseball, only five teams have led in the standings every day of the season and then won the World Series: the 1927 Yankees, who are often cited as the greatest team of all time; the 1955 Dodgers, who won Brooklyn’s only World Series title; the 1984 Detroit Tigers, who started the season 35-5; the 1990 Cincinnati Reds, who swept the favored Oakland Athletics in the Series; and the 2005 Chicago White Sox, who were 11-1 in the playoffs.Seven college basketball teams have led every Associated Press poll and then won the national championship, and four of those were U.C.L.A. teams. The most recent to do it was the Duke team of Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley and Grant Hill in 1991-92. Kentucky had a chance to join them this season before losing in the national semifinals.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Since 1950, when the preseason poll was started, only two teams have led every poll: Florida State in 1999 and Southern California in 2004. (The N.C.A.A. took away two of U.S.C.’s wins and its Bowl Championship Series title as a result of the investigation into gifts to running back Reggie Bush.)So grabbing an early lead can be a ticket to sports immortality. But the critical part is holding that lead.Before Spieth, the last player to lead the Masters for the first three rounds was Greg Norman in 1996. That ended badly. Norman lost a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo, the eventual winner, and earned the wrong kind of immortality.A version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2015, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Spieth Joins an Elite Pack of Front-Runners.
