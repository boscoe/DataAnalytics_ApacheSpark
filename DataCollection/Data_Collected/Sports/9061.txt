Wayne has been part of 143 wins, a club record, and ranks second in franchise history in receptions (1,070), yards receiving (14,345) and touchdown catches (80). Indianapolis, his only N.F.L. team, selected him in the first round of the 2001 draft. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in October 2013 and injured his left elbow last October. ■ The Panthers signed the free-agent offensive tackle Michael Oher to a two-year contract. Oher, the subject of the popular movie “The Blind Side,” is a veteran of six N.F.L. seasons. He started 11 games last season for the Titans and helped the Ravens win Super Bowl XLVII after the 2012 season. (AP)Advertisement
