The United States national men’s soccer team starts down the long road to the 2018 World Cup on Friday night, but despite a string of disappointing recent results, its first step does not figure to be a steep one.The Americans’ opponent on Friday in St. Louis is St. Vincent and the Grenadines, a young team of largely part-time players that is ranked 129th in the world. (The Americans, despite only one win in their past six games, are 33rd in the FIFA rankings.)Yet regardless of the result at Busch Stadium, or in the Americans’ next test, at Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday, it is worth remembering that the path to the World Cup is long and full of twists and turns.The United States will potentially play 16 games in qualifying. The first six will come in the current round, a four-team round-robin group that includes St. Vincent, Trinidad and Guatemala, and does not end until September 2016. The top two teams advance to the final round, 10 games in a six-team hexagonal that runs until October 2017.AdvertisementThe most important thing to remember, however, is that many of the players who begin the World Cup journey will not be around when it ends. United States Coach Jurgen Klinsmann used 38 players in the last qualifying cycle, and less than half made the roster for Brazil.AdvertisementA quick look at a few lineups from that run shows just how much things can change.The Americans opened qualifying for the 2014 World Cup more than two years before the tournament, with a game against Antigua and Barbuda on June 8, 2012, in Tampa, Fla. Their starters that day included veterans (Steve Cherundolo and Carlos Bocanegra), an experimental left back (Jose Torres) and a striker Klinsmann thought would be the answer (Herculez Gomez).
            Here is tonight’s USMNT lineup: Howard, Cherundolo, Bocanegra, Goodson, Torres (LB); Edu, Jones, Bradley, Donovan, Dempsey; Gomez        The Americans won, 3-1, and the core of that group got the United States through the first round with a 4-1-1 record. But by the time the final-round hexagonal started in February 2013 in Honduras, Klinsmann had made big changes.

Johnson; Dempsey, Altidore        Cherundolo was gone — he played his last game for the national team in October 2012, and retired as a player before the World Cup began — but so was Bocanegra, dropped on game day for Omar Gonzalez. There were new backs on either side (the German-American Timmy Chandler became cap-tied to the United States by starting, and Fabian Johnson played on the left), and two attackers (Eddie Johnson and Jozy Altidore) who Klinsmann thought would be the answer.The Americans lost that day, 2-1, but wound up cruising through the more difficult teams in the group and punching their ticket to Brazil. By the time the team kicked off its opener against Ghana, the lineup had only hints of the one that had started the journey in Tampa.

Howard will be 39 when the next World Cup kicks off. Jones will be 36, Dempsey 35.Klinsmann knows this — he called qualifying “a long marathon” this week — and for that reason he included only 11 players from the 2014 World Cup team on the roster for the St. Vincent and Trinidad matches, and instead invited a group of younger players that included defender Matt Miazga, 20; midfielder Darlington Nagbe, 25; and forwards Bobby Wood, 22, Jordan Morris, 21, and Gyasi Zardes, 24.“You have to water the seeds and watch them grow,” Klinsmann told USSoccer.com this week. “We’ve been bringing these guys along for the last year as part of the transition period, and it’s time for them to prove their point.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
