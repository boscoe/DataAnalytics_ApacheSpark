The deal is worth at least $500 million, said a person briefed on the details of the agreement who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. The deal will start on July 1. The contract calls for the N.B.A. to receive a guaranteed payment of $500 million, with $200 million more expected through a revenue-sharing arrangement between the league and Tencent, a social media powerhouse, through its WeChat service. A study released this week ranked Tencent the most valuable brand in China, worth $66 billion.The deal builds on an existing one with Tencent and makes it the league’s exclusive official digital partner in China. One of the initiatives will be the creation of N.B.A. League Pass in China, which will let fans watch games online and on their mobile devices. The deal also allows for interactive gaming and the sale of merchandise. The league believes it will reach hundreds of millions of daily users.The deal is another element in the league’s decades-long plunge into China, where basketball is the No. 1 team sport, played by an estimated 300 million people. N.B.A. games were first televised in China in 1987, and the league has staged 18 games there since 2004. It has 18 media partners in China, and N.B.A.-licensed apparel and footwear is carried in thousands of stores. In 2008, the N.B.A. China subsidiary was established, run by a former leader of Microsoft’s China operations. Advertisement
