Clemson (8-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), which has not been the top-ranked team in an Associated Press poll since just after the 1981 season, was named No. 1 in the first College Football Playoff rankings of this season, which were released Tuesday night.Rounding out the top four, in order, were Louisiana State (7-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference), Ohio State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) and Alabama (7-1, 4-1 SEC). Independent Notre Dame (7-1) was fifth, and Baylor (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) was sixth.The Big 12 teams Baylor and Texas Christian (8-0, 5-0) dropped substantially compared with the A.P. poll. Baylor, No. 2 in the A.P. poll, is sixth in the playoff rankings, and T.C.U. is No. 5 in the poll but No. 8 in the rankings. This is bound to prove a fraught subject with fans because those two teams both finished last season 11-1 and were the first two left out of the four-team playoff.Jeff Long, the athletic director at Arkansas and the committee’s chairman, emphasized the preliminary nature of the rankings.Advertisement“Strength of schedule left us uncertain of those teams’ strength,” he said on ESPN, pointing to Baylor and T.C.U. and the relatively poor standing of their opponents so far. He added, “They have their strength-of-schedules in front of them.”In the coming month, both Baylor and T.C.U. play Oklahoma State, which is undefeated and ranked No. 14 by the committee, and Oklahoma, which has one loss and is ranked 15th — as well as each other.More broadly, the rankings merely established pecking order as top teams proceed to face one another. For instance, this Saturday, Clemson hosts Florida State, No. 16 in the playoff rankings, and L.S.U. travels to Alabama. Two weeks later, Ohio State hosts Michigan State, the committee’s seventh-best squad.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            The 12-member selection committee will release rankings every Tuesday until Sunday, Dec. 6, when it will establish the composition of the four-team playoff after the regular-season and conference championship games are completed. The No. 1 and No. 4 teams and the No. 2 and No. 3 teams will play each other in the semifinals on the afternoon and night of Dec. 31 at the Orange Bowl and the Cotton Bowl. (The No. 1 team will be placed where it has greater home-field advantage.) The winners will play for the national title on Jan. 11 in Glendale, Ariz.The committee, which includes several sitting athletic directors as well as figures like the former Nebraska coach Tom Osborne and Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, also will establish the matchups for the Peach Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl.AdvertisementThe SEC dominated the initial rankings, with two teams in the top four, three in the top 10 and six over all. By contrast, the Pacific-12 had only three teams in the rankings — as many as the American Athletic Conference.The Big Ten also placed three teams in the top 10, suggesting that if any of them — Ohio State, Michigan State or Iowa (ninth) — remains undefeated and wins the conference, it will be a prime candidate for a high playoff spot.The Pac-12, which produced last year’s runner-up, Oregon, was the only major conference to place no teams in the top 10. Its two one-loss contenders, Stanford and Utah, were ranked 11th and 12th. The two could meet in the conference championship game Dec. 5; Stanford hosts Notre Dame the week before.Long singled out Clemson for its victory against Notre Dame and four wins over winning teams, as well as for its balance on offense and defense. Clemson has the Football Bowl Subdivision’s 11th-best scoring offense, averaging more than 40 points per game, and its 19th-best scoring defense, allowing 17.6 points per game.Perhaps the most surprising trend was the lack of emphasis on winning percentage. While that metric ultimately played a big role in last year’s final rankings, in these rankings, two one-loss teams were ranked above several undefeated teams.This was especially surprising in the case of Alabama, which lost at home to Mississippi, No. 18 in the playoff rankings.Defending Alabama’s placement, Long referred to “games that they’ve won against quality opponents,” identifying neutral-site and road victories against Wisconsin, Georgia and Texas A&M, which the committee ranked 19th.Further nitpicking was invited by specific permutations. While Florida (7-1, 5-1 SEC) beat Ole Miss at home, the Gators trailed the Crimson Tide by six spots, at No. 10.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As during the Bowl Championship Series era, there is anxiety that although teams outside the power conferences are technically able to qualify to play for a national title, in practice, the means of selecting contestants might exclude them.As Long described Memphis in a conference call with reporters, it sounded as if he was describing a team ranked in the top five.“Offensively, they’ve performed very well,” he said, adding that the victory over Ole Miss, which defeated Alabama, helped move Memphis into that consideration. “They have two other wins against teams with better than .500 records.”Memphis still has two road games against teams ranked by the committee, Houston (25th) and Temple (22nd), as well as a conference championship game.“Change is guaranteed,” Long said, “and that is what makes college football exciting.”A version of this article appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Clemson Is Atop First Playoff Rankings .
