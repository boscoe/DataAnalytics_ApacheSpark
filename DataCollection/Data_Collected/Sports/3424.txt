1 p.m., CBSMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: J. J. Watt vs. the Jets’ offenseWatt is the most dominant defensive player in the N.F.L., and his statistics — 16 tackles for loss, nine and a half sacks, five pass deflections, a forced fumble — do not do him justice. “He reminds me of the way we used to have to handle Howie Long — same type of player,” said Chan Gailey, the Jets’ offensive coordinator. “You have to know where he is, and you have to account for him every play.” Even though Watt plays on the right side most of the time, he will move around just enough to influence, and complicate, the Jets’ play-calling. Watt stands to benefit from the presence of the pass-rusher extraordinaire Jadeveon Clowney (back), who missed Houston’s last game.NUMBER TO WATCH: 10That is how many consecutive quarters the Texans have played since allowing their last touchdown. Houston held the Bengals to two field goals in its upset victory Monday, a week after doing the same in a win against the Titans.QUOTATION OF THE WEEK: ‘I’m still dumb sometimes, but I’ve definitely grown a lot as a player in five years.’T.

YATES, Houston’s backup quarterback, who will start in place of the injured Brian Hoyer (concussion).A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Jets at Texans.
