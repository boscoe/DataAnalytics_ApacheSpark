When he was a boy in Lexington, Ky., Brian Cashman never had visions of becoming the Yankees’ general manager. He was not from the Bronx. He was being raised in bluegrass country, where basketball is king and children daydream of playing for the University of Kentucky.“I think every kid in Kentucky has that dream,” Cashman said.Cashman’s fantasy was so specific it included the ways he would help beat Denny Crum’s Louisville Cardinals, Kentucky’s hated cross-state rival. His family lived about a 15-minute drive from Rupp Arena, where the Wildcats play, and Cashman cherished the times his father got tickets. They would see players like Sam Bowie, Mel Turpin and later Rex Chapman, as well as visiting stars like Dominique Wilkins of Georgia and Auburn’s Charles Barkley.And years later, when he did become the Yankees’ general manager and he indulged in rough-and-tumble basketball games on the playgrounds outside Yankee Stadium, Cashman was fond of noting the symmetry between his favorite basketball team and the baseball club that employed him.Between 1949 and 1998, every time Kentucky won the national championship, the Yankees won the World Series. It happened in 1949; 1951; 1958; 1978; 1996, when Cashman was the assistant general manager of the Yankees; and then again in 1998, which was Cashman’s first season in charge.AdvertisementThis was especially gratifying for Cashman, who loved to point out this winning connection to the Yankees’ media relations personnel and encourage them to highlight it in the team’s daily notes package. But the streak came crashing to a halt in 2012 when Kentucky, under Coach John Calipari, won still another title, and the Yankees did not, getting swept in the American League Championship Series by the Detroit Tigers.AdvertisementBut there is hope anew. The Wildcats, who play West Virginia in the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. tournament Thursday night in Cleveland, are heavy favorites to win it all again this year. This might, in fact, be the best Kentucky team Cashman has ever seen. Kentucky is four wins from an undefeated record and a ninth N.C.A.A. crown.The Yankees are not considered favorites to win the World Series in 2015, but the season has not even started, so anything can still happen. And Cashman will like his chances just a little bit better if Kentucky wins this year’s N.C.A.A. final April 6, the day the Yankees open the season in the Bronx.Cashman acknowledges that as much as he loves basketball, he was never a great player and was never going to be the point guard for Joe B. Hall’s Kentucky squads. Indeed, at Lexington Catholic High School, Cashman never made it higher than the junior varsity, although that group was pretty talented and included Frank Kornet, a 6-foot-9-inch forward who went on to star at Vanderbilt and play two years in the N.B.A.But if Cashman did not have had the size or skill to play varsity basketball, he was still somewhat of a freakish athlete. He ran like a greyhound and, despite being only 5-7, could regularly dunk a tennis ball and sometimes a volleyball.“I was Spud Webb,” he said with a laugh. “I could jump out of my shoes.”But the 5-6 Webb, who won the slam dunk competition at the 1986 N.B.A. All-Star Game, could also shoot. Cashman could not.In his junior year of high school, Cashman transferred to Georgetown Prep in Bethesda, Md., where he played one more year of junior varsity basketball. By then he had come into his own as a baseball player, and in his senior year he also played wide receiver after the football coach heard about his speed and jumping ability.From there, Cashman went on to play second base at Catholic University in Washington, and set several hitting records. Basketball was relegated to a pickup sport that he would play into adulthood.AdvertisementAnd a perfect place for him to play turned out to be the courts across the street from the old Yankee Stadium. Cashman and several other Yankee employees would leave work at lunchtime, play for an hour or so, then head back into the clubhouse for a shower before returning to their desks. Playing ball was a “stress-relief activity,” Cashman said, but he still had to bring his cellphone in case George M. Steinbrenner called him.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            There were other challenges, too. Once, Cashman said, a neighborhood player went up for a rebound and a long, unsheathed kitchen knife fell out of his pants and clanged to the ground. The player apologized.“He said he had just gotten out of prison and people were trying to get him,” Cashman said. “He put it by the basket pole and we kept playing.”Another time, someone took Cashman’s phone from the court. When Cashman discovered it was missing, he made it clear he wanted it back, no questions asked. The next day, he said, it was delivered to the stadium’s media gate by some youths who lived in the neighborhood.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He broke his ankle sky-diving a few years back, and the new Yankee Stadium is not as conveniently located by the playgrounds as the old one was. But Cashman is still a fan of Kentucky, and has several times invited Calipari to Yankee Stadium for a day since Calipari became coach in 2009.Calipari has offered to return the favor in Lexington, but Cashman has yet to take him up on it. One day, though, he hopes to take his school-age children to Lexington so they can witness the passion of Kentucky basketball.“Kentucky fandom is off the charts,” he said. “I would love for them to experience that like I did.”The final two weekends of the N.C.A.A. tournament come at an inconvenient time for baseball’s general managers. Final rosters are taking shape, opening day is approaching and there is not a lot of time to dwell on college basketball. But Cashman will find time to root, starting Thursday and, he hopes, right through the Final Four in Indianapolis.“It would be great if we can get back on track with them,” he said of the six times both teams have won championships in the same year. “But first Kentucky has to win it.”An article on Wednesday about Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman’s love of Kentucky basketball misstated, in some copies, the year John Calipari became Kentucky’s coach. It was 2009, not 2011.A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees’ Cashman Relishes Kentucky Connection.
