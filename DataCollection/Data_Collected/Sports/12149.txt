It may have been a signal that he would play a decisive role in the game, and he did — but not in the way he might have hoped.Still in search of his 660th career home run, Rodriguez went 0 for 6, struck out four times and accounted for seven outs as the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Yankees, 3-2, at Yankee Stadium in a game that took 3 hours 58 minutes.The Rays scored in the top of the 13th on a ground-ball single by James Loney that found its way through the right side of the infield. Rodriguez came to the plate in the bottom of the inning with one out and a runner on first but hit into a 6-4-3 double play for the final outs of the game.Rodriguez was not the only batter to flail. The Rays’ pitching staff, led by the left-handed starter Drew Smyly, struck out the Yankees 16 times (Smyly notched 10). The Yankees, meanwhile, struck out Tampa Bay batters 13 times. It was that kind of game.The Rays’ victory was their first over the Yankees in six games this year. They will head back home to play three games against the Baltimore Orioles, a series that was originally scheduled to be played in Baltimore but was shifted to Florida because of the unrest in that city.Wednesday’s game began with Yankees starter Michael Pineda taking the mound in place of Masahiro Tanaka, who was placed on the disabled list Tuesday with a strained right forearm and wrist tendinitis and could be headed for season-ending surgery.Pineda allowed two runs in five and two-thirds innings and struck out five. Tampa led, 2-0, through four innings, but the Yankees got solo home runs from Chase Headley in the fifth and Chris Young in the sixth to even the score.The Yankees’ stalwart bullpen pitched well, allowing only the one run, in the 13th inning, in a combined seven and one-third innings pitched and recording eight strikeouts.
