Federal agents boarded an international cruise ship as it docked in Florida before dawn on Friday and arrested one of the world soccer officials who had yet to be captured in a broad corruption investigation, the F.B.I. said.The official, Héctor Trujillo, the general secretary of the Guatemalan soccer federation who is also a judge on the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, was arrested by federal customs agents. He was expected to appear in a federal courtroom in Florida, said Kelly Langmesser, an F.B.I. spokeswoman.Mr. Trujillo, 62, was on an island cruise Thursday when the Justice Department announced charges against him and 15 others. Checking the cruise itinerary, federal agents saw that the ship was not scheduled to stop before it arrived in Port Canaveral, Fla.It was unclear whether Mr. Trujillo was aware of the indictments while at sea, but Internet access and phone service are available on many cruise lines.AdvertisementAt around 6 a.m. Friday, agents with Customs and Border Protection boarded the ship and arrested Mr. Trujillo without incident, Ms. Langmesser said.For the last five years, Mr. Trujillo has been the general secretary of Guatemala’s national soccer federation. During that time, he has simultaneously served as a judge.Announcing the charges against the array of individuals on Thursday, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch specifically mentioned Mr. Trujillo and his seat on his country’s constitutional court. Ms. Lynch characterized him as “purportedly dispensing justice by day while allegedly soliciting bribes and selling his influence within FIFA.”
                The 16 men arrested Thursday include five current or former members of FIFA’s ruling executive committee and the current presidents of Concacaf and Conmebol.            Mr. Trujillo is accused of accepting money from business executives in exchange for lucrative sports marketing contracts, including from a Miami-based company called Media World that figures prominently into the United States’ case.The indictment unsealed Thursday refers to multiple bribe negotiations in Miami involving Media World, Mr. Trujillo and other defendants. Those defendants include Brayan Jiménez, president of the Guatemalan soccer federation, and Rafael Salguero, a former president of that federation who rose higher in the ranks of world soccer and assumed a role on FIFA’s executive committee.AdvertisementThe negotiations referred to contracts signed in 2010 and 2014. The bribes traveled around the world in deliberately roundabout ways, with one particular six-figure bribe wired from Miami through Panama City in an effort to conceal the transaction, according to the indictment.
                The Justice Department unsealed a 236-page indictment on Thursday that described charges against some of the most powerful leaders of international soccer.            Mr. Trujillo and his fellow officials were mindful of their illegal activity, the indictment suggests. It quotes from a meeting in Chicago last July at which the men insisted that nothing related to the transactions should be discussed over the phone and detailed the manner in which a bribe payment had been concealed.Mr. Trujillo specifically referred to a bribe he had been paid that traveled through the bank account of a construction company. He and the person controlling that account established a “sham contract,” according to the indictment, to minimize suspicion.A Media World executive, Fabio Tordin, secretly pleaded guilty in the case last fall, the United States announced on Thursday. He was present at the meeting in Chicago at which Mr. Trujillo detailed the convoluted flow of some bribe money.Rebecca R.
