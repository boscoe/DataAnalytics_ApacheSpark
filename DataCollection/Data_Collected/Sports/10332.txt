LOS ANGELES —  Somewhere in suburban Cincinnati lives a woman who lost her job a few months ago and whose company, because she had car-pooled that day, arranged for her ride home. She was driven by Xavier’s leading scorer and rebounder, a 6-foot-10, 270-pound Uber driver named Matt Stainbrook.As Stainbrook remembers it, she tearfully held a box of her office belongings. He pretended that he did not know the circumstances.“That was my good idea,” he said Wednesday. “My bad idea was when she got in, I said, ‘How’s your day going?’ Because that’s the normal thing to say.”It was a quiet, memorable ride, at least for one of them.“It was a 40-minute ride — she lived far away,” Stainbrook said. “She didn’t say a word.”Maybe, at some point, she saw familiarity in that bespectacled face, or silently wondered why the driver’s knees nearly touched the steering wheel of the Buick. Had she asked, she could have learned one of college basketball’s most interesting stories. If nothing else, her mood probably would have brightened.AdvertisementStainbrook does not look or act like a star basketball player. But he plays like one, averaging 12.1 points and 6.9 rebounds per game for Xavier (23-13), which was set to play Arizona (33-3) at Staples Center on Thursday night in the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. tournament.AdvertisementHe spends much of his time hanging around his little brother, the team’s other walk-on players and the student managers. His on-court look — not much different from his off-court one — is a bit 1970s-era Bill Walton, a bit ’80s-era Kurt Rambis, a lot timeless recreation-league nerd.Part of that is on purpose.“They see this big, tall white guy, long hair, pads all over, goggles,” Stainbrook said, describing himself the way opponents probably do. “ ‘That guy can’t play.’ Then, you know what, I get a couple of buckets, and then all of a sudden they’re on their heels a little bit, catching them by surprise. I thought it was part of my game. I still think, a little bit, it’s part of my game.”Smarts, though, run in the family. Stainbrook graduated last year with a finance degree. His father, Dave, was an offensive lineman at Ohio University in the 1980s and is now a software engineer in the aerospace industry who has worked with NASA.Before college, Stainbrook was never a star. He was “a nobody,” he said, who did not start on his high school varsity team in suburban Cleveland until his senior year. He planned to attend and play for Case Western Reserve, a Division III program, before he received his only scholarship offer, from Western Michigan.He started his first game as a freshman, against Xavier, and had 10 points and 7 rebounds in a surprisingly difficult 68-65 victory by the Musketeers. Xavier Coach Chris Mack wondered how the Western Michigan center — with his crazy hair, pads on his knees and elbows, and goggles on his face — had gone unnoticed in recruiting.Stainbrook transferred to Xavier after his sophomore year. Mack had some rules: Lose the hair (“We’re not Gonzaga,” Stainbrook recalled Mack saying). Lose the pads. Lose 50 pounds. And lose those awful goggles.“I said, ‘Coach, these are prescription goggles,’ ” Stainbrook recalled. “I actually need them to see. He’s like, ‘Those can stay.’ ”AdvertisementStainbrook sat out a year, as required by N.C.A.A. rules. He has been a better-than-solid presence in the middle since then, earning second-team honors in the Big East this season.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            None of that, of course, explains the Uber driving. On a long ride, he will gladly tell the story.It started about a year ago. Matt’s younger brother, Tim, was a walk-on player for Xavier, a Jesuit university in Cincinnati. He paid about $25,000 to attend college and play for the basketball team.(Their older brother, Andy, is 6-9 and briefly attended Air Force. But they are slight compared with Matt. “He got all the weight,” Tim said. “Whenever we ate family dinners, he got all the food.”)Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

His graduate-school bill would be about $14,000.That was when the question came up: Could he give his scholarship to his brother?The answer, from the college and his coach, was yes. Tim Stainbrook, a 6-foot-6, 200-pound forward who barely plays, had his college expenses paid this year. (Tim said he expected to be a walk-on again next season, when his brother will be gone, and to pay the full amount of expenses himself.)Matt Stainbrook played his senior season, essentially, as a walk-on.Among the things the swap did, besides save the family a substantial amount of money, was free up what Matt Stainbrook could do in his spare time. Unburdened by many of the restrictions that the N.C.A.A. places on scholarship athletes, Stainbrook got a job.Uber was perfect.“You can sign on whenever you want, sign off whenever you want,” Stainbrook said. “You can not do it for a month straight.”During the off-season, he said, he drove 25 or 30 hours a week. During the season, he estimated, he drives 10 or 20 hours a week, earning $200 or $250 in his roomy 2004 Buick Rendezvous, now with 190,000 miles on it.“It sort of relaxes you,” he said. “You get to talk to people who don’t always want to talk basketball all the time, so it’s a change of pace.”He drives mostly near the Xavier campus, and about half of the people he picks up recognize him — if not by name, by face and size. Some want to take a photograph with him.AdvertisementThe others? Like the woman who lost her job, they may have other worries. Or maybe they keep their questions to themselves, silently wondering why Xavier’s best player is driving them home.A version of this article appears in print on March 27, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Driving Strangers Around, and Xavier Onward.
