The FIFA ethics committee has requested a life ban for Michel Platini, president of UEFA, soccer’s governing body in Europe, his lawyer, Thibaut d’Ales, said Tuesday. The move would rule Platini out of the race to succeed Sepp Blatter, the suspended president of FIFA, the sport’s world governing body. D’Ales said that the sanction was sought after the FIFA ethics committee investigations unit submitted its final case report. Blatter could also face expulsion from world soccer over a $2 million payment he approved to Platini in 2011. Platini and Blatter face hearings in December before a FIFA ethics judge, Joachim Eckert. Platini is currently serving a 90-day ban.■ Switzerland’s Federal Office of Justice has decided to partially relax laws on bank secrecy in the country in order to provide information on the FIFA executives arrested in May as part of a United States-led investigation.
