We just let go of the wagon a little bit in the fourth.”SPURS 115, CLIPPERS 107 LaMarcus Aldridge had 26 points and 13 rebounds, Tony Parker scored 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, and San Antonio remained undefeated at home.The Spurs opened the final quarter on an 11-0 run to build a 96-88 lead with 9:17 left.Chris Paul had 27 points and 10 assists for the Clippers.T’WOLVES 99, KINGS 95 Andrew Wiggins had 32 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists to lift host Minnesota, which had lost eight of its previous nine.The Timberwolves led by 8 at the start of the fourth but missed nine of their first 10 shots to let Sacramento back in it.
