Western Kentucky announced Tuesday that it had suspended its swimming and diving programs for five years after an investigation of hazing incidents and violations of Title IX and the student conduct code involving sexual misconduct and assault, harassment. The positions of the swimming coach Bruce Marchionda, the assistant Brian Thomas and the diving coach Chelsea Ale will be eliminated on June 30.Collin Craig, a former freshman swimmer, complained to the police in January that he had been assaulted and harassed on several occasions. A subsequent search of a house where the hazing incidents occurred turned up beer kegs, marijuana paraphernalia and picture boards featuring intoxicated students. The university’s summary determined that a hostile environment had been created at the house, as well as within the program.The report concluded that Marchionda knew team members had been arrested on suspicion of marijuana use and possession, theft and public intoxication. None of the coaches immediately reported the sexual harassment incidents, as required by Title IX. Discipline was inconsistent and often occurred during the fall when major competition was not at stake.■ Thanks to the College Football Playoff, bowl games paid more than a half-billion dollars to conferences and universities last season, the largest payout ever and an increase of almost $200 million from the final season of the Bowl Championship Series.
