One of the largest fantasy sports companies appears to have closed an easily accessible loophole that had been available for users to make bets from states where daily fantasy sports is illegal.The technique, using a proxy server, is one of the simplest and most widely available services to let a computer appear to be somewhere other than its true location when its user logs on to a website. This month, The New York Times reported that users in all six of the states in which daily fantasy sports is considered illegal were able to make bets at DraftKings, one of the two largest sites.But over the past several days, The Times again tried to gain access within one of those states — Iowa — and the DraftKings site declined to allow a user to log on, suggesting that proxies are now being blocked. The Times was not able to use proxies to log on to the other leading fantasy site, FanDuel, from the illegal states either earlier this month or more recently.The change comes ahead of a court hearing on Wednesday in New York in which the state’s attorney general is seeking a preliminary injunction barring residents from gaining access to the sites, arguing that daily fantasy sports is a form of illegal Internet gambling. The attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, had ordered DraftKings and FanDuel to stop taking bets in the state; both companies have filed formal complaints against the action.AdvertisementIn seeking the preliminary injunction to enforce his ban, Mr. Schneiderman had listed a range of arguments and had taken note of the use of proxy servers as a possible violation of other states’ laws.AdvertisementA week after The Times reported that DraftKings was accessible via proxies, the company announced that it had undertaken a partnership with GeoComply, a company that provides geolocation services to legal gambling operations in the United States.“Common methods used to circumvent location checks such as proxies are restricted and will invalidate a player’s eligibility,” the DraftKings statement said.David Briggs, chairman of GeoComply Ltd., the technical arm of the firm, confirmed that it was providing so-called geoblocking technology to DraftKings. Mr. Briggs said the technology “represents an innovative and significant layer of protection against any attempt to fake a player’s location, such as proxies.”The move could be significant in New York, where proxies could have allowed players to keep betting even if daily fantasy sports games are banned here.As the court fight proceeds, FanDuel has said it has suspended paid contests for players in New York, while DraftKings has said it has the legal right to continue them.
            In 2006, Congress tried to crack down on illegal online sports betting. Today, Internet wagering is thriving, and a new business that resembles gambling, fantasy sports, is winning millions of players and stoking controversy. The Times, with the PBS series “Frontline,” investigated illegal gambling in the Internet age.

			The use of proxy servers is no theoretical matter in fantasy sports. In a memorandum to the court in support of his order, Mr. Schneiderman said that in 2014, DraftKings received entry fees of $484,897 from player accounts registered in states where daily fantasy sports is considered illegal.DraftKings said in a statement Tuesday that its own investigation found that the “overwhelming majority of these fees — over 92 percent — were paid by users who, at the time of payment, resided in states where DraftKings was allowed to operate.” DraftKings said it shut down the remaining user accounts.Advertisement“We comply with the law and take very seriously our responsibility to protect our customers,” the company said.The use of proxies is so common that the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, released a set of proposed guidelines for daily fantasy contests in her state that included a prohibition on the use of the technology by any player.Mr. Schneiderman, however, is focusing his argument on the assertion that daily fantasy sites are gambling that is prohibited under the state Constitution.In new filings on Tuesday ahead of the court hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Schneiderman said that the sites should be shut down in New York as illegal gambling because winning the contests depends on a future event outside the players’ control.To bolster that argument, the documents include a statement by a prize winner in a DraftKings “Millionaire Maker” contest who said that even though he “couldn’t name 10 players in the N.F.L.,” he had won more than $400,000 in one of his first games. He also said he missed out on the $1 million top prize only because one of his selections did not score a fourth-quarter touchdown.“It’s close to winning the lottery,” he said, according to court papers that attribute the quotation to news accounts. “I was 9 points away from winning the lottery.”In seeking a preliminary injunction in New York, the attorney general has argued that the games are based on chance and not on skill, an important distinction. Fantasy sports companies contend that their games are not gambling because they involve more skill than luck and were legally sanctioned by a 2006 federal law that exempted fantasy sports from a prohibition against processing online financial wagering.DraftKings filed a brief in State Supreme Court on Tuesday opposing the preliminary injunction on the basis that there is “overwhelming, undisputed evidence that DraftKings’ contests are complex games of skill” and offers opinions from three experts.AdvertisementThe brief cited tests of random DraftKings lineups against the lineups of the highest repeat winning players.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It was unclear whether he would rule immediately.FanDuel and DraftKings have shown tremendous growth, raising hundreds of millions of dollars from investors.The sites offer fantasy sports games that mostly take place in a single day, rather than the more familiar season-long contests.FanDuel has an average of 52.1 million monthly visits, while DraftKings stands at 30.3 million, according to Joel Zand of the Internet analysis site SimilarWeb.AdvertisementMajor North American sports leagues have embraced daily fantasy, partnering with the companies and accepting their advertising. Ads for the companies are ubiquitous on TV broadcasts of sports events.DraftKings announced Tuesday that it had hired Exiger, a regulatory risk and compliance firm, to review the company and “help develop best practices that ensure DraftKings remains at the forefront of safety and consumer protection in the fantasy sports industry.”Despite the ban, FanDuel’s logo was prominent on the court and elsewhere at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Monday for the Legends Classic, a college basketball event it sponsors.Mr. Schneiderman has expanded his investigation to include Yahoo, which is a relatively small player in the market.Victor Mather contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on November 25, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Daily Fantasy Sports Site Appears to Close Digital Loophole .
