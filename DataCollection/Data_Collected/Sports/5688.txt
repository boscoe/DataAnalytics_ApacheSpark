ARLINGTON, Tex. — After their only two losses came against playoff teams, Connor Cook and Michigan State finished off their season with a three-touchdown comeback in the fourth quarter against playoff-snubbed Baylor.Cook threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keith Mumphery with 17 seconds left to give the No. 7 Spartans a 42-41 victory in the Cotton Bowl, the lead-in game on New Year’s Day to the two national semifinals that the two-time Big 12 champion Baylor (11-2) hoped to be a part of instead.“For us to win in such an emotional and dramatic fashion like you just saw out there, really just I think with all the guys coming back, all the juniors, really just makes us feel good and brings us closer together,” Cook said.The Spartans (11-2) got the winning touchdown after Marcus Rush blocked Chris Callahan’s 43-yard field goal attempt with 1 minute 5 seconds left.AdvertisementWhen Baylor got the ball back for one last try, Bryce Petty was sacked on consecutive plays before Riley Bullough’s clinching interception.AdvertisementPetty completed 36 of 51 passes for a Cotton Bowl-record 550 yards and three touchdowns, two to the speedy freshman K.D. Cannon and the other to the 390-pound backup guard LaQuan McGowan, which put Baylor ahead, 41-21, late in the third quarter.Jeremy Langford ran for 162 yards and three touchdowns for the Spartans, whose losses were to the Pac-12 winner, Oregon, and the Big Ten champion, Ohio State.Langford’s 1-yard plunge with just under five minutes left got the Spartans to 41-35. It came the play after Cook’s 11-yard scramble was initially called a touchdown but ruled short after a replay review.

Michigan State then got Cook’s 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Josiah Price and recovered an onside kick.Cook threw a 39-yard pass on the first play after the recovery, but was scrambling to avoid pressure on the next when he threw an awkward pass right to linebacker Taylor Young, who ran 84 yards to the end zone.Young’s apparent touchdown was wiped out by an illegal block, pushing Baylor back to its 43. After Petty’s fourth-down incompletion, Michigan State went 60 yards in nine plays for Langford’s final score.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Spartans were only the second Big Ten team in the game, which was played for the 79th time.Baylor finished fifth in the final College Football Playoff rankings, a spot ahead of T.C.U., the team the Bears shared the Big 12 title with despite beating the Frogs, 61-58, in October. T.C.U. won its bowl game handily, beating Mississippi, 42-3, in the Peach Bowl on Wednesday.Advertisement“We’ve played a lot of really good games over the last seven seasons. Won a lot of really good games. And this is one of the tougher non-wins that I’ve ever experienced,” Baylor Coach Art Briles said. “It’s got nothing to do with the big picture. The small picture right now is letting a game get away from us today.”It was tied, 14-14, after the first quarter, but Baylor went ahead, 24-14, at the half on Petty's 1-yard touchdown run and Callahan’s 25-yard field goal.Cannon, already with a 49-yard touchdown catch, got the Bears started in the second half when he split two Michigan State defenders and was in a full sprint when he reached out with both hands and made a fingertip grab near the 35. He gathered the ball in and ran to the end zone to finish a 74-yard touchdown before Callahan added another field goal.Cannon finished with eight catches for 197 yards, and Corey Coleman had seven catches for 150 yards, including a 53-yard score on a throw from his fellow receiver Jay Lee.The Bears had 583 yards, even with minus-20 yards rushing. Michigan State had 552 yards, including Cook’s 314 yards passing.A version of this article appears in print on January 2, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Michigan State Rallies in Final Seconds to Top Baylor in Cotton Bowl.
