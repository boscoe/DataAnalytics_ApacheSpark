ZURICH —  Just before 6 a.m. here Thursday, Swiss law enforcement officers briskly entered a side door of the Baur au Lac hotel. Moments later, a hotel custodian, in a starched uniform and polished shoes, stepped out the front door of the five-star property and dutifully vacuumed the entryway carpets, seemingly oblivious to the police raid underway behind him.It would have been a bizarre juxtaposition for this plush, historic hotel on the banks of Lake Zurich if it were not so familiar. Just six months ago, the Swiss police arrived at the Baur au Lac for the first roundup of top soccer officials, rocking the soccer world and providing an august setting for charges of corruption, bribery, money laundering and other ignoble offenses.
                The Justice Department unsealed a 236-page indictment on Thursday that described charges against some of the most powerful leaders of international soccer.            With Thursday’s apprehension of two more high-ranking soccer officials, the Baur au Lac suddenly ranked, however innocently, alongside the Watergate (President Nixon’s downfall) and the Adlon Kempinski Berlin (Michael Jackson’s dangling baby) as the world’s most notorious yet refined hotels.The Baur au Lac, which claims to be the place where the Nobel Peace Prize was born, is also the preferred hotel for FIFA officials because of its elegance and proximity to the group’s headquarters. It has been a polite and accommodating host for police visits.AdvertisementAs in May, the arrests were carried out quickly and with discretion so as not to disturb other guests at the hotel, where rooms go for $650 a night. A front-desk clerk received the officers when they arrived and a manager cleared the ornate lobby of visitors — he apologetically explained there was “an extreme situation.”The officers walked past a Christmas tree adorned with gold ornaments and potted plants festooned with ribbons on their way to the rooms of Alfredo Hawit of Honduras and Juan Ángel Napout of Paraguay, FIFA vice presidents and the leaders of their regional soccer confederations.AdvertisementAfter knocking on the door of each man’s room, the officers presented a piece of paper that briefly explained — in German, English and Spanish — what was happening to them. Among other things, the document reminded the men that they had the right to contact their country’s consulate.Each man was given the opportunity to pack his luggage and then was escorted to the ground floor for transportation to police custody. Unlike in May, when authorities took many of the arrested officials out a back door and into a waiting car as hotel staff members held up white bedsheets in an attempt to obscure the public’s view, this time the police returned to the side entrance.Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney general, announced new indictments of officials from FIFA, soccer’s world governing body.While restaurant staff arranged the breakfast buffet, including a tower of pastries and an assortment of smoked fish, the police led Mr. Hawit and Mr. Napout out the side door and over a small bridge to the hotel’s garage. Waiting among a panoply of high-end vehicles, the men were guided into cars and driven away.The ride was likely a bit more pleasant than the ones taken by their colleagues: In May, the police transported some of the indicted officials in pedestrian cars like an older-model Opel. This time, their procession featured a Volvo and a few Mercedes, all with tinted windows.Once the cars pulled away, a hotel manager told the staff members who had been assisting in the operation, “That’s it,” and the group went back inside. There, other members of FIFA’s executive committee, who had by then seen reports of the arrests on social media, were coming downstairs to prepare to leave for the scheduled meeting at 9 a.m. at FIFA headquarters.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In the restaurant, officials in blue FIFA blazers whispered to one another over bowls of the hotel’s acclaimed porridge, while Mr. Hawit’s wife, who was in the room when her husband was arrested, was comforted by friends near the lobby.AdvertisementOutside, as the sun rose and the workday began, commuters stopped to stare as security guards milled about in front of the hotel’s driveway. The Baur au Lac, a fixture of this city for more than 170 years, was no longer known simply for its history, array of wines and in-house brand of chocolate.By about 8:30 a.m., most of the FIFA officials had made their way to the organization’s headquarters, about 20 minutes away. In an underground conference room, the executive committee discussed the arrests at the start of its meeting but then attempted to move on, ultimately voting on a package of governance reforms that will be proposed to the FIFA Congress in February.Back at the Baur au Lac, the doorman had been replaced by a security guard, who told visitors that only guests and staff were allowed in. Just before 9, three hours after the police arrived, the man in the starched uniform emerged to vacuum the carpets again.Calum MacKenzie contributed reporting.A version of this article appears in print on December 4, 2015, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Five-Star Hotel Draws Return Visitors: Police.
