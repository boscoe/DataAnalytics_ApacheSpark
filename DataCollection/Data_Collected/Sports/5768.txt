Rethinking Business Of College FootballTo the Sports Editor:Re “What Made College Ball More Like Pros? $7.3 Billion, for a Start,” Dec. 31: Cardale Jones’s Twitter comment “Why should we have to go to class if we came here to play FOOTBALL, we ain’t come to play SCHOOL” calls for a simple, though educationally and politically incorrect, solution. Let universities hire professional athletes, pay them generously without pretense and allow them to attend classes of their choice, if they so desire.Such a policy would not only eliminate the gap between student and athlete, but also put an end to hypocrisy and frequent scandals.JOEL COHEN, Staten IslandTo the Sports Editor:Open up the places now held by football players who could never have gotten into college if they weren’t playing football to young people who have actually made the grades and done the hard work required for college admission, and pay people like Cardale Jones to play football. This way, the college can do what it’s supposed to do, which is to educate people, and the football academy can become a draft organization for future N.F.L. players and, possibly, hold them to the same laws as everyone else.But that’s what we have now, isn’t it? Except for the law part.HENRY STROZIER, BrooklynTo the Sports Editor:The tenured scholarly community of universities might not have the final say, but any strongly worded statement from their deliberative bodies would reverberate through the entire university. Faculties have the capacity to work out special programs so that football athletes might have lighter loads during the season and heavier loads during the off-season.AdvertisementThe N.C.A.A. is in no position to do that.GEORGE KALBOUSS, Columbus, OhioTo the Sports Editor:Why don’t colleges and universities that give achievement bonuses to sports coaches also give bonuses to department heads for producing Rhodes scholars, Fulbright scholars, Wilson Fellows and other honorees?Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It is refreshing to consider how many brain traumas, broken bones and torn tendons would be prevented, and how much strutting, pouting, bullying and preening behavior the public would be spared.AdvertisementDAN CAMPION, Iowa CityA version of this letter appears in print on January 4, 2015, on Page SP5 of the New York edition with the headline: Rethinking Business of College Football.
