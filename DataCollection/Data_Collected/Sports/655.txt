The St Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs have faced each other more than 2,000 times, with passion and sometimes bitterness. On Friday night, they begin one of the most significant chapters in their rivalry in a five-game National League division series.From Chicago to St. Louis, and especially in the gray area of Central Illinois known as the Downstate Line, fans will argue for the greatness of their chosen team.It has been going on for years. Here are 10 key moments in the century-old rivalry.1885 and 1886: The Cardinals, then known as the Browns, faced the Cubs, then known as the White Stockings, in two postseason series between the champions of the American Association and the National League. In 1885, the seven-game series finished even at three games all with one tie; the Browns won the next year, four games to two.The Browns moved to the National League in 1892, and the Cardinals have been in the same league (and eventually division) with the Cubs franchise ever since.Advertisement1906: The Cubs cap a period of dominance, posting the best record in major league history, 116-36, while the Cardinals languish near the back of the pack at 52-89. But the Cubs are upset in the World Series by their other fierce rival, the Chicago White Sox.June 22, 1928: During a doubleheader against the Cardinals at Wrigley Field, Cubs center fielder Hack Wilson gets into a verbal and then physical dispute with a fan. A near riot breaks out as thousands swarm the field. Wilson is fined $100, about $1,400 today.Advertisement1945: The Cubs win the pennant, beating the Cardinals by three games. According to legend, a Cubs fan tries to bring his goat to a World Series game at Wrigley and curses the team when he is not admitted. The Cubs lose to the Tigers, and have not been back to the World Series since.May 5, 1960: Don Cardwell of the Cubs throws the only no-hitter involving the two teams. It is one of only 60 Cubs wins that year.June 15, 1964: The Cubs decide to trade a 24-year-old outfielder to the Cardinals as part of a six-player deal. The player, Lou Brock, goes on to a Hall of Fame career with more than 900 stolen bases. The Cubs’ key acquisition, pitcher Ernie Broglio, goes 7-19 for the team and is out of the majors in two years. ESPN named it the worst deadline trade ever.Sept. 22, 1974: One of the wildest basebrawls starts when Bill Madlock of the Cubs and pitcher Al Hrabosky, who was called the Mad Hungarian, get into a battle over who can delay an at-bat more. Eventually the umpire orders Hrabosky to pitch, though Madlock is out of the box, and calls strike one, setting off the donnybrook. The rumpus is highlighted by catcher Ted Simmons decking Madlock.June 23, 1984: In a nationally televised game, the Cubs trail by 7-1 but battle back to tie the score at 9-9 on a Ryne Sandberg homer in the ninth. Sandberg ties the score again at 11-11 with another homer in the 10th, and the Cubs win in the 11th. Sandberg finishes 5 for 6 with seven R.B.I.1998: Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa help fans forget the strike/lockout of 1994-95 with their runs at Roger Maris’s record of 61 homers. McGwire hits No. 62 against the Cubs and finishes with 70; Sosa winds up with 66 but wins the Most Valuable Player Award, and only the Cubs make the playoffs.Oct. 9, 2015: For the first time since the days of the Browns and the White Stockings, the two old rivals meet in the postseason. John Lackey faces Jon Lester at Busch Stadium. The Cardinals won a baseball-best 100 games, and the Cubs won 97; the winner of the series may well become the favorite to win the World Series.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
