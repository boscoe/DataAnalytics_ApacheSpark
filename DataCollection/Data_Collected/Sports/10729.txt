A clocker for the New York Racing Association and two jockey agents were taken away from Aqueduct on Thursday by security agents and told their privileges were revoked until an investigation by the Queens district attorney, into allegations of unlawful access to a computer system, is concluded.No charges were filed against Stephen Foster, a clocker and a placing judge for the association or the agents Mike Gonzalez and Jose Morales Jr.“It’s an ongoing police investigation,” said Martin Panza, NYRA’s vice president for racing operations. “We aren’t going to say anything until the Queens D.A.’s office finishes its work.”A spokeswoman for the office said policy dictated that she could not confirm or deny whether there was an investigation.AdvertisementThe investigation involves NYRA’s in-house computer system and whether Foster allowed the two agents access to it and a wealth of information about horses on the grounds, which would give them an unfair advantage in finding mounts for their riders, said a person who had direct knowledge of the complaint who was not authorized to speak publicly about it.Morales, who worked as a clerk in the racing office until this fall, is the agent for Angel Arroyo, who had 31 victories in the winter meet, and Israel Rodriguez, who had 21.AdvertisementGonzalez represents Manuel Franco, whose 58 victories made him the third-leading rider at the winter meet.A version of this article appears in print on April 3, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | Horse Racing; Clocker and Agents Are Investigated.
