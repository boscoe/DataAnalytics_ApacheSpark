
APRIL 6, 2015

Just in time for opening day, a half-dozen current and former New York Times writers weigh in with thoughts on the Mets and the Yankees. Some root for the team in the Bronx, others for that less heralded club in Queens, but in this instance there seems to be a consensus of sorts: This could be one of those seasons when the Mets actually outdo the Yankees.
Oy vey, kreplach, I’ve been this way so many times before.I am
 an Upper West Sider by birth, a National League fan by birthright. (My 
father grew up a Boston Braves fan. My parents rooted for the Giants 
before that team stole away to points west.) This time of the year was 
my own form of peyote worship.As a kid, I wrote out annual forecasts for the Mets.
 I had John (Little Hammer) Milner down for 35 home runs. Pat Zachry 
would break out with a 20-win season. Steve Henderson, that All-Star 
Game has a locker reserved for you. Skip Lockwood, man, oh man, you’re 
going to save 35 games, maybe 40!I presented the list to my father and demanded he match me. He looked at me as a doctor would a patient at a mental health ward.Too
 much spring optimism, followed by too much midseason darkness and 
end-season chaos, wore me down. I’ve ceded hallucinogenic optimism to my
 sons, Nick and Aidan. Aidan, in particular, forever sees the promise of
 a Met-Jet-Knick sun breaking over the ridge.With acknowledgment that my crystal ball is a cracked and foggy receptacle of my hopes and fears, I’ll lead with my chin:The
 Mets, accustomed to dwelling in a canyon of darkness, will walk 
blinking into the light this season, led by Matt Harvey and strong young
 arms everywhere. Wilmer Flores, the tall, out-of-place shortstop, will 
stroke the ball hard and prove sure-handed enough. The flight path of David Wright’s
 career has passed its apex, but if he would stop sliding headfirst into
 bases (note to self: Why does this custom persist?), he might have a 
fine year. Dilson Herrera, a little second baseman with a sweet stroke, 
will start the year in Las Vegas but could be looking for a Whitestone condo before season’s end.If only Sandy Alderson,
 who displayed a sure hand with pitchers and in rebuilding the minors, 
had not spent so much Mets coin acquiring geriatric corner outfielders. A
 closer fence seems unlikely to immunize Curtis Granderson
 against the encroachments of age. Michael Cuddyer, a professional 
hitter, had a fine spring. But he’s spent much of the last three years 
injured. To bet that pattern will break at 35 would have been a cinch 
when I was 14.So here’s my prediction: The Mets will break the .500 mark, perhaps standing in the sunlight of 84 wins.As for The Other Team? I was a teenage tribalist. With my friends Peter and Fred, I would hop the D train to Yankee Stadium to root loudly against the home team. I’m more mature now (note to self: Not really, but give the appearance of rationality).C. C. Sabathia
 is a splendid, if rapidly aging, pitcher. Michael Pineda has a rocket 
launcher arm. The brilliant Masahiro Tanaka has an elbow hanging by 
threads. Mark Teixeira has a beautiful swing, if only he did not harbor religious objections to hitting to the opposite field. Didi Gregorius has a questionable bat and an acrobat’s delicacy at shortstop. Alex Rodriguez
 in this lifetime has ingested enough performance-enhancing drugs to 
ensure that his muscles will twitch well into his next life.The Yankees are the law firm of If, If, If & If. Manager Joe Girardi is one of the game’s best, and if healthy, his team could cop a playoff spot.If
 you read this in the corporeal edition of my newspaper, please tear 
this up. If you read it online, and know what’s good for you, click 
spike.This is the best time of the year for Mets fans. Sure, the Mets haven’t won any regular-season games yet, but they haven’t lost any, either.
Fatalistic? Of course! “Mets” is a four-letter word. To paraphrase recent remarks by Daniel Murphy,
 the Mets’ second baseman, about the gay former player Billy Bean, I 
disagree with the lifestyle of losing that the team has embraced since 
2006 — including two collapses and six consecutive losing seasons from 
2009 through 2014 — and wonder if it has made defeatism a choice.
So it has been heartening to read and watch the Grapefruit League 
reports suggesting that 2015 might just be the end of the long Nationals
 nightmare for the Mets, not to mention their woeful records against 
other teams. One hopeful sign has been the re-emergence of the Mets’ 
majority owner, Fred Wilpon, who seemed to have entered a witness protection program of his own making after becoming entangled in the Bernard L. Madoff financial scandal.
Wilpon has even delivered a pep talk to his players, which may have 
startled them: An owner who hasn’t spent much to help them win is now 
rooting them to victory.
Even so, the Mets have (fingers crossed) pulled together a promising 
roster (knock wood), led by a cadre of talented pitchers. (Insert the 
inevitable counterfact to rain on the Mets’ potential parade.) The 
shiniest star in the pitching firmament is of course Matt Harvey, whose 
stellar season in 2013 was cut short. His subsequent Tommy John surgery,
 which left him on the sideline until now, was a quintessential Mets 
moment: sweet success followed by, well, nothing. 
In a look at the position players, there is hope that David Wright
 is getting his groove back, perhaps because of the arrival on the 
roster of his friend Michael Cuddyer, who plays the part of Wright’s 
older brother from another mother. Juan Lagares’s numbers in center 
field augur many happy recaps. And Lucas Duda has seemingly made enough 
progress at first base to reassure fans that management did right to 
keep him rather than Ike Davis. (An ur-Mets drama, that.)
Still, fans are vexed by blah results from Murphy at second base; Travis d’Arnaud, the catcher; Curtis Granderson
 in the outfield; and the new starting shortstop, Wilmer Flores. Is 
Flores good enough to take on so crucial a role? Fans can’t be 
optimistic about anyone who shares his given name with the ineffectual 
punk gunman from “The Maltese Falcon.”
Ah, the stuff that dreams are made of. Now that I’m not working full 
time for the first year since 1974 (when the Mets went — what else? — 
71-91), I plan to go to more games. It would be nice if they were 
finally good again.This is the best time of the year for Mets fans. Sure, the Mets haven’t won any regular-season games yet, but they haven’t lost any, either.Fatalistic? Of course! “Mets” is a four-letter word. To paraphrase recent remarks by Daniel Murphy,

time for the first year since 1974 (when the Mets went — what else? — 
71-91), I plan to go to more games. It would be nice if they were 
finally good again.Stuart Elliott was the advertising columnist of The New York Times from 1991 (Mets, 77-84) to 2014 (79-83).In this underdog-averse city, Mr. Met usually drinks alone.And you know how it goes when that big-headed goof is lured into another one of those endless Mets-Yankees arguments. A Jeter dig here, a Piazza swipe there, and then comes the wet slap of the Yankee trump card on the bar counter:Since your team’s 1962 inaugural year, Humpty Dumpty, it is 2-2 in 
World Series appearances. And the Yankees? They’re 8-5, including a 
drubbing of your “Unamazins’ ” in 2000. Now run home to Mrs. Met and 
have a good cry in your Rheingold.But there might suddenly be good cause for that rictal smile affixed 
to Mr. Met’s chalk-white face. This season’s Mets are young, talented 
and unpredictable enough to recall those fleeting moments of Queens overshadowing the Bronx:
 the miracle of 1969, when New York could not decide whether the 
champion Mets or a man on the moon was more improbable, and the second 
half of the 1980s, when the team’s bad-boy persona mirrored the city’s 
Gordon Gekko moment.This 2015 team, an intriguing mix of characters and character, is 
generating an excitement rarely felt since the brief innocence of Dwight Gooden. In addition to the ongoing saga of whether the veteran third baseman David Wright
 will return to being David Wright, it has shortstop Wilmer Flores, who 
will be forgiven his defensive flaws if he hits; Juan Lagares, perhaps 
baseball’s best center fielder; first baseman Lucas Duda, who hit 30 — 
30! — home runs last year; outfielder Curtis Granderson,
 for whom walls have been moved in; and second baseman Daniel Murphy, 
who has promised to no longer talk about his religious beliefs, which is
 a good thing.The Mets also have what might be their best pitching staff in years, 
even with a couple of early losses to injury. There is Matt Harvey, of 
course, so good his name bears repeating: Matt Harvey. And Jacob deGrom,
 last year’s National League rookie of the year. And, um, Bartolo Colon, who turns 42 in May, weighs 285 pounds and recorded his first career out by whiffing Jim Edmonds. In April 1997. Colon, by the way, is the 2015 opening day starter for the Mets, 
causing aging, overweight softball players everywhere to rejoice.By comparison, the Yankees are much less interesting, if not less talented. Derek Jeter’s retirement
 party, which lasted nearly as long as his career, has finally ended, 
and now the only intrigue is whether the professionally contrite Alex Rodriguez
 — who is two years younger than Colon but could pass for his son — can 
open and close his mouth and his first baseman’s mitt at the appropriate
 times.Sure, the Yankees have Mark Teixeira,
 and Brett Gardner, and Jacoby Ellsbury, and Masahiro Tanaka, even if he
 will not be throwing as hard. They also have those 27 World Series 
championships. But Mr. Met has been drinking alone too long. If you see him with his
 head down, denting the bar counter, buy him a Rheingold. Come October, 
you might want to know him.The opening of a baseball season is a time when expectations run high. But Mets
 fans like me know better than to expect. We scan the roster, shot 
through as always with question marks, and we do what we always have to 
do: find something, anything, to hang our hopes on.
This year, we have a stronger peg than usual, one rooted deep in the 
team’s genetic makeup. Because for 53 seasons, whenever the Mets have 
marched to either triumph or disaster, it’s almost always been about the
 pitching.
Think of Tom Seaver,
 Jerry Koosman and the 1969 miracle. Tug McGraw and his “you gotta 
believe” mantra in 1973. Doc Gooden and the mid-1980s world beaters. 
Dave Mlicki shutting out the Yankees in the first crosstown game that counted. Johan Santana finally breaking the no-hitter drought. R. A. Dickey
 knuckling his way to the unlikeliest of Cy Young Awards. And on the 
darker side of the ledger, Tom Glavine and the epic 2007 collapse.
So it resonates pretty strongly with fans like me that the 2015 Mets 
are heading north to start the season loaded with people who can really 
throw.
It’s a lot easier to reconcile yourself to paying Citi Field
 prices — and to putting up with the many ways that the stadium annoys 
and disappoints those of us who like to, you know, watch the game — when
 you can be confident that whoever starts for the Mets can give the team
 a solid chance to win.
There are solid performers up and down the rotation. The team even 
had the depth to absorb the loss of Zack Wheeler in stride. As they say 
in the Shake Shack line, what’s not to like?
The team’s other Tommy John casualty this spring, the left-handed reliever Josh Edgin,
 seemed to catch the Mets in a more vulnerable spot. But encouraging 
signs can actually be found even there: The front office, so often 
blasted by fans for tightfistedness and timidity, quickly plugged the 
hole with a trade.
Of course, you can’t get to the postseason winning every game by 1-0 
(although Seaver spent many years trying). But there are reasons to 
think the 2015 Mets offense can be sufficient for a pennant run. More or
 less the same lineup managed 3.8 runs a game in 2014, hardly great but 
enough to rank in the top third of the league, and there is a decent 
chance that number will improve this year. 
All you need to ask for, really, is a return to career-average form from David Wright and Curtis Granderson. The addition of the hitting coach Kevin Long can only help.
Yes, a murderers’ row this lineup is not, but it doesn’t need to be. 
The mound has usually been where you find the heart of the Mets, and 
this year, it’s where you’ll find it again.

But then recently, after a Baltimore blowout of the Yankees in spring training, Buck Showalter, the manager of the Orioles, chided him unnecessarily, saying his home run trot was slower than it used to be. Preening was the implication.
Of course, if Rodriguez had sprinted around the bases, the criticism 
would have been that he was showing off, calling attention to himself 
that way. So, Buck, if you are Alex Rodriguez, what is the precisely 
appropriate speed for circling the bases after a meaningless tater?
Maybe knee-jerk suspicion or even outright disdain is the right 
attitude toward someone who has proved his ineptitude in creating an 
admirable image. But given Rodriguez’s thorough inability to conduct 
himself appropriately as a public figure, I’ve often thought it was bad 
luck that he was given such enormous athletic gifts. I sympathize with 
the guy; he can play ball like crazy, but he can’t act right. Is that 
any more his fault than it is mine or yours that for us, it’s the other 
way around?
That being said, by my lights, he has behaved well this spring. His 
humility — in accepting a reduced role on the club and in acknowledging 
that at his age and after a year away from the game, he’s not sure how 
well he can perform — strikes me as sincere. 
He was clobbered for the handwritten letter that he wrote to fans as 
he arrived in the Yankees’ camp in February. “Same old A-Rod. Still 
doesn’t get it,” was the media refrain. But I thought it was just about 
right — brief, forthright, apologetic, acknowledging his big mistakes. 
None of the Lance Armstrong
 arrogance. Do you really blame him for not wanting to rehash his 
shameful conduct? His critics seem to think he owes them a continuing 
perp walk. But a one-year suspension — he paid the price. Let the man 
live his life.
Now, I’m a Yankees fan, so I hope Rodriguez is productive this year. 
But that, I’m not counting on. Here’s an interesting statistic: From 
2011 through 2013, Rodriguez’s three most recent seasons on the field, 
he came to the plate with 742 runners on base and drove in 97 of them, a
 hair above 13 percent.
That stinks. During those three years, 269 major league players had 
the opportunity to drive in at least 486 runners, or an average of one a
 game. In terms of percentage, Rodriguez was 186th, behind not just the 
major league leaders — Allen Craig (who knocked in more than 21 
percent), Matt Carpenter (19.5) and Miguel Cabrera (19.5) — but also a 
number of current and former Yankees teammates, including Robinson Cano (17.6), Mark Teixeira (16.4), Chase Headley (16.1) and Derek Jeter (14.4).
And then there were such nonstars as Marco Scutaro (14.7), Ike Davis (13.8) and Jonny Gomes (13.3). Rodriguez trailed them, too.
I read a lot last week about Rodriguez’s encouraging performance in 
spring training. At the time, his batting average was sitting at .320, 
and he also had three home runs. All good. But you didn’t hear a lot 
about his measly four runs batted in.
That, unfortunately, sounds like the same old Rodriguez to me.I’d thought the reflexive lambasting of Alex Rodriguez had finally abated.

I’ve seen the best of times, the worst of times and pretty much 
everything in between. But I never thought it would come to this.
Let’s be honest: If you root for the Yankees
 and could choose Horace Clarke or Stephen Drew to start at second base 
in the season opener on Monday, are you absolutely sure you would want 
Drew? And that tells you all you need to know about just how bad this 
team is. The only thing that might keep it out of last place is the fact
 that Joe Maddon now works in Chicago.
Clarke is often cited as the face of the disastrous post-dynasty 
years: zero pennants 1965-1975 after 14 in the previous 16 seasons. But 
when you look at Drew, Clarke doesn’t seem as bad as we thought. Even in
 his worst years with the Yankees, Clarke never sank to the .491 O.P.S. 
that Drew posted for the Yankees last season. And Drew’s career batting 
average, .256, is no better than Clarke’s. In fact, it’s identical. 
Pitching? Masahiro Tanaka has a frayed elbow and is now acknowledging
 that he does not plan to throw as hard as he did a year ago. Michael 
Pineda can pitch very well even without pine tar, but since he came to 
the majors in 2011, it seems he’s spent as much time on the disabled 
list as on the mound. C. C. Sabathia
 will turn 35 in July, has nearly 3,000 innings on his arm and is coming
 off surgery: He is a textbook definition of a .500 pitcher, at best. 
And that’s the top of the rotation.
The bullpen should be strong if Dellin Betances comes close to what 
he did last year. But he’s 27 and has had exactly one good (O.K., 
spectacular) major league season. How likely is it that we’ll again see 
the Betances who blew away the league last year? 
But the main reason this team will be lucky to escape last place is 
this: There isn’t one player in the lineup who truly scares an opponent.
 Not one.
Game on the line, runners on base. If you’re the opposing manager or 
pitcher, are you going to get nervous if you see Brett Gardner come to 
the plate? (Nice player, but hardly scary.) Jacoby Ellsbury? (Ditto.) Mark Teixeira and Carlos Beltran look brittle and way past their primes until proven otherwise. Brian McCann has decent power, but really, is anyone quaking when he comes up? 
And if you expect serious offense from Alex Rodriguez,
 Chase Headley or Didi Gregorius (by the way, the only starting position
 player under 30), you probably shouldn’t hold your breath.
So what are Yankee fans to do, faced with the prospect of watching 
this bunch all season? Well, that other club in town seems to have a 
pretty interesting team. Heretical? O.K., then how about this: Get a 
Kickstarter campaign going, track down Clarke and make him an offer.
Chances are he wouldn’t produce much more than Drew. But then again, he’s 74. And for this team, that seems like a perfect fit.Let’s be honest: If you root for the Yankees
