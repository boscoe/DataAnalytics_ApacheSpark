Ethics investigators for FIFA, the ruling body of world soccer, have recommended sanctions be imposed on Sepp Blatter, the organization’s longtime president, and Michel Platini, the head of soccer’s European confederation, the organization said on Saturday.Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini, who have both been provisionally suspended from world soccer since early October as FIFA conducted an internal investigation into a financial transaction between them, will have the opportunity to defend themselves at a hearing, which is expected to take place in December. After that, the judge on FIFA’s ethics committee will decide whether to impose the more permanent sanctions that have been recommended.In the meantime, Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini remain forbidden to conduct any business related to the sport. Both men had appealed their provisional bans; earlier last week, FIFA announced that it had denied both appeals.
                Scandal and accusations have dotted the FIFA reign of Sepp Blatter.            Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini have the option to appeal that decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. Mr. Platini, who is eager to clear his name in order to be eligible to run for FIFA’s presidency in February, has done so, the court said. Mr. Blatter’s lawyers have not, perhaps seeking to focus further appeals not on the temporary ban but on any more lasting sanctions that could be ordered by FIFA’s ethics judge.AdvertisementBoth have maintained that they have done no wrong. Mr. Blatter’s lawyers centered their appeal to FIFA on a lack of evidence, charging that the organization had assumed Mr. Blatter was guilty rather than presuming he was innocent, and had rushed to oust him.AdvertisementFIFA’s code of ethics prohibits people of the same nationality from investigating one another, so individuals who are Swiss, like Mr. Blatter, or French, like Mr. Platini, were recused from investigating them.The investigation into Mr. Blatter was conducted by Robert Torres, the chief justice of Guam and a member of FIFA’s ethics committee, FIFA said. The investigation into Mr. Platini was conducted by Vanessa Allard, a lawyer from the Cayman Islands who also sits on the ethics committee.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Mr. Eckert is German.Both inquiries were undertaken in response to an unfolding criminal investigation by the Swiss authorities. In September, corruption allegations emerged surrounding a $2 million payment Mr. Blatter made to Mr. Platini in 2011 for work the two said had been done a decade earlier. No written contract for that work existed, they said.On Sept. 25, Switzerland’s attorney general, Michael Lauber, said that he was scrutinizing the transaction, and Mr. Blatter specifically, for possible criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. Two weeks later, FIFA announced the provisional suspensions of Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini.Saturday’s announcement signaled that FIFA was moving forward with its response to the federal investigation, and that the likelihood of formal sanctions, as now recommended by the ethics investigators, had increased.FIFA would not specify what penalties the internal investigators had recommended for Mr. Blatter and Mr. Platini. In October, FIFA ruled that Chung Mong-joon, a former FIFA vice president from South Korea, had violated FIFA’s ethics code in connection with the World Cup bidding process; the organization banned him from world soccer for six years and fined him about $100,000.A version of this article appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page SP10 of the New York edition with the headline: FIFA Ethics Committee Recommends New Set of Sanctions for Blatter and Platini.
