Bengals (10-3) at 49ers (4-9)4:25 p.m. Line: Bengals by 4.5A J McCarron versus Blaine Gabbert. Who saw that coming?While McCarron looks to be the first Alabama quarterback to win an N.F.L. game since 1987, Gabbert will continue his on-the-job audition to be the 49ers’ quarterback of the future.It is an underwhelming pairing compared with what before the season was projected to be the polished Andy Dalton (who broke his thumb last week) versus the athletic Colin Kaepernick (who was benched and subsequently put on injured reserve).But McCarron and Gabbert have shown an ability to move the ball, so it is a rare instance when a matchup of backups may prove to be entertaining.PICK: BengalsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
