He was named after the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.The bruising encounter ended with cuts near both of Klitschko’s eyes, and the judges Cesar Ramos and Raul Caiz Sr. scored the match 115-112 in favor of Fury, while Ramon Cerdan had it 116-111 in favor of Fury, a Briton whose record improved to 25-0. Klitschko, a Ukrainian, fell to 64-4. In his first defeat since April 2004, he surrendered the titles he had held from the World Boxing Association, the International Boxing Federation and the World Boxing Organization. “I saw my face in the mirror, and it didn’t look so nice,” Klitschko said. “But that’s boxing.” Advertisement
