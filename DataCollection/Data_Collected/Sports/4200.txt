Week 13 scores and highlightsThere is plenty of pessimism in Atlanta, as the Falcons have underperformed after a hot start. It seems especially stark this week when they are playing the optimistic Buccaneers. Tampa Bay has won two of its last three games, and Jameis Winston appears to have what it takes to succeed in the N.F.L. with solid results on the field, even if he still manages to be in the news too often for his myriad transgressions in college.Coach Lovie Smith has the Buccaneers believing they are capable of a playoff push, and if they can figure out what went wrong in pass protection last week against the Colts, he may be right.PICK: BUCCANEERSAdvertisement
