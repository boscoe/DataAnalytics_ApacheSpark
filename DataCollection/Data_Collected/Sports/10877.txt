CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times        UNIONDALE, N.Y. —  Sparky the Dragon, the toothy yet friendly Islanders mascot, was poised for interaction as the Anaheim Ducks took the ice for pregame warm-ups recently at Nassau Coliseum.With his intense stare and a fuzzy blue snout that never breathes fire, Sparky trudged out from the visiting team’s canopy-covered runway in clown-size sneakers before he was engulfed by shrieking fans of the Ducks.Sparky playfully mocked the guests from Southern California, even nipping the head of a laughing Ducks fan in a black jersey when she requested a photo with him.He brushed his furry arms, as if to dismiss remnants of the encounter with rival fans, and tramped off to meet the next mob eager for his dragonesque attention.AdvertisementIt is all in a game’s work for Sparky, whose future is murky as the Islanders prepare to move to Brooklyn after this season.AdvertisementMany elements from Nassau Coliseum will not make the trek to Barclays Center, which will be the team’s home after a 43-year run in Uniondale. Ushers, ticket takers and security staff members — many of whom have worked at the Coliseum for decades — also will not continue in their roles because of union regulations.Sparky has to await his fate along with an on-edge Islanders fan base preparing for the emotional roller coaster of the playoffs, which start next week.“After the season, we will discuss all operations and the in-game experience in Brooklyn,” said Barry Baum, Barclays Center’s chief communications officer. “Until then, our efforts are selling tickets and rooting for the Islanders in the playoffs.”Sparky, a part of the Nassau Coliseum in-game experience since 2001, when the Arena Football League’s Dragons also played there, stayed with the Islanders after the Dragons ceased operations in 2008. He participates in local school visits and birthday parties, and even the occasional bar mitzvah.Before games, Sparky roams the Coliseum concourse, orange wings flapping behind him along with a blue-and-white tail in the shape of a hockey stick — a nuance added when he became an exclusive member of the Islanders family.Youngsters beg for a pose. Giggling adults often receive a hug of their own. Ever mum, Sparky improvises, whether stopping by a suite or offering congratulations to a bride-to-be who has just accepted a proposal before 16,000-plus hockey fans.“Sparky is like family,” said Karen Crane of Bay Shore, an Islanders fan since the team’s Stanley Cup years of the early 1980s. “Of course he has to go with the team to Brooklyn. He’s special to us, and he’s an important part of the Islanders.”AdvertisementMascots have been a critical part of the fan experience for most N.H.L. teams for decades.Characters such as Harvey the Hound in Calgary, Carlton the Bear in Toronto, and Youppi — the former mascot for baseball’s Montreal Expos, who was later adopted by the Canadiens — bring an element of innocence that appeals to fans of any age.“A young fan often remembers meeting the mascot before even knowing the players,” said Dave McCarthy, the N.H.L.’s vice president for consumer products marketing. “That’s where affinity for a team starts.”Only three of the league’s 30 teams — the Rangers, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Edmonton Oilers — do not have mascots. This year’s All-Star weekend in Columbus included a competition called the Mascot Showdown, with the Eastern Conference winning and Stinger — of the host Blue Jackets — being named the most valuable player.Fans traveling to Nassau Coliseum from afar were impressed after an encounter with the home dragon sporting a No. 0 jersey.“I think Sparky’s cool,” said Milton Mohr, a longtime Islanders fan from Southey, Saskatchewan, who wanted to visit the arena before the Brooklyn move. “Everyone is happy to see him.”Whether Sparky makes the move 30 miles west to Brooklyn — a short subway ride from Madison Square Garden, where the Rangers play — will be decided by the team that relocates to Barclays Center, also home to the N.B.A.’s Nets.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the superheroish BrooklyKnight was a public relations disaster — he seemed to frighten youngsters with his severe metallic-colored mask. The character lasted two seasons.The concept of a Sparky-less future for the Islanders in Brooklyn was upsetting to some fresh-faced Islanders fans.For Noah Berman, celebrating his seventh birthday with his parents, his grandparents and many enthusiastic friends in a suite overlooking the Coliseum ice, an in-game Sparky visit was enough to temporarily distract them from the action between the Islanders and the Ducks.Advertisement“I feel happy when I see Sparky, and I like him,” Noah said. “I like that he knows how to use his hands instead of talking and also that he has orange things sticking up from the top of his head.”Asked whether Sparky should continue his role and patrol Barclays Center when the Islanders set up shop next season, Noah was emphatic.“They should take him to Brooklyn,” he said. “Because Sparky is nice!”A version of this article appears in print on April 6, 2015, on Page D9 of the New York edition with the headline: A Mascot With a Fuzzy Future.
