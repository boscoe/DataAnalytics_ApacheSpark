AdvertisementSupported byBy The New York TimesThe Mets’ decision to give this year’s opening day start to Bartolo Colon instead of Matt Harvey has created something of a stir. Then again, the Mets have done really well on opening days, whether an ace like Tom Seaver or Dwight Gooden was starting or a less-heralded pitcher was on the mound.Consider this: Seaver and Gooden pitched a combined 19 openers for the Mets, while the other 34 starts went to a number of other pitchers. Together, as detailed below, they helped produce a Mets opening day record of 34-19, which is not bad for a team with a regular-season record that is nearly 400 games below .500.Roger Craig 1962, 1963Two of his 46 losses in 1962 and 1963 came on opening days. He also committed three balks in the defeats.Al Jackson 1964, 1965Two starts, two losses.Jack Fisher 1966Lost 24 games in 1965 but got the nod the next April.
