The International Olympic Committee said it would create a mourning area in the Olympic Village at next year’s Rio de Janeiro Games where participants could remember family or friends during a moment of reflection at the closing ceremony. The remembrance area will “remember all those who have lost their lives at the Olympic Games,” Thomas Bach, the I.O.C.’s president, said at a news conference in Rio. Bach said that a “solemn moment of reflection” would recall events such as the deaths of 11 Israelis killed when Palestinian gunmen invaded the athletes’ village at the 1972 Munich Games.A version of this brief appears in print on March 1, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Area to Be Set for Mourning.
