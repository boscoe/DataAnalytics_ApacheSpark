The soda company will not renew its deal with the Mets even though the team finally turned things around. So farewell, Pepsi Porch. And goodbye, giant Pepsi sign.“Pepsi loves the great sport of baseball,” the company said in a statement. “We’ve had a productive relationship with the Mets and wish them all the best in the future, but have decided to reinvest in a different way.”The company declined to say how it would redirect its money. But according to Sports Business Journal, Pepsi will pour more marketing dollars into its existing deal with the Chicago Cubs, who are renovating Wrigley Field. The Cubs, of course, also had a surprisingly successful season before they were swept by the Mets in the National League Championship Series.Pepsi felt that it was already represented in New York at Yankee Stadium and wanted to invest more in Chicago, where it has been a sponsor of the Cubs since the 1980s, according to Sports Business Journal.The Mets will remove the giant red sign that displayed the soda maker’s name and towered over the second deck in right field, which was aptly named the Pepsi Porch. Meanwhile, Pepsi’s departure has not gone unnoticed. Coca-Cola is in discussions to become the official soda of the Mets. If a deal is reached, will the team rename the second deck in right field in honor of Coke? Stay tuned. Advertisement
