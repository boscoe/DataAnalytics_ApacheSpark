Crosby had one goal in his previous 19 playoff games.“I don’t think we gave him that much space,” Lundqvist said. “It was just they were better today at getting to the front of the net and getting to loose pucks.”Crosby savored the victory as the series was set to move to Pittsburgh on Monday.“Sometimes in the playoffs, you play well and you don’t always get the result that you want,” Crosby said. “It’s good to get rewarded.”Derek Stepan opened the scoring when he rifled a high shot past Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury at 17:05 of the first, finishing a pretty setup by J. T. Miller and Ryan McDonagh.Pittsburgh held a 5-3 advantage in shots after the opening period, during which the Rangers failed to convert on two power plays. They fumbled their first five advantages after scoring once in five chances in the opener, and the Penguins held a 3-1 lead after two periods.A sixth power play finally yielded a goal for the Rangers as Brassard — who had scored 28 seconds into Game 1 — managed to direct a loose puck past Fleury at 3:16 of the third, closing the gap to 3-2.That jolted the crowd, and white towels waved in unison when the Rangers garnered their seventh power play after a hooking penalty against Brandon Sutter at 5:46 of the third.The Rangers again failed to convert, but they nearly scored the tying goal — short-handed — on a mad scramble in front of Fleury several minutes later.This time, it was Malkin in the role of defenseman who rescued Fleury with a swipe of his stick to save a skittering puck from edging over the goal line.Chris Kunitz, who also had two assists, then made the Rangers pay, netting a power-play goal at 9:41 to restore the Penguins’ two-goal lead.Rick Nash scored for the Rangers with 5.1 seconds remaining.The night clearly belonged to Crosby, who was held to one goal in 13 playoff games last spring.“He’s a great player,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said. “The best players in the N.H.L. are going to get some looks and he got some looks tonight.”The game had a similar feel to the opener — tense and tight with the sense that the slightest error from either team could shift the outcome.When the Penguins finally solved Lundqvist, who had 18 saves, midway through the second on a power-play goal by Sutter at 10:01, there seemed to be a palpable momentum shift.Sutter had hit the post to Lundqvist’s left earlier in the period, during which Pittsburgh held an 11-10 advantage in shots.Fleury had lost four straight at the Garden, starting with Game 6 of last year’s second-round series, which the Rangers won after trailing three games to one.Fleury, who also was defeated twice at the Garden during the regular season, made 23 saves.“We hung in there, found a nice way to get some goals, and it felt nice to get that win,” Fleury said.Lundqvist was not surprised to see the Penguins’ best players perform as they have so often.“They have some really skilled players and you have to respect that,” he said.The Rangers, who lead Eastern Conference teams with 29 postseason wins since the start of the 2012 playoffs, failed again to start a series with two straight home wins. They last accomplished that feat in the second round against Washington in 1994.SLAP SHOTSThe Rangers are 22-6 in playoff series when they have won Game 1 of a series at home.Advertisement
