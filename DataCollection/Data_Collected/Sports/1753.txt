Britain’s League Cup, the one soccer tournament you simply cannot explain to nonsoccer friends, bubbles up in midweek. Best to ignore it for now then look up in February to see if your club is in the final; that’s what most Premier League managers will do.The M.L.S. playoffs begin Wednesday and Thursday. The top two teams in each conference earned byes and will not play until the weekend, but the one-game first-rounders offer some enticing matchups: The Los Angeles Galaxy managed to lose their way into a date with Seattle on Wednesday (10 p.m., Eastern time, Unimas), while Didier Drogba-led Montreal won its way into a home game against Canadian rival Toronto F.C. on Thursday (7 p.m., Unimas). The Red Bulls, who won the Supporters’ Shield as regular-season champion, will open on the road Sunday: opponent, time and even TV network to be determined.Chelsea hosts Liverpool bright and early Saturday (8:45 a.m., NBCSN). On beIN Sports, Real Madrid (11 a.m.) and Barcelona (3:30 p.m.) face Liga stragglers as they circle each other in advance of the season’s first Clásico on Nov. 21, so tune in for the meat in that Spanish sandwich: the Turin Derby between Juventus and Torino at 1 p.m.Want something even more intense? Try the Tel Aviv Derby between Maccabi and Hapoel at noon. Of course, you will have to visualize it or just follow online; the game will not be televised in the United States.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
