The Miami Dolphins decided against matching the contract offer that tight end Charles Clay had received from Buffalo, an A.F.C. East rival, so he will join the Bills after signing their $38 million, five-year deal Tuesday. The Dolphins had the right to match after giving Clay a transition tag two weeks ago, but they decided the price was too high.■ The Washington Redskins re-signed the free-agent quarterback Colt McCoy. The signing means, at least for now, that the three quarterbacks who started games for last year’s 4-12 club will return, including Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins. Coach Jay Gruden has said that Griffin will enter the season as the starter.■ The Jacksonville Jaguars claimed running back Bernard Pierce off waivers a day after his drunken-driving charge led to his release Wednesday by the Baltimore Ravens.A version of this brief appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Dolphins Decline to Match Bills’ Bid for Clay.
