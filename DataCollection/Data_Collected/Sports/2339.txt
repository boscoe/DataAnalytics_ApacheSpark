In his ruling, Judge Lawrence K. Marks said the committee’s arbitration process had been compromised by a conflict of interest.MASN carries the games of both the Nationals and the Baltimore Orioles, but the Orioles are the network’s majority owner. The Orioles challenged the award of baseball’s Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee on several grounds, including the Proskauer Rose law firm’s representation of the Nationals in the arbitration and in other matters for M.L.B. and the three teams, including the Mets, whose owners sat on the committee.Marks rejected all other grounds to vacate the award and seized only on the Proskauer conflict. “MASN and the Orioles have established that their well-documented concerns fell entirely on deaf ears,” he wrote.He added, “This complete inaction objectively demonstrates an utter lack of concern for the fairness of the proceeding.”The revenue sharing committee will almost certainly be asked to decide again on the Nationals’ request for much higher rights fees. The Nationals — formerly the Montreal Expos — are still being paid according to the contract they signed when they moved to Washington in time for the 2005 season.Advertisement
