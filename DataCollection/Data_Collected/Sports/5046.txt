Bears (5-8) at Vikings (8-5)1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 5.5The Vikings have been hit hard by injuries to their defense, and it may not get any easier this week. Linval Joseph, perhaps their most important defensive player, is likely to miss a third consecutive game. The Vikings will have their secondary’s depth tested mightily. Last week, the Vikings sent out multiple rookie cornerbacks and moved Terence Newman, a veteran corner, to safety. They may get some players back this week, but the hits have kept coming with Everson Griffen, a defensive end who has 8.5 sacks, missing practice. They may be able to cobble together enough to beat Chicago, but they need to get everyone back if they expect to be a true contender.PICK: VikingsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
