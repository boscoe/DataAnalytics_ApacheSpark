On her Facebook page, she subsequently wrote: “My tweet made the news! And check out what KO has to say! I sent to make sure he was aware of this Penn State legacy, started in 1970’s, which has raised over $114mil plus $13mil this yr. — the Penn State culture he can’t deny.”At another point, Olbermann wrote on Twitter, “PSU students are pitiful because they’re PSU students — period.”On Tuesday afternoon, he apologized, also on Twitter, for “being stupid and childish.”ESPN said in a statement that Olbermann’s actions were “completely inappropriate and does not reflect the views of ESPN.”“We have discussed it with Keith, who recognizes he was wrong,” the statement said.Last month, Olbermann excoriated the settlement of a lawsuit by Pennsylvania officials that restored the 111 victories that the N.C.A.A. had rescinded from Joe Paterno after the sexual abuse scandal involving his former assistant Jerry Sandusky. The settlement, which Olbermann described as a “reprehensible bargain,” also called for spending the $60 million fine imposed by the N.C.A.A. on fighting child abuse in Pennsylvania. Advertisement
