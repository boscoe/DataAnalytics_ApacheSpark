Fantasy football analysis for N.F.L. Week 16 games. You can also follow the Sablich brothers on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy and see their complete Week 16 player rankings.8:25 p.m. Saturday. Line: Eagles by 3Quarterback Sam Bradford (PHI) — His best performance of the season came against the Redskins in Week 4 (270 passing yards, three touchdowns). He’s also coming off his best game since Week 4, with 361 yards and two touchdowns (and two interceptions) last weekend against the Cardinals. He’s still not in QB1 territory, but there is some hope here for those very desperate for a quarterback in Week 16.Kirk Cousins (WAS) — The Eagles have allowed the fifth most fantasy points to the position (19.8 F.P.P.G.), and Cousins had 21.7 in Week 4. Coming off a four-touchdown performance, Cousins is worthy of low-end QB1 consideration this weekend.Running BackDeMarco Murray/Darren Sproles/Ryan Mathews (PHI) — After just two carries last weekend against the Cardinals, Murray’s season, and his tenure with the Eagles, appears all but over. Mathews, who had 58 yards on 11 carries against Arizona, is the only back to consider in fantasy formats, but only as a flex.AdvertisementAlfred Morris/Matt Jones (WAS) — The Eagles are the seventh-best fantasy matchup for running backs, but neither Morris nor Jones has topped 10 fantasy points in the last five weeks.AdvertisementWide Receiver/Tight EndJordan Matthews (PHI) — He caught eight passes for 159 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinals last weekend, his third game in the last four with a touchdown. He didn’t do much against the Redskins in Week 4, but they have allowed the seventh most fantasy points to the position this season (26.3 F.P.P.G).DeSean Jackson (WAS) — Coming off his best fantasy performance of the season (21.3 points), Jackson now has a touchdown in four of his last five games. He’s a solid WR2 play against the team yielding the third most fantasy points to receivers (28.3 F.P.P.G).Jordan Reed (WAS) — The Eagles are the third-toughest fantasy matchup for tight ends, allowing just three touchdowns to the position. They held Reed to five catches for 37 yards in Week 4.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            1 p.m. Sunday. Line: Panthers by 7QuarterbackMatt Ryan (ATL) — The Panthers’ fifth-best passing defense (224.8 Y.P.G.) has allowed the fourth fewest F.P.P.G. (14.3) and held Ryan to 224 passing yards and no touchdowns in Week 14. There’s no reason to play Ryan this weekend.Cam Newton (CAR) — He had 265 yards and three touchdowns against this unit in Week 14, which was, compared to his recent lofty standards, somewhat of a disappointment. He has thrown five touchdown passes three times over the past five games..Running BackDevonta Freeman (ATL) — He was held to 40 rushing yards on 12 carries with no touchdowns in Week 14, but that was only the second time he was held below 10 fantasy points since he established himself as the team’s starter. The odds are he’ll perform at an RB1 level this weekend.Wide Receiver/Tight EndJulio Jones (ATL) — Fantasy’s third best receiver was held to 88 scoreless yards against the Panthers in Week 14 and has only topped 10 fantasy points once in the last four weeks. Nothing should keep you from starting him in your fantasy championship game, but the matchup is not ideal with a title on the line.AdvertisementTed Ginn Jr. (CAR) — With seven touchdown receptions in his last four games, Ginn is now the 15th-ranked fantasy receiver. His best game of the season came against the Falcons in Week 14 (120 yards, two touchdowns).Greg Olsen (CAR) — He remains an elite play at the position, but he was held to three catches and 52 yards in Week 14 (5.2 points).1 p.m. Line: Bills by 7QuarterbackTyrod Taylor (BUF) — No quarterback has topped 20 fantasy points since Tom Brady in Week 5 (25.3). But Taylor, fantasy’s seventh best quarterback, has at least 25 fantasy points in three of his last four games, keeping him in the QB1 conversation.Running BackDarren McFadden (DAL) — The Bills are just average against the ground game, and McFadden has been remarkably consistent since becoming the starter in Week 7, with just two games under 10 fantasy points during that span. He’s worthy of low-end RB1 consideration.Karlos Williams (BUF) — He should receive the majority of the backfield work, with LeSean McCoy expected to be out. He’s a solid RB2 against a Cowboys defense allowing the sixth most fantasy points to the position (21.2 F.P.P.G).Wide Receiver/Tight EndDez Bryant (DAL) — He had his first touchdown since Week 11 last week, just his third of the season. He’s an WR3 play at best.Sammy Watkins (BUF) — With two more touchdowns last weekend against the Redskins, he now has six in his last four games. The matchup is tough (18.4 F.P.P.G., fifth fewest), but nothing can keep him out of the WR1 tier at this point.1 p.m. Line: Lions by 10.5QuarterbackMatthew Stafford (DET) — Only one quarterback has over 20 fantasy points against the 49ers since Week 5 (Russell Wilson, 25.4 points Week 11). Stafford, who has 12 touchdown passes in his last four games, is worthy of low-end QB1 consideration.AdvertisementRunning BackShaun Draughn (SF) — He’s questionable to play this week with a knee injury. He’s only viable in P.P.R. leagues should he play, as he has only topped 10 fantasy points in standard leagues once since becoming the starter in Week 9.Wide ReceiverCalvin Johnson/Golden Tate (DET) — Johnson’s season is ending badly, with just one reception in each of his last two games. He’s tough to trust as an WR2 this weekend, while Tate, who has two touchdowns in each of his last two games, is the high-upside WR2 play.1 p.m. No betting line.Running BackAlfred Blue (HOU) — He was held to 39 yards on 14 carries against the Titans in Week 8. He’s a flex play for the very desperate.Wide Receiver/Tight EndDeAndre Hopkins (HOU) — With only one game in his last four with a touchdown and more than 10 fantasy points, he’s not as reliable as you’d like from a stud fantasy receiver down the stretch. He did have 94 yards and a touchdown in Week 8.Delanie Walker (TEN) — He made the most of his two catches last weekend against the Patriots, scoring two touchdowns. Walker hauled in all six of his targets for 62 yards in Week 8 and remains one of the better TE plays this weekend.1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 13QuarterbackAlex Smith (KC) — The Browns allow the sixth most fantasy points to the position (19.8 F.P.P.G.), but Smith cannot be trusted, especially after his 171 yards and one touchdown in a favorable matchup against the Ravens.Running BackCharcandrick West/Spencer Ware (KC) — The matchup is enticing, as the Browns allow the second most rushing yards (134.9 Y.P.G.), and the eighth most fantasy points (20.5 F.P.P.G.). The banged-up Ware is expected to get a few carries, but West’s majority share should produce RB2 numbers with RB1-upside.Wide Receiver/Tight EndJeremy Maclin (KC) — With seven catches for 50 yards and a touchdown, Maclin topped 10 fantasy points last week for the third time in his last four games. He’s in the WR1 conversation against the Browns (27.2 F.P.P.G., fifth most).AdvertisementGary Barnidge (CLE) — Sure, the Chiefs allow the fewest fantasy points to the position (5.1 F.P.P.G.), but Barnidge has proved to be a consistent performer, no matter his quarterback or the opponent, and is tied for third in the N.F.L. among tight ends in touchdowns (9).Travis Kelce (KC) — He’s quietly piled up the receiving yards (822, fifth most at the position), but he hasn’t been a factor in the red zone, with just two touchdowns in his last 13 games. He cannot be trusted.1 p.m. Line: Dolphins by 2.5QuarterbackRyan Tannehill (MIA) — After getting his owners’ hopes up with seven touchdown passes between Weeks 10-12, and 351 yards and three touchdowns in Week 12 against the Jets, he’s averaged just 13.1 F.P.P.G. over the last three games. There’s no reason to consider Tannehill during the fantasy football playoffs, no matter the matchup.Running BackFrank Gore (IND) — The Dolphins allow the second most fantasy points to backs (24.3 F.P.P.G.), but it’s difficult to get excited about a back who has topped 10 fantasy points just once in the last five games and has 5.9 points in each of his last two games.Lamar Miller (MIA) — He was a huge bust in a favorable matchup with the Chargers last weekend (2.4 fantasy points) and is tough to trust with three games under 5.5 fantasy points in his last five.Wide ReceiverT. Y. Hilton/Donte Moncrief (IND) — The boom-or-bust nature of both receivers make it impossible to expect much from either despite the favorable matchup (26.1 F.P.P.G., 10th most).Jarvis Landry (MIA) — He’s earned the right to be an every-week WR2 but hasn’t shown much in recent weeks, with no touchdowns and less than 10 fantasy points in each of his last three games. The Colts allow the sixth most fantasy points to the position and have allowed at least one receiver to score in all but two games, so there’s some hope.4:05 p.m. Line: Saints by 3.5Quarterback Drew Brees (NO) — It doesn’t get much better for your championship game than Brees at home against a 25th-ranked Jacksonville pass defense that has permitted the third most fantasy points to the position. But a foot injury could spoil your plans. Check the injury reports on Sunday morning.Advertisement Blake Bortles (JAC) — Bortles playing indoors against fantasy’s most favorable matchup for the position is arguably just as good as rolling out a healthy Brees in Week 16. This game has shootout written all over it.Running Back Tim Hightower (NO) — He will warrant RB2 consideration as he continues to see the bulk of the touches. Jacksonville ranks 12th against the run.T.J. Yeldon/Denard Robinson (JAC) — Yeldon would be a strong start against the league’s worst run-stopping unit. Opposing backs have rung up seven straight double-digit fantasy games against the Saints since Week 8. Monitor his progress throughout the week.Wide Receiver/Tight End  Willie Snead/Brandin Cooks (NO) — Cooks is a must-start WR1 against a weak Jacksonville secondary that has allowed at least 13 fantasy points to an opposing receiver in each of their last four games. Snead has stat lines of 7/122 and 10/76 over his last two weeks and will be a worthwhile WR3 play.Allen Robinson/Allen Hurns (JAC) — Both Jacksonville wideouts need to be in lineups against the league’s 30th-ranked pass defense.Ben Watson (NO) — Watson continues his surprise fantasy resurgence, catching six of his 12 targets for 48 yards and a touchdown against the Lions last Monday. He’ll be a solid TE1 play against the Jaguars, who are permitting nearly 10 fantasy points a week to the position this season.Julius Thomas (JAC) — No team allows more fantasy points to the position than the Saints. Consider Thomas a top-end TE1 option this weekend.1 p.m. Line: Patriots by 3Quarterback Tom Brady (NE) — The Jets have toughened up against the pass in recent weeks, but Brady should finally get Julian Edelman back this week and is never a candidate to sit as long as he is active. He managed 355 yards and three total touchdowns against this same unit in Week 7.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ryan Fitzpatrick (NYJ) — The Patriots are the fifth worst fantasy matchup a quarterback can have this year, and they have allowed just one game of more than 18 points to the position in their last eight. Fitzpatrick found fantasy success in Week 7 (292 yards/2 touchdowns), but you can’t feel too confident rolling the erratic Fitzpatrick out as anything more than a high-end QB2 during this championship week.AdvertisementRunning Back Chris Ivory (NYJ) — Ivory face-planted hard (figuratively) last week against a mediocre Dallas run defense that had allowed 200 yards the previous week to Green Bay. Bilal Powell’s increased role in recent weeks and a date with fantasy’s seventh worst matchup for the position lands Ivory in the midrange RB2 tier this weekend.Steven Jackson/James White/Brandon Bolden (NE) — The Jets rank No. 2 in the N.F.L. against the run, and are also the second worst running back matchup in fantasy. The stable of Patriots backs, which now includes the veteran Jackson, will be tough to trust in your championship game.Wide Receiver/Tight End Brandon Marshall/Eric Decker (NYJ) — The Patriots held Marshall to a season-low four catches for 67 yards in Week 7 while managing to keep Decker out of the end zone. But you’ll still be starting both in this average matchup.Julian Edelman/Brandon LaFell/Danny Amendola (NE) — Edelman is expected back, and will be the Patriots receiver to trust against the Jets’ talented but underachieving secondary. Rob Gronkowski (NE) — He is in good enough health, and Coach Bill Belichick is not one to rest his players before the playoffs, so he is, once again, fantasy’s top TE play this week.1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 3 Quarterback Jameis Winston (TB) — The Bears have been extremely vulnerable through the air in recent weeks, yielding 25 fantasy points to Blaine Gabbert in Week 13, 21 to Kirk Cousins in Week 14, and 32 points to Teddy Bridgewater last weekend. Winston is coming off 363 yards and two touchdowns and is a viable QB1 option, considering the matchup.Jay Cutler (CHI) — The matchup is decent, with the Bucs allowing 18 points per week to opposing quarterbacks over their last three contests, but trusting Cutler on the road in your championship game is a hard pill to swallow.Running Back Matt Forte/Jeremy Langford (CHI) — The Bucs have permitted double-digit fantasy points to an opposing running back in four of their last five games. Forte is high-end RB1 option.Advertisement Doug Martin (TB) — The Bears have yielded double-digit points to an opposing back in eight of their last nine games. Martin’s strong renaissance season should continue this weekend with worthwhile RB1 production.Wide Receiver/Tight End Alshon Jeffery (CHI) — Jeffery is in an elite option against fantasy’s ninth best matchup for the position. The Bucs have allowed six receivers to score at least 10 fantasy points in their last four games.Mike Evans (TB) — The Bears’ secondary was just lit up by Stefon Diggs for two touchdowns and have been burned all season by elite WR1 players in the same class as Evans, despite ranking third in the league against the pass. He’s a strong WR1 play this weekend.Austin Seferian-Jenkins (TB) — Jenkins has exactly three receptions in each of his last three games and has a tough matchup (sixth worst). He’s a borderline TE1 play at best.1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 11.5Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger (PIT) — Roethlisberger went off on the best pass defense in the league (380/2 TDs) last week despite being a bust against Cincinnati the week prior. He should be in line for another great stat line against the hapless Ravens, who have allowed the seventh most fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks.Running Back DeAngelo Williams (PIT) — Williams still turned in a solid fantasy day last week despite a daunting matchup against the Denver run defense. The Ravens are no slouches either, allowing the fourth fewest F.P.P.G. to backs. But Lamar Miller and Charcandrick West have managed to reach double digits against them in recent weeks despite playing in far-less explosive offenses.Javorius Allen (BAL) — Allen was a major disappointment as the featured back against Kansas City, managing just 44 yards on 14 carries with a fumble. He’s low-end RB2 material at best against a stout Pittsburgh run defense that ranks as fifth best in the N.F.L.Wide Receiver Antonio Brown/Martavis Bryant (PIT) — Both are great starts against Baltimore’s resistance-free secondary that has allowed the most fantasy points to the position is 2015.AdvertisementKamar Aiken (BAL) — Pittsburgh’s secondary is fantasy’s second best matchup for the position, but Aiken was already the only Ravens pass-catcher you should have been considering starting anyway. He tallied 77 yards and a touchdown on five receptions against the Steelers in Week 4.4:25 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 4.5 Quarterback Aaron Rodgers (GB) — Rodgers’s owners who somehow survived last week’s disaster in Oakland can’t be too confident with a road game against the Cardinals, who have limited the position to a 15-point fantasy average in 2015 (eighth worst quarterback matchup). Consider him a midrange QB1 option and hope for the best.Carson Palmer (ARI) — Palmer owners were surely expecting a lot more against a weak Eagles defense last weekend, but unfortunately he wasn’t called on to do much with David Johnson carrying the offense. He remains top-end QB1 material against a Packers unit that has allowed 19-point games to Derek Carr and Matthew Stafford in recent weeks.Running Back David Johnson (ARI) — Johnson single-handedly won many fantasy games last week with his 189-yard, three-touchdown performance. Green Bay ranks 22nd against the run.Eddie Lacy/James Starks (GB) — Lacy falls back to the RB3 tier after a dismal 11-carry, 23-yard performance against the Raiders last weekend. The Cardinals play stout run defense, ranking fourth against the run in 2015, and are the sixth worst matchup in terms of fantasy. Wide Receiver Larry Fitzgerald/Michael Floyd/John Brown (ARI) — Fitzgerald has been a disappointment in four straight games and will be a low-end WR2 play against a talented Packers secondary that is considered the ninth worst fantasy matchup a wideout can have. Floyd and Brown continue to earn WR2 respect and are the more trustworthy options.Randall Cobb (GB) — It’s hard to recommend Cobb or any of these receivers with so much at stake, considering their recent production and the matchup. The Cardinals’ capable secondary has allowed just two touchdowns to the position over the last five weeks.4:25 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 14.5Quarterback Russell Wilson (SEA) — Wilson is averaging about 29 F.P.P.G over his last five starts and has been the most consistent quarterback in the league during this time span, scoring at least 20 fantasy points in each of his five games. We’re pretty sure you’re starting him this weekend.AdvertisementRunning Back Todd Gurley (STL) — Seattle has the league’s third best run defense (83.9 Y.P.G.) and is the worst running back matchup in fantasy. Gurley remains in play as an RB1 option, but with a lower ceiling than normal.Christine Michael (SEA) — He emerged out of Seattle’s running back committee with the most carries in Week 15, which makes him the most sensible play this week against the Rams’ 23rd ranked run defense that has allowed the 10th most fantasy points to the running opposition in 2015.Wide Receiver Tavon Austin (STL) — Austin produced all of his 7 fantasy points as a rusher when these teams met in Week 1, as the Seattle secondary held him to just 2 receptions for -2 receiving yards on five targets. He’s a tough sell this weekend.Doug Baldwin (SEA) — The Rams have allowed three 100-yard receiving games to receivers in the last three weeks, and they permitted a receiver to score at least 11 fantasy points over their last five games. Baldwin, with a mind-boggling 10 touchdowns in his last four games, is obviously a must-start.8:30 p.m. Line: Vikings by 5Quarterback Eli Manning (NYG) — Minnesota ranks seventh against the pass, but have allowed big fantasy performances to Russell Wilson (34) and Carson Palmer (20) in two of their last three contests. Unfortunately for Manning owners, the odds aren’t good that he achieves similar success with Odell Beckham Jr. suspended.Teddy Bridgewater (MIN) — He has strung together consecutive QB1 starts, including four touchdowns last weekend, which was easily the best game of his Vikings career. Desperate owners at the position should strongly consider his services against the worst-ranked pass defense in the N.F.L.Running Back Rashad Jennings (NYG) - The Giants’ value-sapping, five-way running back committee appears to have been finally laid to rest, with Jennings carrying the load over the last two weeks. He has answered the call swimmingly, with consecutive 100-yard efforts. Unfortunately for most owners, this emergence comes too late (as it has for the Giants as well). Jennings can be considered a strong flex play against the league’s 20th-ranked run defense.Adrian Peterson (MIN) — Peterson is expected to be just fine for Sunday night’s game after a minor ankle scare in Week 15. You’ll obviously want him in your lineup against the Giants’ 21st-ranked run defense.AdvertisementWide Receiver Rueben Randle/Odell Beckham Jr. (NYG) — Randle’s sneaky first-quarter score last weekend marked the third time in four games he has reached the end zone. His stock has been boosted with Beckham’s suspension, but we’ve been here before with Randle, only to be let down. The matchup isn’t exactly a cakewalk either, as Minnesota’s seventh-ranked pass defense held Alshon Jeffery to one reception for 10 yards (and a touchdown) in Week 15. Stefon Diggs (MIN) — It took six weeks, but Diggs finally found his way back into the end zone as he hauled in two touchdowns and 53 totals yards on three receptions against the Bears. He’ll be one of the better WR3/4 dart throws this week against the league’s worst secondary, just keep in mind he hasn’t had more than four receptions since Week 11.8:30 p.m. Line: Broncos by 3 Running Back Jeremy Hill/Giovani Bernard (CIN) — A tough break for Hill and Bernard owners, as they must take on the league’s top-ranked run stopping defense on its home turf.Wide Receiver A. J. Green (CIN) — Denver has been the toughest matchup a receiver can have for the majority of 2015. While that didn’t stop Antonio Brown last week, Green is definitely a safer bet as a WR2 play considering his health and a shaky quarterback situation. Demaryius Thomas/Emmanuel Sanders (DEN) — The Bengals rank 21st against the pass this season. Start your Denver receivers as you normally would.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
