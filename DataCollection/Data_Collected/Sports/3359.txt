IOWA CITY —  In the early 1970s, amid the Iowa football team’s 19-year streak without a winning season, the former University of Iowa president Willard Boyd arrived early to a Big Ten meeting and made small talk with his friend Novice Fawcett, the president of Ohio State.Coach Ray Nagel had just left Iowa. Ohio State, one of college football’s most pedigreed programs, had just been to the Rose Bowl and was a couple of years removed from a national championship.So when Fawcett asked Boyd whom he planned to hire to replace Nagel, Boyd pithily replied with the name of Ohio State’s already legendary coach: “Woody Hayes.”“The joke is that that’s so preposterous,” Boyd, 88, said decades later.“We want to win, to go to bowl games,” Boyd added. “But we’re not obsessed with going to the Rose Bowl. That would be foolish.”AdvertisementRight now, however, Iowa fans could be forgiven for exuberance. The No. 6 Hawkeyes (No. 5 according to the College Football Playoff selection committee) are 10-0. If they beat Purdue and Nebraska in their final two regular-season games, as they are favored to do, and then prevail in the Big Ten championship game in Indianapolis on Dec. 5, they will be a shoo-in for the playoff and a chance at the program’s first national championship since 1958. They also will be one of the more unlikely title contenders in recent years.Iowa is not ranked in the Football Bowl Subdivision’s top 10 in scoring offense or defense. Its starting offensive tackles began their careers as walk-ons. With a few exceptions, its victories have been close: 10-6 over No. 21 Wisconsin; tied until late in a 31-17 win over lowly Iowa State; 27-24 against Pittsburgh, on a 57-yard field goal at the end of regulation.AdvertisementInvited to praise the perfect Hawkeyes last week, the playoff selection committee’s chairman, Jeff Long, was the opposite of gushing. “They are consistent on both sides of the ball,” he said. “They’re not a flashy team, but they are consistent.”But that lack of flash, to use Long’s term, or foolishness, to use Boyd’s, is crucial to this year’s success. A more even temper among fans and decision-makers may be all that saved Kirk Ferentz, now in his 17th season as head coach, from being fired less than a year ago.In January, Iowa was coming off a 7-6 season that included a 45-28 loss to Tennessee in the TaxSlayer Bowl. Ferentz had not won more than eight games since 2009, and one of the things blocking his firing seemed to be his famously burdensome contract. The deal, agreed to in 2010 when Ferentz was coming off an 11-2 season and drawing renewed attention from N.F.L. teams, pays him more than $4 million a year and included a reported eight-figure buyout clause.“Don’t think there weren’t a lot of people who wanted me fired and wanted Coach fired last year and the last couple of years,” said Gary Barta, Iowa’s athletic director.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            But Barta defended Ferentz “100 percent” in January. And Ferentz held a news conference at which he acknowledged, “I’m not totally tone-deaf,” adding that he was “very disappointed for all of us.”Big contract or not, at many top programs, a coach in Ferentz’s position would have been gone. One state over, Nebraska fired Bo Pelini the day after the 2014 regular season ended even though in his seven seasons Pelini’s teams never once won fewer than nine games.AdvertisementBut that is Nebraska, a program that won three national championships in the 1990s. Iowa’s fans might be a little more forgiving. And a lot more patient.“If you look back at Iowa football, there’s always ups and downs, and usually when there’s a down, there’s a huge up,” said Boone Myers, one of the ex-walk-on offensive tackles, an ardent fan as a boy in the small town of Webster City.“Growing up I was really patient,” he added. “When we had a bad year, I wasn’t like, ‘Oh, we’re not going to win this year.’ I was always like, ‘It’s going to be good, because the Hawkeyes pull through.’ ”That kind of attitude has enabled Iowa’s continuity: Ferentz and Hayden Fry have been the only two football coaches at Iowa since 1979.Ferentz arrived at Iowa in 1981 as a young offensive-line coach with intentions of moving back east — he grew up in Pittsburgh — after a year or two.But 1981 was the year Fry led the Hawkeyes to their first Rose Bowl in nearly a quarter-century. Ferentz and his wife, Mary, “fell in love with the place,” he said, and stayed nine years. He formed part of a cadre of assistants that included the future head coaches Bill Snyder, Barry Alvarez and Bob Stoops.In 1999, after tenures as Maine’s coach and as an N.F.L. assistant, Ferentz succeeded Fry.Ferentz has run the team pretty much the same way ever since. He said suggestions that he had employed more aggressive in-game strategies this year were unfounded. The main changes, he said, have been new facilities and a switch to morning practices.Asked why this year’s team is performing so much better than last year’s — which had at least as much talent, including left tackle Brandon Scherff, drafted fifth over all by the Washington Redskins — Iowa’s players spoke of a leadership gap.“I think a big part of being successful is having leaders and having guys who step up and lead the young guys,” quarterback C. J. Beathard said. “We’ve got guys that aren’t selfish. And they had some guys who were doing their own thing last year.”AdvertisementLike most programs, Iowa endeavors to lock down its state’s most talented prospects, tending to home-brew its linemen and look elsewhere for skill-position players. Cornerback Desmond King, whose total of eight interceptions leads the Football Bowl Subdivision, is from Detroit. Running back Jordan Canzeri is from Troy, N.Y. Beathard, a junior, is from Franklin, Tenn. (He is the grandson of the Super Bowl-winning general manager Bobby Beathard, a fact his official Iowa bio modestly omits.)At a news conference Monday, a reporter asked Ferentz about LeShun Daniels Jr., a junior running back who ran for 195 yards and three touchdowns last Saturday and who hails from Warren, Ohio: “How did you get LeShun out of the Ohio State living room?”Ferentz responded: “It was easy. They didn’t offer him.”As in the days when Hayes reigned supreme, the Buckeyes take the pick of the Ohio litter. Now Iowa may face Ohio State, Michigan or Michigan State for the Big Ten championship. (Michigan’s quarterback, Jake Rudock, transferred from Iowa after starting there for the previous two seasons.)Yet when the road to the playoff goes through such prestigious programs, sticking with a coach when other programs might have felt compelled to move on appears less a concession than a concerted strategy — the advantage of slightly more manageable expectations.“I believe that Kirk Ferentz is one of the best coaches in America,” Barta said. “My support for him, whether it was last January after the bowl or the year before, or years before that, was because of that fact and really no other.”Barta added, “Don’t mistake ‘Iowa nice’ for ‘Iowa not caring if we lose.’ ”A version of this article appears in print on November 21, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: After Years of Patience, Unfamiliar Heights.
