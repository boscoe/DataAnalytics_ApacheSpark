There is no timetable for Cruz’s return to the Giants’ lineup.Cruz aggravated the strain in his calf, which he first injured in mid-August, in practice last week. The next day the area was injected with platelet-rich plasma, known as P.R.P., to promote healing and reduce inflammation.“I want to sprint, and I want to do the treadmill, but they continue to hold me back until there’s 10 full days for the P.R.P. to kind of set in,” Cruz said Thursday. “Ten days before I can have another conversation with the doctors about accelerating to the next level.”Cruz said he did not injure his calf last week as severely as he did in August. Already, he said, he feels better. But his workouts remain limited to some exercises in a pool to maintain his conditioning. He also continues to try to strengthen his right knee, which was surgically rebuilt a year ago after he ruptured the patellar tendon in a game at Philadelphia.Advertisement
