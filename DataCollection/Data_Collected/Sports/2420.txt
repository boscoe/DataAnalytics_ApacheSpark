The lawsuit, filed in a federal court in Indianapolis on Thursday on behalf of the former Weber State cornerback Devin Pugh, seeks to allow players to transfer freely between colleges and to abolish the cap on football scholarships — currently 85.N.C.A.A. rules require basketball and football players in its top tier of competition to sit out a season if they change universities, unless they are granted a waiver by the N.C.A.A.Pugh was a cornerback at Weber State in the 2011 and 2012 seasons before a new coach declined to renew his scholarship. According to the complaint, he had offers from other top programs, but they were rescinded when he did not receive a waiver from the N.C.A.A. to transfer without missing a season. Pugh later enrolled at a Division II college.Pugh’s complaint noted that the same rules about sitting out a season did not apply to coaches who move to new teams.“This is really unfair to kids,” said Steve Berman, Pugh’s lawyer. “When coaches can change schools so freely, this is a completely arbitrary and unfair rule.”Berman has several other pending lawsuits against the N.C.A.A., including one that seeks changes to the association’s concussion protocol and another that seeks damages for the method the N.C.A.A. previously used to cap the value of a scholarship.“We are unaware of the specific facts of the plaintiff,” the N.C.A.A. said in a statement about Pugh’s lawsuit. “However, it appears that many of the allegations are patterned after litigation filed by this lawyer in other cases.”The N.C.A.A. has 60 days to answer the complaint.Advertisement
