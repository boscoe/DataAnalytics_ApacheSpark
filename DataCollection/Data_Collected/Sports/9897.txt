COLUMBUS, Ohio —  To earn a spot in the main portion of the N.C.A.A. tournament, Dayton slipped by Boise State this week in a play-in contest that was a virtual home game for the Flyers. When the team traveled an hour east to Columbus, it was as if the Flyers had moved from their living room to their kitchen.In front of a friendly crowd Friday night, Dayton, the East Region’s No. 11 seed, used a second-half to surge to defeat sixth-seeded Providence, 66-53, at Nationwide Arena. It was the tournament’s only game of the day in which the lower-seeded team won.The sophomore forward Dyshawn Pierre led the Flyers (27-8) with 20 points, and the senior guard Jordan Sibert added 15. LaDontae Henton had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Friars (22-12).It was an ugly game — the teams combined for three baskets in the first 11 minutes of play — that eventually gave way to something of an encore for the Dayton fans who had watched their team rally to beat the Broncos on Wednesday.As time ticked off the clock, their cheers boomed off the rafters of the arena.At the beginning of the second half, when the game was tightly contested, the sophomore guard Kyle Davis picked off an inbounds pass, raced downcourt and laid the ball in the basket. The play fueled a rally that gave Dayton its second win in three days.The Flyers will play third-seeded Oklahoma on Sunday evening in the round of 32.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of Columbus, Ohio, relative to Dayton, Ohio.
