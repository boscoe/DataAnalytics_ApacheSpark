There is plenty of time for dogs to act doglike at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show while other dogs are being judged.On Monday night, as she awaited her turn, a greyhound named Gia with piercing, hypnotic eyes scanned the crowd (and nearly left the floor of Madison Square Garden to join some of the formally dressed patrons), gleaned treats from her handler and acted with such endearing playfulness that I wondered if she knew she was at work.Perhaps this was her warm-up act, her way of getting her game snout on.But then, as if persuaded by a word or a tiny gesture from her handler, Gia shifted into the gear she needed during her turn in the hound group ring. She stood still — playtime was over! — and allowed her handler to nudge her legs into the ideal pose.Earlier in the evening, a toy Manchester terrier mixed joy with labor when he concluded his showing for the toy group judge by leaping into an open yellow box that was not part of the preferred route. You could imagine him uttering, “D’oh!”

While walking among the dogs on their way to and from breed judging, I try to persuade them to give me a kiss (bloodhounds are easy) or a paw.AdvertisementIn my first dog year, 2000, I watched as the seven group winners trotted onto the green carpet for the Best in Show judging. But the Bedlington terrier had other things on his mind, like pausing to do some required business before taking his position.AdvertisementSoon, the word went out: “Cleanup!”Another year, I saw a crowd gathered in a ragged circle in the rotunda of the Garden where all dogs awaited their turn to be judged, or stayed after they won or lost.I seemed to have come upon an emergency until I moved in closer to see a mastiff rolling around on his back, eager for anyone and everyone to rub his belly. I joined in, risking my objectivity to please that giant working dog.
                Do dogs really look like their owners? Put the theory to the test by trying to guess which dog from the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show belongs to which owner.            Tuesday’s second day of the 139th Westminster meant a long wait until evening before the four group winners (a beagle, a standard poodle, a Shih Tzu and an Old English sheepdog) and their entourages learned whom their remaining competitors would be from the sporting, working and terrier groups.The presence of Rocket, the Shih Tzu, attracted attention Monday for a reason beyond his elegantly groomed, flowing coat and topknot. One of his owners is Patricia Hearst Shaw. When she was better known, simply, as Patty Hearst, a publishing heiress, she was kidnapped in 1974 by the leftist guerrillas of the Symbionese Liberation Army, and subsequently seemed to transform from captive to criminal accomplice with a nom de revolution of Tania. She was imprisoned for bank robbery, but her prison sentence was commuted in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and President Bill Clinton later pardoned her.Celebrity owners are not new at the Westminster show, but I do not remember any of them trying to steal the spotlight from their dog. Handlers do most of the talking to reporters (some of whom want nothing more than to know what their dogs eat or what their favorite toys are) with exuberance and explanations of their charges’ performances.Forty years on, Hearst was initially reluctant to leave her seat in the Garden to speak to the dog media about Rocket. She would talk Tuesday, we were told. Rocket’s co-owners, Luke and Diane Ehricht, filled in. Luke, who is also Rocket’s handler, was still shvitzing from showing Rocket when he kvelled about his little dog’s “magnificent head,” “free-flowing movement” and “arrogant” bearing characteristic of the breed.

Conrad for The New York Times        Cradled in Ehricht’s arms, Rocket was unfazed and not perspiring.But as the nonsporting group was being judged, Hearst appeared behind the media section. Tiny and blond, she was still reticent to talk. She relented when informed that if Rocket did not win Best in Show, reporters would lose interest in her.AdvertisementSo she spoke about her affinity for French bulldogs, which goes back about eight years, and her newfound interest in Shih Tzus (“so sweet and loving; I love the hair”).Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I have grown daughters and grandchildren and other things that normal people have.”Whichever dog was chosen Best in Show, a postgame ritual was to follow the judge’s verdict just before 11 p.m. Eastern time: The winner and its posse gather in a news conference room. The handler talks until there are no silly questions left. And the dog most likely says nothing, not even a bark, as if the reporters were not there.A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Looking Back at Nearly 15 Dog Years.
