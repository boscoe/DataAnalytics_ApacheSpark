The swing offense Bo Ryan runs at Wisconsin is called that because, seen from above, the movement of the ball and the players is like a swing. But one could read the term another way, because no player can be too committed to his own position; everyone must be ready to swing, so to speak.The point guard may bring the ball up and the big man may frequently start plays down low, but through a series of cuts, passes and moves without the ball, they are just as likely to end the play switched. Big men must be able to shoot; point guards must be able to field the ball in the low post.In an ideal world, Ryan would have five 7-foot players with low-post moves, yet also with a wing player’s ability to drive and take outside shots, and a guard’s court vision. This year, he has had to make do with only one.To say that Frank Kaminsky will be the national player of the year is to make an increasingly safe prediction (Duke’s Jahlil Okafor seems to have faded). To say that he is the best player is to agree with the statistics expert Ken Pomeroy, who said, “It’s really as simple as the combination of being very efficient and playing a large role in his team’s offense.”AdvertisementAnd to say that Kaminsky is the best offensive player on the best offensive team is simply to state a fact. Adjusted for opponents, Wisconsin (31-3) scores 124.6 points per 100 offensive possessions — the best this season and, if it holds through the end, the best since at least 2002. Kaminsky leads the Badgers in points, rebounds and assists. On defense, he leads in blocks and steals.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            He is projected to be a first-round pick in June’s N.B.A. draft, but what drove him the most in the off-season was last season’s loss in the Final Four on a last-second 3-pointer to none other than Kentucky, nearly everyone’s pick to win the tournament this season.“I didn’t take any time off,” Kaminsky said last month. “I just wanted to get better as much as I could.”AdvertisementThere were hill workouts, in which he had several parachutes strapped to his back, and workouts in sand to improve his footwork.“It was a frustrating loss,” Kaminsky said of last year’s game against Kentucky, “but at the end of the day, it’s really helped me. It’s motivated me in a lot of different ways to get better.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Georgia State Coach Ron Hunter tore his Achilles’ tendon in his exuberance after the Panthers’ Sun Belt championship on Sunday. He managed to cut the nets down anyway — after the basket was lowered for him to reach. Hunter is expected to coach Georgia State’s first-round game against Baylor.Brandon Ashley might be the X-factor for Arizona, and he is playing his best right now, averaging 19.6 points and 6.3 rebounds to earn the most outstanding player of the Pac-12 tournament. Ashley, a 6-foot-9 junior, missed the tournament a year ago, when he tore a ligament in his foot, and his absence hurt the Wildcats, who lost to Wisconsin in the round of 8. With Ashley and others, Arizona has arguably the most complete lineup in the tournament.B.Y.U. has to beat Mississippi in the First Four, but assuming it does that, the Cougars can certainly take down Xavier, which lacks firepower.1 Wisconsin (31-3) versus 16 Coastal Carolina (24-9)8 Oregon (25-9) versus 9 Oklahoma State (18-13)5 Arkansas (26-8) versus 12 Wofford (28-6)4 North Carolina (24-11) versus 13 Harvard (22-7)6 Xavier (21-13) versus 11 Mississippi (20-12)/ Brigham Young (25-9)3 Baylor (24-9) versus 14 Georgia State (24-9)7 Va.

Of the 16 teams in the region, three — Brigham Young (7th, 71.7), Arkansas (14th, 70.8) and North Carolina (24th, 69.9) — are in the top 25 in possessions per game. So if you enjoy fast, up-and-down basketball, you’ll get it out in the West Region.A version of this article appears in print on March 16, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: The One-Man Swing.
