After guiding the Mets to their first pennant in 15 years, Manager Terry Collins will be rewarded with a two-year contract extension that will be officially announced at a news conference on Wednesday, according to a person in baseball with knowledge of the situation. If Collins finishes out the extension, he will have managed more games than anyone else in Mets history.At 66, Collins is already the oldest manager in baseball, and he has indicated in recent weeks that he wanted to manage through one more contract and then retire. Jim Leyland, Collins’s mentor, retired at 69. Collins will be 68 when his new contract expires.Earlier this season, Collins’s job status appeared to be in jeopardy. The Mets were struggling with injuries and their record was hovering around .500 in a season in which the front office was hoping to compete for a playoff spot. But after General Manager Sandy Alderson brought in significant reinforcements at the nonwaiver trade deadline, Collins led the team to the National League East title and the N.L. pennant.Amid the newfound success, Collins seemed to cast all inhibitions to the side and became an increasingly engaging figure in public. He also became popular among Mets fans. Even after the Mets lost the World Series on Sunday night at Citi Field, Mets fans chanted Collins’s name and loudly cheered when he took a postgame curtain call on the field. TIM ROHANA version of this article appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page B15 of the New York edition with the headline: Collins Is Said to Receive Extension.
