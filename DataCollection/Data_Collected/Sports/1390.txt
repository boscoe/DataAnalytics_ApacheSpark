The two-time overall champion Anna Fenninger will miss the entire World Cup season after seriously injuring her right knee in a training crash in Sölden, Austria, on Wednesday, three days before the start of the Alpine skiing circuit. Fenninger, a 26-year-old Austrian, had surgery in nearby Innsbruck after tearing the medial collateral and the cruciate ligament as well as the patellar tendon in the right knee.The Austrian team doctor Christian Hoser said Fenninger, who won her second straight overall title last season, would need up to 12 months of recovery before getting back on skis. “There is hope and a realistic chance that she will be able to continue her career,” he said.A version of this brief appears in print on October 22, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Fenninger Out for Season After Crash in Austria.
