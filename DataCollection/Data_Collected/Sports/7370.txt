GLENDALE, Ariz. —  When quarterback Tom Brady first jogged onto the field before Sunday’s Super Bowl, thousands of New England Patriots fans rose from their seats, burst into applause and then sat down.But Brady was not in the mood for idle celebrations of his appearance, his sixth in a Super Bowl, a record for a quarterback.He waved his arms over his head and gestured for the fans to get back on their feet and cheer. Brady, 37, continued this unsubtle demonstration until he was greeted by a more raucous response.Kickoff was still 90 minutes away.Long before the game began, Brady knew the stakes and the effect the outcome would have on the narrative of his career. The bold, lasting impressions of Brady’s story have always been written in the postseason, with early success and a 3-0 Super Bowl record before he was 28 years old.AdvertisementBut two straight losses in the biggest football game of the year followed, and Brady was clearly growing weary of the stain that was leaving on his legacy.AdvertisementSunday’s game unfolded like a microcosm of his Super Bowl experience. At first he could do no wrong against the Seahawks, and then he could do little right.Still, as he walked onto the field midway through the final quarter, with the Patriots trailing by 3 points, the crowd chanted: “Bra-dy! Bra-dy!”After a stumbling third quarter in which he looked harried and old, Brady was suddenly resurrected. Poised in the pocket, he again looked like the carefree 24-year-old who won a Super Bowl in an upset. His 3-yard touchdown pass to Julian Edelman with 2 minutes 2 seconds remaining in the game — a classic connection, with a calm Brady looking one way and then throwing the other — sealed the Patriots’ 28-24 victory over Seattle.Brady became just the third starting quarterback to win four Super Bowls, after Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana.“It’s been a long journey,” Brady, who was named the game’s most valuable player, said afterward. “There have been a couple of tough losses in this game. But we made the plays at the end of this one.”His coach, Bill Belichick, with whom he shares a 4-2 Super Bowl record and with whom he will forever be linked, said Sunday’s performance was quintessential Brady.

Lee/The New York Times        “Tom does not doubt himself, and he sticks to the plan,” Belichick said. “He’s a great player, and at any time, he can make great plays.”AdvertisementThat includes moments when his skills appear to have deserted him.With a visible, defiant determination, Brady cruised through the first half, completing 20 of 27 passes, with two touchdown throws. But as the second half began, after Seattle’s fearsome defense and its wily coach, Pete Carroll, had a chance to make adjustments, Brady appeared befuddled. New England ran 11 plays in the third quarter and picked up one first down, and the Seahawks took their first lead of the game, 17-14, early in the period.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

In a pivotal sequence, Brady was hurried and then hit just after releasing a second-down pass. On the next play, under duress again, Brady unwisely rushed a pass over the middle toward tight end Rob Gronkowski.The ball landed instead in the hands of Seattle middle linebacker Bobby Wagner, an interception that led to a Seahawks touchdown and a 10-point Seattle lead.“That wasn’t exactly the way we drew it up,” Brady said of the deficit. “Throwing a couple of picks didn’t help.”The turnabout that ensued in the fourth quarter was not surprising to those who have been around Brady the longest.“I’ve been coaching for 14 years, and I’ve never known anyone who has more mental toughness,” New England’s offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, said. “It was a fitting end for him.”Late in the game, Brady used the formula that worked so well early on, mixing runs up the middle with short play-action passes out of a no-huddle offense.It was an effective strategy, with Seattle’s defense struggling to keep up with the pace and with the quickness of the Patriots’ small but shifty receivers. Brady also benefited from an injury to Seattle’s nickel cornerback, Jeremy Lane, who was replaced by the second-year pro Tharold Simon — a substitution that did not go unnoticed by the Patriots’ coaching staff.Simon gave up the first touchdown of the game as Brady threw to receiver Brandon LaFell, and Simon also had trouble keeping up with the pesky Edelman.Even when Seattle tied the score and eventually took the lead, the Patriots stuck to their offensive game plan. And in the aftermath of his fourth Super Bowl victory, Brady could do something he might only have dreamed of 90 minutes before Sunday’s game: plot a fifth Super Bowl victory.AdvertisementAsked to assess his legacy, he shook his head. It was too early for that.“No, not going to do that,” Brady said. “I’ve got a lot of football left.”A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page D8 of the New York edition with the headline: A Quarterback Measured Only by Titles Refreshes His Legacy With a 4th.
