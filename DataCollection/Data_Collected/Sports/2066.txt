One week after winning back the starting job, Ohio State quarterback J. T. Barrett, a redshirt sophomore and a team captain, was cited Saturday morning by the Columbus police on a charge of operating a vehicle under the influence, a misdemeanor. Barrett was suspended for one game by Coach Urban Meyer.The incident, reported by the website Eleven Warriors, was confirmed in a statement Saturday morning by Ohio State’s athletics department.Multiple news outlets have reported that Barrett, 20, was arrested at a checkpoint near campus and that his blood-alcohol concentration registered slightly over Ohio’s limit of 0.08 percent for those over 21. However, the limit is 0.02 percent for those under 21.Under athletics department rules, Barrett will be tested for alcohol regularly, and if he again violates departmental policy, he will be subject to a mandatory two-game suspension.AdvertisementBarrett was thrust into the starting job last year when the presumed starter, Braxton Miller, sustained a season-ending injury during the summer. Barrett led Ohio State to an 11-1 record before breaking his ankle in the final game of the regular season. At that point, Cardale Jones, now a redshirt junior, took over and helped the team go 3-0 en route to the national championship.Jones held onto the starting job until Meyer announced that Barrett would start on Oct. 24 at Rutgers.AdvertisementNo. 1 Ohio State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) did not play this weekend. Its next game is against Minnesota on Nov. 7.A version of this article appears in print on November 1, 2015, on Page SP11 of the New York edition with the headline: Ohio State Quarterback Is Suspended for a Game.
