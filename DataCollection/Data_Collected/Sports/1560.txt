Week 7 scores and highlightsIt took a minor miracle from the football gods by way of increasingly confusing N.F.L. rules about what constitutes a touchdown catch and what doesn’t, but the Lions finally got a win last week. Along the way, Detroit’s offense resembled the explosive unit fans have come to know in recent years, racking up 37 points and 546 yards against the Bears. It will be hard to duplicate that performance this week, however, as the Vikings have the league’s second best scoring defense, giving up an average of 16.6 points.The two teams met earlier this season, a 26-16 Vikings win in which Adrian Peterson rushed for 134 yards. He has rushed for a shade under 1,400 yards in 13 games against Detroit in his career.PICK: VIKINGSAdvertisement
