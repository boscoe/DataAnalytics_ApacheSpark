DURHAM, N.C. —  Behind both baskets in the upper levels of Cameron Indoor Stadium during the Duke women’s basketball team’s game Sunday were swaths of empty blue seats.Those two upper-deck sections remained largely unoccupied throughout the fourth-seeded Blue Devils’ 64-56 victory over fifth-seeded Mississippi State in the second round of the N.C.A.A. tournament.Closer to the court, the wood bleachers on the sideline behind press row — known for seating the ever-spirited and rowdy Cameron Crazies — featured more empty seats than occupied ones. Reporters, who during the peak of Cameron craziness are subject to body-painted students leaning over them, had ample space to stretch and move their arms. The most animated students were three blue-clad men who occasionally made the Cameron Crazies’ signature noise (Oooohhh) and gesture (extending their arms and vigorously shaking their fingers toward opponents on the court).At several points in the game, the stadium became loud, but nowhere near the earsplitting levels that crowds in Cameron Indoor have produced in the past.AdvertisementThe announced attendance was 2,293. The stadium can seat 9,314.The paucity of fans Sunday reflected a larger trend of stagnant attendance in Division I women’s basketball. In 2014, average total attendance was 1,579. It represented a small bump from the year before — the 2013 season averaged 1,533 a game — but it was the second year in a row below 1,600. The last time attendance dipped below that number was 2006.Attendance at the first two rounds of the N.C.A.A. tournament has followed suit. In 2004, according to a 2013 report to the N.C.A.A. written by Val Ackerman, the current commissioner of the Big East and the first president of the W.N.B.A., average attendance at first- and second-round games of the tournament was 6,697. By 2013, it had fallen to 4,850.Joanne P. McCallie, coach of the Blue Devils, was diplomatic and optimistic when asked what she thought of the crowd Sunday.
                Women’s N.C.A.A. bracket.            “We’ve had some pretty big crowds here: 9,300, sellouts, so it’s been awesome,” McCallie said after the game, adding that the crowd “wasn’t that, but I’ll tell you what: It was a very spirited crowd and a very dedicated crowd who very much wanted us to do well.”She added: “It was a smaller crowd, but it was a crowd who understands everything this team has been through. And that crowd, that foundation — we heard that loud and clear, and they made it a lot of fun.”AdvertisementWith 16 minutes 45 seconds left in the second half, Duke guard Rebecca Greenwell made a 3-pointer to pull the Blue Devils to 1 point behind. McCallie screamed and waved her arms upward to pump up the crowd. It responded, and the stadium was the loudest it had been all game.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I think Mississippi State also had a nice little fan base, and their band was loud. So I think it was a really great environment for an N.C.A.A. game.”Fifteen years ago, when Williams was 6, Duke’s second-round game of the tournament at Cameron Indoor attracted 5,318 fans, more than double Sunday’s turnout. One year later, in 2001, 6,023 fans came to the Blue Devils’ second-round game in Durham.On Saturday, 11 miles away in Chapel Hill, only 2,098 fans attended fourth-seeded North Carolina’s 71-65 victory against No. 13 Liberty in Carmichael Arena, which holds 6,822.And of those fans, nearly half cheered for Liberty, which is in Lynchburg, Va., about 120 miles away. Fans of the Flames, whose primary color is red, were as loud as U.N.C. supporters, if not louder.“I noticed that before the game started,” Tar Heels forward Stephanie Mavunga said. “I was like, man, all this red was walking in. And that came in before the blue. Wait a second.”During a break in the game, a contingent of North Carolina fans started a “Tar Heels” chant. Liberty fans responded with one of their own, and a chant-off ensued. It was difficult to determine which group won.“We really got the support,” Liberty Coach Carey Green said. “I’m biased when I make this statement: I think our fans were louder than the Carolina fans.”He added, “They picked us up — they were the sixth man to encourage us.”For Green, who in his postgame news conference spoke of his desire to enhance the Flames’ national profile, the fan support was promising. For North Carolina and Duke, though, thoughts of the empty seats lingered.A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: The Brackets May Be Crowded, but Arenas Aren’t.
