With the Seahawks a yard from a Super Bowl victory, quarterback Russell Wilson fired a pass to Ricardo Lockette — a play call that many have questioned. But the play seemed well-designed, and to Wilson, Lockette looked open. “I thought it was going to be a touchdown when I threw it,” Wilson said. But Patriots safety Malcolm Butler had other plans.

              The Seahawks said they liked what they saw from the Patriots’ defense, and at the outset, the play looks like a winner: Jermaine Kearse runs toward the defenders to block their path to Lockette, who slants behind Kearse. It appears to give Lockette a clear lane to the end zone.

              “The last play we had a formation where we could throw it on them. Lockette was coming underneath and the guy made a great play. I had a chance, was looking, and then he kind of cut in front of me and made a play. I thought it was a touchdown, honestly. When I let it go, I thought it was going to be game over.”

              “I saw Wilson looking over there. He kept his head still and just looked over there, so that gave me a clue. And the stacked receivers; I just knew they were going to throw. I don’t know how I knew. I just knew. I just beat him to the point and caught the ball.”

              The Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, Darrell Bevell, said that Lockette could have gone stronger for the ball. But Lockette may have thought that he had a clear path to the end zone and, looking at Wilson’s throw, never saw Butler coming. It was a stunning ending, and Lockette may have been the most surprised of all.
