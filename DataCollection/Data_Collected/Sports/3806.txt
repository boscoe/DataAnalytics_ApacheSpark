But they have also, at times, looked like they had no business being on an N.F.L. field.This week, the Jets may be without cornerback Darrelle Revis and center Nick Mangold, which, for a team that has lost four of its previous five games, seems almost cruel.The recipe for success will be a steady diet of Chris Ivory running the ball into Miami’s porous front seven. Even without Mangold to help open holes, there should be plenty of room.Pick: JetsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
