San Diego tight end Antonio Gates, 35, is the active leader in career touchdowns. Adrian Peterson, 30, ranks second among all active players in both career rushing yards (behind Frank Gore) and career touchdowns (behind Gates). On Sunday, all three players showed they still have something left in the tank.Hasselbeck, filling in for an injured Andrew Luck, helped the Colts win against Tampa Bay with another strong performance. Hasselbeck is now 4-0 this season, and threw for 315 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions against the Buccaneers. Indianapolis rushed 27 times for just 26 yards, putting the game in the hands of Hasselbeck. He responded by posting a passer rating of 100.8, and became the second oldest quarterback (behind Warren Moon) since at least 1960 to win four consecutive starts.Gates caught two touchdowns to help the Chargers defeat the Jaguars. Like most of his 102 career touchdown receptions (including playoffs), those scores came from the arm of quarterback Philip Rivers. The two players have now combined for 76 touchdown passes, which is tied with Peyton Manning and Reggie Wayne for the fourth most by any quarterback-receiver combination in N.F.L. history (including playoffs). With six more connections, Gates and Rivers will tie Dan Marino and Mark Clayton for third place, and put them behind only Steve Young and Jerry Rice (92) and Manning and Marvin Harrison (114). Gates is also eight touchdowns away from tying the regular-season record for receiving touchdowns by a tight end, held by Tony Gonzalez.And then there is Peterson. Entering the week, Peterson led the N.F.L. with 1,006 rushing yards, and rushed for 158 yards, the most in Week 12. His 1,164 rushing yards through 11 team games is the fourth most since at least 1960 by any player, trailing only Curtis Martin (2004), Barry Sanders (1998) and Walter Payton (1984). Peterson is on a pace to become the third player in N.F.L. history to lead the league in rushing after turning 30 years old, joining Martin (age 31, 2004) and Marion Motley (30, 1950).He also scored two touchdowns Sunday, giving him 99 scores for his career. At age 30, most running backs are on the decline, but the Vikings star is averaging 105.8 rushing yards per game, the third best average of his career. Peterson also improved his career rushing average to 98.7 yards per game, the third highest in league history, behind Sanders and Jim Brown.Advertisement
