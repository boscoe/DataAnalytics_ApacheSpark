Week 5 scores and highlightsWhile the Raiders-Broncos rivalry has been one of the most competitive of the last few decades — with the Raiders holding a 60-49-2 advantage, including playoff games — the Broncos have owned the series in the Peyton Manning era, outscoring Oakland, 222-85, in the course of six rather easy victories.While the Broncos appear poised to compete for the A.F.C. title, the Raiders present an interesting matchup. Quarterback Derek Carr has made tremendous strides and Amari Cooper is on a pace to have one of the best rookie seasons any wide receiver has had. If Cooper continues at his current pace, he will finish the season with 96 catches and 1,356 yards. Still, Cooper is not happy with his performance thus far.“There’s always room for improvement,” he said.PICK: RAIDERSAdvertisement
