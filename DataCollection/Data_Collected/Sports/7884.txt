It was unlikely that any of the Knicks’ players were aware of the stakes of Wednesday’s game, but with their loss to the Orlando Magic, the Knicks are officially the worst host team in N.B.A. All-Star Game history.At 10-43, the Knicks will go into the All-Star break with a .189 winning percentage to edge the 1990 Miami Heat, who were 10-39 (.204) when they hosted the game. If the Knicks had beaten the Magic, their winning percentage would have gone up to .208.It is hard to imagine teams more different than that Heat squad and the current Knicks. While the Knicks are an original N.B.A. franchise with a famous team president and a marquee star in Carmelo Anthony, the Heat were in their second season as an expansion franchise when they hosted at Miami Arena.Anthony is expected to suit up as a starting forward for the Eastern Conference on Sunday despite sitting out Wednesday’s loss with knee problems. Unsurprisingly, the Heat did not have a representative in the 1990 game, with Rony Seikaly and Sherman Douglas providing most of the team’s production. The Heat did not have an All-Star player until Alonzo Mourning in 1996.AdvertisementWhat the teams have in common is repeated failure in their seasons as host. At the break in 1990, the Heat were three games into what would prove to be an eight-game losing streak. They had lost nine of their last 10, and 22 of 25. The Knicks came into the season with expectations of competing for a playoff spot, but at one point they lost 26 of 27 games. After the break, things could get worse, with the possibility that Anthony could sit out the rest of the season.All-Star Game locations are chosen years in advance, so it is impossible to predict how good a franchise will be when the game comes around; the Knicks were 54-28 just two seasons ago. But the 1990 game was the beginning of a terrible era for host teams. In 1991 the game was in Charlotte, N.C., with the 14-33 Hornets hosting. In 1992 it went to Orlando, Fla., and the 12-36 Magic. The league got a respite in 1993, when the Utah Jazz, with a record of 33-18, hosted the game, but it was back to mediocrity in 1994 when the league went to Minnesota, the home of the 14-33 Timberwolves. Four of the seven worst hosts on record came in that span of five seasons.AdvertisementThe good news for the N.B.A. is that it can point out that although the game is being played at Madison Square Garden, it is nominally being co-hosted by the Nets. At 21-31, the Nets would be only the 11th-worst host in history.A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Knicks’ Feat: Worst Team to Host All-Stars.
