Having trailed by 17 points, the Bengals went on to beat Seattle, 27-24, in overtime.The day started well for the Bengals, with Andy Dalton driving his team 86 yards for a touchdown on their opening drive. It looked like it could get out of hand in Cincinnati’s favor when Dalton connected with A.J. Green for an apparent 72-yard touchdown on the team’s next possession, but a holding penalty nullified the play, and Cincinnati settled for a punt.From that point, the Seahawks largely took over the game behind a dominant effort by Thomas Rawls in relief of the injured Marshawn Lynch. Rawls, an undrafted rookie, ran 23 times for 169 yards and had an incredible 69-yard touchdown run that gave Seattle a 10-point lead. Bobby Wagner returned a fumble for a touchdown shortly after that, giving Seattle a big lead against a team that had trailed for a total of 1 minute and 58 seconds during its undefeated 4-0 start.In the fourth quarter, the Bengals found their rhythm.Dalton connected with Eifert for a second touchdown, and after his team’s defense forced Seattle to punt, he took over again, driving the team 71 yards and scoring on a 5-yard run.A Mike Nugent field goal with time expiring completed the comeback in regulation.After trading punts in overtime, the Bengals drove 33 yards to set up Nugent for the 42-yard game-winner that banked off the upright before falling through.Dalton finished the day having completed 30 of 44 passes for 331 yards and 2 touchdowns.Advertisement
