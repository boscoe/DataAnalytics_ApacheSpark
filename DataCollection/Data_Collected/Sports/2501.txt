Rams (4-3) at Vikings (5-2)1 p.m. Line: Vikings by 2N.F.L. Week 9 Scores and HighlightsYou would be forgiven if you looked at the standings and wondered how the Vikings were 5-2. There is a good chance you are not alone. Minnesota is one of the stealthiest 5-2 football teams in N.F.L. history. It is as if everyone wrote off the Vikings after they were throttled by the 49ers — a team that has largely lived up to low expectations — on the Monday night of the opening weekend, and Minnesota has been winning its games on an island somewhere ever since.The Rams certainly seem to have gotten more attention, possibly because their living, breathing highlight reel of a running back, Todd Gurley, does something almost each week that causes jaws to drop. A rookie out of Georgia, he may just be the N.F.L.’s best running back at the moment, averaging 115 yards rushing a game, a full 15 more than the player in the No. 2 spot, Minnesota’s Adrian Peterson, who counts himself as a Gurley fan.“I love what this young guy’s doing,” Peterson told the NFL Network about Gurley. “I wish him well, but not this week against us. He’s a talented young guy. He’s hungry.”If you like watching teams that run the ball and play tough defense (the Rams and the Vikings rank fifth and sixth in total defense), this might be your game of the week.PICK: RAMSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
