But trying the dirt for the first time is tough.From Melissa Hoppert:American Pharoah With Beholder out, this Triple Crown winner should cruise to an uncontested early lead, and the lack of speed in the race will hamper his late-running foes.Tonalist This late-charging winner of the 2014 Belmont Stakes is coming off a four-and-three-quarters-length victory in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park.Honor Code This 4-year-old turned in powerful performances in the Met Mile and the Whitney to establish himself as the top older male, but his third-place finish in his last race leaves a bad taste.Advertisement
