The Jets fired Ryan in December and replaced him in January with Todd Bowles.“We are very grateful for the outstanding support of our fans in Cortland and to fans who made and enjoyed trips to the area,” Neil Glat, the team’s president, said in a statement. “Our hope is that our training in Florham Park will allow additional fans to experience the fun and excitement of a Jets training camp this year.”More teams — 18 of 32 last year, according to the N.F.L. — are staying home for training camp. It allows them to take advantage of their facilities while practicing closer to their fan base.Advertisement
