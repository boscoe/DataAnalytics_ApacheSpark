Week 13 scores and highlightsQuarterbacks tend to receive most of the credit for wins and most of the blame for losses, but any rational person should understand that Matt Hasselbeck’s 4-0 record as a starter this season does not create a quarterback controversy in Indianapolis. Yet Coach Chuck Pagano found himself having to address whether the job will still belong to Andrew Luck when he returns from a lacerated kidney.“Andrew is our starting quarterback,” Pagano told reporters. “When he is healthy and he is 100 percent healthy and the doctors and our trainers say he is ready to roll, then he is going to be under center.”The 40-year-old Hasselbeck has been a great story, and he has joined Brett Favre and Warren Moon as the only Super Bowl-era quarterbacks to have four consecutive wins in their 40s. Depending on how limited Ben Roethlisberger is in his return from a concussion, Hasselbeck could very well make it 5-0, but even a Super Bowl win would not wrest the job from Luck.PICK: STEELERSAdvertisement
