The Pittsburgh Steelers did not get Ben Roethlisberger back this week, but the team’s struggling offense finally came to life when Landry Jones entered the game in place of the injured Michael Vick. The third-string quarterback led the Steelers to 25-13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.Jones, a four-year starter at Oklahoma, had never thrown an N.F.L. pass when he came on in relief of Vick, who had injured his hamstring. His second pass of the game went for an 8-yard touchdown to Martavis Bryant and the Steelers would go on to score in the first four possessions with Jones under center.“Landry’s been watching Ben for a long time,” said Le’Veon Bell, the star Steelers running back, told reporters after the game. “He knows the offense like the back of his hand.”In his post-game news conference, Coach Mike Tomlin cited Jones’s extensive work in preseason games as a reason he was able to step so easily into the team’s offense. He said Jones has continued to work hard despite his place on the depth chart.Advertisement“You don’t always have control over the opportunity,” Tomlin said. “But when given the opportunity, you need to be prepared. I give him credit for that, he was prepared.”AdvertisementWhile insisting that he had maintained his confidence and familiarity with the system despite a lack of playing time, Jones, in his post-game news conference, seemed just as surprised by the immediate success as everyone else.“I just still can’t believe I got in the game and to play,” Jones said. “I’m still kind of reeling from it.”The swing in momentum seemed to validate the criticism Vick has endured in recent weeks.Starting his third consecutive game in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger, Vick’s tenure has been met with a great deal of frustration, especially from star wide receiver Antonio Brown who saw his production drop off dramatically.After a win on Monday night, Brown said he should be getting the ball more often, and that Vick’s conservative approach while Roethlisberger recovers from a sprained medial collateral ligament in his knee is not working.“I think he wants to get me the ball, he’s trying to get me the ball. It’s just he’s new out there,” Brown told reporters. “I think Mike Vick looks over and sees me doubled and says ‘ooh, I can’t go there.’”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It did not help that Brown was being shadowed by Patrick Peterson, one of the game’s best cornerbacks, but Brown showed his frustration throughout the game, regularly throwing his arms up and staring in Vick’s direction at the conclusion of a play.Vick, who had been removed from the game earlier in the day to go through testing for a concussion, injured his hamstring on a third quarter running play and did not return. Prior to the injury he had completed 3 of 8 passes for 6 yards and rushed for 47 yards.AdvertisementIn Vick’s place, Jones was a revelation, forming an immediate bond with Bryant. Jones finished the day having completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and 2 touchdowns. Bryant, in his first game of the season following a four-game suspension for a violation of the league’s substance abuse policy, had 6 catches for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns. Brown finished the day with 3 catches for 24 yards.
            Steelers WR Martavis Bryant has now played 12 career NFL games. He has 11 TD's.        “It’s been a long road since my days in Oklahoma,” Jones told reporters. “Just very blessed and thankful to get in there.”Roethlisberger has shown good progress in the rehabilitation of his injured knee, but his status for Week 7 is unclear. Considering how effectively the Steelers moved the ball with Jones against a high-caliber Arizona defense, Tomlin will undoubtedly endure a week of questions about whether or not Vick will get another chance at quarterback.Tomlin was asked directly after the game if he had found himself a new starting quarterback but he declined to anoint Jones as the interim solution until Roethlisberger can return.“You know, we have some options here,” Tomlin said. “We’ll deal with those at the appropriate time. We’re just going to enjoy the efforts of all parties involved right now.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
