Every so often, Jamal Crawford gets to remind everyone that he can still be a prolific scorer.Crawford scored a season-high 37 points, making all 10 of his free throws, and the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Detroit Pistons, 101-96, Saturday at home to end a two-game skid.Crawford, a 35-year-old veteran, was inserted into the starting lineup because J. J. Redick was sidelined, and he made the most of it, providing the Clippers with some offensive firepower after they stumbled out of the gate.“We just needed to win,” Crawford said. “I never really lose confidence in myself.”Neither do the Clippers, who added several new players to their bench over the summer.“I really commend him for being as old as he is and ready to play at all times,” the Clippers’ DeAndre Jordan jokingly said of Crawford. “He really gives guys fits.”AdvertisementBlake Griffin scored 34 points, including a crucial jumper with 17 seconds left on a pass from Crawford. Jordan finished with 10 points and 16 rebounds for the Clippers, who were without the injured Chris Paul.AdvertisementGriffin and Crawford have developed a well-honed chemistry in their years together.“At any moment, he can catch a spark and just go,” Griffin said.Ersan Ilyasova scored 20 points, Andre Drummond had 18 points and 19 rebounds, and Reggie Jackson added 20 points in Detroit’s third straight loss.With the Clippers leading by 95-94, Paul Pierce missed and Griffin scrambled for the rebound. As he was falling out of bounds on the baseline, he threw the ball off Ilyasova to retain possession. Griffin then hit a 20-footer to extend the lead to 97-94.Jackson made two free throws that cut the Clippers’ lead to 1 with eight seconds left. Detroit was forced to foul Crawford, who made both for a 99-96 lead.Detroit’s Kentavious Caldwell-Pope missed a potential tying 3-pointer with four seconds to go. Crawford got fouled and went back to the line, where he made both to seal the win.BUCKS 108, CAVALIERS 105  Jerryd Bayless scored 17 points and held LeBron James scoreless over the final 3 minutes 15 seconds of the second overtime, and host Milwaukee beat Cleveland, ending the Cavaliers’ eight-game winning streak.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
