About 200 miles away from Yosemite Valley and El Capitan, Jacqui Becker got a text message and a photo from her boyfriend, the climber Kevin Jorgeson. The photo was of him smiling in front of a wall of granite. The text announced that he was not stopping now.“I’m not holding this train up,” Jorgeson wrote.Jorgeson and Tommy Caldwell are trying to become the first people to free climb El Capitan’s Dawn Wall. For six days, though, Jorgeson could not get past Pitch 15, a brutally difficult sideways traverse with almost nothing to hold.Caldwell was already through 20 of the route’s 31 pitches, including all the most difficult ones. He could not wait indefinitely. The climbers had reached a now-or-never point in their yearslong partnership to reach the top.On Friday, now won.Jorgeson, desperate to reach the summit after six years of work detailing and practicing the route, with his fingers battered by the sharp rocks, clipped his safety rope into a fixed bolt after making it across Pitch 15 on Friday afternoon. A cheer rose from the small crowd in a meadow below El Capitan, about 1,500 feet below.AdvertisementJorgeson soon sent a text to Becker. Full of adrenaline, he joked that he would climb straight to the Wino Tower, at the top of Pitch 20, pulling even with Caldwell.If nothing else, Jorgeson’s success brought relief to the expedition, and settled, for now, any uncomfortable questions about how long Caldwell would wait before moving to the summit by himself.Pitches 14 and 15 were rated as the two most difficult parts of the climb, with matching 5.14d grades — meaning they are among the toughest in the world to climb without aid. (Free climbing means to climb upward only with hands and feet, using ropes and equipment solely as safety devices.)
                A graphic tracks an attempt by Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson to free-climb the 3,000-foot Dawn Wall, a vertical sheet of mostly smooth granite that many believe is the hardest climb in the world.            When Caldwell and Jorgeson breezed through the lower sections of the ascent after starting on Dec. 27, then completed Pitch 14 on Jan. 1, they celebrated with announcements on social media.“Tonight, I sent the hardest pitch of my life and the hardest on the Dawn Wall!” Jorgeson wrote on his Facebook page. “Best of all, Tommy sent right after me! Pitch 14 (the first traverse) is in the bag!”AdvertisementBut Pitch 15, about 70 feet of horizontal sidestepping across a stripe of pinkish granite, became Jorgeson’s albatross.“There are tiny little holds, but they’re far apart and facing different directions,” said Josh Lowell, a filmmaker who has been chronicling the pair’s attempts at the Dawn Wall for several years. “Some you grab in awkward ways, sometimes barely by your fingertips, sometimes cocking your wrist in weird angles.”The route goes that way because the rock is too smooth above and below it. The stripe has just enough of a sandpaper texture to cling to. The holds can be as sharp as razor blades.During Jorgeson’s run of difficulties, Caldwell tried to explain just how difficult the task was. On his Facebook page, he called the Pitch 15 traverse “some of the smallest and sharpest holds I have ever attempted to hold onto. It’s crazy to think that the skin on our fingertips could be the limiting fact towards success or failure.”The men sand and file their fingers at night, and set an alarm so they can apply lotion every few hours.
                Where’s Kevin? Zoom in to find Kevin Jorgeson perched on the face of El Capitan’s Dawn Wall.            Jorgeson failed in three tries at Pitch 15 last Saturday, and was unsuccessful on several more nights during the week, between days when he rested to allow his fingers to heal. One post showed his battered fingers as he tried to grip the rock.“On my 4th attempt, around 11 pm, the razor sharp holds ripped both the tape and the skin right off my fingers,” Jorgeson wrote Thursday night. “As disappointing as this is, I’m learning new levels of patience, perseverance and desire. I’m not giving up. I will rest. I will try again. I will succeed.”In making it past Pitch 15 on Friday afternoon, Jorgeson split one finger in five places. But he immediately moved on to Pitch 16, rated 5.14c, with a “dyno” crux — a move requiring the climber to leap sideways several feet to the left to an out-of-reach hold.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He said late Friday that he planned to start the pitch at the beginning on Saturday, to try to complete it in one attempt even though the unwritten rules of climbing would allow him to restart from after the dyno because he had reached a perch where he could stand without using his hands.Advertisement“My plan is to try to repeat the dyno,” he said in a message late Friday, with a photograph of his bloodied hands. “But if it doesn’t go quickly, I will probably take it from the stance in order to minimize further damage to the body. It’s a violent move.”Caldwell had made it past Pitches 15 and 16 earlier in the week — climbing a longer route down and around the sideways “dyno” move. He did Pitches 17 and 18 one night, and 19 and 20 to reach the Wino Tower, a rare ledge on the face, on Thursday. Then, two climbing days from the top, he waited for Jorgeson.It was unclear how long he would wait. Had Jorgeson not succeeded on Friday, it is possible that the two would have agreed for Caldwell to move forward alone.That could still happen, depending on Jorgeson’s fortunes as he tries to catch up. But Jorgeson’s family and friends in Santa Rosa, Calif., are ready to come to Yosemite to meet him at the end of his long climb. It is not over yet.A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: After Brutal Traverse, Climber Looks Upward.
