This season’s N.F.L. playoffs have had it all: overtime thrillers, disputed penalties, trick plays. But with one game remaining in the season, the league must now grapple with an odd question: Did the Patriots deflate some of their game balls in the A.F.C. championship game Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts?The answer is largely moot because the Patriots won, 45-7, and few football experts believe that slightly softer footballs were the reason. But because the accusation involves the Patriots, who have a history of running afoul of league rules, the N.F.L. is looking into the matter.Mike Signora, a spokesman for the league, said Tuesday that the N.F.L. continued to investigate.The rules governing balls are clear. Every ball must be manufactured by Wilson Sporting Goods and have the commissioner’s signature on it. The urethane bladder inside the ball must be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds of pressure and be made of a tan, pebble-grain leather case. The ball can be 11 to 11.25 inches point to point, 28 to 28.5 inches at its widest and weigh 14 to 15 ounces.The referees inspect the dozen game balls that each team selects 2 hours 15 minutes before the game. In inclement weather, teams also bring a dozen backup balls to be tested as well. The balls remain in the referee’s possession until just before the game, when they are delivered to the ball boys on the sideline.AdvertisementTo prevent teams from overinflating balls to make them more buoyant — an advantage for kickers — special “k-balls” are shipped from Wilson directly to the stadium and opened by the referee before the game. The k-balls are used exclusively for kicking plays.AdvertisementIf the home team — in this case, the Patriots — is found to have any balls that do not conform to specifications, the referee can get a proper ball from the visitors. “Any such circumstances must be reported to the commissioner,” the N.F.L. rule book states.
                N.F.L. officials are investigating whether the Patriots violated league rules by using footballs that were not properly inflated during the A.F.C. championship game against the Colts on Sunday.            “In case of rain or a wet, muddy or slippery field, a playable ball shall be used at the request of the offensive team’s center,” the rules continue.The larger question is why the Patriots would deliberately deflate some or all of their balls and how they would manage to get them into the game after they were inspected by the referees.In an interview, Gil Brandt, the former longtime vice president for player personnel with the Dallas Cowboys and a current analyst for N.F.L. Media, had the same question.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The officials do a great job of being sure everything is up-to-date. With all the procedures they take, I find it hard to believe that someone could take two bags of 12 balls and deflate them. I don’t see where you could go with this large bag of balls. Do you lock yourself in a room? It’s not very feasible.Q. Why would a team deflate the balls?A. The only advantage is when it’s 12.5 to 13.5 pounds of pressure and someone puts it down to 11.5, supposedly it’s easier to throw. But it seems so far off the charts that someone would do that and not get caught beforehand.Lane Kiffin at U.S.C. got caught deflating balls a few years ago, so anything’s possible.Q. If it was done in college, why not in the pros?A. Anything is possible, but it is highly improbable. If you’re down on the sidelines and taking a ball out of the bag, which logistically you’d have to do, you could be seen.Q. Could the balls have inadvertently lost air because of the cold weather?A. Sometimes balls can have a bladder problem. I’m a collector, and I have a ball that hasn’t lost any air in five years. But I have another ball that has to be reflated. Those great ladies in Ada, Ohio [where Wilson produces game balls for the N.F.L.] do such a great job sewing the balls, but sometimes the bladder loses air and it’s beyond their control. But the officials are so good at what they do and are taught what they have to do, I find it hard to believe it could take place.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
