Barcelona, is set to appear in court alongside his father to face tax fraud charges relating to past advertising contracts.The judge in charge of the case has not yet set a date for the trial, according to reports in the Spanish news media on Thursday. The judge’s decision follows a report from the state legal services, which represent Spain’s national tax agency and called for Messi and his father, Jorge Horacio, to face charges that carry a sentence of as much as 22 months in prison.The state legal services rejected the argument made by Lionel Messi’s lawyers, as well as recently by the state prosecution, that only Jorge Horacio Messi should stand trial as the instigator of the suspect business deals.Instead, the state legal services concluded that, even if he did not set up any of his business contracts himself, Messi “couldn’t have ignored” that a significant part of his income was generated via offshore companies, according to the report, which was not made public but was disclosed by newspaper El País.The accusations against Messi and his father date to 2013, when a state prosecutor opened an investigation into whether the two had defrauded the state of about 4 million euros (about $4.5 million) by using offshore companies in countries like Belize to avoid paying Spanish taxes on advertising contracts. The investigation focused on Messi’s tax returns filed between 2007 and 2009.Even if found guilty, Messi is unlikely to spend any time in prison because sentences for financial crime of less than two years are suspended under Spanish law. Furthermore, Messi and his father have agreed to make an additional tax payment of €5 million — covering the alleged unpaid taxes as well as interest charges — in 2013, shortly after their advertising deals were placed under court investigation.Messi has won four FIFA world player of the year awards and led last season Barcelona to another Champions League victory, as well as the Spanish league and cup titles. Messi, 28, is from Argentina but moved to Spain when he was 13 to join Barcelona’s youth academy.Some other high-profile players are facing similar tax evasion investigations, linked to advertising deals allegedly set up through offshore companies in order to avoid Spanish taxes. Without commenting on the allegations, Javier Mascherano, who plays alongside Messi both for Barcelona and Argentina, agreed last month to pay back-taxes and interest charges on income. But another star player who is under investigation, Xabi Alonso, denied recently ever failing to comply with his Spanish tax obligations.Advertisement
