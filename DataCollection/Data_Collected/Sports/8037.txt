With that issue resolved, Silver said he would look at reducing the overall wear and tear on players, revisiting the draft lottery system, addressing the competitive balance of the league and increasing the focus on youth basketball.Many of Silver’s remarks, made at Barclays Center before the All-Star weekend’s skills competitions, were more of a promise of action than a declaration of anything immediate. Still, he said that there would be a “dramatic reduction” in the number of times a team had to play four games in five nights and that the league wanted to reduce the number of back-to-back games.To help accomplish that goal, the league is considering shortening the preseason, Silver said, in hopes that the season can start earlier and end later. He said each extra day would drastically aid the league’s ability to reduce tough workloads and positively affect player health.Addressing accusations that teams like the Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers were intentionally losing games to improve their draft position, Silver said that the draft lottery was not necessarily a broken system but that it had a perception problem the league intended to address.“I want to ensure that our fans know that our teams do not have an incentive to lose games,” he said.Silver said the league also intended to consider the format of the playoffs because Western Conference teams with winning records had recently been excluded from the postseason while Eastern Conference teams were able to qualify with losing records. Silver said, though, that he supported the continuation of the conference system.“If there was a simple solution, we would have made it long ago,” he said. One difficulty, Silver said, is that Eastern teams may not want a change that would hurt their chances to qualify for postseason play.After turning the news conference over to questions, Silver once again had to discuss off-court issues. The Atlanta Hawks are in the process of seeking new ownership after a controversy erupted over racist comments made by the team’s ownership and management.Silver said the team’s sale was proceeding as expected and confirmed that the league’s Board of Governors had approved a new rule. Ownership groups now must consist of no more than 25 people, and each person must own at least 1 percent, which will eliminate vanity ownership stakes like the one previously held by Jay Z with the Nets.As for the All-Star weekend in New York, Silver said the Knicks and the Nets had claimed that the event pushed $200 million into the local economy and that the various All-Star-related events had been attended by a combined 166,000 fans.Advertisement
