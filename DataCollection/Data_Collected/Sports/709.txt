Instead, as an example, in last week’s 49ers loss to Green Bay, Hyde had just 20 rushing yards on eight carries. Not surprisingly, Kaepernick struggled, too. If San Francisco expects to stop its three-game losing streak — and the 49ers did defeat the Giants last season at MetLife Stadium — it will have to run the football. If not, the Giants’ pass rushers might have their first highly productive game of the season, because Kaepernick cannot make the offense efficient by himself. He has been sacked 14 times, a pace to be sacked 56 times in 16 games. A solid running game is the best protection for a beleaguered quarterback because it keeps a team out of third-and-long situations. But the Giants have the league’s top rushing defense. For them, controlling Hyde is a priority. It will allow them to focus more on Kaepernick, especially late in the game.Number to Watch: 10That’s how many points San Francisco has scored in its last two games. The 49ers have scored the fewest points per game of any N.F.L. team this season.Quotation of the Week ‘I get punched every single game. I get hit in my face every single game. We’re playing football, and these are grown men out here. I don’t think anybody should be talking about what happened after they lost the game.’Giants wide receiver ODELL BECKHAM JR., in response to accusations by Buffalo Bills defenders that Beckham threw punches and acted like a “prima donna” during the Giants’ victory last week.Advertisement
