Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s office said Wednesday that it was cutting nearly $6 million in funding for the United States Grand Prix, raising questions about the race’s future just four years after Formula One put what many saw as a permanent footprint on American soil. Officials at the Circuit of the Americas, a $300 million track built to host the race, have said they were promised $25 million per year for 10 years. The race still gets $19.5 million from the state portion of the fund and local tax money will bump it to $22.7 million, according to Abbott’s office. But that is a $6 million cut from 2014. The spokeswoman Cait Meisenheimer said the reduced figure was calculated under guidelines set by state lawmakers.A version of this brief appears in print on November 12, 2015, on Page B17 of the New York edition with the headline: Grand Prix Funding Cut.
