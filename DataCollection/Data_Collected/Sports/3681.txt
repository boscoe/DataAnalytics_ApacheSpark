Singapore’s Court of Appeal has ordered the release of a man accused of fixing soccer matches around the world, ruling on Wednesday that the allegations against him do not warrant extended detention without trial.The man, Tan Seet Eng, was first detained in September 2013, two years after European prosecutors named him as the crucial link in hundreds of professional matches from 2008 to 2011 with suspicious outcomes that were under investigation for match-fixing.Mr. Tan, also known as Dan Tan, was subsequently held in Singapore under a law that allows detention without trial for up to one year, with the possibility of periodic extension, in the interest of “public safety, peace and good order.”Get news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day in the Asian morning.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

An Italian arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Tan, and Roberto Di Martino, an Italian prosecutor, said he expected Mr. Tan would eventually face trial there. Hungarian prosecutors have also indicted Mr. Tan.AdvertisementBut it was unclear if he would ever face extradition to Europe. A lawyer for Mr. Tan did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday afternoon.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
