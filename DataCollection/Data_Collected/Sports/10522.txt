Still, with his outstanding showing at the plate in spring training, the move brought a threat of litigation from the players’ union.Bryant, 23, hit .425 in the exhibition season, with nine home runs in 40 at-bats. If he spends at least 12 days in the minor leagues, his eligibility for free agency will be delayed by one year, until after the 2021 season. Major League Baseball defended the decision, saying in a statement, “A club has an unfettered right to determine which players are part of its opening-day roster.” ■ The Mets made two trades to bolster a bullpen lacking in left-handers, acquiring Alex Torres from San Diego and Jerry Blevins from Washington. The Mets sent the right-hander Cory Mazzoni and a player to be named to the Padres and outfielder Matt den Dekker to the Nationals. ■ The Brewers released Chris Perez, 29, a former All-Star on a minor league contract who was seeking a setup job in Milwaukee’s bullpen. ■ Closer Drew Storen left Washington’s 6-2 loss to St. Louis with a blister on his right big toe. Nationals Manager Matt Williams said there was no timetable for Storen’s return, a fact made more troublesome by the news that reliever Casey Janssen had rotator cuff tendinitis. Advertisement
