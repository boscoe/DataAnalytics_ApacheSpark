Toronto was in a playoff position in early January when Nonis announced the firing of Coach Randy Carlyle, but the team finished 30-44-8 for its worst point total (68) in an 82-game season since 1996-97. ■ The Buffalo Sabres fired Coach Ted Nolan, a day after their season ended with a second consecutive last-place finish. Nolan had two years left on a contract he signed a little more than a year ago. ■ Jaromir Jagr, 43, signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract to stay with Florida, saying he felt revitalized in his 20 games after the Devils traded him to the Panthers in February.
