Manchester United climbed to third with a 3-1 win over visiting Aston Villa that featured an exquisite volley on the turn from Wayne Rooney.■ Roma ended its four-month winless streak at home with a 1-0 victory over Napoli in Serie A, and Lazio kept up the pressure with a 3-1 win at relegation-threatened Cagliari.
