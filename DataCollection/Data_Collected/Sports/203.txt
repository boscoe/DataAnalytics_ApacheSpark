Chances are you didn’t guess they are Alfred Blue of the Texans and Devonta Freeman of the Falcons. But neither may have the chance to do it again this week. Depending on the health of his team’s starting running back, Blue or Freeman may find himself on the bench.Formerly a benchmark of a hardworking running back, a workload of 30-plus carries has largely fallen out of favor. Larry Johnson of the Chiefs did it 11 times from 2005 to 2006, but last season the total was reached only 11 times by the entire league.Freeman looked unstoppable last week against Dallas, rushing 30 times for 141 yards and three touchdowns. A second-year player out of Florida State, he had not done much in his first two games. But given a start with Tevin Coleman sidelined, he thrived. Coleman did not practice Wednesday, and if he does not play Sunday and Freeman comes up big again, Coleman could be out of a job.Blue, on the other hand, will almost certainly give up his job once Arian Foster is healthy despite an impressive game last week, rushing 31 times for 139 yards and a touchdown. Foster practiced in a limited way Wednesday, and his status will probably be a game-time decision, no doubt drawing the ire of fantasy football fans.Pick: FalconsAdvertisement
