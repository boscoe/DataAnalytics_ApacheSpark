Roger Federer said he would skip the Davis Cup this year, having led Switzerland in 2014 to its first title. “It’s been a big burden for me throughout my career,” said Federer, who beat Mikhail Youzhny, 6-3, 6-1, in his first-round match at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Monday. “I always feel there is so much guilt put on you” by the national federation or the International Tennis Federation.
