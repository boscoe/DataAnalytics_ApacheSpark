The Bengals have allowed just 17.4 points a game and the Broncos are just behind them at 18.5, numbers that will increase the pressure on the young backup quarterbacks.Osweiler has performed well while learning on the job, and he is certainly further along than McCarron, but Denver has been outscored by 36-0 in the second half of their last three games. So even if the Broncos build an early lead, the Bengals can’t be counted out.Pick: BroncosAdvertisement
