RoundupBy The Associated PressCam Newton threw two touchdown passes, Jonathan Stewart ran for another score, and Graham Gano kicked three field goals — two in overtime — as the Carolina Panthers beat the visiting Indianapolis Colts, 29-26, on Thursday night to improve to 7-0.The Colts (3-5) stormed back from a 23-6 fourth-quarter deficit to tie the game with two seconds remaining in regulation. The teams traded field goals on their first possessions in overtime before the Panthers intercepted a deflected Andrew Luck pass to set up Gano’s 52-yard game winner with 5 minutes 27 seconds to play in overtime.GIANTS TO TEST PIERRE-PAUL The Giants plan to push the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul more in practice this week, and there is a chance he will play for the first time since losing a finger in a Fourth of July fireworks accident.Pierre-Paul’s stamina and his ability to play with his damaged right hand will be tested in practice, Coach Tom Coughlin said.If Pierre-Paul makes enough progress, the Giants will be open to using him against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. “We’ll have two good practice days with him, and we will push the envelope a little bit to test the conditioning level,” Coughlin said.The Denver Broncos acquired the two-time Pro Bowl tight end Vernon Davis from the San Francisco 49ers.“He’ll be a valuable addition to our team w/his experience & leadership,” Broncos General Manager John Elway wrote on Twitter.The 49ers will receive sixth-round picks in 2016 and 2017 in the deal, and the Broncos will get a seventh-round pick in 2016.Davis, 31, has 55 career touchdown receptions in his 10-year career.The undefeated Broncos are coming off their biggest win of the year, a 29-10 dismantling of Green Bay in which tight ends Owen Daniels and Virgil Green combined for a season-best 105 yards receiving.SURGERY FOR LOCKETTE Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette had season-ending surgery to stabilize ligaments in his neck, a day after being taken off the field on a backboard after a scary hit during Seattle’s game at Dallas.The Seahawks released a statement that the operation, at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, was a success and that all neurological signs were positive. Before the surgery, the team said Lockette had full motion and feeling in all his extremities and a good prognosis.Lockette was injured on punt coverage when he was hit by the Cowboys’ Jeff Heath.Advertisement
