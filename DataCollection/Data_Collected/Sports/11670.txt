The Penguins created many more chances in a desperate attempt to tie the game, but Lundqvist stood tall.“Monday is the way we’ve wanted to play since Game 1,” defenseman Ryan McDonagh said. “We made better decisions with the puck, executed a lot better, and didn’t turn it over too much to where they would be able to utilize their transition game and their speed.“That’s a good sign,” he added. “If we play the way we need to, it’s successful.”The Rangers again played without defenseman Kevin Klein, but he took part in a morning skate with teammates for the first time since sustaining an injury to his left arm March 11.Klein is one of the Rangers’ better defensemen, but the team was at its defensive best for much of the game. The Penguins managed only 11 shots through two periods, rarely sustaining possession in the attacking zone until the final frenzied push.Of course, merely gaining the zone was troublesome for Pittsburgh until the third period — the Rangers’ neutral-zone play was that strong.“You have to give credit to them,” Hornqvist said. “They were in our face and didn’t give us time and space.”The closest the Penguins came to scoring over the first half of the game was when Crosby hit the far post from the right circle on a nifty set up from Hornqvist late in the first period.That does not mean, however, that Lundqvist was not sharp. He made a pad save on Maxim Lapierre on a short-handed 2-on-1 break near the midway mark of the second. Lundqvist also calmly turned aside Crosby on his own, cutting across the crease from the right-wing side eight minutes into the third.After Hornqvist’s goal, the Penguins sustained their momentum and set the tempo over much of the final seven minutes but could not get the equalizer.“We were able to get off to a pretty good start and have two good periods offensively and defensively, and hold off a really strong push in the third that was to be expected,” Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault said.The Rangers were suffocating early, not allowing a shot on goal over the first 15 minutes. And as they have for all three games of the series, they also scored the first goal.Hagelin’s 11th of the past three postseasons — the most of any Rangers player — was set up by a long pass by defenseman Keith Yandle, who had sat out the morning skate because of illness.Seconds after standing up a surging Crosby as he skated into the Rangers’ zone, Yandle took advantage of a poor Penguins line change by hitting a streaking Hagelin in stride as he split Malkin and Ian Cole and skated into the slot alone.Hagelin beat goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury cleanly for his first goal of the series. Fleury had 24 saves.Almost 20 minutes had elapsed before the game’s next goal, by Kreider at 11:07 of the second. Again, a Rangers defenseman made a play to create the tally. Marc Staal intentionally missed left on a slap shot from the point, the deflection off the boards caroming to an open Kreider, who slapped the puck out of midair for what ultimately was the winner.“We needed to come back here strong and play the right way,” Lundqvist said. “And I think we did.”Advertisement
