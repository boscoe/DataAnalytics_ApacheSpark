The Carolina Panthers are 13-0 and closing in on the fifth perfect regular season in N.F.L. history, with quarterback Cam Newton making a strong case for the Most Valuable Player Award.The Giants are 6-7, have a habit of throwing games away late and are alive in the playoff chase only because they are lucky enough to play in the pitiful N.F.C. East.So Sunday’s game between the teams might seem like a mismatch. What would one expect the opening betting line on the game to be? Ten points? Fourteen? More?Try 4.The head-scratchingly low number may have caused some fans to grab their wallets and rush to the nearest legal (or illegal) bookmaker. But before you take out a second mortgage, it is worth considering why the line is as low as it is.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            ■ The Giants are hosting the game, which is generally considered to be worth about 3 points. By extension, a neutral-site game between the teams might have a line of 7 and a game in Carolina a line of 10, both of which feel more right.Advertisement■ The Panthers are less impressive than one might expect a perfect team to be, with a schedule significantly easier than most of this season’s other elite teams’. The Panthers had a good win over Green Bay and beat Seattle on the road when that team was struggling, but otherwise they have mostly been playing noncontenders.AdvertisementEarly in the season, the Panthers played a number of close games that perhaps could have gone the other way, and seven of their wins have been by single digits. Oddsmakers much prefer to see blowouts that clearly establish a superior team. (Carolina’s three biggest wins of the season came in the last four weeks, so this trend may be changing.)The website Inpredictable, which analyzes Las Vegas lines, says bookmakers currently rank Carolina as only the third-best team in football.■ In contrast, the Giants may be better than their record appears. Six of their seven losses have been by 6 points or fewer. Losing games in the last seconds may drive fans crazy, but it is looked on much more favorably by oddsmakers, who see it as a sign the team was competitive. The Giants’ 1-point loss to the New England Patriots last month was as impressive as many of the Panthers’ victories.■ Motivation is a trickier category. Both teams would seem to be eager to win: the Giants to keep their playoff hopes alive and the Panthers to make history. But late in the season, teams fighting for a playoff berth have tended to fare better than teams playing just for seeding or for a historically good record.Many bettors found a line of 4 points too good to be true, and it has since drifted upward to 5, 5 ½ or even 6. Still, 6-point favorites often lose in the N.F.L. The Panthers may be much more vulnerable Sunday than meets the eye.A similar situation may arise in the playoffs. The Panthers are virtually certain to be the N.F.C.’s top seed, and a possible opponent for them in their first game is Seattle, which is on track to be a No. 5 or 6 seed. Although the Seahawks are 8-5, computer rankings and oddsmakers love them. Their early-season struggles seem to be behind them, and they have won six of seven, including consecutive road blowouts against the Minnesota Vikings and the Baltimore Ravens.Inpredictable says that the Seahawks are actually the top team in the league by the odds, ranking them 1 ½ points better than Carolina. Even with home field and a possible 16-0 record, the Panthers might find themselves only a 1- or 2-point favorite in their playoff opener.The Panthers may have to become the first 19-0 Super Bowl winner before the last skeptic is convinced.A version of this article appears in print on December 17, 2015, on Page B17 of the New York edition with the headline: A Victor in 13 Straight Games Still Has to Win Over Oddsmakers.
