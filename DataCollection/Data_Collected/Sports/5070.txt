Perfection in sports tickles the imagination because perfection is so hard to accomplish in any other walk of life.Is there a perfect melody, perfect painting or perfect business plan?But in sports, outcomes are measured by quantifiable victories, so the seemingly unattainable — a perfect achievement — is simplified: It means never losing.It is why Sunday’s game between the Giants (6-7) and the Carolina Panthers (13-0) is so much more than a late-season matchup with playoff implications. The Panthers, who had a losing record a year ago, are trying to become the fifth N.F.L. team to finish the regular season without a loss or a tie. Only one of those teams, the 1972 Miami Dolphins, also won every game in the postseason; the Dolphins finished with a 17-0 record.Week by week, the focus on Carolina has grown, and the Panthers will carry that bull’s-eye into MetLife Stadium on Sunday. They have also spent months listening to critics who called them the worst undefeated team in N.F.L. history.“We’ve heard it since Week 3, and it’s been the same narrative — everyone just changes the reasons why we’re the worst at that particular moment,” tight end Greg Olsen said Wednesday. “We don’t really pay too much attention to it. We don’t need anybody’s votes. We don’t need style points. In our league, your record is what you are.”AdvertisementOlsen added, “We’re not going to apologize.”Still, Coach Ron Rivera has spoken to his players about the pitfalls of chasing an unblemished season. Rivera was a linebacker for the 1985 Chicago Bears, who were coached by Mike Ditka and were 12-0 until a loss in Miami.Advertisement“As Coach Ditka used to always tell us, ‘They like to put you on a pedestal, but remember, that pedestal gets high, so it’s a long way to fall,’ ” Rivera said last week in a conference call.As it happens, the Giants have plenty of experience with rattling the pedestal upon which the top N.F.L. teams have sat in recent seasons.Four times in the last eight years, the Giants have faced an undefeated team after the midpoint of the regular season. They did it in Week 17 of the 2007 season, losing to the New England Patriots, 38-35. In 2011, the reigning Super Bowl champions, the Green Bay Packers, were 11-0 when they went to MetLife Stadium and narrowly escaped with a 3-point victory. This season, the Patriots were 8-0 and rallied for a 27-26 win over the Giants.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            But the most notable game in the category was Super Bowl XLII, when the Giants got a second shot at the Patriots after the 2007 regular season and stopped New England’s 18-0 run with a 17-14 upset.On Thursday, the retired Chris Snee, the Giants’ right guard for each of those four games, recalled the buzz that preceded them. What Snee remembered most was that nobody — not coaches, fans or reporters — talked much about the Giants. The attention was focused on the opponents.“You grow tired of hearing about how good those guys are,” Snee said. “You grow tired of hearing about what they’re going to do. It really makes you want to be the team that gives them their first loss. That’s especially true this late in the season and if they’re coming into your home stadium.”Referring to the Golden State Warriors’ recent streak of victories to open the N.B.A. season, Snee said that any opponent standing in the path to sports history found a distinctive, heightened focus.Advertisement“You know the whole country is watching at that moment,” Snee said. “You know you’re playing the team in the N.F.L.”Quarterback Eli Manning, Snee’s former teammate and training camp roommate, also said that Carolina’s 13-0 record was similar to the Warriors’ 24-0 start.“It’s natural, when you haven’t lost, that there is excitement with people saying, ‘Hey, can they finish the season undefeated?’ ” Manning said at his locker last week. “In football, it’s ‘Can they be the team to go to the Super Bowl and be undefeated?’ There is all that, but for us, this game is important because it affects our season. We’re playing for a playoff spot.”But Tom Coughlin, the Giants’ coach since 2004, conceded that he found gratification in giving undefeated teams tense, hard-fought games.“I do take pride in it,” he said.Coughlin continued: “You’re playing against the best, you better bring your best — that’s the attitude we’ve always had. It’s a great motivational and inspirational-type thing to be able to play against the teams that are playing the best.”Addressing his team this past week, Coughlin mentioned a few times that Carolina was undefeated — although he did not think he had to do it.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Dozens of college football and basketball teams have done it. In other sports, there have been definitions of at least a kind of faultlessness.AdvertisementThe gymnast Nadia Comaneci had an unprecedented score of 10.0 at the 1976 Summer Olympics. The speedskater Eric Heiden won five gold medals to sweep the individual events at the 1980 Lake Placid Games.John Wooden, the U.C.L.A. basketball coach, had four undefeated teams. Days before the Patriots and the Giants met in Super Bowl XLII nearly eight years ago, Wooden was asked about what New England was trying to achieve.“There is no perfect season,” he said. “You can have a season where you win all your games. But that is far from perfect. The other teams you played scored points, and your team made mistakes. Maybe a lucky bounce actually won you a game or two.”Wooden did not like to mix accomplishment and victories.“I never even mentioned trying to win games to my teams,” he said. “I did talk about perfection. I said it was not possible. But I said it’s not impossible to try for it. That’s what we did in every practice and game.”A version of this article appears in print on December 20, 2015, on Page SP3 of the New York edition with the headline: Panthers Arrive With Masterpiece, but Giants Know How to Smudge.
