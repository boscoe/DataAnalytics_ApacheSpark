CreditFred R. Conrad for The New York Times        Nathan, a 4-year-old bloodhound, was relaxing in his carrier on Monday morning at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He had already won his breed competition and was biding his time — it would be nearly 12 hours — before he had to face group competition at night against other hounds.But when a Canadian artist, Alec Baldwin, stopped by with a portrait of Nathan against a desert background, the bloodhound was let out of his carrier in a far corner of Pier 92 in Manhattan. If a fan was willing to paint him in a regal pose, why not oblige by coming out of his room?So Nathan posed between Heather Helmer, his handler and co-owner, and Baldwin, who is from Manitoba. He kissed each of them in the sloppy style that requires bloodhound handlers to carry extra cloths to soak up the abundant saliva.“He loves you,” Helmer told Baldwin. “He’s slobbering.”Nathan’s charm was evident at last year’s Westminster show when he was the overwhelming crowd-pleaser in the Best in Show competition, which he lost to Sky, a wire fox terrier. It was as if an ad hoc Nathan Nation had formed at Madison Square Garden, as if they were trying to catapult him into an unprecedented achievement: first bloodhound to win the top prize at Westminster.Nathan won the National Dog Show late last year, so was victory plausible at Westminster? Why has a bloodhound never won at the show, which is held during the days at Piers 92 and 94 in Manhattan and at the Garden at night? The Wynn Las Vegas put Nathan’s odds at 10-1, fourth best in the field.AdvertisementMost of the 192 breeds entered this year have never won Westminster. Indeed, only 47 have.Is the bloodhound’s exclusion because it is not classically adorable, with its sad, sunken eyes, jowly face and wrinkly neck? Is it the slobber?AdvertisementDoes Nathan, and those before him, remind judges of the bloodhounds who pursued the beloved Paul Newman in “Cool Hand Luke”? Or is McGruff the Crime Dog too much of an authoritarian cartoon bloodhound to adore?Those who love bloodhounds — with their long heads and floppy ears — do so for their easy disposition and loving demeanor. Sure, they are big, sloppy galoots. But does that make them less deserving of the top prize?
                Do dogs really look like their owners? Put the theory to the test by trying to guess which dog from the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show belongs to which owner.            Those questions will continue to be asked about bloodhounds, because Nathan did not successfully defend his hound group title. Instead, a 15-inch beagle named Miss P finished first among hounds at Monday night’s judging, while Nathan finished second.Miss P, who is also 4, is a grandniece of Uno, who in 2008 became the first beagle to win Best in Show, and followed that with a run of public celebrity. He retired to a farm in Austin, Tex.“This is a surprise, this is wonderful,” said Eddie Dziuk, who was one of Uno’s owners. He said that Miss P has had a spirited, sportsmanlike competition against Nathan for hound-group supremacy the past year without any trash talk among the rival owners or dogs.“She moved so fluidly and effortlessly tonight,” he added.Win or lose at Best in Show on Tuesday, Miss P intends to retire to motherhood.One of her competitors will be a Shih Tzu named Rocket, the winner of the toy group, whose ownership group includes Patricia Hearst Shaw, who in 1974, when she was better known as Patty, was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army.AdvertisementShe is not a stranger to Westminster; in 2008, her French bulldog won best of opposite sex, essentially second place to the winner of that breed competition. At the time, she told People magazine that she understood the incongruity of her notoriety clashing with the showing dogs.“I guess people somehow imagine that you don’t evolve in your life,” she said after Rocket’s group victory. “I have grown daughters and grandchildren and other things that normal people have.” In addition to Rocket, one of her French bulldogs won second place in the breed earlier.The Shih Tzu wore a blue bow that supported his topknot. The last two group winners of the night were Flame, a black standard poodle who won the nonsporting group, and an Old English sheepdog named Swagger, the victor in the herding group.They will face the winners of the terrier, working and sporting groups, who will be chosen Tuesday night before the Best in Show dog is chosen.A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Disappointment for the Fans of a Charming Galoot.
