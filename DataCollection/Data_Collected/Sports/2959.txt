Browns (2-7) at Steelers (5-4)1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 4.5N.F.L. Week 10 scores and highlightsSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger had to be taken to the locker room on a cart after spraining his left foot in last week’s 38-35 victory against the Raiders, but he refused to rule himself out for this one against the Browns, against whom he is 18-2 in his career. But Coach Mike Tomlin sounded less optimistic, stating that the team would “leave the door ajar” for Roethlisberger, though only “slightly ajar.”If Big Ben cannot go, Landry Jones will start for Pittsburgh. In his only start this season, a 23-13 loss to the Chiefs, Jones completed 16 of 29 passes for 209 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Pittsburgh may also be without running back DeAngelo Williams, who also has a foot injury. Williams rushed for 170 yards last week filling in for the injured starter Le’Veon Bell.Cleveland is also facing some uncertainty at quarterback. Starter Josh McCown is still struggling with a rib injury, meaning Johnny Manziel may be under center for the Browns once again.PICK: SteelersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
