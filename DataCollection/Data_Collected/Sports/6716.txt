Last year’s Super Bowl pitted one of the greatest single-season offenses in N.F.L. history against one of the greatest single-season defenses. Using slightly different time frames, this year’s Super Bowl can boast similar claims.Both the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks had slow starts in 2014. After New England’s 41-14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 4, pundits wondered if we were witnessing the end of the Tom Brady/Bill Belichick-era Patriots. But since that game, the offensive line emerged as a cohesive unit, Rob Gronkowski’s health improved and Brady became red-hot. Since that game, New England has averaged 35.3 points per game, including the playoffs (but excluding the meaningless Week 17 finale, in which the Patriots benched many starters).From Games 5 to 15 of the regular season, New England scored 379 points, the seventh most during such a stretch of any team since 1970. Then, the Patriots scored 35 points in the team’s first playoff win over the Baltimore Ravens, and 45 last weekend against the Indianapolis Colts. New England joins the 1994 San Francisco 49ers and the 1990 Buffalo Bills as the only Super Bowl participants to average 40 points per game through multiple playoff games before the Super Bowl.Seattle can tell a similar story. After falling to 3-3, it allowed only 11.3 points per game over its final 10 regular-season games; no other team allowed fewer than 16 points per game over that span. And the Seahawks have continued their dominant play in the postseason. Against Carolina, Seattle’s defense held the Panthers to 10 points until the final minutes; and, with six minutes left, Seattle intercepted a pass from Cam Newton, and returned it for a touchdown, sealing the victory.AdvertisementAgainst Green Bay, Seattle turnovers gave the Packers’ offense three possessions at the Seattle 19-, 23- and 33-yard lines. The Seahawks’ defense held the Packers to field goals on each drive. On the other 10 Green Bay drives, the Seattle defense limited a Packers offense that averaged 2.73 points per drive during the regular season to 13 points.AdvertisementIf one takes the longer view, Seattle’s defense is beginning to stand out as legendary. Over the last three years, 31 of the 32 N.F.L. teams have allowed more than 10,000 passing yards; Seattle has allowed fewer than 9,000. Over the last three years, Seattle has allowed an average of 282.3 yards per game; the other 31 teams have allowed an average of 350.1, and no other team has allowed fewer than 310. And, since 2012, the Seahawks have allowed 15.2 points per game. Only one other defense (the 49ers’, at 18.4) has allowed fewer than 20 points a game during that time, and the other 31 teams have allowed an average of 23.2.Playing in today’s offense-friendly environment has, in some ways, hidden how dominant the Seahawks’ defense has been. Seattle has led the N.F.L. in points allowed in each of the past three seasons, becoming the first team to do so since the Minnesota Vikings (1969 to 1971). And the Seahawks have also led the N.F.L. in yards allowed in each of the past two years; since the N.F.L. merger in 1970, the only other defense to lead the league in points allowed and yards allowed in consecutive seasons was the 1985-86 Chicago Bears.But with a longer view, the Patriots’ offense stands out as dominant, too. Over the last five years, New England has scored 2,500 points, or 500 points per year. The next best team is Green Bay, and the Packers are still 216 points (or 43 points per season) behind the Patriots. The Patriots have also had only 76 turnovers over the last five years. That is easily the fewest in the N.F.L.; the other 31 teams have averaged 128.So while this year’s Super Bowl may not be able to match last year’s in terms of glamour and hype, it is yet another matchup of a dominant defense against a dominant offense. It is also the clearest Super Bowl in which we may be witnessing a changing of the guard when it comes to the league’s dynastic team.The team of the 1950s was the Cleveland Browns, and the team of the 1960s was the Packers, but they were never quite dominant at the same time (those Browns teams, led by Otto Graham, last made a title game in ’57, while the Packers first made a championship game in 1960). The Browns did have a resurgence behind Jim Brown in the 1960s, and won the N.F.L. title in 1964 (the Packers had won it in ’61 and ’62). Then, in 1965, the teams met in the championship game at Lambeau Field. Green Bay won, 23-12, thanks to 201 rushing yards from Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor. It was the first of three straight championships for the Packers.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bart Starr and Terry Bradshaw played only one game on the same field, a nondescript one in 1970 in the midst of losing seasons for both squads. Those Steelers under Bradshaw last won the Super Bowl in 1979, while the team of the 1980s — the 49ers — began to emerge in 1981, the year the team won its first Super Bowl.That season was also the only time that Bradshaw and Joe Montana played against each other. In Week 9 of the 1981 season, the 5-3 Steelers hosted the 6-2 49ers in a game that no one could have known would feature the team of the ’70s against the team of the ’80s. Neither quarterback had a great day: Bradshaw threw three interceptions, and Montana threw a pick-six to Mel Blount — but the 49ers pulled out the win on a 1-yard run by Walt Easley. San Francisco, which had started the season 1-2, ended the year on a 15-1 run, culminating in the first of the team’s four Super Bowl titles of the decade.The 49ers’ run, like the modern Patriots’, lasted far into the next decade. The Dallas Cowboys, the team of the ’90s, would face San Francisco frequently during those years, including in the N.F.C. championship game in 1992, 1993 and 1994. But all of those games were started by Steve Young; in fact, there was only one game in which Montana and Troy Aikman were the starters. That came in 1990, in a game in which the 49ers’ defense flustered Aikman, and San Francisco won easily in Dallas, 24-6.Aikman never played against Brady; the Cowboys’ run ended in the late ’90s, and the Patriots’ run did not begin until the 2001 season. Will the Seahawks end up emerging as the team of the ’10s? Winning Super Bowl XLIX will go a long way toward putting Seattle in the pole position for that title. And that is part of what makes this game so fascinating.AdvertisementWith the exception of games between the 49ers (under Young and George Seifert, not Montana and Bill Walsh) and the Cowboys in the ’90s, contests between the previous dynasty and the next dynasty are very rare. This will be the second matchup between Brady and Russell Wilson, but the teams are not scheduled to play each other again until 2016. Add in the element of a dominant offense and a dominant defense, and this year’s Super Bowl is very much deserving of the hype.A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Super Bowl Pits Best on Both Sides of Ball.
