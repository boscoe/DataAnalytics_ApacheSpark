The third leg of the Volvo Ocean Race started Saturday with the fleet setting sail for China from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, without the Danish-backed Team Vestas Wind, whose vessel was being assessed for repairs. The Danish boat has been shipped to Malaysia after it was retrieved from a reef in the Indian Ocean where it was grounded after a collision on Nov. 29. Three teams — Team Brunel (Netherlands), Abu Dhabi Ocean Racing and Dongfeng Race Team (China) — are tied for first with 4 points apiece.A version of this brief appears in print on January 4, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Ocean Race Starts Third Leg, Minus a Boat.
