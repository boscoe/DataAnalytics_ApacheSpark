A judge in an Illinois court dismissed a class-action lawsuit against the Illinois High School Association that asserted its concussion policies were negligent and did not do enough to protect the state’s football players. The suit was filed last year by Alex Pierscionek, who had played as a defensive lineman at South Elgin High School in suburban Chicago.The judge, LeRoy K. Martin Jr., sided with the association, a nonprofit organization that oversees high school sports in Illinois, ruling that football players assume the risk of playing contact sports and that increased liability could harm high school football, potentially even causing it to be abandoned.“It is clear to this court that I.H.S.A. has acted to protect student-athletes in this state,” Martin wrote.Pierscionek’s lawyer sought greater protections for players, like mandatory baseline testing for all football players, the presence of medical personnel at practices and a medical monitoring fund that would have paid for former players to be screened for problems related to head injuries.AdvertisementSince the filing of the suit, the association has passed regulations limiting the number of contact practices teams may conduct, and a new committee has been formed to examine safety issues. Pierscionek said he sustained a concussion before his junior season in 2012 and was not removed from practice, later needing an airlift to a nearby hospital.Last week, Andre Smith, a football player at Bogan High School in Chicago, died from blows to the head he had sustained during a game. He was the seventh high school football player in the United States to die from injuries this season, the association said.Advertisement“This ruling energizes our efforts to continue to make all sports safer for high school student-athletes in Illinois,” Marty Hickman, the association’s executive director, said in statement. “The tragedy that occurred with Andre Smith, and situations like it, are what drive us and those who work to make all levels of sports safer for the participants.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
