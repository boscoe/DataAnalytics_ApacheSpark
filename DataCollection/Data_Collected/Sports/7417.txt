By at least by one measure, the game was also the most expensive ticket ever.According to TiqIQ.com, the average price of a ticket being offered for resale on game day was $10,466.11, which is over four times more than last year, when the average price was $2,567.Part of the reason was that the game was in a warm climate and flights and hotels were less expensive than last year, when the Super Bowl was played in New Jersey.The matchup also helped. Seahawks fans could more easily get to Arizona from the Pacific Northwest. Indeed, Seattle fans seemed to outnumber Patriots fans in the stadium and in the streets of Phoenix.Finally, there was the drama of a team going for its second consecutive title against a team that last accomplished the feat a decade ago.SURGERY LIKELY FOR SHERMAN Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman played the Super Bowl with torn ligaments in his left elbow and will most likely need Tommy John surgery in the off-season.Seattle Coach Pete Carroll said Monday that it was his understanding that Sherman would need the surgery after the All-Pro cornerback was injured in the N.F.C. championship game against Green Bay.
