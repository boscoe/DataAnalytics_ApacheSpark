By contrast, Harvard, which de-emphasized football in the 1950s, has an endowment of more than $35 billion. Wellesley College, which is a fraction of Alabama’s size and does not play football, has an endowment approaching $2 billion. The difference in reputations is still greater: Harvard ranked No. 2 and Wellesley was No. 4 in the most recent U.S. News survey of universities and liberal arts colleges, while Alabama was No. 96. If football is so important to academic success, why do the universities that spend less on it have both more money and better national reputations, and why is the gap growing rather than shrinking with the passage of time?MICHAEL A. LIVINGSTON, Cheltenham, Pa.Catching the Agony of Mets FansTo the Sports Editor:Re “The End,” Nov. 3: What an epic, operatic photograph by Chang W. Lee that perfectly captured the agony of Mets fans after Eric Hosmer’s game-tying, game-changing run. As a Red Sox fan, I recognize all too well the sentiments in those faces, the body language of fans whose perceived superstitious power and control over winning becomes just a mote of dust in a single chaotic clutch championship moment. Lee captured the crushing feeling of being so close to the summit and then realizing you will not plant your flag — you must begin anew, in the spring, with the rest, far down at base camp again.I remember such a moment in Shea Stadium in 1986 when the Mets sent the Red Sox back down the mountain. Keep the faith, Mets fans, there’s always next year.KATE O’CONNELL, Bayside, QueensTV-Related Swings and Misses To the Sports Editor:Re “October Surprise: Rodriguez Excels on Different Stage,” Nov. 2: I’m amazed at the bad taste and cluelessness of Fox’s hiring Alex Rodriguez (one of the biggest steroid cheats and deniers in baseball history) and Pete Rose (banned from baseball for betting on games and repeatedly lying about it) as principal analysts on its pregame and postgame playoff and World Series telecasts. Was there no one else available? Quite an example for the youth of America. What a disgrace.ALVIN S. MICHAELSON, Los AngelesTo the Sports Editor:It was disappointing that Richard Sandomir chose to revisit the missteps of Alex Rodriguez. While Rodriguez’s actions were not always appropriate, his personal turnaround, including the hard work he put in to acquire and professionalize new skill sets, did not warrant at least seven editorial reminders of his past missteps.I am sure many of your readers have not lived lives of perfect behavior. Many, including those who have accomplished similar positive lifestyle turnarounds, probably resent this tawdry portrayal of Rodriguez.IRWIN TANTLEFF, Syosset, N.Y.Advertisement
