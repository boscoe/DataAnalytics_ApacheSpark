BEAVER CREEK, Colo. —  After winning the world title in the Alpine combined on Sunday, and delivering on the high expectations of his ski-crazed country, Marcel Hirscher of Austria was able to relax. So he celebrated his victory the best way he knew how: with steins of beer and plates of Wiener schnitzel at the Austria House, a temporary outpost of his homeland here in the Vail Valley complete with apple strudel, oompah bands and women wearing dirndls.“In Austria, skiing is really big, and there is a lot of pressure on my shoulders,” Hirscher, 25, said Monday. “Nearly everyone was expecting that I am going to win for sure one medal, so I have done that. I have completely no pressure now. I feel endlessly free. Now, I can take full risk and attack.”Pressure or not, Hirscher is a medal favorite for Friday’s giant slalom and Sunday’s slalom at the Alpine World Ski Championships. Having added a second gold in the team event Tuesday, he now has an opportunity to become the first man to win four gold medals at a single iteration of the world championships.With 69 podium finishes, five world championship medals, three World Cup overall titles and an Olympic silver medal, Hirscher has emerged as one of the most successful ski racers in recent history. Only two Austrian skiers, Hermann Maier and Benjamin Raich, have more World Cup victories than Hirscher’s 29, and in his country he is an A-list celebrity who is ubiquitous on television and in magazines and newspapers.AdvertisementHe has notched 11 top-three World Cup finishes this winter and leads the overall standings. He is poised to become the first man to win four straight World Cup overall titles.
                Some of the top ski racers in the world describe the sounds of a World Cup downhill.            “I’m sure it’s not easy to win it four times in a row because no one else has done it before and there’s a reason for that,” he said. “If it happens, it would be unbelievable, but it won’t be easy.”AdvertisementRaised in Annaberg — an Alpine town about two hours from Salzburg — Hirscher grew up a stone’s throw from the slopes where his father, Ferdinand, taught him to ski. Ferdinand Hirscher instilled in his son the importance of the technical aspects of the sport.“He told me, ‘Listen, if you want to win races, it doesn’t matter what level, you have to ski technically brilliantly,’ ” Marcel Hirscher said. “It was the most important thing of my career, to have this technique.”Hirscher is now one of the finest technical skiers the sport has had, and his father is still one of his coaches, although he did not travel to the world championships because of his fear of flying.For the past two years, Hirscher, whose skiing is defined by a precise, efficient and aggressive technique, has focused on improving his giant slalom skills in hopes of catching Ted Ligety of the United States, who has won the World Cup giant slalom title five times and is widely considered the world’s best giant slalom skier. Hirscher’s relentless training has paid off: He leads the giant slalom standings by 138 points over Ligety, who has struggled.“We worked hard to close that gap,” Hirscher said. “And it was worth it, of course. But no time to relax. Ted is an excellent skier and working hard as well, so we have to stay tuned constantly.”Ligety is not convinced that Hirscher has caught up to him.“Marcel is skiing better than he has been, but I think myself and Alexis, we haven’t been showing our best skiing this year,” Ligety said, referring to the French skier Alexis Pinturault. “So I think that makes it kind of deceiving at how much better Marcel is, with him winning so many races, big victories. A couple of us guys aren’t necessarily skiing as well.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He races speedway motorcycles, does CrossFit training and posts snapshots of his World Cup travels on his Instagram account, which has more than 90,000 followers (a fraction of his 400,000 Facebook followers). Social media, he said, is invaluable to his brand. Whereas Maier is emblematic of a past generation, Hirscher has quickly become the face of today’s Austrian youth.AdvertisementBut fame and success can have a downside. Hirscher cannot walk the streets of Salzburg without being mobbed, and he says he longs to do things that “every other 25-year-old does.” He would like to have a family someday with his longtime girlfriend, Laura Moisl.Because of the demands of his career — the news media, the training, the schedule, the emotional and physical exhaustion — Hirscher has said that he will retire in 2019, when he is 30, cutting short a potentially record-breaking career.“I’ve already reached more than I could ever expect,” he said. “But still my dream is finding the perfect turn.”A version of this article appears in print on February 12, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: New Kind of Austrian Ski Star Is Set to Add to Title Collection.
