She was 19.Her death was confirmed by Brooke Desserich, the co-founder of Ms. Hill’s foundation, the Cure Starts Now. “She’s made an impact on the world,” said her coach, Dan Benjamin. “People are contacting me because they want to share her story.”A year and a half ago, Ms. Hill was a high school student getting ready for college. She decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph, a Division III program. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in Lawrenceburg, Ind., near Cincinnati. Tests found the tumor, but treatment did not work. She knew she had less than two years left.The N.C.A.A. agreed to let Mount St. Joseph move up its opening game against Hiram College by two weeks because Ms. Hill’s condition was deteriorating. Xavier University offered its 10,000-seat arena so more people could attend. Tickets sold out in less than an hour.By the time the game came around on Nov. 2, the tumor had affected Ms. Hill’s right side so much that she had to shoot with her nondominant hand. With the former Tennessee women’s coach Pat Summitt and several W.N.B.A. players on hand, Ms. Hill took a pass and made a left-handed layup only 17 seconds into the game. She also made the last basket of the game.“It’s a dream come true,” she said. “Everything that happened today was amazing.”Ms. Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor forced her to give up playing. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in a room at the hospital where Ms. Hill was being treated.Advertisement
