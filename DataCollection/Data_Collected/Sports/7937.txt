Anthony, who said he expected to play in Sunday’s N.B.A. All-Star Game at Madison Square Garden, if only for a “few minutes,” made his comments in an interview with ESPN Radio.Anthony aggravated his injury in Monday’s loss to the Miami Heat and missed Wednesday’s loss to the Orlando Magic, which dropped the Knicks’ record to a league-worst 10-43 entering the All-Star break. He has indicated that he will probably need surgery.“Now I’ve got to start thinking about the future,” said Anthony, who has four years remaining on a five-year deal worth $124 million. “This season is this season. So I really want to just sit down with my team and sit down with the proper people to just kind of plan this thing out and see exactly what I have to do.”Anthony, who was voted by fans to start in the All-Star Game, said he planned to take the court “even if I come out and just play a couple minutes and just wave.”“They voted me in for a reason,” he said, “so at least I can show them that I appreciate that by just participating in the game.” SCOTT CACCIOLAAdvertisement
