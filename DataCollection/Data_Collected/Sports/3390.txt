Rams (4-5) at Ravens (2-7)1 p.m. Line: Ravens by 1N.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsThe quarterback exchange that sent Sam Bradford to Philadelphia and Nick Foles to St. Louis was one of the biggest trades of the off-season, with many observers predicting that a change of scenery would be beneficial to each of them. It has not worked out, and this week neither is expected to start. At least Bradford is injured; Foles is sitting simply because he has been terrible.The Rams have three offensive linemen on injured reserve, so Case Keenum, who is starting in Foles’s place, will have his hands full. The lone good news in the Rams’ world is that Chris Long, a standout defensive end, is expected to return.PICK: RavensWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
