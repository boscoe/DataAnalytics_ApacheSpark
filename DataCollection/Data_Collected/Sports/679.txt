Week 5 scores and highlightsLightning round question: Can you name a Ravens starting wide receiver? Don’t feel bad if you can’t — even hard-core Ravens fans probably have no idea whom quarterback Joe Flacco will be throwing to this weekend. With Steve Smith and the top draft pick, Breshad Perriman, likely to be out with injuries, the Ravens’ starting wide receivers entering Week 5 look to be Kamar Aiken and Marlon Brown. This is kind of sad considering that Flacco throws one of the best deep balls in the league.Still, there is a glimmer of hope. The Ravens have traded for Rams wide receiver Chris Givens, and he is expected to see immediate action.“He’s going to be out there on Sunday,” Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said. “How much he plays depends on how well he does. I’m really hopeful that he plays a lot. It will be up to him and how well he can learn what we’re doing.”PICK: RAVENSAdvertisement
