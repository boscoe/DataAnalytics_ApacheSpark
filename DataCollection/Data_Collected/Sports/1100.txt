The result hurt the Palestinian team’s chances of advancing to the final round of Asian qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.In a letter addressed to FIFA’s acting general secretary, Markus Kattner, the Palestinian Football Association claims East Timor fielded seven players who did not comply with FIFA citizenship regulations.Under FIFA rules, a player may be eligible to represent a country if he was born there, has lived there for five years as an adult, or has parents or grandparents from there. Timor has no national league to attract professional players, and while it shares a common language with Brazil (Portuguese), links such as migration are limited. Yet nearly 20 Brazilian-born players are now listed as having a Timorese citizenship.The letter to FIFA is signed by Susan Shalabi Molano, a senior member of the Palestinian Football Association and a member of the Asian Football Confederation’s executive committee. The president of the Timorese federation, Francisco Kalbuadi Lay, is also an A.F.C. executive committee member.Molano said she was unaware of any of East Timor’s other recent opponents making similar complaints.In a news conference this week, East Timor’s Brazilian coach, Fernando Alcântara, expressed delight at how his team had been able to match the Palestinian team’s ability. When asked what part recruitment had played in this, he deflected the question and repeated a previous answer about his side’s improved strength, preparation, mentality and strategy.Team unity has been an issue, however. There has been ongoing concern about the Timorese being unfairly treated in the team; the captain Anngisu Barbosa did not play the team’s two most recent games, despite being in Dili. And before the Palestinian match, East Timor’s native-born players bunked in a local sports center while the Brazilians stayed in a budget hotel around the corner. The players were moved together to a hotel before a subsequent match against Malaysia.East Timor lost to Malaysia, 1-0, and after a promising start to its qualifying campaign now sits at the bottom of its group.Advertisement
