BOSTON —  Stung by recent polling that showed only a third of Boston residents want the city to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, the group organizing the bid has reversed itself and now supports a voter referendum on the proposal, an inauspicious development for an already shaky bid.John Fish, chairman of Boston 2024, the private group that organized the bid, announced Tuesday morning that the group would seek a statewide vote and even help gather the signatures required to get the measure on the ballot. Mr. Fish, who is also chief executive of the region’s leading construction firm, pledged that if the measure failed, or if it failed in the city of Boston, the group would drop the bid.His stance is a reversal of the group’s earlier position that no referendum was necessary and that even if one were held, Boston 2024 would not necessarily abide by it if it were nonbinding.In a statement Tuesday, Mr. Fish said the Games would be “good for Boston and will create thousands of jobs, drive economic development and serve as a catalyst for the long-term plans of Boston.” He said Boston 2024 was backing a vote because it was “committed to the highest level of transparency and accountability.”AdvertisementHolding a vote is a high-risk proposition. Officials at both the United States Olympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee have strong aversions to ballot measures because they can amount to highly public rejections of something they hope to depict as prestigious. In these officials’ eyes, an unfavorable vote in Boston would be a public-relations catastrophe.But the United States Olympic Committee told Mr. Fish in advance of his announcement that it supported the referendum.AdvertisementPatrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the Olympic committee, said in a statement: “We believe that Boston can and should lead America’s bid to host the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Great achievements are often preceded by great skepticism. The vision for these Games is sound, and they would be a powerful catalyst for growth and progress in Massachusetts. But that vision must be shared by the citizens, and for that reason we fully support the notion of a referendum.” The about-face by Boston 2024 reflects the bruising that it has taken since the United States Olympic Committee surprised the country in January by picking Boston as its bid city for the Games.It is the latest sign that Boston 2024 is engaged in a full-fledged political campaign. After the release of the latest damaging poll results last week, the group took out newspaper ads Monday pledging transparency. And political operatives connected with Mayor Martin J. Walsh met Tuesday night with neighborhood activists to start organizing grass-roots support. Adding a referendum to the mix, with a vote set for November 2016, when the country elects a new president, completes the picture of an all-out effort determined to change public opinion.Boston 2024 has been criticized for acting in secrecy, neglecting to talk with the landlords of sites it said were secured and insisting it could pay for everything with private money, which few people seemed to believe.The problems were only compounded when Mayor Walsh, an initial skeptic but now a convert who supports the Games, signed an agreement that barred city employees from criticizing the bid. Then it was revealed that Boston 2024 was paying extravagant fees to an ever-expanding group, including $7,500 a day to former Gov. Deval Patrick to act as a “global ambassador” for bringing the Games to Boston. (Subsequently, Mr. Walsh was able to drop the language that said city employees could not criticize the bid, and Mr. Patrick said he would provide his services free.)
                The bid prepared by Boston 2024, a group of business leaders, construction magnates and politicians that was presented to the United States Olympic Committee in December. The committee chose Boston over Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington on Jan. 8.            Meanwhile, the city endured a record snowfall over the winter, bringing about the collapse of the region’s rickety public transit system and making people wonder how Boston could handle Olympic crowds if it could not even get commuters to work.Advertisement“Terrible idea,” former United States Representative Barney Frank said to Boston magazine in a typical response. “If we can’t find a place for snow, where are we going to find a place for the Olympics?”In January, 51 percent of Bostonians supported the bid. In February, support dropped to 44 percent. By last week it had plunged to 36 percent, according to polling by WBUR, the NPR news station here.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Other apparent options include Paris, Rome, and Hamburg, Germany.“They need a reset,” Mr. Payne said of Boston 2024. “They misunderstood that this was really a public endeavor, not a private enterprise. The public sees the Games as something that’s supposed to be good for all of us, not a way to make a quick buck.”A version of this article appears in print on March 25, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Group Seeking Boston Olympics Will Pursue Vote.
