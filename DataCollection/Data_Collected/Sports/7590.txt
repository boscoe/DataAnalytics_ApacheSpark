CreditEve Edelheit for The New York Times        TAMPA, Fla. — At the end of all those baseball showcases in Orange County, Calif., the format would often be the same. Few of the coaches and children who had come together for the day knew one another. The director would stand in front of the players and call out the names of those who had excelled that day: the best fielder, the best arm, the best hitter.The name Robert Refsnyder was called out frequently, and as the Korean-born boy rose to accept his award, the people looked at him almost in bewilderment. The face did not match the name.“Yeah, that’s me,” he would say, laughing to himself. “I’m Rob Refsnyder.”At some point this year, whether in spring training, on opening day or later in the regular season, Refsnyder is likely to be introduced to Yankees fans for the first time, and some of them may look at him with the same bemused expression that the players and coaches at those California showcases wore.Refsnyder is a top Yankees prospect, a gifted hitter who has been invited to his first major league spring training this month and hopes to soon become the team’s starting second baseman. He was adopted from South Korea by parents with German and Irish backgrounds, as was his older sister, Elizabeth, who was a talented softball player in college.AdvertisementIn 2012 Refsnyder was selected out of the University of Arizona in the fifth round of the amateur draft — adopted, in a sense, by the Yankees. He raced through the ranks of the minor league system, batting .297 with a .389 on-base percentage and 508 total bases in two and a half seasons, and now provides hope to fans who have been waiting for the Yankees’ farm system to produce the next Robinson Cano or Brett Gardner.AdvertisementBut equally important, with his growing success he can also provide inspiration to millions of adopted children and adults. Refsnyder says he has always been very comfortable with his adoption, but he knows that life can be challenging for some adopted people, especially during the identity-forming years of adolescence.Adopted children make up roughly 2 percent of the total population under age 18, but 11 percent of all adolescents referred for therapy have been adopted, according to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. Refsnyder points out that no two stories are the same — even he and his sister can have different feelings about their adoptions — and says he has spent little time considering his circumstances.But during Refsnyder’s college career and his brief time in the minor leagues, his adoption story became public, leading adoptees and adoptive parents to reach out to him, seeking advice in letters and emails and telling him of the inspiration he provides.That attention may intensify if he has the kind of success he and the Yankees expect.“It’s not something I am yearning to do,” he said of being a spokesman for adoptees. “But I am happy to do it. I want people to know that it’s O.K. to be different, and I’m going to be as accessible as I can be about it. I have never shied away from it, and if kids want to ask me about it, I’ll talk about it. I might make a joke, but I’ll never hide from being adopted. I’m proud of my family. I play for the name Refsnyder.”Refsnyder was adopted in 1991 when he was a little over 5 months old. He was born in Seoul, South Korea, and given the name Kim Jung-tae. His family does not know the identity of his biological mother; they know only her age and level of education, and Refsnyder harbors no resentment.“I am sure she did what she felt was best for me, to give me the best opportunities in life,” he said. “And I feel so blessed. I love my family and I would do anything for them, just like they have for me.”His mother, Jane Refsnyder, can recall every date of the adoption process off the top of her head. Like pregnant women who keep track of trimesters, ultrasounds and glucose tests, adoptive parents navigate visits with social workers, criminal background checks and submitting financial statements. Sometimes sacrifices are made before they ever meet the children.AdvertisementAfter years of waiting in vain for a domestic adoption, Jane and her husband, Clint Refsnyder, turned to Holt International and were matched with Rob on March 26, 1991. On June 28, after an agonizing delay trying to secure his visa, they obtained an appointment in Los Angeles. At 7:43 that morning, as they waited in a coffee shop in the ground floor of the building, they were jolted by the Sierra Madre earthquake, which measured 5.8 on the Richter scale.As ceiling panels fell around them, the Refsnyders evacuated to the street. Then Jane remembered she had left her briefcase containing the adoption documents in the restaurant. She handed Elizabeth, who was 3, to Clint and, as everyone was streaming past her in the opposite direction, she ran back inside. “There was no way I was going to lose that,” she said.A little over two months later, after a week’s delay because of an upper respiratory illness, Rob finally arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Sept. 5. He came with the Korean nickname Moose, for a burly baby.As the children grew, they exhibited natural athletic ability. Clint, who was 6 feet 8 and played as a forward on the Muhlenberg College basketball team, fostered their sports acumen with spirited games of one-on-one in the driveway and annual Christmas Day trips to see the Los Angeles Lakers in the days of Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As a junior wide receiver and outside linebacker at Laguna Hills High School, he was named player of the year in his conference. His coach asked him to play quarterback for the first time the next year, and the team went undefeated and won a state championship.But it was in the sporting arena that he started to hear occasional barbs, mostly from fans but sometimes from opponents. His parents did not allow him to play football until he was 13, and that year, after a boy tackled him, he yelled down at Rob, “Why don’t you go back where you came from?” Rob replied, “Why don’t you?”Other comments were more innocent. When he was 16, Rob earned a place on a United States Junior Olympic team that traveled to Venezuela for a tournament, and was joined there by his father. Local children, upon seeing Refsnyder, wondered why he was not on the Japanese team. That amused him, but for other reasons, he said, the trip changed his life.“At that age, you’re not thinking about other people so much,” he said. “Kids in Orange County, Calif., are maybe kind of selfish and spoiled. But I saw some real poverty on that trip, kids with one shoe and stuff like that. It changed me forever.”When he got to college and the importance of the games grew, the heckling from the stands intensified. People made racist jokes, he said, and nasty comments about his adoption. Some of it could be laughed off. Some could not.Advertisement“They were saying some terrible things, hurtful things,” he said. “Rude remarks about my race and my parents’ race, saying that adoption is not O.K. They were ignorant, just trying to get inside my head.”Refsnyder said he never had a big sit-down with his parents about being adopted, nor did he feel the need to. He did not even realize he was adopted until, when he was 5 or 6, he asked his sister why they looked different from their parents. Her reply was, “Because we’re adopted, duh.”He said, “Ever since then, I totally accepted it.”Although recent laws and trends have caused a decrease in international adoptions, South Korea has the oldest international adoption program and sent more children overseas than any other country — more than 150,000 — from 1953 to 2006, according to the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. More than 104,000 were adopted by American citizens.In recent years, the South Korean government has taken steps to reduce the number of adoptions to keep biological families together. In 1991, Refsnyder’s was one of about 1,800 adoptions to the United States from South Korea, down from a high of more than 6,000 in 1986, two years before Elizabeth Refsnyder was adopted. In 2013, the number was 138.In Orange County, where the Refsnyders still live, there are many families of Korean background. Countless times, some of those people have told the Refsnyders what a wonderful thing they have done to take in two children, and how lucky the children are to have such loving and supportive parents.“We always say that we are the lucky ones,” Clint Refsnyder said. “My wife and I are so fortunate to have two such wonderful kids.”Sometimes, Refsnyder said, his mother asks if he would like to find his birth mother. Rob’s response is typical of his approach to the subject as a whole: “Sorry, mom, you’re stuck with me.” One day, he said, he hopes for a family trip to South Korea.Recently, Jane recalled the day when Rob was in high school and he cautiously asked if her feelings would be hurt if he decided he wanted to search for his birth mother.“Oh, Robert,” she said she told him. “I’ll go to the ends of the earth with you. And if we ever find her, I’ll be the first to put my arms around her and thank her for the great gift she gave us.”A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Impressing Yanks, and Inspiring Adoptees.
