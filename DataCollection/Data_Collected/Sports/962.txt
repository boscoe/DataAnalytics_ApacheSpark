But that feeling did not last long. He struck out the side on 10 pitches, with his trademark long locks flapping against his shoulders, and strutted back to the dugout with a satisfied look on his face. If he had been a little bit in awe at the start of his first All-Star experience, he no longer was. He belonged, and he knew it.It is with that inner confidence that deGrom will try to propel the Mets past the Los Angeles Dodgers in a winner-take-all N.L.D.S. Game 5 of their first-round division series on Thursday night. To do so, deGrom will probably have to outpitch Zack Greinke, who was the best pitcher in baseball for a chunk of the 2015 season. And deGrom will have to pull off that feat just six days after he outpitched the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw, whose career has been even more brilliant than Greinke’s.It is a daunting assignment for the 27-year-old deGrom, to do something like that twice in such short order, and it is made even more imposing by the fact that last Friday’s game was in Los Angeles and Thursday’s will be, too. The crowd will be against him, for sure.As for his teammates, well, if you were to poll the Mets’ clubhouse, you would find that deGrom is the pitcher they want on the mound on Thursday. There is no debate.“We got our horse going,” said the Mets’ first baseman, Lucas Duda. “I think you have to love it. You got to embrace it.”And the Mets do. With Matt Harvey pitching effectively, but not dominantly, in his return from Tommy John surgery, and with the rookies Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz still learning the nuances of the game, the Mets have come to look to deGrom more and more. He is their ace.And deGrom, in turn, seems to have no problem with that designation. After winning the National League Rookie of the Year Award last year, he elevated his performance this season and recorded the fourth-lowest E.R.A. in the N.L., behind only Greinke, Jake Arrieta and Kershaw.There were a few glitches — some early struggles, some weariness down the stretch — but much of the time deGrom made it look easy.Dan Warthen, the Mets’ pitching coach, credits deGrom’s flowing delivery for some of that success. Because deGrom, listed at 6 feet 4 inches and 180 pounds, is built lean and lanky, his arm acts like a whip. And so, when he fires a 95-mile-per-hour fastball to a hitter, the ball appears that much closer to the plate.“He’s like Big Bird, he’s so long,” Warthen said. “He throws the ball and it’s on you.”DeGrom grew up in rural DeLand, Fla., attended Stetson University and played shortstop in college before finally moving to the mound. The Mets took a flier, drafting him in the ninth round in 2010. Soon after, deGrom tore his ulnar collateral ligament and had to have Tommy John surgery.Perhaps deGrom knows how lucky he is to even be pitching now: Even after losses, he cannot help but smile a little while addressing reporters. In the off-season, deGrom, who is now married, still lives near his parents in DeLand, the place he grew up riding horses and fishing. He still gets his hair cut by his older sister in his parents’ kitchen, and he still prepares for spring training by playing catch with his father.Was that Eddie Vedder on the field at Wrigley when the Cubs won their division series earlier this week? This year’s playoffs have given baseball teams a chance to show off their own star fans.His warm-up song, “Simple Man,” by Lynyrd Skynyrd, befits him in a complimentary way.“Jacob is a ‘what you see is what you get’ kind of guy,” his agent, Brodie Van Wagenen, said this year. “He’s humble. He’s workmanlike. This may come off the wrong way, but he’s sweet. He’s a good kid.”DeGrom goes about his work quietly, earning him respect within the clubhouse. He seems able to hold a conversation with a veteran like Kelly Johnson, who is six years older than him, just as easily as he can with the starting pitchers closer to him in age.And when deGrom does speak up, he does not appear to take himself too seriously, either. Before one game, he tried to bait reporters into falling for a corny joke.“Smells like updog in here,” deGrom kept saying, pacing the dugout.After Game 1 of the division series, he took a seat at the dais for the postgame news conference and slyly lowered Daniel Murphy’s chair, causing it to drop and startle Murphy.“Yowzers!” Murphy exclaimed.Murphy looked down at his chair and then up at deGrom a little incredulously, as if he had been surprised that one of the best pitchers in baseball had the gall to play a practical joke in a room full of reporters from around the country. Murphy adjusted himself in the chair and tried to regain his bearings as he was asked another question.“This is messed up, Jake,” Murphy whispered to him.And deGrom just covered his mouth and lowered his head, trying to hide his smile.Comfortable with himself, and confident, and not inclined to make things too complicated, he looks ready to try to grab hold of Game 5. And perhaps he can.Advertisement
