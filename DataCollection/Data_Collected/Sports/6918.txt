CreditLaura Leon for The New York Times        ESTEPONA, Spain — F.C. Basel, the best soccer team in Switzerland, went to work one recent day on a glistening grass field set among chunky dirt mounds, overgrown vegetation and the construction site for what appeared to be a new Burger King.The circumstances seemed a bit incongruous: Basel, which leads the Swiss Super League standings, was preparing for a UEFA Champions League match, yet it was about 1,000 miles from home. On this particular afternoon, the team’s training consisted of a casual exhibition match on an unlikely field against a second-division team from Germany.“When you say it this way, O.K., it sounds strange,” Basel goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik said, laughing.In truth, Basel’s circumstances were not unusual. They were simply the consequence of European soccer’s annual winter break, an amorphous and much-debated concept that involves the shutting down of some of the major leagues around the continent for some of the coldest months. Basel and dozens of other teams have traveled to Spain’s southern coast this winter. Other clubs from Central Europe have sought green grass and warmer temperatures in Turkey or the Middle East. At least two have traveled to Florida.AdvertisementThe purpose of the break is obvious. Playing soccer on frozen fields or in snow is difficult, and asking fans to spend money to watch it is not necessarily an attractive proposition. Because most European countries adhere to the long-established fall-to-spring model for their seasons, navigating the bleakest part of winter — in part by organizing training camps in warm-weather destinations to keep players sharp — simply comes with the territory for many clubs.“I went home to Barcelona for Christmas and spent time with my family, eating soup and rabbit and all the traditional foods,” said Marc Torrejón, a defender for the German club S.C. Freiburg, which held its camp in nearby Sotogrande. “Then I came to Costa del Sol and got focused on football. It was perfect — a break, a rest, and then time to get going again.”AdvertisementThe length of the gap between games varies from league to league. The English leagues are famous (or infamous) for having no break — a frequent topic of debate — and Switzerland’s league generally has the longest layoff in Western Europe, with this winter’s hiatus stretching 62 days. Of the so-called Big 5 leagues in Europe (England, Germany, Spain, Italy and France), Germany takes the longest rest. This season, play in the Bundesliga stopped on Dec. 21 and will not resume until Friday. Italy’s Serie A and Spain’s Liga took two-week breaks.In years when a major international tournament is held during the summer, some argue that such a built-in respite for players can be invaluable.“Coaches in England always bring up that subject,” Uli Hesse, a German author who has written extensively on soccer, said in an interview.“They say German teams have an advantage because of the winter break, and you see it in the players’ legs in summer. Obviously, England has no break, and so a connection to the national team’s results is easy to make.”Depending on a team’s size and global appeal, the winter break can be more about moneymaking and marketing than anything else.Bayern Munich, which, like Basel, will return to Champions League play in February, flew 2,675 miles to train in Doha, Qatar, on a trip that was as much about business as about soccer. Real Madrid spent part of its short Christmas break in Dubai, where it lost an exhibition match against A.C. Milan. Hoffenheim was one of two German clubs increasing the Bundesliga’s visibility in South Africa — 10 hours away by plane — and did so with the blessing, and financial assistance, of the German soccer federation.AdvertisementMost clubs, though, are simply looking for some sun and the opportunity to knock off any rust that may have formed on their players during the holidays. In many cases, cost is also a factor. Freiburg, which is in last place in the Bundesliga, flew to Spain on a commercial flight operated by the discount carrier EasyJet and is staying in the relative quiet of a golf resort about an hour’s drive from Marbella.“We could have gone to Belek,” Jochen Saier, Freiburg’s sporting director, said, referring to a Turkish destination popular with many clubs. “But there are so many teams there, and it is so crowded. Coming here is better from a cost perspective and gives us a chance to work on things without many distractions.”Freiburg was among about 70 clubs training on Spain’s southern coast, where regional officials hired an organizing company, Football Impact, to help coordinate the camps. Football Impact arranged friendly matches at a variety of fields and hosted many of the clubs, including Basel, at Marbella Football Center, a sprawling complex in the shadow of mountains and only a short drive from the Mediterranean.The Marbella center has four full-size fields and four smaller training fields, and it offers locker rooms, weight rooms and laundry services to teams that buy package deals that cost 90 euros to 150 euros per player per day (about $100 to $175). The cost varies mostly based on the level of the hotel the club chooses, said Gaston Iglesias, a communications executive with Football Impact.In January, most of the clubs are from Western Europe. In February, many East European and Scandinavian clubs arrive, either to reboot after longer breaks (Russia’s winter hiatus lasts three months) or to begin preseason training for leagues with spring-to-fall schedules.Basel stayed in Marbella from Jan. 11 until last Wednesday, going through intense workouts that Coach Paulo Sousa described as critical to the team’s success in the second half of its season. Just 10 days after it restarts its schedule, Basel will face Porto in the first leg of the Champions League Round of 16, a daunting challenge. Porto, from the Portuguese league, will have played 10 competitive games in 2015 at that point. Basel will have played two.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Vaclik, the Basel goalkeeper, said he wished there could be a standard break across Europe. In the absence of one, he and his team have little choice but to prepare for an in-form opponent when they face Porto.Fortunately, he has some experience. In 2013, Vaclik was a member of Sparta Prague when that club spent more than two months idle while waiting to play Chelsea, of England, in the Europa League knockout rounds.Vaclik described “a feeling in your stomach that is there for all of the holidays,” but he said he was proud that Sparta lost to Chelsea by only 1-0.“It was a long wait,” he said. “But what choice did we have? It is the same now. We wait. We train. And then we play.”A version of this article appears in print on January 25, 2015, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Winter, It’s Time for a Stoppage.
