 Friday 7 Baylor at 15 Texas Christian7:30 p.m., ESPNLast season, these two teams shared the Big 12 title, but both were left out of the College Football Playoff. As a result, this year’s game was one of the most eagerly awaited of the season, with a conference title and a possible playoff spot expected to be on the line. It has not worked out. Both teams are banged up, T.C.U. (9-2) is reduced to playing spoiler, and Baylor (9-1) needs help to win the conference. The Bears have to win their final two games and hope that Oklahoma loses to Oklahoma State on Saturday.Baylor will be looking to its third-string quarterback, Chris Johnson, who began the season as a receiver after being beaten out by Jarrett Stidham as the backup. Now Stidham is out, and Johnson will be making his first start. Last week, Johnson looked good when he came in for Stidham. He threw for two touchdowns and ran for another as the Bears handed Oklahoma State its first loss.T.C.U. started the season with a rash of injuries on defense and leaned on its offense to help them keep winning. Now the injuries are piling up on offense, and the Horned Frogs find themselves eliminated from the conference race. Quarterback Trevone Boykin (also a former receiver) has not played in two weeks, but he might be able to go in this one. Last week, T.C.U. put up a valiant effort against Oklahoma but failed on a 2-point conversion that would have won the game. The play of running back Aaron Green was key in keeping it close. Although the stakes are not as high as expected, this rivalry dates to 1899 and ought to be entertaining.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            3 Iowa at Nebraska3:30 p.m., ABCSay what you will about Iowa’s credentials, but all the Hawkeyes do is win. Have they played the best schedule? No, but they beat Pittsburgh and won at Wisconsin and at Northwestern. They do not play Ohio State, Michigan or Michigan State, but they have clinched the Big Ten West and will play one of those three teams in the championship game.AdvertisementBefore that, they need to take care of business on the road against Nebraska. The Cornhuskers (5-6), who are coming off a bye week, upset Michigan State before defeating Rutgers. The Hawkeyes (11-0) cracked the top four in the playoff rankings but are only 2-point favorites against the Cornhuskers. This Black Friday rivalry has been a good one, and this year, the stakes are particularly high. If the Hawkeyes can win their next two games, they are all but assured a spot in the national semifinals. Lose either one, and they are out. 16 Navy at 21 HoustonNoon, ABCThe American Athletic Conference’s West Division title and the inside track to a New Year’s Day bowl game are on the line. Navy (9-1) has been one of the better stories of the season, and its quarterback Keenan Reynolds is making a push for the Heisman Trophy as he finishes his record-setting career. Reynolds is Navy’s career rushing leader, and he owns the N.C.A.A. record for career rushing touchdowns. He is one touchdown away from the total touchdown record. Houston suffered its first defeat of the year last week when the Cougars were upset by Connecticut. Cougars quarterback Greg Ward Jr., who has had a spectacular season, sat out much of that game and is still bothered by an ankle injury. The winner of this game gets home-field advantage for the conference title game on Dec. 5.AdvertisementFRED BIERMANA version of this article appears in print on November 27, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Games to Watch.
