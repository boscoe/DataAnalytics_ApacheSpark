In the first four days of the 2015 Winnebago lake system spearing season in Wisconsin, his friends and family caught and registered three.Then it was his turn.He spotted the giant fish through the hole in the ice and grabbed his five-prong spear. After propelling it through the water, Krueger, 48, was shaking, realizing his throw was accurate and the spear in place. Later, the sturgeon was measured to be 71.5 inches and 89 pounds.About 13,000 licenses were sold for the spearing season this year, from Feb. 14 to 21. The 1,870 fish taken from Lake Winnebago made it the sixth highest harvest on record.“Sturgeons have been around for 150 million years,” said Ryan Koenigs, a Winnebago sturgeon biologist for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. “They’re a prehistoric fish and were literally swimming around in rivers and lakes when dinosaurs were here.”AdvertisementKoenigs emphasized the importance his department placed on regulating and controlling the annual take. “This is probably one of the more heavily regulated fisheries in North America in terms of the mandatory harvest cap system in place,” he said. “The harvest caps are set for sustainability — they’re not taking out more than what can be supported.”AdvertisementSturgeon are native to the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River drainage basin, and spearfisheries exist at Winnebago and Black Lake in Michigan. Michigan’s 2015 season, which was limited to five sturgeon, was over in less than six hours. Wisconsin registered 2,158 speared sturgeon this season, including 288 from the Upriver Lakes.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

This year, the fish were found to be leaner because of a lack of gizzard shad. The largest sturgeon speared this season weighed 137 pounds; the largest in previous years was 212 pounds, in 2012.“The whole sport brings families together,” Kendall Kamke, a senior fisheries biologist, said. “The fish is the catalyst of what is a more ethereal event. Nowhere else in the world has this. It’s a sport that is passed down from generation to generation.”Don Burg, 81, has not missed a season in 72 years. When he started, in 1944, there were 30 shanties, and five tags could be bought for a quarter.According to Koenigs, the season attracts people from Canada, and last year, license holders traveled from roughly 20 states.“The economic importance of the fishery as a whole during the average nine-day season contributes $3.5 million to the local economy,” Koenig added. “It’s a unique opportunity and a unique season.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
