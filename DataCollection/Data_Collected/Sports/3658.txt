Fantasy football analysis for Thursday’s three games. Check back Friday for analysis of Sunday’s games and Monday’s matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns. You can also follow the Sablich brothers on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy.12:30 p.m. Eastern time, FoxLine: Eagles by 1 Quarterback Matthew Stafford (DET) — After two of his best performances of the season, Stafford has the fortune of playing a reeling Eagles defense that has allowed 10 passing touchdowns over the past three games, including five last weekend to Tampa Bay’s Jameis Winston.Mark Sanchez (PHI) — At the time of writing, it’s unclear whether Sanchez or Sam Bradford will be the starting quarterback for the Eagles. The Lions have been giving fantasy points out to quarterbacks like they’re going out of style, to everyone not named Derek Carr (19 F.P.P.G., sixth most). Even so, it’s difficult to trust either Eagles quarterback no matter the matchup.Running Back DeMarco Murray/Ryan Mathews (PHI) — While the Lions’ run defense has performed better of late, this is still a favorable matchup at 21.3 F.P.P.G. (eighth most). Murray, who is ninth among backs in total fantasy points and fifth in receptions (39), is a solid RB1, especially with Mathews out with a concussion.Advertisement Theo Riddick (DET) — His seven carries in Week 6 was a season high, but he has done damage in the passing game and leads all backs with 62 targets (tied with Devonta Freeman) and 50 receptions. He’s an RB3 with lots of upside in P.P.R. leagues.AdvertisementWide Receiver Jordan Matthews (PHI) — The Lions haven’t allowed more than 10 fantasy points to a receiver since the Vikings’ Stefon Diggs in Week 7 (17.1). Outside of his 19.3-point performance in Week 9, Matthews has averaged only 3.6 F.P.P.G. over the last eight games. Given this and the messy quarterback situation, he is now an WR3 fantasy play.Calvin Johnson/Golden Tate (DET) — The Eagles have allowed a receiver to top 10 fantasy points in every game this season, and over all are tied for the most-favorable receiver matchup (28.7). Johnson is set up for a big week, while Tate is in the WR3 conversation.4:30 p.m., CBSLine: Panthers by 1Quarterback Tony Romo (DAL) — He showed some expected rust in his return last weekend, but improved as the game progressed and finished with 227 yards and two touchdowns. The Panthers are fantasy’s third-toughest quarterback matchup, but Romo usually delivers on Thanksgiving (minus last year’s downer). Start him as a QB1 but have reasonable expectations. Cam Newton (CAR) — After a career-high five touchdown passes in Week 11, Newton is an obvious start against Dallas, although the Cowboys haven’t allowed more than two touchdown passes in a game to a quarterback this season and over all are the sixth-toughest matchup (15 F.P.P.G.).Running Back Darren McFadden (DAL) — Carolina’s eighth-ranked run defense has allowed only one 100-yard rusher this season (Doug Martin, Week 4). If the Cowboys can keep the game close, McFadden (129 yards on 29 carries in Week 11) is an RB1 based on his volume of carries alone.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Jonathan Stewart (CAR) — He has at least 10 fantasy points in five of his last six games and is a solid RB1 in a favorable matchup with the Cowboys (21.5 F.P.P.G., seventh most).Wide Receiver Dez Bryant (DAL) — According to Panthers Coach Ron Rivera, Bryant will most likely be covered by cornerback Josh Norman, currently rated by ProFootballFocus.com as the top CB in the league. Something to keep in mind, but with Romo at quarterback, Bryant is always an WR1.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

It’s hard to justify starting him unless you’re desperate in P.P.R. formats.AdvertisementTight End Jason Witten (DAL) — Romo’s return did little for Witten, who saw only three targets and finished with two catches for 27 yards. We would be surprised if Romo didn’t look Witten’s way more going forward, and the Panthers have allowed some success to the position, so he’s still a low-end TE1.Greg Olsen (CAR) — One would think Olsen would have benefited more (54 yards, 1 TD) from Newton’s five-touchdown performance, seeing that he leads the team, and all tight ends in the league, in targets (83). That volume will keep him a high-end TE play.8:30 p.m., NBCLine: Packers by 9Quarterback Aaron Rodgers (GB) — He has been steady all season, outside of Week 8 in Denver (6.2 fantasy points), and he threw three touchdown passes against the Bears in Week 1. Chicago’s fourth-ranked pass defense may be as stout as it looks on paper. The Bears’ 19 passing touchdowns allowed is the sixth most in the league, and the Denver backup Brock Osweiler managed 250 yards and two touchdowns last weekend.Jay Cutler (CHI) — Cutler managed 14.1 fantasy points in Week 1 with his top target, Alshon Jeffery, playing. If Jeffrey (groin, shoulder) can’t play, Cutler is no better than a low-end QB2, which means you probably shouldn’t use him.Running Back Matt Forte (CHI) — He is expected to return after missing the last three games with a knee injury. He had one of his best fantasy performances of the season in Week 1’s matchup (166 total yards, 1 TD), but he could very well lose a few carries to Jeremy Langford as he eases his way back. He is more of a high-end RB2 this week.Eddie Lacy (GB) — The Bears are a beatable run defense that allowed 85 yards and a touchdown to Lacy back when Lacy was considered one of the best backs in the league (Week 1). His stock has tumbled since, but he did have his first 100-yard rushing performance of the season on 22 carries last weekend. James Starks is still around, but Lacy appears to have returned to being the team’s top rusher and is a solid RB2 this week. Wide Receiver Alshon Jeffery (CHI) — There is hope he can play, but we may not know until shortly before game time. He was targeted 11 times and ended up with 78 scoreless yards in Week 1. Marquess Wilson had 102 receiving yards on four catches last weekend in Jeffery’s absence.Randall Cobb/James Jones (GB) — Nine targets led to two receptions for 24 yards for Cobb. His fantasy day was saved by a touchdown. He is becoming harder to trust, but he sees too many targets not to be considered a high-end WR2. Jones had two touchdowns against the Bears in Week 1 and turned 11 targets into 109 yards and a touchdown last weekend. He’s a solid WR3 who the Giants still wish they hadn’t cut.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
