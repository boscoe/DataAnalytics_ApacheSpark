Jake Arrieta and Dallas Keuchel reported to spring training in February with a combined career record of 55-59 and zero appearances on Cy Young Award ballots. By the end of the season they were certified aces, lifting their teams to the division series with shutout pitching in the wild-card games.On Wednesday, Arrieta won the National League Cy Young Award, and Keuchel took the honor in the American League. Their breakout seasons mirrored those of their teams, and the baseball writers noticed. Arrieta’s award was the third this week for the Chicago Cubs, and Keuchel’s was the second for the Houston Astros.The Astros’ Carlos Correa was the A.L. rookie of the year, and A. J. Hinch was the runner-up for the Manager of the Year Award. In the N.L., the Cubs’ Kris Bryant was the rookie of the year, and Joe Maddon was named the top manager. The Most Valuable Player Awards — the fourth set of honors given by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America — will be announced Thursday.The Cubs do not have a finalist for the M.V.P. — Washington’s Bryce Harper is the heavy favorite — but Arrieta’s prize made them the first National League team since the 1991 Atlanta Braves to win three BBWAA awards in the same season.“We have tremendous athletes at very young ages,” Arrieta said Wednesday. “We have arms that are going to be around for a while. We’re probably going to make some moves for some others, and that’s only going to strengthen our ball club.”AdvertisementThe 1991 Braves won with Terry Pendleton (M.V.P.), Tom Glavine (Cy Young) and Bobby Cox (manager). They also reached the World Series, a goal that eluded the Cubs, who were swept by the Mets in the N.L. Championship Series. The Astros lost a five-game division series to the Kansas City Royals, who went on to win the World Series.AdvertisementArrieta went 22-6 with a 1.77 E.R.A., finishing with 22 scoreless innings. He allowed only 5.9 hits and 0.4 home runs per nine innings — leading the majors in both categories — and his 0.75 E.R.A. after the All-Star break was the best in baseball history for a pitcher with at least 100 innings.“It’s hard to put in perspective,” Arrieta said. “I see the numbers on TV; people bring it up to me quite a bit. It’s kind of crazy to even think about.”Dallas Keuchel, Houston

Source: MLB.com Keuchel won all 15 of his decisions at home and went 20-8 over all with a 2.48 E.R.A. He led the A.L. in innings pitched (232) and walks plus hits per inning (1.017) and won a Gold Glove. He received 22 of 30 first-place votes, with David Price, who pitched for Detroit and Toronto, collecting the rest. Oakland’s Sonny Gray finished third.The N.L. vote was closer, though not as close as many had expected. Arrieta had 17 first-place votes, with 10 going to the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Zack Greinke and three to Clayton Kershaw, Greinke’s teammate. Greinke had a 1.66 E.R.A., the lowest in the majors in 20 years, and Kershaw had 301 strikeouts, the most in the majors since 2002.Arrieta had a losing record in four seasons with Baltimore before a trade to Chicago in mid-2013. The Cubs encouraged him to use his preferred delivery — across his body — and he has thrived. He is the fifth Cubs pitcher to win the award, after Ferguson Jenkins, Bruce Sutter, Rick Sutcliffe and Greg Maddux.Keuchel — the third Astro to win, after Mike Scott and Roger Clemens — had a similarly rough start to his career. In his first two seasons with the Astros, he was 9-18 with a 5.20 E.R.A. He is not that pitcher anymore.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I really feel like this year was the first time that I can remember that I was able to throw the majority of the pitches where I wanted.”AdvertisementThe Astros radio analyst Steve Sparks, who pitched in the majors for nine years, said Keuchel made his most important adjustment in May 2014, when he changed the angle of his wrist on his slider. The pitch now breaks much later, giving Keuchel another weapon to go with his sinker and changeup, which move the opposite way.“He could do so many things once he perfected that slider,” Sparks said. “That’s what opened everything up for him.”Keuchel’s stuff improved even more this season, changing his profile from a ground-ball pitcher to one also capable of generating lots of strikeouts. He had 216 in the regular season and then fanned seven in six innings at Yankee Stadium in the Astros’ 3-0 wild-card victory.“All last year he was getting better and better — more confident, being more creative with setup pitches,” Sparks said. “And he stays low in the strike zone with his fastball, like three inches below the knees, better than anybody I’ve ever seen.”That late, low movement, and the confidence to match, has lifted Keuchel to the same unlikely spot as Arrieta: the top of his profession for a sudden contender.An article on Thursday about the winners of Major League Baseball’s Cy Young Awards — the Chicago Cubs’ Jake Arrieta and the Houston Astros’ Dallas Keuchel — erroneously attributed a distinction to the 2015 Cubs. They are the first National League team — not the first team — since the 1991 Atlanta Braves to win three Baseball Writers’ Association of America awards in the same season. (The Seattle Mariners won three awards in 2001.)A version of this article appears in print on November 19, 2015, on Page B19 of the New York edition with the headline: Newly Anointed Aces Win Cy Young Awards.
