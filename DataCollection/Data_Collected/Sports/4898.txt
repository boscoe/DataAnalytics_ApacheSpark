That journey begins with a trip to St. Louis to face a team that runs the ball well and always seems to make opposing teams work hard on offense.For Tampa Bay to win this game, it will need Jameis Winston to continue his rapid development as a quarterback while also giving the ball to Doug Martin more often. Martin is second in the N.F.L. with 1,214 rushing yards, but he carried the ball only 11 times on Sunday. The Buccaneers are 0-5 when he has fewer than 15 carries but are 6-2 when he has 15-plus.St. Louis is tied for 21st in the N.F.L. in rushing defense, with an average of 115.9 yards allowed a game, but it has given up just seven rushing touchdowns, so when the Buccaneers are in the red zone, they may need Winston to finish off the drive with his arm.This may be the final game in St. Louis for the Rams, who are flirting with the possibility of a move back to Los Angeles. While the Rams were once called the Greatest Show on Turf, they would be leaving as a team with a few solid defensive players, a potential superstar rookie running back in Todd Gurley, and little else.
