The title races in Europe are getting away — Chelsea leads by 7 points in England, Bayern Munich by 10 in Germany, and Juventus by a whopping 14 in Italy — so do yourself a favor and ignore the mediocre slate of league fixtures this week* and expand your horizons. Soccer editor Andrew Das tells you what to watch this week.(*This does not apply to Manchester City at Manchester United on Sunday (11 a.m., NBCSN), which is skip-church, reserve-the-couch, must-see TV.)The United States will play Mexico in a friendly next Wednesday in San Antonio, so get your scouting started early. Two good options: Club America — which fields several potential members of El Tri and one American, defender Ventura Alvarado — hosts Herediano of Costa Rica late Wednesday (10 p.m. EST, Fox Sports 2) in the semifinals of the Concacaf Champions League. Expect it to be spicy; the first leg ended in fights, suspensions and smashed bus windows. And then on Friday, Tijuana — the closest thing to an American outpost in Mexican soccer — plays Queretaro in a Liga MX match (8:45 p.m., ESPN Deportes).The latest renewal of Major League Soccer’s I-95 rivalry is Saturday night, when the Red Bulls visit D.C. United (7 p.m. EST, MSG2) with first place in the East on the line. (That would make New York City F.C. at Philadelphia that afternoon — 4 p.m., YES — the Route 1 Derby then?)Not interested in those? There’s always college basketball tonight, golf this week and baseball everywhere you look.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
