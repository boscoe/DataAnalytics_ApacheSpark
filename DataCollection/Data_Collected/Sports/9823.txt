Using their advantages in size and strength, the Hoyas outmuscled the upstart Eagles. Eastern Washington guard Tyler Harvey, the leading scorer in Division I, had 27 points, but he was scoreless for nearly 10 minutes of the second half as the Hoyas built a 23-point lead. Eastern Washington (26-9), the Big Sky Conference champion, which was making just its second appearance in the N.C.A.A. tournament, cut the deficit to 8 with 52 seconds left before succumbing. Guard D’Vauntes Smith-Rivera, who did much of the defending against Harvey, led Georgetown with 25 points. Eastern Washington’s Venky Jois had 19. Georgetown (22-10) had lost to a double-digit seed in each of its past five N.C.A.A. tournament appearances since reaching the Final Four in 2007. Georgetown was ousted by No. 10 Davidson in 2008, No. 13 Ohio in 2010, No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth in 2011, No. 11 North Carolina State in 2012 and, most famously, No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast two years ago.The Hoyas will play No. 5 Utah on Saturday for a slot in next week’s round of 16.Advertisement
