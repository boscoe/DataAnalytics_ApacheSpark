8:30 p.m. Eastern, ESPNMatchup to Watch: Giants offensive line vs. Philadelphia pass rushRoughly a year ago, when the Giants last played in Philadelphia — a visit that ended with a 27-0 thrashing by the Eagles — the home team terrorized Giants quarterback Eli Manning, sacking him six times. Philadelphia also sacked Manning’s backup, Ryan Nassib, twice. The Giants’ offensive line this season has been overhauled with a first-round draft pick, a free-agent acquisition and lots of shifting of personnel. No starter on this year’s Giants offensive line played that position for the team a year ago.So far this year, the Giants’ line has done a respectable job protecting Manning, but Monday’s game may be the biggest test yet of the revamped unit’s cohesiveness. Philadelphia can be a loud and confusing place for an offensive line to operate, and the Eagles’ pass rush may also be finally hitting its stride. Last week against New Orleans, Philadelphia sacked Saints quarterback Drew Brees five times.Number to Watch: 3-1That is Chip Kelly’s record against the Giants since he became the Eagles’ head coach. The Eagles defeated the Giants twice last season.Quotation of the Week‘Oh, yeah, they treat you like royalty.’ODELL BECKHAM Jr., Giants wide receiver, when asked if Philadelphia fans treated him well when he made his first career visit to Lincoln Financial Field last season.A version of this article appears in print on October 19, 2015, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Giants at Eagles.
