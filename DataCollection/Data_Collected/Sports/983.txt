8:25 p.m., CBS, NFL NetworkLine: Falcons by 3 ½Atlanta’s 5-0 start makes it seem as if the team has had it easy, but the Falcons have faced a fourth-quarter deficit in four games.The latest hero in the undefeated run is Robert Alford, a third-year cornerback, who intercepted a pass in overtime on Sunday and returned it 59 yards for a touchdown to beat the Washington Redskins.“The game is not over until the clock says zeros,” Alford told reporters. “We’re always going to grind until the end.”The Falcons went 10-22 in the last two seasons but look reborn now that Devonta Freeman has taken over as the team’s starting running back, adding some balance to an offense that had relied too heavily on quarterback Matt Ryan and receiver Julio Jones. Freeman was little known heading into Week 3, but since then, he has rushed for 362 yards and seven touchdowns. For the season, Freeman leads the N.F.L. with 645 all-purpose yards and eight touchdowns.New Orleans is 30th in the league against the run, allowing an average of 135.8 yards a game and 4.5 yards a carry. With Freeman rolling, and running back Tevin Coleman expected to contribute more as his rib injury heals, the Falcons should rumble to a victory regardless of what Ryan and Jones do.Pick: FalconsBENJAMIN HOFFMANA version of this article appears in print on October 15, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Falcons (5-0) at Saints (1-4).
