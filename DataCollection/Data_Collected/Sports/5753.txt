Murray had himself complained of pain in his left shoulder during his 6-2, 6-0 win over Rafael Nadal. Nadal shrugged aside his defeat to beat Wawrinka, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3, in the match for third place, in his first competition since having an appendectomy in November.“I don’t know exactly what happened. I’ve never had anything happen to my left shoulder before,” Murray said. “It’s pretty sore and at the end of the match when I was reaching out to sign autographs it was quite painful.”Murray is set to have a scan before continuing his build-up to the first Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open, at the Hopman Cup in Perth next week.He will join Heather Watson to represent Britain at the mixed team event, with their opening match scheduled against France on Monday.Nadal shrugged aside his defeat against Murray to beat Wawrinka 7-6 (7/1), 6-3 in the match for third place, in his first competition since undergoing an appendectomy at the start of November.The Spaniard and Djokovic are both scheduled to open their official ATP season by playing in next week’s Doha tournament where Nadal is the defending champion.A version of this brief appears in print on January 4, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Title to Murray as Djokovic Withdraws.
