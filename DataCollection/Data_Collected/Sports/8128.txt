On four separate home dates this season, the Yankees will honor four different players, three of whom will have their numbers retired, the team announced Monday.While the team’s future may be unclear, the past remains profitable.On May 24, the Yankees will retire Bernie Williams’s No. 51 and honor him with a plaque in Monument Park. On June 20, Willie Randolph will get a plaque, as well, although his No. 30 will not be retired. Aug. 22 will be Jorge Posada day as his No. 20 is retired, and the next day Andy Pettitte’s No. 46 will be retired and both players will also have plaques in Monument Park.The Yankees are coming off their second consecutive season without making the playoffs. The last time that happened in a nonstrike season was 1992-93. Last year, the Yankees honored Joe Torre, Rich Gossage, Tino Martinez and Paul O’Neill, and also had a day to honor Derek Jeter, who retired after the season.Advertisement
