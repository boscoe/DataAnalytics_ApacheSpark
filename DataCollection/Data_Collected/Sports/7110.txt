LONDON —  Just when it seemed there were no more boundaries to cross in soccer, the game has found a few more.One involves the Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin’s buying a piece of Atlético Madrid via his property company, Dalian Wanda Group. Given that Atlético needs money to sustain its upstart challenge to Real Madrid and Barcelona, it was perhaps only a matter of time before the Spanish club made a connection with a company eager to expand its brand globally.Dalian is paying about $50 million for a 20 percent stake in Atlético, a deal that includes the club’s visiting China on a regular basis and helping young Chinese players gain experience, both at home and in Spain.But if that was intriguing, the second boundary crossed in the past week was grotesquely unwelcome. It came Sunday in Liège, Belgium, when a bunch of hooligans calling themselves the Ultras Inferno 96 reached a new low.AdvertisementThe fans smuggled into the stadium a huge banner that featured a sword-wielding villain, similar to the main character from the “Friday the 13th” movies, holding the severed head of a former Standard Liège player.AdvertisementAfter the killings at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and the apparent beheading of a Japanese hostage by Islamic State militants, this could hardly have been more insensitive or more irresponsible.The Ultras’ banner targeted Steven Defour, a Belgian midfielder who led Standard Liège to two league titles before he was sold to Porto in 2011. Last August, he returned to the Belgian league with Liege’s bitter rival, the Brussels club Anderlecht.Beneath a slogan that proclaimed “Red or Dead“ (red is the color of Standard Liège), was what can only be described as a sick parody, with a character looking like Jason Voorhees of “Friday the 13th” holding a head meant to be Defour’s.Though Standard denounced the banner afterward, it whipped up a charged atmosphere before the match when it announced Defour’s name last, to a chorus of boos, the newspaper Het Nieuwsblad reported.In that atmosphere, where he was being cast as a traitor, Defour lost his composure. He was sent off by the referee for seemingly deliberately kicking the ball at fans in the stands. Standard Liège won the game, 2-0.Immediately following the red card, there was unrest inside the stadium as Anderlecht supporters tore up seats and threw them onto the field.Belgians weren’t shy about sharing their feelings online about the gruesome banner.One messenger was Didier Reynders, the foreign affairs minister, who Tweeted that the act was tasteless, stupid and unacceptable.AdvertisementAnother Tweet, from Yves Leterme, a Standard Liège fan and the Belgian prime minister for a brief time in 2008, said “I remain a supporter but feel ashamed by the banner tonight.”On Monday, officials tried to identify those responsible for the banner, some of whom, like Voorhees, were masked during the game. They faced up to a five-year ban from attending soccer games and a fine of up to 5,000 euros, or about $5,600.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Atlético could proudly boast of its ability to find strikers like Fernando Torres, Sergio Agüero, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa and then sell them on to clubs like Liverpool, Manchester City, Monaco and Chelsea.It was those teams with deep-pocketed foreign owners who were able to acquire Atlético’s ripened stars. Meanwhile, Atlético, shifting a pile of debt that ran in the hundreds of millions of dollars a few years ago, was somehow able to overcome all of its hurdles last season to win the Spanish league — and nearly the Champions League, too.Driven by Coach Diego Simeone, an Argentine who won a league title when he played for the club two decades ago, Atlético continues to defy credibility by turning sow’s ears into silk purses.The Malaysian Vincent Tan owns the Welsh club Cardiff City, while his countryman, the Air Asia chief Tony Fernandes, owns the London club Queens Park Rangers. The Singaporean investor Peter Lim has just taken a controlling stake in Valencia. But Wang has surpassed them all with his stake in a much more prominent club.AdvertisementAs Asia ascends economically, a new ball rolls in soccer, and not just with the English and French clubs bankrolled by Middle Eastern oil money.Real Madrid,regarded as the most valuable team on earth, has sought merchandising and television audiences in the East. Atlético has gone even further by selling a piece of itself.Fifty million is a lot of dollars, although that would barely buy an arm and a leg of Real’s biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale. But Wang’s business skills will no doubt enlighten those in the boardroom at Atlético’s Vicente Calderón Stadium.When the team runs out against Barcelona for the return leg of the Cup on Wednesday night, or against Real on Feb. 7, the name on the front of Atlético jerseys will not be “Dalian.”That space was sold, in 2013, to Azerbaijan. Not to any company, but to the country, which looked to Atlético’s worldwide exposure to publicize its own growing wealth and potential for tourism.But the new deal with Dalian has the potential to be much longer lasting, and include more influence over the way Atlético is run — and perhaps one day affect Chinese soccer as a whole, too.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, in The International New York Times.
