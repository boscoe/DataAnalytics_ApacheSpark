TMZ reported that some Browns starters were pushing for Johnny Manziel to regain the starting position. But players have flatly denied it.“My first take was that it sounded like a story that came from The Onion and not TMZ, not that TMZ’s really a reputable news source with hard-hitting journalism,” Joe Thomas, the team’s left tackle, said at a charity event. “But to me it was just something that was crafted from thin air.”At some point the players might want to reconsider their stance. Josh McCown is old (36) and not very good (76.4 career passer rating). Manziel is young (23) and his big-play abilities as a passer and runner would at least make the team more fun to watch, even if they did not immediately lead to more wins.Pick: ChargersAdvertisement
