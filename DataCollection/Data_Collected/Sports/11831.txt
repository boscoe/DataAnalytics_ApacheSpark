Since SNY went on the air in 2006, Mets viewership has nearly always lagged behind the audiences amassed by the Yankees on YES. This is hardly a revelation: In nearly all of those seasons, the Mets performed poorly while the Yankees won a World Series championship in 2009 and were always at least pretty good.In 2013, Yankees viewership was double that of the Mets. Last year, it was nearly double.But with the Mets on an 11-game winning streak and the Yankees at 9-7 entering Friday, the chasm in their television audiences has narrowed significantly.Through Tuesday, Mets games this season on SNY were drawing an average of 253,339 viewers for each game, up by 47 percent from the same time last season. At YES, Yankees viewership had tumbled by 21 percent, to 267,000.
            The Mets’ ratings on SNY have long lagged behind the Yankees’ on YES. But this year, they’re closer than ever.        500,000 viewersYANKEES400,000300,000METS200,000100,000’07’09’11’13’15*APRIL 23, 2015
The reason for this is fairly obvious: Winning is more attractive than losing. And the Mets, despite injuries to David Wright, Zack Wheeler and Travis d’Arnaud, appear to be on the rise.AdvertisementThe Yankees, however, look nothing like the dynastic team of the 1990s or even the highly competitive one of the last decade. Viewership on YES, which was launched in 2002, regularly exceeded an average of 400,000 a game each season — far more than the Mets’ peak of about 314,000 in 2007 — until dipping to 355,000 in 2012 and tumbling to 244,000 in 2013. YES’s numbers perked up to 288,000 last year, as fans took their final looks at Derek Jeter, even as the team missed the playoffs for the second straight year.Through Tuesday, the most-watched broadcast for either team this season was a Mets game featuring Matt Harvey, who pitched six innings on April 14 in a 6-5 win over Philadelphia. An average of 429,161 watched that game, at least 25,000 more than the Yankees’ viewing peak this season, for their home opener on April 6.AdvertisementViewers will have three ways to watch the Mets-Yankees games at Yankee Stadium this weekend. On Friday night, the game will be shown on Channel 11, YES and the MLB Network. On Saturday afternoon, when Harvey is scheduled to pitch, the game will be carried by SNY, Channel 11 and Fox Sports 1. On Sunday night, ESPN will carry the game exclusively.A version of this article appears in print on April 24, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Winning Viewers Along With Games.
