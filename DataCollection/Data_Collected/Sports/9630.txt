The unanimous vote was shouted down by supporters of the nickname, many of whom wore past and present school uniforms and jackets with the Redskins logo.“All of these years we’ve never used it in a negative way,” Emily Koeppel, a Lancaster High School senior, said after the meeting. “It was never meant to be hurtful.”Numerous high schools and universities throughout the country have dropped the term in recent years, and several Native American groups have begun a campaign to press the N.F.L. to remove it from the Washington franchise.“There is no pride in having schools boycott playing our sports teams,” said Kimberly Nowak, a board member. “There is no pride in winning by forfeit.”The lacrosse boycotts by the Akron, Lake Shore and Niagara Wheatfield districts followed a March 3 public forum in Lancaster that drew more than 100 people on both sides of the issue.Several students said they would continue to wear their Redskins apparel and call themselves Redskins despite the vote by the board to begin a “student-centered” process to develop a new mascot.“This is our school,” said Torie Dombrowski, a student. “We are Redskins.” A spokesman for the Oneida Indian Nation of central New York, which is involved in the N.F.L. campaign, said districts that had replaced their mascots, including one in Cooperstown, had not seen a decline in school spirit.“Not only did the school make a powerful statement to the Native American community that they no longer wanted to use a term that is a dictionary-defined slur against native people,” the spokesman, Joel Barkin, said, “but it made a statement to the kids in that school to be self-aware and have empathy and think about how the actions that you are engaging in affect other people outside of yourself.”In 2001, the United States Commission on Civil Rights called for an end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools, saying the portrayals “encourage biases and prejudices that have a negative effect on contemporary Indian people.”The board member Michael Sage said, “The students in this generation and those to follow need a new tradition.”Advertisement
