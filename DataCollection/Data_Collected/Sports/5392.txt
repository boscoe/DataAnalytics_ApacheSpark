They got their wish, but it did not really help. Some of those fans have now turned to hoping that Coach Jim Tomsula will be fired. Others have called for a change in ownership. A team that was once the epitome of success has bottomed out, and there is little about the current roster or management to suggest that a turnaround is on the way.The Lions are guaranteed a losing record for the third time in four seasons, but their improved play recently at least offers a glimmer of hope for next year.Pick: LionsAdvertisement
