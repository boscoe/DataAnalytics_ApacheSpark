Over all, the Lions are yielding 18.8 F.P.P.G. to the position (eighth most).Matthew Stafford (DET) — Coming off a season-high five touchdown passes against the Eagles, Stafford is now two touchdowns short of the 22 he had in 16 games last season. It gets tougher against the Packers (17 F.P.P.G.), who held Stafford to 242 yards and two touchdowns in Week 10. His better play of late has him as a borderline QB1 play in Week 13.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            Running Back Eddie Lacy (GB) — Dare we say, Lacy is back? He did have his best game of the season in Week 12, with 105 yards on 17 carries and 34 yards and a touchdown on four receptions. It was his second consecutive 100-yard game on the ground, and over all he looked much more explosive than before his groin injury kept him out against the Lions in Week 10. He has earned his way back into the RB1 conversation this week against Detroit (20.1 F.P.P.G., eighth most).AdvertisementAmeer Abdullah/Theo Riddick (DET) — Abdullah had a career-high 16 carries on Thanksgiving and has not fumbled in his last five games, which has given him an edge in this crowded backfield. That said, he is barely worth a flex play against a Packers team that held all Lions backs to 33 yards and no scores in Week 10. Riddick, with at least five receptions in three of his last four games, remains a P.P.R. flex play.Wide ReceiverCalvin Johnson/Golden Tate (DET) — The last touchdown scored by an opposing receiver against the Packers was by the Lions’ Lance Moore in Week 10. Johnson, who caught six passes for 81 yards that week, is coming off his best fantasy performance since Week 1 of 2014 (8/93/3; 27.3 points).AdvertisementRandall Cobb/Davante Adams (GB) — Rodgers targeted Adams 21 times in Week 10, which turned into 10 catches for 79 yards, and both Adams and Cobb were left without a touchdown. Play Cobb as a solid WR2 this week with Adams a potential flex play (stronger in P.P.R. formats).We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
