Broncos (7-2) at Bears (4-5)1 p.m. Line: EvenN.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsIn his first three seasons with the Broncos, Brock Osweiler threw a total of 30 passes. Last week, in relief of the injured and awful Peyton Manning, he threw 24 in the second half. And while he did not exactly resemble the Manning of 2013, he was a lot better than the Manning of 2015.Signs point to the Broncos suffering a third consecutive loss, but it is worth remembering that they won many of their games earlier this season despite Manning, not because of him. Their defense, led by Brandon Marshall, Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware (should he return from a back injury), is among the best in the N.F.L., and if Osweiler can find a way to get the ball to Demaryius Thomas, Emmanuel Sanders and Vernon Davis, they know how to get it into the end zone.PICK: BroncosWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page.
