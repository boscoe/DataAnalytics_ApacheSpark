CHAPEL HILL, N.C. —  On senior night for North Carolina, it was the Duke freshman Tyus Jones who led the No. 3 Blue Devils to a season sweep of the No. 19 Tar Heels.Jones, who scored 22 points in Duke’s 92-90 overtime win against the Tar Heels in February, poured in 24 more on Saturday night to power the Blue Devils’ 84-77 victory at the Dean E. Smith Center. He scored 17 of his points in the second half and made all 12 of his free throws.“Tyus is outstanding,” Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “He’s a big-time player.”The senior guard Quinn Cook added 20 points for Duke (28-3, 15-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), and the freshman center Jahlil Okafor scored 14.The Tar Heels (21-10, 11-7), buoyed by a buzzing crowd and the junior forward Brice Johnson’s 11 first-half points, led by 33-31 at halftime after recovering from a 10-point deficit. Marcus Paige, a preseason all-American who scored only 5 points in the teams’ past meeting, made five of nine 3-point attempts and scored 23 points Saturday.But after Duke retook the lead with 11 minutes 53 seconds left in the second half, Jones and Cook hit back-to-back 3-pointers with a little more than six minutes left to push the Blue Devils’ lead to 9. Duke did not trail for the rest of the game.For the second straight time, the teams shared a moment of pregame respect amid their rivalry as North Carolina honored Krzyzewski for reaching 1,000 career wins. In the previous game, the teams honored Dean Smith, a former Tar Heels coach who died last month.A version of this article appears in print on March 8, 2015, on Page SP11 of the New York edition with the headline: Freshman Guard Leads Duke to a Sweep of North Carolina.
