A 4-0 series triumph leaves no doubt about the better team and seems to underline the winner’s greatness.With their victory over the Cubs on Wednesday night, the Mets became the eighth team to sweep a league championship series since the L.C.S. expanded to seven games in 1985.Those sweeps — 13 percent of all series — were accomplished with little trouble. The winning teams all scored 18 to 22 runs in the four games; the losers never managed more than 12.The most tightly contested sweep came last year, when the Royals whitewashed the Orioles but outscored them by only 18-12. The most crushing victory was in 1990. Mark McGwire hit .154, Jose Canseco hit .182 and the Athletics did not hit a homer. But they still outscored the Red Sox, 20-4, and went on to be heavily favored over the Reds in the World Series.Two of the sweeping teams, the 2014 Royals and the 2007 Rockies, had swept division series as well and were 7-0 heading into the World Series.Before Mets fans become too complacent about the coming series, they should be warned. This powerful set of teams did not carry good form to the next round. Only one of the seven previous sweeping teams won the World Series, the 1995 Braves. The others fell short, and three of them were swept themselves.The 2012 Tigers managed six runs in four games against the Giants and could not stop Pablo Sandoval from hitting three homers. The 7-0 Rockies of 2007 were beaten by the Red Sox, 13-1, in the opener and never recovered.And the mighty 1990 A’s, winners of 103 regular-season games, could not solve Jose Rijo and the Reds’ pitching staff and went down in one of the biggest World Series upsets.Of course, a team that sweeps a league championship series has a longer layoff before the World Series than its opponent, which can affect momentum.L.C.S.
