HOUSTON —  For the last two months, Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski has issued his team a daily reminder. Eight is enough, he tells the Blue Devils.That is how many scholarship players they have, and that is who they will win with — have won with.“We truly do believe it,” forward Amile Jefferson said after top-seeded Duke outlasted No. 5 Utah, 63-57, on Friday in a South Regional semifinal, the Blue Devils’ 15th victory in 16 games since Krzyzewski scrawled the numeral 8 on a board inside the team’s locker room at Cameron Indoor Stadium.The mantra stabilized them after Rasheed Sulaimon was kicked off the team. It motivated them before a daunting conference game at Virginia. It defined them heading into the N.C.A.A. tournament, which Duke has used to showcase a rotation that, thin or not, is loaded with size and skill and savvy.AdvertisementAfter all, among those eight scholarship players are Justise Winslow, a freshman swingman who delighted his hometown crowd with dunks and 3-pointers and blocks. One of those blocks came after a missed alley-oop, when he ran the length of the floor to thwart Delon Wright.Advertisement“When he’s playing like that, we’re a different team,” guard Matt Jones said of Winslow.He added: “He fills a void on our team that no guy can really fill. He’s like the hub of the team.”And the freshman guard Tyus Jones, thriving alongside the senior Quinn Cook, who scored two early baskets in the second half to build the Blue Devils’ lead.And the freshman center Jahlil Okafor, who, despite being held to fewer than 10 points (6) for only the second time all season, proved a boon with his presence and passing.“It wasn’t too much of a challenge,” Okafor said. “They double-teamed me, and my teammates made them play.”The last time Duke (32-4) played here, in a regional in 2010, it won the title. It can advance to another Final Four if, on Sunday, it can topple second-seeded Gonzaga, which thrashed U.C.L.A.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Seeking its first regional final appearance since 1998, Utah (26-9) whittled a 15-point second-half lead to 5 but could not recover from an uncharacteristically poor shooting performance. Aside from the reserves Dallin Bachynski and Brekkott Chapman, who combined for 17 points on 6 of 11 shooting, the rest of the team shot 30.6 percent (15 of 49).When asked Thursday whether Wright, the star point guard, center Jakob Poeltl or someone else entirely presented the greatest challenge, Krzyzewski offered a one-word response.Advertisement“Yes,” he said.As if to say, everyone, though Duke was perhaps most wary of Wright, who leads the Utes in scoring, assists and steals. Wright struggled, scoring all of 10 points.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He restored it to prominence, to its most victories in a decade and a berth in the Round of 16, where the ultimate barometer of this rebuilding project awaited: Duke. To become a power again, the Utes needed to beat a power.The game’s early stages were sloppy — shots bricked, passes missed, bodies flying, discombobulated chaos. By the first television timeout, nearly six minutes in, Duke and Utah had combined for two field goals. On 17 attempts.When they shot, players saw a black backdrop beyond each basket, a vastness familiar in football stadiums hosting tournament games but not in their own arenas. The imprecision hurt Utah, which missed its first nine shots — and 16 of 19 — but not as much, perhaps, as the foul whistled on Wright, his third, with 4 minutes 59 seconds remaining before halftime.The call on Wright, for wrangling for a loose ball in a scrum with Winslow, sent Krystkowiak into a snarling tizzy and left the Utes without their best player for the rest of the half.Utah committed turnovers on three straight possessions. Duke scored on four straight possessions, stretching its lead to 10 and taking a 27-22 lead into halftime.Winslow made two 3-pointers within 55 seconds, leading a 14-2 run that extended Duke’s lead to 49-34 with 8:41 left.Even though the Utes drew closer, they never posed a serious threat, and now Duke is one of eight teams remaining in the tournament. For a team with championship aspirations and expectations, though, being one of the last eight is most certainly not enough.A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Duke’s Core of 8 Reaches Round of 8.
