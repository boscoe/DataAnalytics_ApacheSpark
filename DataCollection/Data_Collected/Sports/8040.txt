As famous for his wagging finger and charitable work as he was for his play on the court, Dikembe Mutombo, a four-time N.B.A. defensive player of the year, headlined a list of 12 finalists announced Saturday for induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.Mutombo, an eight-time All-Star, is second on the N.B.A.’s career blocks list, with 3,289. He also recorded 11,729 points and 12,359 rebounds.The players joining Mutombo on the ballot are Tim Hardaway, Kevin Johnson, Spencer Haywood and Jo Jo White. Coaches John Calipari, Bill Fitch, Robert Hughes and Bo Ryan and the referee Dick Bavetta round out the men’s ballot.The women’s screening committee nominated Lisa Leslie, a three-time W.N.B.A. most valuable player, and Leta Andrews, a high school coach in Texas for more than 50 years, who holds the record for victories among high school coaches, male or female.To gain induction, finalists need 18 of 24 votes from the honors committee; the class of 2015 will be announced April 6.Louie Dampier, John Isaacs, Lindsay Gaze, Tom Heinsohn and George Raveling, who were directly elected through various Hall of Fame committees, will join the players elected at an induction ceremony in September.A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2015, on Page SP11 of the New York edition with the headline: Mutombo on Hall Ballot.
