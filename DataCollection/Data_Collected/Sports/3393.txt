Week 11 scores and highlightsEagles wideouts Riley Cooper and Miles Austin have combined for 23 catches, six fewer than their teammate Darren Sproles, a running back who does not start. But despite their limited roles in an offense focused on short throws to running backs and tight ends, Cooper and Austin still represent the Eagles’ best options for stretching the field. It would be odd to suggest that quarterback Mark Sanchez could make a team’s offense more dynamic, but since Sam Bradford has basically abandoned any wide receiver not named Jordan Matthews, his shoulder injury could open things up for Philadelphia.PICK: EaglesAdvertisement
