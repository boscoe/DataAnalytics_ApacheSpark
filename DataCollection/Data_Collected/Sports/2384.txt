Tip No. 1 for any marathoner is to simulate raceday as much as possible in training. Wear the same shoes and clothes you plan to wear in the marathon, drink the same fluids and run in the same weather conditions, if possible.If you are preparing for the New York City Marathon, however, there is one thing you cannot simulate in your training: running in a crowd of 50,000 people on the streets of New York.When those 50,000 runners come together on Nov. 1 at the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, they will have taken many routes to get there. What does your marathon training look like? As you log miles on roads, trails, treadmills and tracks, we want to see it. Do you run early in the morning with a group of fellow marathoners, or train in the evening on quiet suburban streets? Are you always exploring new routes, or do you have a few tried and true paths that keep you on track? Send us what you see on your training runs. Please show us your view, not your face, your feet or your watch.Share your photos and see other runners' routines on Instagram by searching #NYTMarathon.Advertisement
