Saturday, at Wisconsin’s off-day news conference before the Badgers’ round of 32 game with Oregon, Hayes playfully tested the spelling skills of the stenographer transcribing his words for the news media.For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.“Before I answer that question, I would like to say a few words — cattywampus, onomatopoeia and antidisestablishmentarianism,” he said, and then laughed. He followed up with soliloquy, quandary, zephyr and xylophone. All came out correctly on the transcript.“That wonderful young lady over there does an amazing job of typing words,” he said.Apparently, Hayes based his exercise on inside information. Wisconsin Coach Bo Ryan said he learned Friday that the stenographer uses three words to practice her typing — the three words Hayes called out at the beginning.Hayes said his curiosity about words began with his stepfather reading to him as a boy. “It’s just fun to know words, and you can say certain words that put people in a quandary, and they don’t know what you’re talking about,” Hayes said. “And it makes for more fun, I guess.”Advertisement
