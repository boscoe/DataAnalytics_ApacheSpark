The vote was 51.6 percent against and 48.4 percent in favor.“The I.O.C. of course respects the close vote by the citizens of Hamburg,” Bach said in a statement. “We regret the decision, which should be seen in the light of the very particular and difficult circumstances the referendum was held in.”The vote took place as Germany copes with an influx of migrants and refugees, a situation that Bach said “requires a great effort by German government and society and is causing widespread feelings of uncertainty.”He also said the result might have been influenced by recent doping and corruption scandals in sports. “This is a pity,” Bach said, adding that the I.O.C. applied strict anti-corruption rules.
