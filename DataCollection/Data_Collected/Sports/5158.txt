The players also said Beckham had to be separated by teammates from a group of Panthers players.The Panthers had previously used bats for pregame motivation. The bats are said to be symbolic of home runs, or “taking the wood” to an opponent. But a Carolina spokesman denied that Beckham had been threatened.Advertisement
