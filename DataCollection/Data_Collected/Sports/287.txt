Since his ouster at The Undefeated, Whitlock has been writing columns for ESPN.com and appeared on television. Sports Illustrated reported online that he was leaving and that ESPN would buy out his contract.“We have mutually agreed to part ways, which was Jason’s preference following the shift from his role as editor in chief,” ESPN said in a statement. “Jason is a talented print and television commentator and we wish him success in his next chapter. ESPN remains fully committed to The Undefeated and plans continue toward an official launch.”Whitlock had no comment.Whitlock, a longtime newspaper and online columnist known for writing about race — sometimes divisively, sometimes provocatively — had never managed anything before being asked by John Skipper, the president of ESPN, to run The Undefeated in 2013. The website, which will exist as a home page with links to 19 articles, was still looking for Whitlock’s replacement.Whitlock had an earlier stint with ESPN that ended with his firing in 2006.Advertisement
