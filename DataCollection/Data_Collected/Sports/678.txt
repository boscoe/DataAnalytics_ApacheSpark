Week 5 scores and highlightsIt is never a good sign when a hashtag calling for your firing goes viral. But that is precisely what happened to Eagles Coach Chip Kelly this week when #FireChipKelly took the Internet by storm after a loss to the Redskins. Speculation about Kelly’s future and questions about his competence are running rampant in the news media. The NFL Network analyst Michael Irvin directed a shout-y monologue at Kelly, essentially imploring him to make some changes to his system for the sake of the team’s future, and the Philadelphia-area writer Buzz Bissinger went so far as to call Kelly “a fraud.”“I think he should be fired after the season,” Bissinger said in a radio interview. “I think it’s clear now the gimmick is over and coaches have figured it out.”Not working in Kelly’s favor is the fact that quarterback Drew Brees and the Saints looked as if they might be getting things back on track. Sure, their thrilling overtime win in Week 4 came against a mangled Cowboys team, but this one does not appear to be a lock for the Eagles as much as it seemed to be just a couple of weeks ago.PICK: EAGLESAdvertisement
