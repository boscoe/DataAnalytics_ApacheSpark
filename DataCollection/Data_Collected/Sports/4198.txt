Week 13 scores and highlightsVic Fangio is doing an excellent job of showing the 49ers what they are missing. He was passed over for a chance at the head coach position in San Francisco, but as the defensive coordinator in Chicago, he has built a unit that is short on star power but long on production. The Bears have struggled some against the run, but it is difficult to pass against them. With Carlos Hyde, San Francisco’s starting running back, expected to be out, it will be up to Blaine Gabbert and the 49ers’ passing game to try to get something going against a fantastic coach with something to prove.PICK: BEARSAdvertisement
