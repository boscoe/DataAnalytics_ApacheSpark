ROSE BOWL2 FLORIDA STATE vs. 3 OREGON5 p.m. Eastern, ESPN, Pasadena, Calif.Florida State’s Jameis Winston won the Heisman Trophy and a national championship last season as a redshirt freshman. While Winston has not had the same caliber year, he is still undefeated (27-0) in two seasons and has staged a number of winning, fourth-quarter rallies.While Winston was one of the country’s most recruited players out of high school, Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota did not start until his senior year in high school and received only three scholarship offers. Still, this season, Mariota has been nearly perfect, throwing 38 touchdown passes and only two interceptions on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy and leading the Ducks to the College Football Playoff. He also has big-time speed, having run for 14 touchdowns, but has struggled at times with ball security.Oregon’s star cornerback, Ifo Ekpre-Olomu, a future N.F.L. talent, is sidelined with a knee injury. He will be replaced by the senior Troy Hill, who will have the unenviable task of trying to shut down Rashad Greene. Greene has been superb this season, particularly in those close games.Another great matchup is at the line of scrimmage, where Florida State defensive lineman Mario Edwards Jr. will square off against Oregon left tackle Jake Fisher, considered among the Ducks’ most valuable players. In the two games Fisher missed, the Ducks sustained their only loss (to Arizona) and gave up 12 sacks. Edwards has a team-high 11 tackles for a loss.Florida State (13-0), an underdog by more than a touchdown, is supremely confident and will play the lack-of-respect card. The Ducks (12-1) are out to prove they belong among the nation’s elite teams.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
