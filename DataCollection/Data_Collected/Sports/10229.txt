They were chatting when the Xavier coach appeared.“There’s Chris Mack,” Miller said to Mack, giving his friend, and his opponent for Thursday’s round of 16 game between second-seeded Arizona and No. 6 Xavier, a warm handshake.Miller has been on a reunion tour the past few days, and it is all connected to Xavier. Last week, Arizona played Ohio State, whose coach, Thad Matta, was once an assistant coach with Miller at Miami of Ohio. The two were roommates for a time.Matta became coach at Xavier in 2001 and hired Miller as his top assistant.Miller was promoted to head coach at Xavier when Matta left to take the Ohio State job in 2004. And when Miller left Xavier for Arizona in 2009, the team promoted Mack, one of his assistants.“I’m just so proud of watching Xavier and Chris,” Miller said.Pointing to Xavier’s move to the Big East Conference, and its third trip to the round of 16 under Mack, Miller said the Xavier program “has done nothing but just increase and get better.”One thing that Mack has not yet done, but that both Miller and Matta did, is take Xavier to a regional final. Arizona and Miller stand in the way.The two do not talk to each other much during the season, but they text frequently.“He’s always been a mentor, whether it was when I was working for him, with him, or now that he’s a couple thousand miles away,” Mack said of Miller.“There is not a challenge that I don’t bring to him if I’m struggling with something.”That probably does not apply to Thursday night.Advertisement
