Nascar suspended Matt Kenseth for two races for intentionally wrecking Joey Logano in an act of retaliation that drastically changed the lineup of drivers in the running for the championship. Drivers have been suspended before for on-track actions but typically for only one race, and the policy has not been uniform.Nascar said it punished Kenseth because he had no chance at winning and he intentionally altered the outcome of Sunday’s race. Nascar said it also factored in aspects of safety, as well as “the fact that the new Chase elimination format puts a premium on each and every race.”Joe Gibbs Racing immediately said it would appeal for Kenseth, who was nine laps down at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia when he deliberately drove a dominating Logano into the wall. The crash was payback for a wreck three races ago, which ultimately led to Kenseth’s elimination from Nascar’s playoffs. A victory at Martinsville would have earned Logano a spot in the title-deciding finale on Nov. 22; instead, he is last in the eight-driver field with two races left.A version of this brief appears in print on November 4, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Wreck Gets Kenseth a Two-Race Ban.
