GLENDALE, Ariz. —  To try to win the Super Bowl, New England quarterback Tom Brady and the Patriots first fearlessly, then desperately tested the strength of the Seahawks’ strength — the secondary of the league’s No. 1 defense — the way few have.They threw 50 passes, mostly quick and dinky ones meant to be caught before Seattle’s defensive backs could react. They threw away from the All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman and toward the lesser-known members of the defensive backfield, forced onto the field by injuries and New England’s surgical strategy.The results were scattered, but in the end, it was the Seattle secondary that was tested, and beaten, allowing the Patriots to erase a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit on the way to a 28-24 victory.Entering the fourth quarter, the Patriots trailed by 24-14 and needed yardage and momentum. And New England got them, picking through Seattle’s tired and depleted defensive backs.AdvertisementBrady threw two short touchdown passes in the final eight minutes of the game, including the game-winner against the Seattle reserve cornerback Tharold Simon.AdvertisementSeattle’s secondary arrived with health questions. Safety Earl Thomas (shoulder) and Sherman, the left cornerback (elbow), were hurt in the N.F.C. championship game. Safety Kam Chancellor hurt his knee in practice last week. All three starters were on the injury list before the game.The Seattle Seahawks coach spoke about the interception that cost his team the game.Sherman might have been further distracted by the impending birth of his son, as his girlfriend was in Arizona, due at any time. But the Patriots largely ignored him, preferring to attack the right side of the Seattle defense and cornerback Byron Maxwell.They threw to Sherman’s side mostly in situations in which a receiver had led him away from the action, as when linebacker K. J. Wright was beaten by tight end Rob Gronkowski for a 22-yard second-quarter touchdown. Brady lobbed the ball to the goal line, Wright was a step behind the play, and Sherman and his fellow Legion of Boomers were nowhere in the neighborhood to help.It was lesser-known members of the secondary who had the biggest impact on the game, good and bad, for the Seahawks.Cornerback Jeremy Lane intercepted Brady at the goal line near the end of the first quarter, the game’s first momentum-shifting play.The Patriots had gobbled nearly eight minutes of the quarter with a measured drive that started at their 32-yard line. But on third-and-6 at the Seattle 10, Brady hesitated, leaned away from the coming hit of defensive end Michael Bennett, and threw over the middle toward the goal line.None of his teammates were there. Lane leapt to intercept the pass, then ran away until he was tackled on the sideline by Patriots receiver Julian Edelman. The excitement of the Seahawks and the fans was muted moments later at the sight of Lane leaving the field on a cart, apparently with a broken arm.AdvertisementThat further tested the depth of Seattle’s secondary. Simon entered the game and was beaten twice on New England’s next drive. The first was a third-and-9 play at Seattle’s 35 on which Edelman sprinted away from Simon on a crossing route, caught a pass and sprinted up the field for a 23-yard gain.

Lee/The New York Times        Two plays later, receiver Brandon LaFell ran a quick slant route against Simon, and Brady found him for an 11-yard touchdown pass.Brady was 20 of 27 for 177 yards and two touchdowns in the first half, and it was obvious that the primary matchup in the second half would be Brady against the Seattle secondary.It proved a daunting matchup. In their previous 10 games, the Seahawks had allowed only two passing touchdowns in the second half.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And they did it again when Edelman caught a 3-yard pass against Simon.But the Patriots had found themselves in a fit of desperation because of what happened early in the third quarter.Brady, trailing for the first time and looking for Gronkowski again, was intercepted on New England’s first second-half drive by linebacker Bobby Wagner. Six plays and 50 yards later, the Seahawks had another touchdown and a 24-14 lead.Seattle needed a big play from its secondary but never got it. In the end, it was a little-known New England defensive back — the reserve Malcolm Butler — who made the play of the game, intercepting Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson at the goal line in the final seconds to secure victory.The Seattle secondary could only stand on the sideline and watch. The hopes of the Legion of Boom had fizzled.An article on Feb. 2 about the performance of the Seattle Seahawks’ secondary in the Super Bowl misstated at several points, and in some editions, the surname of the Seahawks player who intercepted a Tom Brady pass and then left with an arm injury. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is Jeremy Lane, not Johnson.A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page D8 of the New York edition with the headline: Primary Strength of the League’s Top Defense Weakens, Then Falls Apart.
