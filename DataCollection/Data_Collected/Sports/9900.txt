SEATTLE —  Gonzaga began the game pressing North Dakota State, and the Bison, the heavy underdogs, passed right through it, getting ahead of Gonzaga’s defenders to sink two 3-pointers. Nearly three minutes into the game, they led by 9-4.Then the Bulldogs, who had flirted with a top seeding throughout the season before settling with No. 2, remembered that they had more talent. They adopted a more conservative defense, keeping the Bison moving the ball seemingly in place. On the other side of the court, they used their mixture of outside shooting and size down low to dominate the Bison, eventually winning, 86-76, in a game that remained close — a shootout by the standards of college basketball in 2015 — thanks to soft defenses and terrific shooting. The teams combined to shoot 53 percent from the field.As usual, Gonzaga’s dominant player was the junior forward Kyle Wiltjer, a Kentucky transfer, who scored 23 points and grabbed eight rebounds. The freshman forward Domantas Sabonis came off the bench to lead the team with 11 rebounds. The senior point guard Kevin Pangos never left the court, scoring 18 points, dishing out five assists and hitting a key 3-pointer with less than five minutes left to give Gonzaga an 11-point lead that did not get smaller until the very end, when it was too late.The Bison’s leading scorers were the freshman forward Dexter Werner, with 22, and the senior guard Lawrence Alexander, with 19.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
