Giants tight end Daniel Fells remains hospitalized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, the infection that ended his season last week, and doctors have turned to a number of antibiotic treatments in an urgent attempt to curb the spread of the infection, people familiar with Fells’s treatment who were not authorized to speak on the record said Sunday.Some of the more recently used medications appear to have helped Fells’s recovery, and NFL Network reported Sunday that doctors were hoping to save Fells’s foot from amputation.Fells’s problems began with injuries to his toe and ankle. More than a week ago, he had a cortisone shot. A couple of days later, Fells’s wife took him to a hospital with a high fever. Doctors diagnosed a MRSA infection.
Fells, 32, has since had several operations in an attempt to eradicate the infection and speed his recovery. The Giants, who placed Fells on season-ending injured reserve, have described the situation as serious.Advertisement“We are concerned about Daniel Fells, very concerned about that,” Coach Tom Coughlin said last week. “We still do not know the reason for the infection or where it came from.”AdvertisementOn Monday, the Giants scrubbed their locker room, meeting areas and training rooms with disinfectant.Several N.F.L. teams have had MRSA outbreaks. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers had three players who were infected in 2013, including the former Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes. Tynes has retired and is suing the Buccaneers, claiming that unsanitary conditions led to his infection.Fells was considered the Giants’ best blocking tight end. He had six catches for 60 yards.A version of this article appears in print on October 12, 2015, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Giant With Foot Infection Faces an Urgent Situation.
