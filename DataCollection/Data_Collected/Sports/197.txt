He may have a point.Peterson, 30, is at an age when running backs tend to wear down, but after being suspended for 15 games last season, he has emerged as an example of how an extended break from the rigors of competition can rejuvenate an aging star. Through three games, he leads the N.F.L. with 291 rushing yards and last week he uncorked a 43-yard touchdown run that had fans checking their calendars to see if they had traveled back to 2012.One could argue for Jamaal Charles, Le’Veon Bell or Matt Forte as the game’s best running back, but Peterson is certainly in the discussion.The question now is whether Peterson’s two-week outburst, in which he shredded the Lions and the Chargers, is a fluke, or a sign that he and the Vikings are back.Peterson will face a bigger test this week against the Broncos, whose defense has held opponents to 82.7 rushing yards a game, sixth best in the N.F.L.Fans can talk all they want about Peyton Manning’s comfort level, his arm strength and the Broncos’ offensive formations, but the days of Denver living and dying on Manning’s ability to put up glittering passing statistics are over. The team’s unbeaten record is largely a result of its versatile and talented defense. The Broncos have the luxury of being able to win even when Manning is playing below his best.This is the only game this week pitting teams with winning records against each other. And since both are placing much of their offensive burden on 30-something stars who may be playing on borrowed time, it could fail to live up to expectations as the de facto game of the week.Pick: BroncosAdvertisement
