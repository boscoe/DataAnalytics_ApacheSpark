It was unclear all week if Jay Cutler would be active for the Chicago Bears, but he decided to play and made a dramatic statement by driving the team 80 yards for a touchdown on the opening drive against the upstart Oakland Raiders. The previously winless Bears went on to a 22-20 victory.Cutler has been working his way back from an injured hamstring, and though his movement was limited, he represented a large upgrade over Jimmy Clausen, who started for Chicago last week and completed just 9 passes for 63 yards in an embarrassing loss to the Seattle Seahawks.On the opening touchdown drive, Cutler was 3 for 4, finishing it with a short pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, who took it 7 yards for an easy touchdown.Cutler’s success continued, as he completed 28 of 43 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns. A late interception nearly cost his team the game, but the embattled Cutler drove the team down the field to set up a game-winning field goal by Robbie Gould.
            Meanwhile... Jay Cutler's gutty performance seals a surprising win for the #Bears. Was never supposed to play, but willed himself there.        The loss had to come as a shock to the Raiders, who came into the game as favorites after winning on the road last week. A revitalized offense looked pedestrian against Chicago with just 243 total yardsThe strong defensive effort by Chicago was surprising since the focus for much of this week was on the trades the team made, sending defensive end Jared Allen to the Carolina Panthers and linebacker Jonathan Bostic to the New England Patriots. Speculation has been rampant, with pundits wondering if the Bears would consider trading Matt Forte as well, but winning for the first time this season may quiet the rumors.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
