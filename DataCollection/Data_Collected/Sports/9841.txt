The Tigers know how well they are capable of playing, but then there are the days when they lose to conference doormats like Auburn and Mississippi State, and how do they explain that?They do not know, and they will spend the off-season wondering how they blew a 16-point second-half lead Thursday night to North Carolina State, which won, 66-65, on a basket by BeeJay Anya with one-tenth of a second remaining. The No. 8 Wolfpack advanced to play the East Region’s top seed, Villanova, on Saturday. Only once all season had L.S.U., which has lost 11 games, dropped two in a row, a stretch of futility encompassing those setbacks to Auburn and Mississippi State. They fell into that unwanted company Thursday night by missing their last 12 shots, failing to make a field goal over the final 10 minutes 26 seconds.L.S.U.’s 60-48 lead evaporated ever so slowly, and North Carolina State, after drawing to 65-64, grabbed the rebound off Jordan Mickey’s missed jumper and ran one final possession. Trevor Lacey jumped at the foul line, as if to take a shot, but he instead dished it to Anya, who took one dribble, spun and flicked a left-handed hook that hit the back of the rim before dropping in.“Not the shot we would have drew up to try to win a game, with BeeJay shooting a left-handed jump hook from about eight feet,” Wolfpack Coach Mark Gottfried said. “That probably wasn’t the one.”Mickey missed two foul shots with 1 minute 3 seconds left, and Anya scored the final 4 points — his only 4 of the game.“I don’t take that many shots during the game, so I try and contribute other ways,” Anya said. When Lacey passed to him on the final play, Anya said, “It was my turn to shoot it.”Advertisement
