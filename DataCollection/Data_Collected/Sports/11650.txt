SAKHIR, Bahrain — A Grand Prix set in the desert, at nighttime under bright floodlights on a bumpy, tarmac track, with sparks flying out from the titanium underbellies of the world’s fastest racing cars, the drivers’ faces visible through their visors.Such were the images of the Bahrain Grand Prix on this small island nation in the Gulf on Sunday. While it looked through most of the 57-lap race as if only those superficial images would serve to excite, the final laps ended up providing the tightest race to the finish this year.It may have ended in another victory by Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes, who led from pole position to victory, but a late-race surge by Kimi Raikkonen in a Ferrari, combined with problems on the brakes of both Mercedes drivers, meant the Finnish driver passed Hamilton’s teammate, Nico Rosberg, with less than two laps left for second position, finishing just 3.3 seconds behind the winner. Rosberg finished third, 2.6 seconds behind Raikkonen.It was Hamilton’s 36th victory in Formula One, his third in the four races of this season, and his second victory in a row in Bahrain.Advertisement“The Ferraris gave us a real run for our money, but fortunately I was able to keep it all together,” said Hamilton. “We need to keep pushing as a team.”AdvertisementHamilton leads the series with 93 points, Rosberg moved into second with 66 points, ahead of Vettel, who is in third with 65 points, and who finished fifth after he made an error battling with Rosberg and damaged his front wing. Raikkonen is fourth in the series, with 42 points.Despite the setting in the dry heat and sand being like a stage setting for a Western film shootout, the hoped-for duel between Hamilton and Rosberg a week after their controversial verbal showdown in Shanghai, when Rosberg complained about being blocked by his teammate, did not happen.Last season, the two drivers exchanged victories, pole positions and top scoring spots throughout the season, with the drivers’ title only being decided in the final race, in Abu Dhabi in November. This year, Hamilton has used each race to whittle down his teammate’s confidence. Even when Vettel won the second race, in Malaysia, Rosberg finished behind Hamilton.“Winning is winning and it doesn’t particularly matter who it is against,” said Hamilton after Sunday’s race, avoiding a question about how it felt about the situation.Yet, after beating Rosberg to the pole position the previous week by only .4 seconds, on Saturday in Bahrain, Hamilton not only again beat him by .4 seconds, but this time, Vettel managed to qualify second, pushing Rosberg to third on the grid.On Sunday, Rosberg got off to a great start that suddenly went bad: He pulled up to a position to pass Vettel, but the German driver not only fended him off, but in doing so gave an opportunity to Raikkonen, who had started fourth, to pass Rosberg.But Rosberg passed Raikkonen at the beginning of Lap 3, and then passed Vettel at the beginning of Lap 9. Rosberg, however, could never get close to his teammate, Hamilton. Rosberg dropped behind Vettel again after a pit stop, but managed to pass the Ferrari driver on Lap 35, thanks to Vettel going off the track and damaging his front wing.AdvertisementThat forced Vettel to make another pit stop to replace the wing, and he lost all possibility of finishing on the podium. He dropped to fifth position, behind Valtteri Bottas of Williams, where he stayed for the rest of the race.Raikkonen had a superior set of tires in the final part of the race, and began an attack.On Lap 42, Raikkonen set the fastest lap of the race, and despite being 16.2 seconds behind Rosberg and 21 seconds behind Hamilton, his charge had begun. Rosberg felt the pressure.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But he had had problems throughout the race with his brakes and his role had been reduced to the hunted rather than the hunter. He had been increasingly taking on the look of a No. 2 driver, lacking that little bit of extra speed that makes a winner and champion out of Hamilton.“Don’t tell me the gap anymore,” Rosberg shouted to his engineer when on Lap 47 he was told him the distance of the Ferrari driver behind him.With less than two laps left in the race, Rosberg’s brakes finally let go, he said, and he went straight on through a corner, 1.1 seconds ahead of the Finnish driver, and virtually opening the door to let him pass into second position. It was a further humiliation for the German driver’s season.“At the end I had to try to catch Lewis but I couldn’t catch him,” said Rosberg, “and I had a brake problem at the end and just went straight on and that gave the position to Kimi.”Hamilton also had to slow down at the end of the race since his brakes had suffered overheating as well, as he was lapping so many of the trailing cars.It was the second race of the season in which Rosberg finished third while his teammate won.Had the race been a little longer, Raikkonen might have won as he was also catching up on Hamilton. “We ran out of laps,” said Raikkonen, “but I think we have to be happy after that.”The grand finale to the spectacular images of the race came as the Renault engine of Daniel Ricciardo’s Red Bull blew up, billowing white smoke just before he successfully crossed the finish line in sixth position.AdvertisementEcclestone backs BakuFormula One’s commercial chief, Bernie Ecclestone, said the Azerbaijan Grand Prix will make its debut next season, despite concerns over the country’s human rights record, The Associated Press reported Sunday from Sakhir, Bahrain.Known as the Baku European Grand Prix, it is to be held as a street race in the country’s capital, Baku.A report this year by Human Rights Watch said that there had been a deterioration in the former Soviet Republic state’s record, with more than 30 human rights defenders — including political activists and journalists — convicted or imprisoned.Speaking ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix, which was canceled in 2011 amid violent clashes after an uprising demanding political reforms, Ecclestone said Sunday he did not think there would be any problems. “It’s going to be another good race,” he said.This past week, the sport’s official website carried a legal notice stating that “The Formula One Group is committed to respecting internationally recognized human rights in its operations globally.”The Human Right Watch report on Azerbaijan said “the Azerbaijani government escalated repression against its critics, marking a dramatic deterioration in its already poor rights record.”A version of this article appears in print on April 20, 2015, in The International New York Times.
