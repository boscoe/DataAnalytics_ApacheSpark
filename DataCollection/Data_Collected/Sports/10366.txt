LOS ANGELES —  The men’s basketball team from Pittsburgh’s Duquesne University opened the 2011-12 season with a game at highly ranked Arizona. The Duquesne coach at the time, Ron Everhart, said beforehand that his sophomore point guard, T. J. McConnell, reminded him of a young Sean Miller — a Pittsburgh-area star in high school, a four-year collegiate starter at Pittsburgh and now Arizona’s coach.The Wildcats escaped with a narrow victory. McConnell played 37 minutes and had 9 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals. Miller was smitten.“I really appreciate him as a player,” Miller said after the game.McConnell transferred to Arizona after the season. He sat out one year because of transfer rules, and since then he has started every game for the Wildcats. Saturday’s game, when Arizona plays Wisconsin in the West Regional final, will be No. 76. His career will end either with the team’s next loss or with a national championship.“There are a lot of players, when they walk out the door, you miss,” Miller said the other day. “I don’t know if I’ll miss anybody more than him.”AdvertisementThey are both from the Pittsburgh area, both point guards, both from prominent basketball families, both the sons of their high school coaches. There may be no symbiotic relationship in the N.C.A.A. tournament like the one between Miller and McConnell, trying to lead Arizona to its first Final Four since 2001.“Me and him, personality-wise, are pretty much spitting images,” McConnell said on Friday.Arizona is stacked with talent. The freshman forward Stanley Johnson looks molded for the N.B.A. and is likely to be a first-round draft choice this year. The 6-foot-7 forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, a defensive flytrap on the wing who leads the team in rebounds, may join him. The Wildcats have a 7-foot center, Kaleb Tarczewski, and a sharpshooting guard, Gabe York.But McConnell, 6-1 and 195 pounds, is the key to the team’s success. He is the increasingly rare pass-first point guard, in the mold of a John Stockton or Steve Nash. (“I obviously can’t be as good as those guys,” he said Wednesday, with sincerity and, perhaps, inaccuracy.)He averages 10.1 points and 6.3 assists per game. (As a senior at Pitt, Miller averaged 10.7 points and 6.4 assists.) He shoots 34 percent from behind the 3-point line and is growing more and more adept at driving to the basket. He is an all-conference defender.As important, McConnell is the team’s thermostat, instilling cool during crises and applying heat when needed.Advertisement“He always makes the right play,” Tarczewski said.McConnell is, basically, Sean Miller’s mind in a uniform.“You can tell, when we’re playing and they point at each other, or T. J. does something or the team does something, the first person Coach Miller looks at is T. J. McConnell,” Hollis-Jefferson said.“And that is something they build throughout practice and throughout the years of getting to know each other. As a point guard and as a former point guard, they have that bond, where Coach Miller knows the game and he knows what a point guard should do. And he expects the world of T. J.”When Arizona found itself teetering on the edge of an upset by Xavier on Thursday, it was McConnell who made the late 3-pointer that invigorated the team.He had played an uncharacteristically sloppy first half (“You could have said I was practically playing for Xavier, how many times I passed them the ball,” he said) and had missed all five of his previous 3-point attempts.McConnell was relieved his key shot went in. Miller shared none of his nervousness.“No,” Miller said, his voice a verbal shrug. “That’s a good shot for us.”Miller, 46, and McConnell, who turned 23 on Wednesday, come from families with similarly deep ties to basketball and geography. Miller and his brother Archie — a decade younger and the coach at Dayton — both played for their father, John, at Blackhawk High in Beaver Falls, Pa., north of Pittsburgh.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As a boy, he made television appearances, including one on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson,” doing ball-handling tricks. Miller grew into a premier schoolboy point guard and starred in college at Pitt. He remains among the Big East Conference’s career leaders in assists. His most famous pass might be one to his teammate Jerome Lane, whose subsequent dunk shattered the backboard.His coaching career included jobs as an assistant at Wisconsin, Pitt, Miami of Ohio, North Carolina State and Xavier, where he rose to head coach. He left in 2009 for Arizona, where he rebuilt a flagging power.AdvertisementAlways able to attract talent, Miller did not have a true point guard in his own mold until he found McConnell.McConnell played for his father, Tim, at Chartiers Valley High in Bridgeville, Pa. As a freshman, he did not look like a blue-chip talent, standing about 5 feet 4 and weighing 110 pounds.But his talent and tenacity were evident, and Everhart offered him a scholarship during McConnell’s sophomore year in high school. He arrived at 6-1, 165 pounds, and was named the Atlantic-10 Conference freshman of the year. He soon outgrew Duquesne.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Like Miller, McConnell has other relatives involved in coaching. One aunt, Suzie McConnell-Serio, is the coach of the women’s team at Pitt. Another, Kathy McConnell-Miller, a former head coach at Tulsa and Colorado, is Pitt’s associate head coach. And an uncle, Tom McConnell, spent seven years in the 1990s as the men’s coach at St. Francis and is now the women’s coach at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.The most important common thread between Miller and McConnell, Miller said this week, is that both played for their fathers.“They were both very hard on us, and I mean that in a good way,” Miller said. “I don’t think we ever walked in the gym and had a day off because of that.”After the Xavier game, McConnell told reporters that the victory was probably the best birthday present he ever had.“Maybe a bike when I was, like, 8,” he said, searching his memory.Miller chimed in from across the dais.Advertisement“A Steeler football helmet,” he said. “He used to run around in his backyard and pretend he was Franco Harris.”McConnell’s eyes shifted and he sat silent with a bemused grin. Was that McConnell’s childhood memory, or Miller’s? Sometimes, their minds seem conjoined.“He’s the extension, because he plays the point guard, of our coaching staff,” Miller said. “And you like to think he represents the qualities that we want to instill in everybody. In T. J.’s case, he really does.”For one more game, at least. At some point soon, a little piece of Miller will be gone.A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: A Mirror Image of Arizona’s Coach, Minus the Suit and Tie.
