McCloughan said the decision on Griffin would “not affect our draft process at all.”Griffin was the No. 2 pick in the 2012 draft and was named the N.F.L.’s offensive rookie of the year, but he tore knee ligaments in a playoff game at the end of that season and has not had the same kind of success since. Still, Coach Jay Gruden said in February that Griffin would head into the season as the starting quarterback. ■ The pass rusher Shane Ray, widely projected as a first-round pick in this week’s N.F.L. draft, was issued a misdemeanor citation after a trooper found a small amount of marijuana in his car, the authorities said. Ray, the Southeastern Conference defensive player of the year at Missouri, was pulled over west of Columbia, Mo., early Monday for speeding, a Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman said, and a trooper searched his car after smelling marijuana. ■ The Green Bay Packers will retire Brett Favre’s No. 4 jersey at halftime of a Nov. 26 game against the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field.
