Week 9 Scores and HighlightsSteelers fans were elated last week to see quarterback Ben Roethlisberger return from a knee injury, but then lost running back Le’Veon Bell for the remainder of the season, also with a knee injury. DeAngelo Williams, who was cut by Carolina in the off-season after nine seasons as a Panther, will now assume the role of starting running back.“I’m encouraged because he’s an established, capable guy, a guy we know can deliver,” Steelers Coach Mike Tomlin said about Williams. “He delivered for us and he delivered for Carolina for 10 years in the league.”The Raiders have had success against the Steelers in recent years despite not fielding many good teams — Oakland has won four of the last five in the series since 2006 — and the 2015 Raiders are pretty good. Two of their three losses were to the Bengals and the Broncos, both undefeated. With those teams running away with the divisions Pittsburgh and Oakland play in, this matchup may prove integral to each team’s playoff hopes.PICK: STEELERSAdvertisement
