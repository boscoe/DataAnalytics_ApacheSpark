The surprise was that it was not Marcel Hirscher, the Austrian star and defending champion who was in a prime position after winning the first run.Instead, it was Jean-Baptiste Grange, a 30-year-old Frenchman, who best handled the pressure and the heavy snow in the final race of these Alpine world ski championships.“I honestly didn’t think I had the capacity to do this,” he said.Grange had not won a major race or even a World Cup race since he claimed his first world title in the slalom, in Garmisch, Germany, in 2011.But after finishing fifth in the first run, Grange skied a beautifully balanced and controlled second run to seize the lead with a combined time of 1 minute 57.47 seconds.AdvertisementNonetheless, he still was not thinking about victory, not in light of his recent history and not with four more skiers to come.AdvertisementBut none of the final four could catch him. Not Mattias Hargin or André Myhrer of Sweden. Not Alexander Khoroshilov, the Russian veteran who has taken his skiing to a new level this season. Not even Hirscher, who has long been the best tech skier in the world and the most reliable finisher in an event that is the sporting equivalent of running a gantlet.“The slalom is so unusual, so unpredictable,” said Stéphane Quittet, Grange’s longtime coach. “It’s such a stressful discipline, so mentally tiring for everyone — even for the coaches on the side of the course.”The first run on Friday was not just mentally tiring. The course set was extremely difficult — slow and full of extreme shifts and turns — and many of the racers fortunate enough to make it to the bottom looked spent.Fritz Dopfer, the German who ended up with the silver medal, was sucking on oxygen through a mask between runs.In total, 43 skiers failed to finish the run, including the last three Olympic slalom champions: Benjamin Raich of Austria, Giuliano Razzoli of Italy and Mario Matt of Austria.“The first run was nasty; it was the worst feeling ever,” said Felix Neureuther, Dopfer’s teammate who won the bronze medal.But for the second run, the course set and the conditions made for an abrupt change. These world championships had been sunbaked, with some spectators watching races in bikini tops. But snow began falling heavily after the first run on Sunday.The attrition rate dropped significantly, but that hardly made it ideal for everyone. Ted Ligety, the American star who won gold in the giant slalom here, started 16th in the second run, just after a television break, and ended up 21st.Advertisement“I skied poorly,” he said. “Going right after the break when it was snowing this hard and nobody is slipping unfortunately is pretty disappointing. But my skiing wasn’t good to begin with.”Hirscher, who had already won two gold medals and a silver medal here, was losing time to Grange but still held a slight edge as he came within sight of the finish line in the second run. But he then straddled a gate and was eliminated.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He sustained his first serious knee injury here during a giant slalom race in 2009.“I’ve had big emotions here in Beaver Creek, both bad and really good,” Grange said.Dopfer, in second, was 0.35 of a second behind Grange. Neureuther, the World Cup leader in slalom this season, was 0.55 behind Grange.“When I crossed the finish line after the second run, I would never have thought that this is enough,” Neureuther said. “With such a big mistake, I thought, This will not be enough, but you see how fast it can go in skiing. Somebody does a mistake and you are up on the podium.”It was the first gold medal here for France, the traditional ski power that has produced the likes of Henri Oreiller, Jean-Claude Killy and Luc Alphand and a pair of surprise Olympic downhill champions in Jean-Luc Cretiér and Antoine Dénériaz.“This is a beautiful ray of sunshine for us,” said Michel Vion, the president of the French Ski Federation, as the snow collected in his dark hair and on his jacket.AdvertisementIt was soon falling on Grange as he received his gold medal and a children’s choir sang the French national anthem, “La Marseillaise,” for the first time in these championships.“I was thinking about all the struggles I’ve had, and thinking about the people I care about,” Grange said.Alpine skiing — a dangerous profession — is full of comeback stories. Injuries, particularly knee injuries, are the coin of the realm, but Grange has had more than his share: two to his knee, one to his shoulder and chronic back pain in 2012 that he said had caused him to consider retirement.“It was the way it kept happening that was tough,” he said. “The knee, the shoulder, the back, the knee. It was all in a row. And I was in pain all the time with the back. But I hung on and hung on, and I fought for it.”A version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Frenchman Roars Back From Injuries, and Fifth Place, to Claim Gold.
