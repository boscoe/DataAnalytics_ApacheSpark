Raiders (4-5) at Lions (2-7)1 p.m. Line: Raiders by 1N.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsIf the Lions try too hard to shut down wide receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, the Raiders can run them into submission with Latavius Murray. The Raiders may have lost consecutive games, but they have built an offense that is as fun to watch as it is effective.Oakland’s defense lags far behind the offense in terms of development, and losing Aldon Smith to a long suspension certainly does not help, but the Lions’ offense scare no one despite the presence of Calvin Johnson. Detroit looked better last week, but in a game that should be a shootout, the Raiders have many more weapons.PICK: RaidersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
