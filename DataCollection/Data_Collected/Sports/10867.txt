Churchill Downs recently adopted a point system to determine the Derby field, with points being earned by the top four finishers in designated prep races. The odds are from the Churchill Downs futures pool, and the records are starts-win-place-show. An article on Saturday’s Wood Memorial, Blue Grass Stakes and Santa Anita Derby can be found here.1. DortmundTrainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Martin GarciaRecord: 6-6-0-0 Points: 170 Odds: 6-1J.D.: There’s no knocking this guy. He’s gotten better each outing, and only illness, injury or a bad post position could slow him down.M.H.: He crushed a talented Santa Anita field, winning by four and a quarter lengths, and like his father, Big Brown, he will enter the Derby with a perfect record and the deserving title of favorite.Next: Kentucky Derby on May 2.2. Firing LineTrainer: Simon Callaghan Jockey: Gary StevensRecord: 5-2-3-0 Points: 58 Odds: 13-1J.D.: He finished behind the top choice by a head twice before going to New Mexico to win the Sunland Derby. That’s enough for me to make him the second choice.M.H.: The runner-up to Dortmund in the Robert B. Lewis, this speedy colt showed in the Sunland Derby that he could win with ease once free of his shadow. Of course, that won’t be the case in the Derby.Next: Kentucky Derby.3. American PharoahTrainer: Bob Baffert Jockey: Victor EspinozaRecord: 4-3-0-0 Points: 60 Odds: 5-1J.D.: Word on the Santa Anita backside is that American Pharoah, last year’s 2-year-old champion, is training even better than his stable mate, Dortmund. The Baffert barn is loaded.M.H.: The son of Pioneerof the Nile overcame a stumble and a displaced shoe to impressively win the Rebel in the slop. All eyes will be on his next race to see if his form holds up.Next: Arkansas Derby on Saturday.4. Carpe DiemTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John VelazquezRecord: 5-4-1-0 Points: 164 Odds: 10-1J.D.: He appeared to win the Bluegrass with energy to spare and is the only real threat from the East. He is going to like the Derby’s mile-and-a-quarter distance.M.H.: The Blue Grass winner has shown that he deserves to be in the conversation with Baffert’s big guns. Still, he didn’t pull away from the field as much as I expected; Dortmund looked more dominant.Next: Kentucky Derby.5. MaterialityTrainer: Todd Pletcher Jockey: John VelazquezRecord: 3-3-0-0 Points: 100 Odds: 12-1J.D.: Materiality, the Florida Derby champ, is trying to do an awful a lot in a little time. I’m betting against his winning the Run for the Roses on so little foundation.M.H.: The son of Afleet Alex, he looked impressive in staying perfect in the Florida Derby. But long odds remain: Since 1882, no horse has won the Derby without racing at 2.Next: Kentucky Derby.6. UpstartTrainer: Rick Violette Jockey: Jose OrtizRecord: 7-3-3-1 Points: 76 Odds: 18-1J.D.: Melissa likes this horse better than I do. I think we’ve already seen his best.M.H.: The New York-bred Upstart posted a career-best 108 Beyer speed figure in finishing second in the Florida Derby. He has never really run a bad race, but will he regress?Next: Kentucky Derby.7. International StarTrainer: Mike Maker Jockey: Miguel MenaRecord: 9-5-2-0 Points: 171 Odds: 17-1J.D.: Sterling résumé, but not all that respected. All this guy does is win. He’s on my tickets, and at 17-1 on Derby day, pound it with both hands.M.H.: International Star, the son of Fusaichi Pegasus, swept the Fair Grounds prep races (the LeComte, the Risen Star and the Louisiana Derby), giving him the most points. He also progressed in all three.Next: Kentucky Derby.8. FrostedTrainer: Kiaran McLaughlin Jockey: Joel RosarioRecord: 7-2-4-0 Points: 113 Odds: 40-1J.D.: Frosted ran himself back into the conversation with an impressive score in the Wood Memorial. I still think he’s more a pretender than a contender.M.H.: After flopping in the Fountain of Youth, the colt had a throat procedure and appears to have rebounded in a big way, winning the Wood by two lengths while earning a 103 Beyer speed figure. Still a bit of a question mark, but I liked what I saw.Next: Kentucky Derby.9. MubtaahijTrainer: Mike de Kock Jockey: Christophe SoumillonRecord: 7-4-1-0 Points: 100 Odds: 8-1J.D.: I’ve watched the U.A.E. Derby replays a dozen times, and he looks like the real deal. He might be the first desert-based horse to hit the board.M.H.: Won the U.A.E. Derby by an impressive eight lengths, setting Twitter abuzz. But will he be able to bounce back in five weeks and after being shipped overseas?Next: Kentucky Derby.10. El KabeirTrainer: John Terranova Jockey: C. C. LopezRecord: 9-4-2-2 Points: 95 Odds: 18-1J.D.: Meet your West Virginia Derby winner.M.H.: The Gotham winner was last with a half-mile left but rallied to finish third in the Wood Memorial, suggesting that he still has some fight. Lopez, though, most likely lost the mount. If Calvin Borel takes over, he could be a nice upset pick.Next: Kentucky Derby.Advertisement
