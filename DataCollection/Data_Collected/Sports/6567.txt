He has done little to disappoint since replacing Peyton Manning as the face of the Indianapolis Colts, but the Patriots have seemingly reveled in showing that although he may be the N.F.L.’s future, Tom Brady is the league’s present.In their three games against New England since Luck arrived, the Colts have been outscored, 144-66, including a 42-20 rout in November. Patriots Coach Bill Belichick has written the script for beating Luck’s Colts: Run the ball all day and keep Luck off the field. A simple enough strategy, but it is one the Patriots have executed so perfectly that it hardly seems fair.Brady will get yet another feather in his cap regardless of the outcome as this is his record ninth conference championship game. A win would give Belichick his 21st playoff victory as a head coach, breaking the record held by the Hall of Famer Tom Landry. Landry guided the Cowboys to a 20-16 playoff record in 29 seasons; Belichick is 20-9 in 20 seasons with New England and the Cleveland Browns.To beat the Patriots at home in the playoffs, everything has to go right. But the Colts’ week started badly: They are dealing with nagging injuries to their starting cornerbacks and the distraction of felony counts of rape and criminal confinement being leveled against the backup linebacker Josh McNary.As good as Luck has been, the Colts seem to rise and fall with their defense. Brady is not the force he once was, but he is far from done, and New England’s running backs will each get a turn at winding the clock down in hopes of rendering Luck irrelevant on the sideline. Unless Indianapolis finds a way to counter that strategy, Luck’s misfortune against New England should continue.Pick: PatriotsAll times are Eastern. Picks do not reflect the betting line.
