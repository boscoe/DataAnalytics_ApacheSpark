To the Sports Editor:Re “Fearlessly Forging Ahead,” Nov. 15: Lindsey Vonn’s journey strikes me as a metaphor for women everywhere. There’s this struggle, a dichotomy of desires and discoveries of who we are as women and what we are to do with all that we have, want, and feel that we must do. As athletes, we do what we are seemingly born to do, yet there’s being a woman, a partner and a mother that makes it all the more. But at its core, the athlete is born to move, and do, and soar, hit the galaxy with all we have, despite it all.I get it, and so do female athletes everywhere. I feel normalized, as if I’m not such a freak for loving my sports so much that they’re part of who I really am.Thanks, Ms. Vonn. You’re a generation from me, but I feel it, the way I felt it at 12 years old in 1965, paddling out among the guys on big surf days and being made fun of because it was no place for girls. And I feel no less freaky for winning sail races over the men and don’t need to apologize for sharing the same tenacity.INGRID BRADLEYMerritt Island, Fla.Challenges of ColorblindnessTo the Sports Editor:Now that the N.F.L. has helped those who are not colorblind realize just how many of us there are, it’s well past time to deal with the more serious issues facing colorblind people. For example, New York City’s official flood zone evacuation maps are completely illegible to colorblind people.AdvertisementColorblindness is not a protected disability under the Americans With Disabilities Act, even though it is far more widespread than many of the protected disabilities. Moreover, accommodation for colorblindness does not require massive capital expenditures. Rather, it requires a little sensitivity and common sense when selecting a color palette. Perhaps it’s time to amend the A.D.A. to include protection for colorblindness.AdvertisementJEREMY M. POSNERNew YorkAccess to Blocked SitesTo the Sports Editor:Re: “DraftKings Leaves Door Unlocked for Barred Fantasy Sports Players,” Nov. 14: Proxy servers are hardly the only means of accessing a location-restricted site, nor are they the most basic or accessible. Students like myself, studying abroad in a country that does not have access to geofenced media sites like Netflix or Hulu, routinely access such blocked sites through virtual private networks.While some of the most popular V.P.N.s are in the $45-$50 price range, several are now available for noncommercial users as free browser extensions or apps (such as the app Hola, which has over 200,000 users) and can be downloaded in seconds from a web store onto just about any computer or mobile phone.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Given the ease of finding alternative methods of circumventing geofences, it should not serve as a litmus test for compliance with digital location-based restrictions.JORDAN OFEKRamat Gan, IsraelTo the Sports Editor:I am piqued that the New York State attorney general is going after fantasy sports sites because they are not games of skill but are gambling. No one of stature is pointing out the hypocrisy, not to mention the shortsightedness, of the state’s laws.New York has a constantly promoted a state lottery. There are casinos and racetracks throughout the state. The largest gambling institution in the world is the New York Stock Exchange. Moreover, the state does not prohibit its citizens from traveling to other states to participate in whatever gambling options are available.Yet it believes it has the right to prohibit its citizens from doing so on the Internet, while eschewing the millions of tax dollars it could get from the Internet sites, funds the state could surely find a use for that’s more productive than mounting anti-gambling prosecutions.MICHAEL SPIELMANThe BronxA version of this letter appears in print on November 22, 2015, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: Striving and Struggling as an Athlete and a Woman.
