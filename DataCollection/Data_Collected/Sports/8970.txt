Dillon Gee, the Mets’ 2014 opening day starter, started the game under much different circumstances. For months, he had been mentioned in trade rumors, and the Mets had indicated he would move to the bullpen if he was not traded.His first spring training start did not do much to help his cause. Gee allowed two hits and two runs and walked two in two innings pitched.A few Mets did impress.Juan Lagares doubled, drew a walk and scored a run as the leadoff hitter, a role he could fill this season.Matt Reynolds, a shortstop prospect, went 2 for 3, scoring two runs and driving in another.Johnny Monell, a minor league catcher the Mets signed this off-season, hit a three-run homer.For the Braves, Chien-Ming Wang, a former Yankee, pitched two scoreless innings and struck out three batters.Advertisement
