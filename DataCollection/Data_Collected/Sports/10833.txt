Two numbers are as much a part of golf’s most popular debate as any words: 18, Jack Nicklaus’s record total of major titles, and 14, Tiger Woods’s stalled challenge.But with Woods’s documented travails hounding his return to the Masters this week, two other golf numbers, 63 and 62, deserve to be dissected much more often than they are.Ever since Johnny Miller shot 63 at Oakmont in the 1973 United States Open, that number has endured as the record score in a major tournament. It’s been equaled 25 times by 23 other golfers, including Nicklaus and Woods as well as Greg Norman and Vijay Singh, who each did it twice.With the Masters starting Thursday, the question arises again: When will somebody, anybody, shoot 62 in a major, where the rough is thicker and the greens are slicker than in the week-to-week events?AdvertisementIt’s unlikely to happen at Augusta National, where only two 63s have occurred, both when the course was 500 yards shorter. Norman opened the 1996 Masters with a 63, but his final-round 78 enabled Nick Faldo to win by five strokes. Nick Price shot a 63 in the third round in 1986, the day before Nicklaus earned his sixth green jacket at age 46. Price had a 30-footer for a 62 on the 18th green, but his putt lipped the cup.“I think Bobby Jones’s hand came up and popped it out of the hole and said, ‘That’s enough,’ ” Price once recalled.Only a few others have had a putt on the 18th green for 62, but all missed, beginning with Miller’s 20-foot birdie putt at Oakmont. Surprisingly, the golfer who missed the shortest putt for 62 was Nicklaus.In the opening round of the 1980 United States Open at Baltusrol, whenever Tom Weiskopf, playing ahead of Nicklaus, made a birdie, his gallery roared.“Answer him,” Nicklaus’s caddie, Angelo Argea, barked.Birdie after birdie, Nicklaus did. After Weiskopf posted his 63, Nicklaus lined up on the 18th green what appeared to be a 3-footer for a 62. Asked about it the other day, he called it a 2-footer.Advertisement“I just totally choked,” he said from his North Palm Beach, Fla., office. “It was nerves. It was a quick-breaking putt. I just choked.”Choked? Perhaps the best clutch putter in golf history choked? “I choked all the time,” he said, laughing. “But those putts went in.”Woods had a 15-foot putt for 62 in the second round of the 2007 P.G.A. Championship at Southern Hills, but his ball lipped out. He later joked that he shot 62 ½.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

If he made it, he knew that another birdie on the easier 18th hole would create a 62. But he missed the putt on the 17th green.“It went through my mind that 62 would have been the lowest round in a major; that’s probably why I missed the putt,” McIlroy told reporters later. “I started thinking to myself, if I can birdie this hole, I’ve got a chance of birdieing the last.”In the 1977 British Open at Turnberry, Mark Hayes, a three-time PGA Tour winner, had perhaps the easiest path to a 62. All he needed was a par 4 on the 18th hole in the second round, but he missed the green with his approach, then missed a 6-foot par putt.Only six golfers who shot 63 at a major won the tournament: Miller, Nicklaus, Woods, Dufner, Norman in the 1986 British Open at Turnberry and Raymond Floyd in 1982 at Southern Hills. Miller’s 63 was the only one that came in the final round.AdvertisementOn the weekly PGA Tour, scores lower than 63 abound. Since 1980, when the tour began keeping more exotic statistics, there have been 480 62s, including J. B. Holmes’s at Doral earlier this year; 122 61s; 22 60s; and six 59s. But in the four majors, 63 has stood for 42 years.Of the 24 golfers who shot 63, six remain on the tour: Woods, Singh, Thomas Bjorn, Stricker, Dufner and McIlroy.If you’re wondering who might be the first to shoot 62, McIlroy appears the best bet. He not only shot 63 at St. Andrews, where this year’s British Open will be played, but he acknowledged his mistake that day in thinking about a 62 before he had a 63.The next time McIlroy is that close to a 62 in a major, whenever and wherever that may be, he’ll surely remember not to get ahead of himself.A version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on Page SP13 of the New York edition with the headline: So Close and Yet So Far Away: A Round of 62 in a Major.
