Still, for the first time in recent memory, the anthem was recorded instead of sung.AdvertisementThose distant fans clapped and yelled when Chicago’s first batter, Adam Eaton, struck out, and they greeted each Baltimore run with jubilant cheer. A “Go Orioles” banner hung from the balcony of a nearby hotel, where other fans gathered to watch. But that faraway support could not relieve a barren afternoon.When the Orioles’ leadoff hitter, left fielder Alejandro De Aza, fouled off a series of pitches in the bottom of the first before drawing a walk, one of the balls bounced back onto the field. The other two came to rest among the empty seats and were not immediately retrieved.When Davis followed with a long blast to right field, the crowd’s usual roar of anticipation for a home run was strangely absent. So was the customary scramble for the ball as it cleared the fence and landed on the Eutaw Street walkway. Normally, the street would have been busy with foot traffic for a restaurant, a barbecue stand and the team’s souvenir shop. On Wednesday, though, the walkway was closed. Only a television cameraman stood in the vicinity of the home run.The stadium was so quiet that Gary Thorne, a television announcer for the Orioles, could be heard exclaiming, “Goodbye!” from his booth as Davis’s shot left the park.The scoreboard was in operation. “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” and John Denver’s “Thank God I’m a Country Boy” played as usual during the seventh-inning stretch. But the sound of the ball against the bat left a hollow echo in the vacant stadium. Buck Showalter, the Orioles’ manager, said the bullpen phone could be heard ringing more than 400 feet from the dugout. Relief pitchers for the Orioles said they could hear strikes called by the umpire Jerry Layne, a rarity in the bullpen, and could even follow the chatter among the outfielders. This only added to a sense of desolation.In the eighth inning, an announcement was made in the press box that apparently had never been made at a major league game. For official record-keeping purposes, the announcer said, Wednesday’s paid attendance was — pause — “zero.”Still, there was some levity on the field. Caleb Joseph, the Orioles’ catcher, gave imaginary high-fives to imaginary fans, and signed make-believe autographs, as he headed to the bullpen for his pregame warm-up. Several times, Davis said, he tossed balls to nonexistent fans behind the Orioles’ dugout between innings.Advertisement“Laughter does something for the soul,” Joseph said.Yet early on, intermittent sounds of distant sirens, their source unclear, brought a more somber tone to the afternoon. Adam Jones, the Orioles’ center fielder and perhaps the most popular African-American athlete in Baltimore, described the turmoil in previous days as a cry of frustration by the city’s youth.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But if you come from where they come from, you understand. But I think ruining a community that you have to live in is never the answer due to the fact you’re going to have to wake up in three or four days and go right back to those convenience stores.”After postponements on Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday’s game was shifted to the afternoon from its scheduled 7:05 p.m. start because of a nightly curfew here. And the public was locked out for reasons of safety and the more urgent need for the police in other areas.Jones suggested that Wednesday’s game could be valuable in providing a small distraction from the city’s troubles for a few hours, saying that sports “unite communities in dark times.”But given the rawness of feeling in Baltimore and the need for a police presence elsewhere, Jones said, “It makes sense not to have any people here today.”Others disagreed. Brendan Hurson, a public defender, wore an Orioles jersey and carried a sign on Camden Street, beyond left field, that said, “Don’t Forget Freddie Gray.” He said that closing the stadium was a missed opportunity to “show the whole world what this city is really about,” to help raise money for rebuilding and to give disenfranchised youth a chance to see a ballgame.“So many chances were lost by locking us out,” Hurson said. “It sends the wrong message about what this city is really about.”Walking past left field along Camden Street, Kweisi Mfume, a past president of the N.A.A.C.P. and a former Democratic representative from Maryland, said he had been an Orioles season-ticket holder since the mid-1980s and had to see for himself the odd circumstance of Wednesday’s game.“This is surreal,” Mfume said.As he walked through other Baltimore neighborhoods earlier, he said, he heard sounds of the game coming from some homes.“It made me feel good,” Mfume said, “not that people were trying to forget their pain and misery but that they were trying to find a way to hold on to something normal in a very abnormal situation. For a moment, perhaps, it just kind of eased their pain and distress to focus on something else.”AdvertisementBut in this distraught city, he added, “we know that when the game is over, everything stays as it is until the structural issues are dealt with.”A version of this article appears in print on April 30, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Empty Seats in a Game Full of Meaning for Baltimore .
