Last season, Oklahoma State became the first Big 12 team to get an at-large bid with a losing conference record (8-10).“Coach said this gives us another breath,” Texas guard Javan Felix said of Coach Rick Barnes.The Longhorns took the lead when Isaiah Taylor made a teardrop shot in the lane with 4.8 seconds remaining.Taylor, the point guard, played only six minutes in the first half because of foul trouble. He was on the bench for all but five minutes in the second half and that was Barnes’s choice.“He wasn’t doing what we needed him to do defensively,” said Barnes, who won his 400th game at Texas.But Taylor was back for the overtime, making another teardrop shot early in the overtime before the game-winner.Seven players from both teams were ejected in the overtime for leaving the bench during a brief skirmish between Taylor and Baylor’s Royce O’Neale.Demarcus Holland led Texas with 12 points. Kendal Yancy scored 11, one more than Felix, who began the overtime with a 3-pointer.Taurean Prince led Baylor with 17 points. Rico Gathers had 12 points and 11 rebounds.After an exchange of turnovers in the overtime, Taylor and O’Neale fell to the court, prompting the brief skirmish. Four Longhorns, including the starters Yancy and Cam Ridley, were ejected along with the key reserves Prince Ibeh and Connor Lammert. Three Baylor players, the starter Johnathan Motley and the subs Ishmail Wainright and John Heard, were tossed.Barnes and Baylor Coach Scott Drew said they expected that none of the players would be suspended by the Big 12.■ Anthony Gill had 17 points to lead four Virginia players in double figures, and the No. 2 Cavaliers beat host Syracuse, 59-47, on Monday night to capture the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title for the second straight year.
