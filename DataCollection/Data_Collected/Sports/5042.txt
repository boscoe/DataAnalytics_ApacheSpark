Line: Cardinals by 3.5A debate has emerged as to whether this Cardinals team, which is one win from its first 12-victory season, is the best in franchise history. But that is selling the 1948 Chicago Cardinals short, not to mention the 1925 and 1947 teams, which won N.F.L. championships.Despite not winning a championship, the 1948 team may have been the best. It won 11 games, like the current Cardinals, but in a 12-game regular season, its only loss coming against the crosstown Chicago Bears in the second game. Its average margin of victory was 14.1 points — this year’s is 11.8. The 1948 Cardinals reached the N.F.L. title game, losing to the Eagles, who the current Cardinals play this weekend.Ray Mallouf, Mal Kutner and Elmer Angsman led that 1948 team to an N.F.L.-leading 32.9 points per game, slightly more than the 31.2 points that this year’s squad, with an aerial attack led by Carson Palmer, is averaging.A key for the Cardinals has been their depth. Larry Fitzgerald has been their leading receiver, but John Brown, Michael Floyd or J.J. Nelson can also deliver a huge catch. And with running backs Chris Johnson and Andre Ellington out with injuries, the rookie David Johnson has proved himself capable of being an every-down back.The Eagles have played up to their competition in recent weeks, with wins against New England and Buffalo, but against a relentless Cardinals defense that is fourth in the N.F.L. in yards allowed per game and fifth against the rush, it is hard to see them coming away with a victory.PICK: CardinalsAdvertisement
