Jets (4-1) at Patriots (5-0)1 p.m. Eastern. Line: Patriots by 9N.F.L. Week 7 scores and highlightsAfter two straight road victories, the Patriots return home to Foxborough for a battle for first place in the A.F.C. East with an all-too-familiar foe: the Jets. On paper, this promises to be a matchup not unlike so many of the Patriots-Jets games in recent years, centered on a stingy, rugged Jets defense taking on a high-flying Patriots offense. Entering this game, the Patriots’ offense ranks as the N.F.L.’s highest-scoring unit, averaging 36.6 points per game. The Jets’ defense ranks as the league’s best, giving up an average of only 15 points. Something, as they say, has to give. As always, it should be a blast to watch.The matchup also features an interesting side story: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady squaring off against Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. Revis played against Brady many times as a member of Rex Ryan’s Jets squads, but he also helped Brady and the Patriots win a Super Bowl last season. The two stars now find themselves back in more familiar roles.While the Patriots and the Jets have given us all some memorable nail-biters, the rivalry has been lopsided in the Brady/Bill Belichick era. Brady is 20-5 against the Jets as a starter in the regular season, 10-2 against them at home.The game will be a homecoming of sorts for the former Patriots running back Stevan Ridley, who practiced for the first time this week after sustaining a knee injury last season. His return to health should only strengthen a Jets backfield that leads the league with 146 rushing yards per game. If the Jets can control the ball against New England, which has at times had problems stopping the run, they have a shot to spoil their rivals’ bid for another perfect regular season.PICK: PATRIOTSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
