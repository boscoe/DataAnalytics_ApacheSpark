He had been assigned to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre when the suspension was handed down.Rodriguez was suspended for using furosemide, a diuretic known as Lasix. It is widely employed in the world of horse racing but can also be used by athletes as a masking agent, which is why baseball bans it. Rodriguez is the 45th minor leaguer to test positive this year under baseball’s drug program. Four major leaguers have also tested positive, all of them for stanozolol, an old, easily detectable steroid. All four, like Rodriguez, are pitchers.Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said Rodriguez “threw the ball pretty well for us in spring training” and said he remained surprised when he heard of suspensions. But, he added, “it’s the world we live in.” BILLY WITZAdvertisement
