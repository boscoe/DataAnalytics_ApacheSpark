Manager Terry Collins plans to start Jacob deGrom in Game 3 on Tuesday in Chicago, so that he, Syndergaard and Matt Harvey can each pitch twice if the series goes seven games.Collins called Syndergaard into his office on Saturday to check on his physical state. Syndergaard, who had never pitched in relief before, was constantly up and down in the bullpen on Thursday in Game 5 against the Dodgers. He threw about 60 warm-up pitches before he entered the game, and then threw 17 more. Syndergaard said he told Collins that his arm “never felt better.”Steven Matz will start Game 4. Of the Mets’ four postseason starters, Matz has the least experience and has missed the most time to injuries.Jon Niese, another starter, has been working out of the bullpen, but his status came into question Saturday. Collins revealed that Niese had a death in his family and that the left-handed reliever Sean Gilmartin had been placed on the N.L.C.S. roster in case Niese is unavailable. TIM ROHANAdvertisement
