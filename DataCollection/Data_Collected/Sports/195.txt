Brees has expressed optimism that he will be back this week, but it is unknown how his shoulder woes could affect his ability to stretch the field.The Cowboys showed a conservative strategy last week in the first start of the year for Brandon Weeden, and it might have cost them the game as a halftime lead evaporated despite Weeden’s completing 22 of 26 passes and Joseph Randle scoring three touchdowns.If Brees starts, that should be enough to get New Orleans in the win column.Pick: SaintsAdvertisement
