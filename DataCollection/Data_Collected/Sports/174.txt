The Pittsburgh Steelers faced a crucial fourth down four times in the last three minutes and overtime of Thursday night’s game against the Baltimore Ravens. Success on even one of them might have locked up the win. All four times they failed, and they lost the game, 23-20.The Steelers got a solid performance by quarterback Michael Vick, subbing for the injured Ben Roethlisberger, and a strong one from running back Le’Veon Bell. With 2 minutes 30 seconds to play, the Steelers had a 20-17 lead and the ball in Ravens territory.That’s when it started to turn sour.After a failed short pass on third-and-5, the Steelers sent out Josh Scobee to try a 49-yard field goal. Scobee was two for two, having made kicks of 45 and 36 yards in the first half. He was six for eight on the year. But he missed this one, wide left.The Ravens went four-and-out quickly, and the Steelers took over again at the Baltimore 29 with 2:11 left. Pittsburgh was 93.8 percent likely to win the game at that point, according to Football-Reference.AdvertisementThe Steelers gave the ball to Bell three times, for gains of 1, 4 and 1 yard. On fourth-and-4, Scobee came out again, this time to try a 41-yarder. Again he was wide left.AdvertisementThere was some grumbling online about Coach Mike Tomlin’s decisions to kick and try to increase his lead to 6 points, from 3, rather than go for it. The New York Times Fourth Down Bot did approve of both decisions.Given another chance, Joe Flacco led the Ravens downfield in less than a minute, and they got a game-tying field goal.In overtime, the second-guessing of Tomlin swelled.The Steelers won the toss and opted for the ball. A 22-yard run by Bell took them past midfield, but the offense stalled again. Bell ran twice more to set up third-and-2, and Vick tried a short pass that fell incomplete.On fourth-and-2, the Steelers were looking at a 56-yard field goal attempt. After the two regulation misses by Scobee, Tomlin went for it, calling an end around by Vick. He fell short.The Ravens failed too, though, and the Steelers had one more chance to win. Again they crossed midfield. Again they stalled. Again they faced a fourth down, this time fourth-and-1 with a 50-yard field goal attempt as an option. Again Tomlin decided to go for it. Vick’s pass was a little too high, and incomplete.Tomlin was hit by critics from two directions. Some felt Scobee should have been given the chance to kick the winning field goal. More agreed with the decision to go for it, but wondered why Tomlin did not call Bell’s number on fourth down, after his impressive 129-yard game.
            Two fourth-down plays in overtime, and the Steelers don’t give the ball to Le’Veon Bell either time. How?        The Ravens kicked the winning field goal on the next series.“When you lose you’re open to criticism,” Tomlin said after the game. “Anything we did, I take responsibility for.”AdvertisementVick, who was 19 for 26 for 124 yards, said, “That fourth-and-1 pass has got to be made somehow, some way.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Many called for Scobee to be cut.
            Every time a Josh Scobee field goal attempt is in the air, I think about his future in drywall repair.        It was an improbable and huge victory for the Ravens, who have made the playoffs six of the last seven years and avoided slipping to 0-4.For the Steelers, who fell to 2-2, it was a missed opportunity to bury a division rival. And a game that will be remembered queasily for some time.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
