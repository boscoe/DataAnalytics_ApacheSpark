Sometimes the anticipation for the game builds all week until Saturday's kickoff. 
And sometimes you only have to wait a day. Soccer Editor Andrew Das tells you what to watch this week.
The midweek Champions League schedule continues to be the biggest threat to hipster G.D.P. since artisanal chocolate. Manchester City-Barcelona is Tuesday's headliner (2:45 p.m. EST, FS1) but Juventus-Dortmund (2:45 p.m., FS2) is worth a peek if you can multitask.On Wednesday, Arsenal hosts Monaco in London (2:45 p.m., FS1), meaning that Arsene Wenger, who has managed both teams, can look forward to yet another day wondering which set of supporters will boo him the loudest. Thursday's Europa League matches include the return leg of Feyenoord-Roma in Rotterdam (3 p.m. EST, FS2). After last week's destruction in the Eternal City, any Dutchman with a nice car or a prized collection of lawn sculptures may want to pull them into the garage for a few days.Ajax Amsterdam, the greatest club in the world and one you should consider supporting, faces Legia Warsaw in the Europa League on Thursday and then travels to the Philips Stadion in Eindhoven on Sunday to face first-place PSV. The weekend schedules in the big leagues aren't tremendous, but Monaco-Paris St.-Germain on Friday should be fun, and Dortmund-Schalke in the Bundesliga on Saturday (9:30 a.m. EST, GolTV) matches two Champions League teams. The big Premier League game is Liverpool-Manchester City on Sunday morning (7 a.m., NBCSN). Bring a friend: you'll never watch alone.Advertisement
