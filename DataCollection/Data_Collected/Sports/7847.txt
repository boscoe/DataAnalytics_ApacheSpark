LONDON — The English Premier League, the world's most widely watched soccer league, said on Tuesday that it had sold British television rights for a record 5.1 billion pounds, or about $7.8 billion.In an auction, the broadcaster Sky won five of seven packages of games for the three-year rights contract, which begins in 2016. The rest were awarded to its main rival for British sports, BT.That split is the same as the broadcasters now hold for the British rights to televise the Premier League, whose teams, including Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, play in games that can attract a global audience of about three billion each week.The league is expected to receive at least an additional $3 billion when it sells the rights to international broadcasters, including those in the United States, later this year.AdvertisementThe battle to broadcast the English soccer games had set Sky, which is partly owned by Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox, against BT, the former British telecommunications monopoly that has aggressively expanded into live sports programming as a way to promote its array of cable television and Internet services.Sky also uses the Premier League to entice customers to sign up for its pay-TV and Internet services. Faced with competition from the likes of Netflix, both companies are willing to spend heavily to secure the rights of high-profile sporting events, including the European Champions League soccer tournament, that consistently attract large audiences.Advertisement“It is an endorsement of what the Barclays Premier League delivers that these broadcast partnerships have been extended and enhanced,” Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the English Premier League, said in a statement. Barclays is the official sponsor of the Premier League.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
