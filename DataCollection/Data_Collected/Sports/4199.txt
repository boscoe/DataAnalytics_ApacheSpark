Eagles (4-7) at Patriots (10-1)4:25 p.m. Line: Patriots by 11N.F.L. Week 13 scores and highlightsRob Gronkowski is so important to the Patriots that after a game in which he was carted off the field with what looked like a devastating knee injury, the tight-lipped team took the unusual step of issuing a statement about his relatively good prognosis of a bone bruise and sprain. It was so out of character for the franchise that Coach Bill Belichick was forced to defend it in a news conference, which he did with his trademark combination of annoyance and condescension.Gronkowski is out this week, as is Julian Edelman (broken foot), but Danny Amendola (knee) is expected to play. Philadelphia is expected to start Eric Rowe, a rookie cornerback, so Tom Brady should be able to pile on the misfortune for the struggling Eagles.Assessing the Eagles this week, Belichick praised the team’s offense, saying they are two deep at several skill positions, including quarterback. While it is true that the Eagles have two quarterbacks, it is not clear why Belichick would concern himself with Sam Bradford or Mark Sanchez.PICK: PATRIOTSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
