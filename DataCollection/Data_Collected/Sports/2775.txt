Putin of Russia on Wednesday ordered an investigation into allegations of widespread doping among the country’s sports figures.Putin, in a late-night meeting with the heads of Russia’s sports federations, called for an inquiry that would cooperate with global antidoping organizations. The meeting came in the wake of the World Anti-Doping Agency report released Monday that said Russian sports were plagued by state-sponsored doping.The allegations have raised the prospect of Russia’s track and field athletes being denied participation in next year’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.“The struggle with doping in sports, unfortunately, remains a pressing issue, and it requires unending attention,” Putin said.Putin is up against a Friday deadline for track’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, to decide whether to suspend Russia, a first step toward excluding its athletes from the Games.Grigory Rodchenkov resigned Tuesday as director of Russia’s antidoping laboratory, a day after he was accused of concealing positive tests, extorting money from athletes and destroying 1,417 samples.The lab, which handled doping tests for last year’s Winter Olympics, stopped work after WADA stripped its accreditation.According to the Russian news agency R-Sport, Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said Russia was ready “to put a foreign specialist in charge of the laboratory, if that’s what’s needed.”Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said he expected that the I.A.A.F. would take “necessary measures” against the Russian track and field federation on Friday. He said he expected the I.A.A.F. to “protect clean athletes.”Tatyana Lebedeva, vice president of the Russian track federation and a former Olympic champion, said the organization had carried out enough reforms to deserve a place at the Games.Advertisement
