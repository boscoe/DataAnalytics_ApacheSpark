Over the past 12 seasons, the New England Patriots have played so well in wet conditions that their margin of victory in those games has exceeded the betting spread — set by a global market that tries to take all known advantages into account — 80 percent of the time, according to an analysis by Covers, a sports betting information website.The analysis suggests that the Patriots have an edge in wet weather that neither the general public nor professional bettors have taken into account. But the analysis sheds no light on what that advantage, or those advantages, might be. The Patriots exceeded the spread 56 percent of the time in their other games during that period, the analysis shows.The findings, which Covers shared with The New York Times in advance of their publication Friday, come as the N.F.L. investigates whether footballs used by the Patriots on Sunday in the A.F.C. championship game against the Indianapolis Colts were inflated below league specifications — presumably making the balls easier to grip, throw and catch in the rain.In the championship game, the so-called consensus betting line — estimated by Covers from Las Vegas odds, online betting activity and overseas markets — favored the Patriots by 7 points, but the Patriots ended up crushing the Colts, 45-7.Who’s going to win?

So anyone who had bet on the Patriots would have won.
                N.F.L. officials are investigating whether the Patriots violated league rules by using footballs that were not properly inflated during the A.F.C. championship game against the Colts on Sunday.            Logan pointed out in an interview that the Patriots were facing not very good opponents in the A.F.C. East: Since 2003, the Patriots have dominated the division while the Jets have recorded five seasons over .500, the Miami Dolphins three and the Buffalo Bills two.Logan said that the Patriots also fumbled much less than the league average, in wet and dry conditions — possibly another indication that the team has a better grip on the ball. Once again, though, the difference shows up most clearly in wet conditions, when the Patriots average 1.35 fumbles per game and their opponents average 2.15 fumbles per game, Logan said.On Thursday, both Tom Brady, who has been the Patriots’ starting quarterback since 2001, and Bill Belichick, the team’s coach since 2000, denied tampering with the footballs.Tony Miller, the director of Golden Nugget’s Race & Sports Book in Las Vegas, said he did not think the Covers findings would affect betting on the team. He also said that he had no idea whether the figures had anything to do with the footballs. But he did say that the figures would stand out to an oddsmaker.“I thought we won the game fair and square,” Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said of Sunday’s A.F.C. championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. New England used underinflated balls.“I would definitely call that more of an anomaly, for sure,” Miller said. “Being in the business these many years, I’ve never looked into a stat like that with that type of percentage and winning — that kind of numbers.”AdvertisementJohn Avello, the executive director of race and sports operations at Wynn Las Vegas, said it was nearly impossible to ascertain if New England had used deflated balls, but he was astonished at how little scrutiny the N.F.L. gives the balls that are the central piece of equipment.“What I am most disappointed about is balls being used that presumably fit a QB like a pair of shoes,” Avello said. “I like the randomness that a ball could slip or not be thrown as a perfect spiral because a particular ball may not have the feel of another. If you let Madison Bumgarner bring his own balls to the park, opponents would be fortunate to get foul tips,” he said, referring to the pitcher for the San Francisco Giants.R. J. Bell, a betting expert at Pregame.com, said that if nothing else, the episode revealed how little scrutiny the league gave the balls.“Considering the N.F.L. is a billion-dollar business, it’s surprising how big of a role the honor system plays — like a high school tennis match,” Bell said.A version of this article appears in print on January 24, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: In Rain and Snow, It’s Clear That Patriots Are a Good Bet.
