But the kick was low, and Patrick Gamble got a hand on it.While most of the Yellow Jackets celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, which was rolling inside Georgia Tech’s 25-yard line.

But he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench. He avoided Aguayo’s diving tackle and then cut back on the final Florida State player with a chance to stop him to win the game for the Yellow Jackets (3-5, 1-4).AdvertisementGeorgia Tech kicker Harrison Butker tied the score, 16-16, with his third field goal of the game, a 35-yarder, with 54 seconds left.AdvertisementU.S.C. 42, UTAH 24 Cameron Smith returned the second of his three interceptions 54 yards for a touchdown, and host Southern California handed No. 3 Utah its first loss.Ronald Jones II, Justin Davis and fullback Soma Vainuku rushed for scores to help the Trojans (4-3, 2-2 Pacific-12) halt a two-game skid and earn a victory for the interim coach Clay Helton in his debut at the Coliseum.Cody Kessler passed for 264 yards and a touchdown and rushed for another score, while JuJu Smith-Schuster had eight catches for 143 yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown that wrapped up the win.Britain Covey caught two touchdown passes for the Utes (6-1, 3-1), whose eight-game winning streak ended.OHIO STATE 49, RUTGERS 7 J.
