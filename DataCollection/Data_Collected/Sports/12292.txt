That way, they could play Dilson Herrera, a sure-handed second baseman. But it also seemed risky, playing Murphy at a position where he did not have extensive experience.During the second inning Saturday, the Nationals had runners on second and third with two outs when Michael Taylor hit a sharp ground ball to third. Murphy dived and appeared to snag the ball, briefly. But as he landed, it squirted away.“I had it in my glove,” Murphy said afterward, full of regret.It was a difficult play, but maybe one Wright would have made. A run scored, and the Nationals went on to win the game, 1-0. Gio Gonzalez, the Nationals’ starter, suffocated any chance the Mets had at a comeback. He threw seven scoreless innings, compiling nine strikeouts.The Mets’ best chance to score came and went in the first inning when Juan Lagares was thrown out at home trying to score from first on a double by Lucas Duda.
