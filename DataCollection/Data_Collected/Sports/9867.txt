PORTLAND, Ore. —  The weight of national championship aspirations did not slow second-seeded Arizona on Thursday, as the Wildcats breezed to a 93-72 victory over No. 15 Texas Southern.The Wildcats (32-3) zipped to a 15-2 lead in the game’s first five minutes, snuffing any possible drama and turning the game into a bench-emptying exhibition of Arizona’s depth. By halftime, it was 54-33, and Arizona had made 20 of 29 field-goal attempts (69 percent) and all 12 of its free throws. The Wildcats shot 60 percent for the game.Still, Arizona prides itself as a top defensive team, and Coach Sean Miller, happy with the result, was not satisfied with the method, which allowed Texas Southern’s guard-heavy lineup to shoot 47 percent from the field.“I know we won by a big margin,” Miller said. “But we have high aspirations, and in this tournament, you don’t get a second chance.”AdvertisementRondae Hollis-Jefferson led Arizona with 23 points, 16 in the first half, and 10 rebounds. Stanley Johnson added 22 points as all five Arizona starters finished in double figures.AdvertisementTexas Southern’s Madarious Gibbs led the Tigers with 15 points. But once behind minutes after tip-off, the Tigers never mustered a meaningful run to reverse Arizona’s momentum.

But that team was without the 6-foot-9 forward Brandon Ashley, whose midseason foot injury kept him out of the postseason.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Its winning streak is now 12 games. Anything short of 17 would be considered a disappointment.A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Arizona Shoots Past Texas Southern.
