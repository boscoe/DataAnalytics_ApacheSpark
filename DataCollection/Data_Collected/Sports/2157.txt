For hundreds of New York City Marathon runners, the first line they encounter on the day of the race is along the orange rails on the outer deck of the Staten Island Ferry, where they jostle for space to photograph the Statue of Liberty, illuminated in an otherwise dark, predawn sky.The first wave of nonprofessionals did not start until 9:50 a.m. Sunday, leading to hours of idle time often spent standing in groups. While the main focus of the day is running 26.2 miles, the path to get to the starting line can be equally frustrating.To combat the doldrums, many runners find solace in an early morning 25-minute ferry ride, which offers tranquillity, time to loosen the joints or eat a quick breakfast and, depending on the time of the day, picturesque views of New York Harbor.“I think it’s amazing,” said Lauren Bell, from London, who ran the marathon for the first time and took the first ferry for runners leaving Manhattan at 5:30 a.m. “This is part of the reason I signed up.”AdvertisementMany of the hundreds who joined Bell on Sunday’s maiden voyage were hoping to get a spot on a 6:30 a.m. bus that would shuttle them from the terminal in Staten Island to the starting area.AdvertisementDuring the trip, only the white foamy waves created by the ferry were visible in the water, and brisk winds whipped the faces of runners huddled in blankets or dressed in cow costumes. Without much water traffic yet, the sounds of cellphones shuttering as patrons took selfies provided most of the ambient noise.Activity increased as the sky turned blue. From 7 to 8 a.m., the ferry terminals began to resemble rush hour during the holidays at other stations of entry and exit throughout the city.While the ferry ride is free, it does come with sacrifices, most notably sleep. Ryan Smith and Silke Koester, from Boulder, Colo., woke up at Koester’s sister’s place on the Upper West Side at 4:30 a.m. They boarded a No. 1 train by 4:50 a.m., which held a mix of late Halloween revelers trying to keep their heads from nodding over and fellow runners holding clear plastic bags containing their preparation items, many sitting with focused glares and hands clenched forward.Sam Teichman, who sells beer and programs at Citi Field, left Game 4 of the World Series just past midnight and had three hours of sleep before waking up to run the marathon.Because of slow subway service — the No. 1 train was not running to South Ferry on Sunday — Teichman missed his planned ferry departure in Lower Manhattan at 7 a.m. He lined up with hundreds of other runners hoping to get on the next ferry, 15 minutes later.“This is life for the next 90 minutes,” Teichman said. “This mass of humanity you’re a part of. You can try to go faster, but there’s no place to go.”At 7:22, an announcement said the next departing ferry was full. A collective groan came from inside the terminal. Some runners, like Chelsea Wild, from Brooklyn, used the time to apply fluorescent green kinesiology tape to their legs to reduce the pounding their knees would take. Others remained in line, beginning to sweat pressed against the bodies of fellow runners.AdvertisementBut once the glass doors opened and runners flocked onto the ferry, a level of peace was attained.Courtney Hughes found a spot at the front of the ferry, stretched back her arms and looked out onto the water as it sailed by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.

They are not closed to the public, but finding a regular commuter in a business suit was less common than seeing a runner dressed in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costume.A representative of New York Road Runners said that more than 50 percent of the field used official provided transportation methods, including buses leaving from the New York Public Library at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue and from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Outside, hundreds more waited their turn at one of 39 portable restrooms.Teichman, who planned to head to Citi Field to work Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday night shortly after finishing, has raced nine times and become used to a day that is full of miniraces. “The whole day is hurry up and wait,” he said.Teichman expected not to leave work until after midnight again, but he decided months ago that the entire race-day experience, including the ferry, was one not to be missed.“Kind of like the stadium, I love sort of seeing the city come alive,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on November 2, 2015, on Page F4 of the New York edition with the headline: Mad Dash at the Start Seeks Berths on a Ferry.
