Anna Pogorilaya took bronze. The Russians were way ahead of the rest of the field. Two Swedish sisters, Joshi and Viktoria Helgesson, finished fourth and fifth, but more than 20 points behind Pogorilaya.Tuktamysheva’s program puts her through several personas, beginning with sedately mysterious strains and reaching an intense, percussive climax four minutes later. “I’ve worked a lot on that; I wanted to show a lot of emotions so it doesn’t get boring for the judges and spectators,” she said.The free skate began with a triple lutz-double toe loop-double loop cascade, followed quickly by a second lutz of notable height. Well after the two-minute mark, she managed a triple salchow-double axel that she said was the watershed point. “I felt good after I did the second lutz, and then the best moment was when I landed the triple salchow-double axel,” she said. “I was like, ‘Yes!’ ”Radionova skated to excerpts from Rachmaninoff’s music and like Tuktamysheva landed seven clean triples, along with two double axels in succession. She raised her leg behind her head in a Bielmann spin at the conclusion.The Russian podium sweep was heartening to all three skaters. “It’s not a shame that I lost to these two girls,” Pogorilaya said.Russia had also been the last country to take all three European women’s medals, in 2002.
