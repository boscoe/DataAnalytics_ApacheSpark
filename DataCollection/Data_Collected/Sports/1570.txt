Each episode sees MacNeil reviewing real-life experiences, big and small, and rating them on a scale of zero to five stars. The reviews run the gamut from seemingly innocent things like engaging in a pillow fight or eating an absurd number of pancakes, to more disturbing things like divorcing or being buried alive. The results are usually hilarious, and sometimes tragic, though often still darkly funny.It might be interesting to see MacNeil review what it’s like to be an N.F.L. fan who attends the games played in London. It must be a forlorn experience. The teams dispatched to play there seem to be consistently unremarkable, the games almost always double as cures for insomnia and they typically do not mean much in the N.F.L.’s grand scheme of things.This week does not get much better. Are you ready for a sizzling Blake Bortles vs. E.J. Manuel quarterback matchup, Londoners? It’s hard to imagine Forrest giving this game more than half a star.PICK: BILLSAdvertisement
