Quarterback Tyrod Taylor has gotten much of the attention by stabilizing a position that has seemingly been in flux since Jim Kelly retired. But beyond Taylor, the Bills have also succeeded because of strong play by two rookies and two reclamation projects.The rookies, Ronald Darby and Karlos Williams, both drafted out of Florida State, in the second and fifth rounds, have had to do some intense on-the-job training. Darby, forced to start at cornerback when Leodis McKelvin was injured, has been picked on heavily by opposing teams but has held his own with 10 passes defended. Williams, a running back, has a touchdown in each of the team’s three games, and last week, when LeSean McCoy was forced out, he rushed 12 times for 110 yards.Meanwhile, Buffalo has also received solid production from guard Richie Incognito and wide receiver Percy Harvin. The talented pair had seen their public image tarnished over the last few seasons, but they appear to have found a home with Coach Rex Ryan and are playing a big part in the team’s success.The Giants may have the more impressive trophy case, but for right now the Bills are New York’s best (and, technically, only) team.Pick: BillsAdvertisement
