COLUMBUS, Ohio —  Archie Miller’s quest to transform the Dayton Flyers into a college basketball power started in a dim and dilapidated gymnasium just southwest of the university’s main campus on the banks of the Great Miami River.That journey reached a climax in the N.C.A.A. tournament last year, when the program made its first showing in three decades in the tournament’s round of 8.“I think building the program to last is something that we talk about year in, year out,” Miller, Dayton’s coach, said Saturday. Last year, he added, “was special — it created that confidence in what we do. It’s carried over to this year that the confidence of that run has stayed intact.”Indeed, the 11th-seeded Flyers earned a spot on the sport’s biggest stage once again despite fielding a roster with just six scholarship players. This season, however, some have argued that the postseason run was aided by what could be considered three consecutive home games. On Friday night, Dayton upset No. 6-seeded Providence in Columbus, about an hour’s drive from its campus, two days after escaping Boise State by 1 point in a play-in game on its home court. The Flyers’ tournament run ended Sunday with a 72-66 loss to Oklahoma in the round of 32, also in Columbus.AdvertisementTo be sure, the dynamic made for a buzzing and booming scene in Columbus, where Dayton fans filled the streets around Nationwide Arena, one of eight sites hosting games in the rounds of 64 and 32. But the potential for inequity cast a cloud over the weekend.AdvertisementDan Gavitt, the N.C.A.A. vice president for men’s basketball championships, said it was “unfortunate” if, in perception or reality, circumstances were not “as equitable as possible.”“That is what the committee strives for,” he said.In last year’s tournament, the Flyers became the protagonists in a basketball fairy tale. They upset Ohio State, an in-state foe and a Big Ten power, and toppled Syracuse, a dominant presence in the sport, before falling to the Florida Gators. It was the program’s best postseason outing since 1984 and has become the foundation for what Miller calls a rising program.Yet if the Flyers were something of an unexpected success story last year, they have shifted into a more checkered role. The notion that they are the beneficiaries of unusual home-court support has been met with criticism from fans and others involved in the sport.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            Miller, whose team was the last at-large program selected for the tournament, played down that notion on Saturday.“The fact that we’re in Columbus, I’m not sure that plays a big role in our guys’ heads other than the fact that they know when they take the floor we’re going to have a great fan base,” he said.“It’s hard for me to be negative about being here,” he added. “It’s hard for me to apologize for making the tournament. It’s hard for me to apologize to our guys getting ready to play six games in 10 days. I don’t think I have to apologize for anything — for what we’re trying to accomplish or where we’re doing it.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

And I think our guys, being put in the first four, immediately started to play the card of that’s unfair. I don’t know what’s unfair about somebody telling us that we’re in the tournament. I think that’s the greatest thing in the world. Now, they told us where to play.”Because of timing, geography and what Gavitt called “very unusual circumstances,” the Flyers continued their postseason march in Columbus.AdvertisementGavitt said that Columbus had been “the only option” among the four regions for scheduling the Flyers’ games.“There was no really other option without moving them up or down a seed line or moving them out of the first four altogether,” he said.As a result, the passionate Dayton fan base turned what was supposed to have been a neutral site into a den of red and blue that might have given the Flyers an edge against the Friars.“We don’t worry about it,” Oklahoma Coach Lon Kruger said before the game. “Fair or unfair — that doesn’t even come up. We’re playing Dayton with a crowd that’s going to be pro-Dayton. But again, that’s the way it is. We’re not going to worry about it. We understand it adds to the challenge.”Still, the notion of inequity has lingered.Gavitt said: “The reality of that — given the complexity of where the tournament is hosted and keeping conference opponents apart and doing all the other things that you’re trying to kind of create a balanced and equitable championship — is that it’s not always perfect.”A version of this article appears in print on March 23, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Concerns Over Geography Leave Mark on a Postseason Run.
