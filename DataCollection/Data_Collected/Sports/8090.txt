CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times        BEAVER CREEK, Colo. — When the Alpine world ski championships came to the United States this month for the first time since 1999, the 13-day event was quickly defined by two competitive challenges taking place simultaneously.Could American ski racers back up their strong performance at the 2014 Sochi Olympics with another convincing showing, even with the worldwide ski community watching more closely than ever?And could a coalition of United States ski racing leaders show that the sport — aided by sophisticated broadcast technology — could capture a larger foothold in the crowded American sporting marketplace?With the world championships ending Sunday, the United States ski team, led by a mix of new and established stars, will leave Colorado with five medals, the second most of any country. Only the perennial ski power Austria, which won nine medals, will have more.AdvertisementInternational ski officials were impressed by the more than 200,000 fans who flocked to the resorts of Beaver Creek and Vail in the last two weeks, and encouraged by record television ratings for ski racing in the United States. They concluded their visit to the Rocky Mountains by talking about staging the championships in America more often. They may add more World Cup tour stops here, as well. Even a race in the Northeastern United States is being considered.Advertisement“With full stadiums and pioneering television coverage, we were thrilled with the championships,” said Sarah Lewis, the secretary general of the International Ski Federation, ski racing’s ruling body, known as FIS. “They certainly exceeded expectations and were a great step forward for ski racing in North America.”With the American stars Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin each winning gold medals in dramatic fashion in the final days of the event, the United States ski team will go out on a high note, matching its medal total in Sochi.Ligety also won a bronze medal in the super combined, and on the first day of the competition, Lindsey Vonn won a bronze medal in the super-G. The most symbolic outcome for the American team might have been Travis Ganong’s surprising second-place finish in the downhill. The breakout silver medal performance by Ganong, 26, came just two days after the longtime king of American ski racing, Bode Miller, 37, had a horrific crash that may have ended his career.The Austrian men’s team, led by the three-time defending World Cup overall champion Marcel Hirscher, appeared poised for a medal bonanza at the championships. But in the end, the Austrian men did the same as they did at the 2014 Winter Games, winning two races and finishing second in another.Among the women, the duel for overall supremacy between Tina Maze of Slovenia and Anna Fenninger of Austria continued to heat up. Fenninger, who showed her promise at last year’s Olympics, continued to impress in big races, winning the super-G and the giant slalom and finishing second in the downhill. Maze countered with three medals, including gold in the downhill and the super combined.Off the racecourse, a chief development at the championships involved innovative broadcasting methods, which might have attracted new American viewers and prospective young ski racers.
                Some of the top ski racers in the world describe the sounds of a World Cup downhill.            In addition to more than 70 hours of live coverage on American television (ski racing in Europe is almost always shown on a tape delay in North America), the broadcast crew for this year’s world championships used as many as 200 camera positions to capture the racing over the two weeks. Broadcasters used five super-slow-motion cameras, which displayed images at a rate of 2,500 frames per second, about 100 times the standard rate used in television. A camera affixed to an overhead cable also followed racers down the racecourses for more than 800 yards.Advertisement“I never got to watch a world championships in this way growing up,” Shiffrin said. “I think a lot of kids sitting in living rooms across America will be inspired to try our sport. It’s been so engaging — you can feel the speed, the terrain and the tactics. This kind of mainstream television exposure could be huge.”Lewis said that the 2015 world championships would leave a legacy for broadcasting of ski racing and that the Vail/Beaver Creek organizing committee had set a new standard for the championships in a variety of ways. FIS is expected to discuss bringing the event back to Colorado in the future.Since many national teams travel to Colorado to train in November, Lewis said there would be discussions about adding another World Cup race or two early in the season. There are currently two World Cup stops in the United States: two women’s races in Aspen, Colo., in late November and three men’s races at Beaver Creek in early December.“There are many U.S. ski resorts who would want to host a World Cup race,” said Tiger Shaw, the chief executive of the United States Ski and Snowboard Association. “And many that would do a great job.”Shaw added that he thought there were several ski areas in the Northeastern United States that would be suitable sites for World Cup races. As early as the 1960s, World Cup Alpine races were held in New England and upstate New York, but it has been many years since one has been held in the Northeast.At the final competition of the championships on Sunday, the men’s slalom, fans packed a four-story grandstand. Virtually every race drew capacity crowds, and in many cases, a few thousand fans hiked up the hill to get even closer to the action.Standing in the snow alongside the racecourse Sunday, one spectator held a sign above her head. It read: “Thanks for the thrills! Come back soon.”A version of this article appears in print on February 16, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: U.S. Revels in Victories and Its Rising Status in a Sport.
