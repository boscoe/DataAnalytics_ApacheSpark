MAJOR LEAGUE FASTBALL2 FT.Two feet.That is the difference between the average major league fastball and the fastballs thrown by the Mets’ postseason starters. For every mile an hour faster, the ball is about six inches farther on its path when it crosses the plate.So it is no wonder that teams are increasingly stocking their rotations with harder-throwing pitchers.This season, nearly one of every 10 pitches was 95 m.p.h. or faster, almost twice the rate from just eight years ago.Now batters face a steady stream of these superfast pitches, with starters and relievers combining to throw more than 60,000 pitches that were 95 or more this season.No pitching staff typifies this trend quite like the Mets’ rotation.20%Mets15%10%PERCENT OF PITCHES 95 M.P.H.

The Mets’ four postseason starters, Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz, regularly throw in the high 90s. Closer Jeurys Familia and Hansel Robles add high-speed pitches out of the bullpen.1. Gerrit ColePirates2. Noah Synder­gaardMets3. Garrett RichardsAngels4. Matt HarveyMets5. Yordano VenturaRoyals6.

The Royals, the Mets’ opponents in the World Series, along with two other postseason teams, the Cardinals and the Pirates, each had two.Syndergaard, who regularly reached 98 to 100 on his pitches, was second in the majors in high-velocity pitches thrown, even though his major league debut came a month into the season. In all, he threw 1,421 pitches that were clocked at or above 95.Harvey spent 2014 rehabilitating after Tommy John surgery, but he returned this season without any apparent loss of velocity.Of the five relievers who made the top 20, two will appear in the World Series: the Royals’ Kelvin Herrera and the Mets’ Familia. The others were Trevor Rosenthal, Aroldis Chapman and Arquimedes Caminero.For the game’s best hitters, 98 is the new 94. They are finding ways to get good swings at pitches that seemed nearly unhittable not that long ago.In the postseason, deGrom has given up two home runs, both on pitches above 95 m.p.h. It is still true that to get good hitters out, pitchers need to vary their speeds and use pitches that change direction — two things the Mets’ starters have done with great success this postseason.Four-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedRegular seasonPostseasondeGromFour-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedRegular seasonPostseasondeGromFour-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedReg. seasonPostseasondeGromdeGromFour-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedReg. seasonPostseasonDuring the regular season, deGrom used his four-seam fastball (his fastest and straightest pitch) about 47 percent of the time. But against the lineups in the postseason, he has mixed in more two-seamers, which have a bit more lateral movement. And to keep the Dodgers’ and Cubs’ hitters from simply gauging the speed of his fastball, he has also made more use of his off-speed pitches, the curve and the changeup.Four-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedRegular seasonPostseasonHarveyFour-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedRegular seasonPostseasonHarveyFour-seam fastballTwo-seamSliderOff-speedReg. seasonPostseasonHarveyHarveyTwo-seamSliderOff-speedFour-seam fastballReg. seasonPostseasonHarvey has not strayed too far from his regular-season formula. But he has often done what is called pitching backward — reversing the order of pitches usually used by hard throwers. Fireballers often start hitters with the hard stuff, getting them to begin their swings early. Then they throw off the hitters’ timing with off-speed pitches. Against the Cubs, Harvey used his curve and changeup early in the game and early in the count.Four-seam fastballSinkerSliderOff-speedRegular seasonPostseasonSyndergaardFour-seam fastballSinkerSliderOff-speedRegular seasonPostseasonSyndergaardSinkerFour-seam fastballSliderOff-speedReg. seasonPostseasonSyndergaardSyndergaardSinkerSliderOff-speedFour-seam fastballReg. seasonPostseasonSyndergaard throws harder than any other Mets starter. But in the playoffs, he has used more sinkers and sliders, pitches that have more downward or lateral movement than his four-seam fastball, which can reach 100 m.p.h.Note: A small percentage of pitches do not have speed data.Sources: PITCHf/x; Pitch Info / Brooksbaseball.net.Photographs by Kirk Irwin/Getty Images (deGrom), John Bazemore/Associated Press (Harvey) and Jayne Kamin-Oncea/USA Today Sports, via Reuters (Syndergaard)Advertisement
