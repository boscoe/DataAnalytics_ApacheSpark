Week 5 scores and highlightsThough the Falcons have jumped out to a 4-0 start, looking like a different team under their new coach, Dan Quinn, not everyone in Atlanta is happy. Specifically, the star wide receiver Roddy White seems disturbed to be doing more blocking than catching in a system implemented by the Falcons’ new offensive coordinator, Kyle Shanahan.“For me, at the end of the day, I want to catch passes,” White told ESPN, adding forcefully and coarsely that blocking was “not what I want to do.”White later attempted to dial back his comments, but he was excused from practice Wednesday for personal reasons and rumors were swirling that the team might be trying to trade him.On the other side of the field, Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins, fresh off a game in which he directed the winning drive in the waning moments, praised Shanahan, formerly Washington’s offensive coordinator, for his role in his development.“I learned a lot about football in the two seasons with him,” Cousins said.PICK: FALCONSAdvertisement
