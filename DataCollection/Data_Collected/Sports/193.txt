Sam Bradford has looked like a bad fit at quarterback and has spent most of the season throwing short passes to his running backs that get nowhere. The team has had only two plays of 25 yards or more, and the humdrum execution has been reflected on the scoreboard with the Eagles averaging 19.3 points a game, tied for 21st in the N.F.L. Relying on the other team to trot out an even worse offense does not seem like a great strategy, but it should work this week for Philadelphia.Pick: EaglesAdvertisement
