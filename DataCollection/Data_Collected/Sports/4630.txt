Week 14 scores and highlightsWhat’s new in the continuing N.F.L. soap opera “The Long Philly Days and Nights of Chip Kelly”? Well, Kelly indicated that he would like to talk to the former Eagles running back LeSean McCoy, who now starts for the Bills. McCoy, after being traded from Philadelphia in the off-season, accused Kelly of trying to ship off all the Eagles’ best black players.“I’d love to shake LeSean’s hand,” Kelly said on a conference call, adding that he had tried to call McCoy after the trade.McCoy told the news media that he had no desire to reconnect with Kelly.“I’m not talking to Chip,” McCoy said Wednesday. “We got nothing to talk about. He can’t call me. He can’t shake my hand. There’s nothing he can do with me.”He added, “I don’t dislike him; I don’t have nothing against him,” which, wild guess, might not be entirely true.Kelly’s current starting running back, DeMarco Murray, reportedly went to the Eagles’ owner, Jeffrey Lurie, to complain about the way Kelly was using him after he was on the field for only 14 plays in Philadelphia’s 35-28 victory against New England last week.PICK: BillsAdvertisement
