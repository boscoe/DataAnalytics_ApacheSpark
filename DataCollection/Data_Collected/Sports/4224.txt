There’s a reason why we focused on him as one of our top priorities.”Samardzija was the third pitcher of the week to agree to a large contract. David Price joined the Boston Red Sox on a seven-year, $217 million deal, and on Friday night, Greinke chose the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Giants and the Los Angeles Dodgers, his former team.Samardzija won 11 games last season for the Chicago White Sox for his first double-digit victory total in eight seasons in the major leagues, going 11-13 with a 4.96 E.R.A. in 32 starts. Samardzija, a 30-year-old right-hander, spent the second half of the 2014 season pitching in the Bay Area with the Oakland Athletics after a trade from the Chicago Cubs. His 214 innings in 2015 were the second-highest total of his career.“This guy’s a horse; even in tough times in what they were doing in Chicago, he still put 200-plus innings on the board,” Evans said. “His numbers may be affected by the third place he’s pitched in two years. There may be some mechanical adjustments he needs to make.”Advertisement
