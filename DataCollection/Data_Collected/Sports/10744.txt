It was a big night for box scores in the N.B.A., and a big night for James Harden in his battle with Stephen Curry for the Most Valuable Player Award.■ Harden put up a career-high 51 points in a 115-111 home win for the Houston Rockets over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night. It was the seventh 50-point game of the season, and Harden joined Kyrie Irving as the only players to do it twice. (The others were Klay Thompson, Mo Williams and Curry.)Harden shot 16 for 25, including 8 for 9 from 3-point range. That .889 3-point percentage is the highest this year for a player taking at least eight 3s. The last time it was exceeded was in March 2012 when Ben Gordon was 9 for 9 for the Detroit Pistons, according to statistics from Basketball-Reference.com.Harden’s big game will certainly catch the eyes of M.V.P. voters, as that race seems to narrow down to Harden and Curry.Harden is averaging 28 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists, while Curry is at 24/4/8. In Curry’s favor is that the team he leads, the Golden State Warriors, is the league’s best, at 61-13, 10.5 games ahead of Harden’s Rockets.AdvertisementThe Warriors have also come out on top all four times the two players lined up against each other this season, with Curry averaging 26 points and Harden 25. They do not meet again in the regular season, but could in the conference finals.Advertisement■ M.V.P. Awards are not usually won at the free throw line, but Harden is racking up points there this season. On Wednesday, he was 11 for 13. His 752 free throws attempted this season is by far the best in the league, with only Russell Westbrook and DeMarcus Cousins also over 500. His 651 free throws made leads Westbrook by more than 150.Curry has been to the line only 317 times this season, but seldom misses there, shooting a league-leading 92 percent.■ Speaking of Cousins, he had a huge effort in defeat for Sacramento in the Houston game, scoring 24 points, and adding 21 rebounds and 10 assists. He is the first player with 20 points, 20 rebounds and 10 assists in a game since David Lee did it for the Knicks in April 2010.Both of those efforts came in losses. To find a player putting up those numbers when his team won, you have to go back to Chris Webber in 1999.■ In Oklahoma City, three Thunder players, Westbrook, who is also a possible M.V.P. candidate, Enes Kanter and Anthony Morrow (off the bench) each scored 30 points or more. Despite their heroics, the Thunder lost to the Mavericks, 135-131.The last time three teammates scored 30 was in March 2012, according to Stats Inc., when Westbrook, Kevin Durant and Harden did it for the Thunder against the Phoenix Suns. (The Thunder did manage to win that game.)No team has had three 30-point scorers in a loss since Portland (Isaiah Rider, Brian Grant, Arvydas Sabonis) lost to Phoenix in quadruple overtime in 1997.■ Chris Paul scored 41 and had 17 assists in a 126-122 Clippers victory at Portland. It was the first 40/15 game of the season, and only the ninth since 1985-86. Paul also did it last season, joining LeBron James as the only players to accomplish it twice in that span. He is on track to lead the league in assists this year for the fourth time in his career.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
