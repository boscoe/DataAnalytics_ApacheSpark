That looked as if it would be an issue this week, with Bene Benwikere, who had been manning the No. 2 corner spot, breaking his leg against Atlanta. The options to replace Benwikere appeared limited until Charles Tillman, who has been out with a knee injury, practiced during the week and may be ready to reclaim his starting role.On offense, quarterback Cam Newton has been impressive manufacturing offense with a ragtag group of wide receivers, but the Panthers will lose some flexibility with running back Jonathan Stewart out with a foot injury. It could be even worse for Carolina if tight end Greg Olsen is limited by a knee injury he aggravated last week.The Giants beat the 13-0 Denver Broncos in 1998 and the 18-0 New England Patriots in the 2007 Super Bowl, and they may be poised to take down another unbeaten this weekend.PICK: GiantsAdvertisement
