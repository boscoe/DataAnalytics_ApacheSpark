U.S.G.A.â€™s previous research projects have focused on turf grass, but the Minnesota partnership will examine topics like the cost of the game, the time it takes to play, its accessibility and golfer enjoyment. The study will use the campus golf course as a laboratory and is expected to involve the schools of business, public affairs, engineering and agriculture in its transdisciplinary approach.
