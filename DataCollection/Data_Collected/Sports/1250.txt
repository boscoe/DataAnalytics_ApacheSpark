CreditGregory Bull/Associated Press        Daniel Murphy hit 14 home runs for the Mets this season, the highest figure in his seven-year career. He is, and always has been, a doubles hitter, not a slugger, and yet in the 2015 postseason he has hit five homers in seven games, and all of the blasts have come off elite pitchers.So what gives? Who knows for sure? Except that the 30-year-old Murphy will become a free agent after the season, and all this postseason power can only drive up the price of his next contract. A contract, it should be noted, that may not be with the Mets.For now, though, the Mets and their fans can savor the fact that their steady-hitting second baseman with the unpredictable glove and an adventurous approach to base running is on a roll no one could have foreseen.He is, after all, just three home runs short of the record for a postseason, which is eight, held by Barry Bonds (San Francisco, 2002), Nelson Cruz (Texas, 2011) and Carlos Beltran (Houston, 2004). And if Murphy hits another home run in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series on Tuesday night in Chicago, that will give him five straight games with a ball over the fence, tying the mark held by Beltran, his former Mets teammate.Talk about October surprises. Murphy is at the top of the list.A version of this article appears in print on October 20, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: High (and Far) Five.
