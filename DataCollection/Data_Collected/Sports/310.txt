Odubel Herrera doubled and then scored on a double to right field by Darnell Sweeney in the bottom of the eighth inning in Philadelphia, where the Phillies beat the Marlins, 7-2.Suzuki threw curveballs and sliders and reached 88 miles per hour on his fastball.Since joining the Seattle Mariners in 2001, Suzuki had played in 2,356 regular-season games before being allowed to pitch. He has had one of the strongest arms among position players in the majors, accounting for 116 career outfield assists.As he warmed up before the inning, television shots showed Jennings and Marlins players and coaches smiling in anticipation.Suzuki threw 18 pitches and recorded 11 strikes, getting one groundout and two flyouts. When he went back to the dugout after the inning, he was greeted by his teammates as if he had gotten out of a bases-loaded jam.Suzuki is a free agent at the end of the season, and he said in an interview Friday that the most likely possibility was for him to return to the Marlins next year. He needs 65 hits to reach 3,000 — not counting the 1,278 he accumulated during his career in Japan — and said he felt physically well enough to play until he was 50.Advertisement
