Tom Coughlin said on Thursday that Cruz would resume his rehabilitation from the injury, which has kept him out of practice and games for more than six weeks.Cruz has not played since Oct. 12, 2014, when he ruptured the patellar tendon in his right knee.“Obviously, we’re all disappointed, but we choose to take the road that we really don’t have a lot of choice,” Coughlin said. “Which means that we get him back in rehab, get him back to work and see when he can get on the field. He tried this week, and he didn’t make it.”With a lack of depth at wide receiver, the Giants on Tuesday worked out the veterans Wes Welker and Hakeem Nicks, a former Giant. Coughlin did not rule out signing either player.“There’s always a chance,” he said. “There’s a chance for anybody that’s out there. If the need comes around, yeah.”Coughlin described Welker as “very quick, very active” in his audition. Asked if he was concerned about Welker’s history of concussions, Coughlin replied: “We brought him in, worked him out. He was healthy, and he worked out well for us inside.”Before Wednesday, Cruz said he had no discomfort in either his surgically rebuilt right knee or the left calf. But after running a few pass routes on Wednesday, he stopped practicing.“It did not feel right to him,” Coughlin said.Coughlin also said that defensive end Robert Ayers, who missed last week’s game with a hamstring muscle strain, aggravated the injury late in Wednesday’s practice. Coughlin described left tackle Ereck Flowers, who has an ankle sprain, as “gimpy.” But Flowers practiced in a limited capacity Thursday.Advertisement
