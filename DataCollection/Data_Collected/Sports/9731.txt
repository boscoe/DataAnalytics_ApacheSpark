KANSAS CITY, Mo. —  It takes a delicate touch to joke about your boss’s heart attack without appearing callous. The palpitations that the Iowa State basketball team gave its boisterous fans throughout the Big 12 tournament lend themselves to such risky humor, especially from Coach Fred Hoiberg, whose own heart problems prematurely ended his N.B.A. career.In Iowa State’s past five victories, three in the postseason conference tournament at Sprint Center, the Cyclones overcame double-digit deficits with a flurry of 3-pointers, dunks and up-tempo theatrics. Following these guys is not for the faint of heart. The slow starts cannot be beneficial for Athletic Director Jamie Pollard, who had a heart attack March 9 and underwent triple-bypass surgery the next day.After a quarterfinal game in which the Cyclones trailed Texas by 10 points with 3 minutes 56 seconds to play before winning, 69-67, on a Monte Morris jumper at the buzzer, Hoiberg joked at the postgame news conference that his team could have given Pollard another heart attack.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            More anxious moments followed the next night against Oklahoma. Iowa State fell 11 points behind early, then rallied to win, 67-65. The Cyclones missed two key foul shots in the final minute and held on only because Sooners forward Ryan Spangler, the Big 12’s top percentage shooter, missed a layup with three seconds to play. Hoiberg theatrically touched his chest and exhaled as he headed to shake Oklahoma Coach Lon Kruger’s hand.AdvertisementOutside the Cyclones’ locker room, Hoiberg said he had spoken to Pollard by phone earlier in the day and added, sheepishly, that he had forgotten to warn Pollard not to watch the game.AdvertisementHoiberg reprised that remark after Saturday’s championship comeback, in which his team rallied from 17 points down early in the second half to topple its budding rival Kansas, 70-66. Like a seasoned politician, Hoiberg has the innate ability to repeat something to multiple audiences while making it sound fresh. (To Iowans, he is the Mayor, after all.)“I should have told him not to watch, with the stress level,” Hoiberg said on the court while his players took turns cutting down the nets.Pollard is home resting and, according to an athletic department spokesman, will not be in attendance Thursday when Iowa State starts its N.C.A.A. tournament bid in a South Region game against Alabama-Birmingham in Louisville, Ky. If last weekend is any indication, Pollard will not be far from a television or his smartphone.Before the Big 12 championship game, Pollard, 50, taped a short video message from his Des Moines, Iowa, hospital bed for the thousands of fans jamming a pregame pep rally at an outdoor mall across from Sprint Center. With scraggly whiskers, an Iowa State ball cap on his head and the surgical scar visible above his hospital gown, a weary-sounding Pollard ended his brief remarks with: “Thank you for all your thoughts and prayers. I will be back. Go, Cyclones.”Later, in the arena, after the Cyclones had won, fans chanted Pollard’s name in the sing-songy cadence of roll call at Yankee Stadium. A fan posted video of it on Twitter, which Pollard reposted.“That brought tears to my eyes. Thank you,” he wrote.Several players said they dedicated the championship to him.“Prayers go out to Jamie Pollard,” Morris said. “He’s a great guy. We did this for him.”Hoiberg is particularly fond of Pollard, who hired him in 2010. Pollard’s gamble on a local legend with no coaching experience restored the program to a level unseen in Ames since Hoiberg rained jumpers for the storied coach Johnny Orr in the 1990s. Iowa State’s consecutive Big 12 titles are a program first.AdvertisementSince 2007, Pollard has signed the Nebraska-born and Iowa-raised Hoiberg as well as the football coach, Paul Rhoads, and the women’s basketball coach, Bill Fennelly, both Iowa natives, to contract extensions of at least 10 years.On campus, Pollard, the 1987 Division III national champion at 5,000 meters and a two-time all-American at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, is known as much for his competitiveness and his love of the Milwaukee Brewers as for his daily running regimen and careful eating habits.So Pollard’s heart attack, which occurred while he was watching daughters Annie and Maggie compete at a high school track meet in Cedar Falls, Iowa, stunned those who know him.“He said he was embarrassed he was getting all that attention, having those symptoms in front of people,” Hoiberg said of Pollard. “I said, ‘Hell, you should feel lucky you were there in that setting, to have the E.M.T.s right there, and to get him to the hospital as quickly as he did.’”Born with a heart defect, Hoiberg played without problems at Iowa State and in the N.B.A. until 10 years ago, when tests during a routine examination for a life insurance policy revealed an aortic root aneurysm. Hoiberg felt no symptoms. During emergency open-heart surgery, doctors repaired Hoiberg’s aorta with synthetic material and implanted a pacemaker in his left shoulder.Last summer, Hoiberg received a new pacemaker. He has been told the aortic valve, spared in the first surgery, must be replaced.“It’s not 100 percent that it’s this summer, but sometime in the near future,” Hoiberg said. “I don’t think it really affects me. If it was dangerous, I wouldn’t be out here.”Cyclones players said they had not been trying to stress out their coach, their fans, or even themselves. None of the three comebacks in three days were even their largest this month. The remarkable stretch dates to March 2 at Hilton Coliseum, where Iowa State made 22 consecutive points to obliterate a 20-point Oklahoma lead in a 77-70 victory.“We don’t want to come back every time, but it just seems to keep happening to us,” said the junior forward Georges Niang, Iowa State’s top scorer, who was voted the most outstanding player in the Big 12 tournament. “I’m not going to say that’s who we are. But if that’s our emergency button and that’s what we have to do, then we’re going to have to do it.”A version of this article appears in print on March 18, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: They Could Skip the Heart Pounding.
