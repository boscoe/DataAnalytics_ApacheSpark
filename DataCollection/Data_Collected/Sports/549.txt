WELLINGTON, New Zealand — The hero of Australia’s Rugby World Cup campaign so far might not be who you think it is.While the star fullback Israel Folau was the focus of attention before the tournament kicked off and flyhalf Bernard Foley was the key in the Wallabies’ 33-13 destruction of England, it is a coach behind the scenes who has proved to perhaps be the most important figure for Australia.In just a few months, the former Argentine hooker Mario Ledesma has turned the horror that was the Australian scrum into one of the team’s major weapons.Twelve months ago the Wales scrum was so dominant against the Wallabies that it won the Welsh a penalty try in Cardiff, which would have won the game had Foley not kicked a late drop goal and penalty for the Australians.AdvertisementThree weeks later, after losses at France and Ireland, the weak Australia scrum crumbled repeatedly under pressure as England won, 26-17, at Twickenham Stadium.AdvertisementBut in a remarkable turnaround, Australia won six scrum penalties against England last weekend and knocked the hosts out of the World Cup.It is all thanks to Ledesma, who played 84 tests for Argentina, a team renowned for its scrum play.Ledesma first linked up with Michael Cheika earlier this year when Cheika was head coach of both the Wallabies and the New South Wales Waratahs of Super Rugby.The 42-year-old Ledesma, who arrived in Australia on a tourist visa, initially started out as a video analyst with the Waratahs. But his input on the Waratahs’ scrummaging was so valuable that he was given a short-term deal to stay with the franchise before being offered the chance to fix the Wallabies’ scrum problems before the World Cup.That decision to get the Argentine on board has proved to be a stroke of genius.Ledesma has changed the way Australia approaches the scrum, using a method similar to what the Argentine national team does, with all eight men directing their power through the hooker while pushing hard and straight. England simply could not cope with that last weekend.Australia has rarely given away easy points by failing at a scrum this tournament. The scrum has also provided an excellent platform for Australia’s much-vaunted backs to create try-scoring opportunities, even thought the team has not always been able to finish them.That has gotten Wales forwards coach Robin McBryde wary as he prepares for Saturday’s game against Australia, which will determine who finishes first in Pool A and most likely avoids a quarterfinal against South Africa.“They’re benefiting from Ledesma as a coach, so there is a certain Argentine flavor to their scrum,” McBryde told the official World Cup website.Advertisement“It’s very much gone back to the art of scrummaging under the current laws. You have to have a different mind-set and a different approach. Australia have certainly benefited from those changes and are scrummaging well as a unit.”But even before Ledesma arrived, there were signs of positive changes this year under Cheika.Cheika took over last November after Ewen McKenzie quit as coach just days before Australia was to start its November tour of Europe. Cheika had little time to mold a group that was struggling with internal divisions between players from two competing Super Rugby franchises, the Brumbies and Waratahs.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

(There was caveat: it would apply only to those who previously had played 60 or more tests).It has meant the return of two experienced backs, Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell, who play professionally for the French club Toulon.The changes have already resulted in Australia winning one trophy in 2015, the Rugby Championship, its first title in the Southern Hemisphere tournament since 2011.AdvertisementThe changes also have set up the Wallabies for a possible World Cup title, something that would have been unthinkable 12 months ago, when most were predicting they would not get out of this year’s “Pool of Death.” No team is in better form right now than Australia, and it has a very real chance to repeat its success in the 1991 and 1999 World Cups and win its third world title on British soil.A version of this article appears in print on October 8, 2015, in The International New York Times.
