Vucevic has scored 20 or more points in seven straight games.The Magic (19-13) trailed for most of the second half but used a 9-0 run late in the third quarter to cut into what had been a double-digit deficit. They went on to outscore the Nets (9-23) by 32-20 in the fourth.“Our defense was very good on the last several possessions of the game,” Magic Coach Scott Skiles said. “That was the game right there.”Point guard Elfrid Payton, who has been hampered by a sprained right ankle, started for Orlando but played just five minutes in the first half. The team struggled at times to find rhythm without Payton, its primary ballhandler. But the Magic found a way to improve their record since Nov. 25 to 13-5, the best mark in the East.“We just couldn’t get a good shot in the fourth quarter,” Nets Coach Lionel Hollins said. “Their defense was pretty good, and it got away from us.”Hollins added, “Executing under pressure is important, and I don’t think we handled the pressure well.”MAVERICKS 114, WARRIORS 91 Golden State flopped without Stephen Curry as host Dallas routed the Warriors for just their second loss of the season.Curry, the N.B.A.’s leading scorer and reigning most valuable player, sat out for the first time this season, and a lower-leg bruise might keep him out again Thursday at Houston. But the Warriors (29-2) still have the best 31-game start in league history, a game better than four teams’.Klay Thompson could not make up for Curry’s absence, going 4 of 15 from the field and finishing with 10 points. Ian Clark led the Warriors with 21.J. J. Barea scored 23 points for Dallas, Zaza Pachulia had 14 points and 15 rebounds, and Dirk Nowitzki had 18 points in the team’s fourth straight win without the injured point guard Deron Williams.The Warriors looked out of sorts almost from the beginning with Curry, their sharpshooting star, watching from the bench in jeans and a black sport coat. The Mavericks built a 17-point lead with about three minutes to go in the first half, and Golden State never drew closer, falling behind at one point by 30.BULLS, 102, PACERS 100 Jimmy Butler tipped in a basket with 1.2 seconds left in overtime, and Chicago secured a home win despite playing without Derrick Rose.Butler scored 28 points, and Aaron Brooks had 29 points for the Bulls, who got 52 points from their bench and held Indiana to 38.1 percent shooting from the field. Rose was scratched an hour before the game with right hamstring tendinitis.Butler scored 15 points in the fourth quarter and overtime combined.Monta Ellis tied the game with a 3-pointer with 3.7 seconds left before Butler tipped in a Pau Gasol lob from atop the key. Butler then defended Paul George on a lob to preserve the win.LAKERS 112, CELTICS 104 Kobe Bryant had 15 points and 11 rebounds for his first double-double of the season while playing what was most likely his final game in Boston.Isaiah Thomas had 24 points, and Evan Turner scored 20 for the Celtics, who had won four straight.Boston trailed by 11 with just over six minutes left but used a 9-0 run to close to 100-98 on Avery Bradley’s dunk with 3:35 to go.It remained a 2-point game until Bryant hit his second 3-pointer of the quarter, making it 107-102 with 1:40 left.Bryant received a huge ovation when he was announced for the starting lineups, but he was jeered the first time he got the ball, a nod to his role in what is perhaps the league’s best rivalry.CLIPPERS 122, HORNETS 117 J. J. Redick scored 26 points, Austin Rivers added a season-best 22, and Los Angeles posted its highest point total of the season.Chris Paul had 19 points and 11 assists for the visiting Clippers, and DeAndre Jordan finished with 13 points and 13 rebounds.Kemba Walker scored 29 points for the Hornets, who announced before the game that center Al Jefferson would have arthroscopic surgery Thursday on his right knee. He is expected to miss at least six weeks.Down by 92-86 entering the fourth, Charlotte managed to cut Los Angeles’s lead to 94-93 on Lamb’s 3-point play with 10:09 remaining. But the Clippers responded with a 14-4 run.RAPTORS 94, WIZARDS 91 DeMar DeRozan had 34 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists, leading Toronto to a home win.Otto Porter led the Wizards (14-16) with 20 points and 9 rebounds.

Relying on replacements for them and for Favors has left the team playing sloppy basketball of late.SPURS 112, SUNS 79 LaMarcus Aldridge had 21 points and 12 rebounds, and San Antonio easily won its 19th straight home game to start the season.The Spurs also extended their franchise-record home winning streak to 28 straight games dating to last season.Kawhi Leonard had 19 points, Manu Ginobili added 13, and Tony Parker had 12 points and 7 assists for San Antonio, which played without Tim Duncan for the third straight game.
