BEAVER CREEK, Colo. —  The men’s super-G at the Alpine World Ski Championships was postponed Wednesday after a snowstorm in the mountains made the course unsafe and restricted visibility.The race was moved to Thursday at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and men’s downhill training for Thursday was canceled. Thursday had been a day off from racing on the championship schedule, a pause created to account for weather postponements.About four to six inches of heavy, wet snow fell in the mountains Wednesday morning, conditions that would have made the 1.2-mile racecourse hazardous. There was also some wind whistling through the trees of the Beaver Creek trails. Lower elevations just below Beaver Creek were getting rain Wednesday.“There was no way to wait to get the race in today because the forecast is for this storm to continue to 2 or 3 p.m. today and the latest possible start time was 2 p.m.,” said Markus Waldner, the race director. “The long-term forecast is for warm air from California to come in, so that should be really good looking forward.”Two of the biggest names in the sport, Bode Miller of the United States and Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, who have been injured this season, will compete in the super-G. The favorites are Kjetil Jansrud of Norway and Dominik Paris of Italy.A version of this article appears in print on February 5, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Men’s Super-G at Championships Is Delayed a Day by a Storm.
