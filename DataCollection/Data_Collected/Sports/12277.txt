SAN ANTONIO — Doc Rivers had two large problems. Seconds into the fourth quarter at AT&T Center on Thursday night, Glen Davis of the Los Angeles Clippers sprained his left ankle and hopped several times on one leg in apparent agony before tumbling like an industrial-size sack of potatoes.Rivers, the Clippers’ coach, knew that his long-term problem would have to wait — the fact that one of his more reliable reserves on an alarmingly short bench was now injured. There was nothing Rivers could do about that.The short-term problem was of greater concern. Rivers needed someone (or several someones, more likely) to remove Davis’s 290-pound body from its position on the baseline before the officials forced the Clippers to use one of their timeouts. Rivers anticipated that he would need them against the Spurs.“That’s not a normal guy to scoop off the floor,” Rivers said (it was his way of saying that Davis was not small). “But we would’ve burned that timeout, and that’s why I was screaming.”AdvertisementGame 6 of this extraordinary first-round playoff series was full of small moments that loomed large. Safely transporting Davis to the bench was merely one of them as the Clippers engineered a 102-96 victory that preserved their postseason hopes and ensured a Game 7, scheduled for Saturday night at Staples Center.Advertisement“This team is mentally tough, but we’ve got to come through it again,” Rivers said. “This series in some ways should go seven. It’s just right. That’s what should happen in this series.”It is almost a shame that one of these teams will lose this weekend. As the Clippers’ Jamal Crawford observed, the Clippers and the Spurs could just as easily be meeting in the conference finals, a tribute to the strength and balance of the West this season.Look no further than the Oklahoma City Thunder for a reminder of its perils.Despite finishing eight games above .500, the Thunder failed to qualify for the postseason and then fired their coach. The conference is a kiln. So pull up a chair, Billy Donovan, and enjoy life as a spectator for a few weeks longer.In the Clippers’ locker room about 20 minutes after the game, a track by Jay Z was playing on a small set of speakers, the volume turned way up. Blake Griffin, who had been fighting a cold in recent days, sat in a chair with his knees wrapped in ice. Leon Rose, a high-profile agent, visited with Chris Paul at his locker.In front of a large whiteboard that doubled as a historical document — the words “Have Fun!” were scrawled in the lower right corner, a remnant from the team’s pregame talk — players spoke with reporters about resolve and focus and urgency, familiar playoff tropes that actually mean something here.If the Spurs, as defending champions, are trying to sustain something special, the Clippers, after three straight premature playoff exits, are hoping to finally meet expectations.“A lot of us on our team have been watching these guys since we were kids,” Paul said of the Spurs. “You see them doing the same thing over and over again.”AdvertisementIn some ways, it is entirely fitting that the Spurs, having long ago set the N.B.A.’s standard for quiet excellence, stand in the way, even as some of their luminous parts lose a bit of luster. Manu Ginobili has seen his production wane. Tony Parker has labored on an injured hamstring. Tim Duncan, who was 38 when the series started, is now 39.San Antonio has reached other milestones in recent days. Parker became the eighth player in league history to appear in 200 career playoff games. Duncan became the first player to log 9,000 minutes in the postseason. Gregg Popovich became the third coach to win 150 playoff games, joining Phil Jackson and Pat Riley.
                A fan’s guide on what to watch and what to eat and drink on the biggest sports Saturday in years.            But change is inevitable, and nobody can slow the toll of time. Whether the Spurs tweak their roster this summer or begin a larger renovation will be something to watch.For now, San Antonio can only hope to find enough masking tape to keep everything intact for one more game.After Game 6, Popovich was critical of his players, describing them as “soft” several times. He knows that his time with this particular group has an expiration date, but he clearly wants the experience to last as long as possible. So he prodded them.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

No excuse for it. Just poor. We should be embarrassed at the way we came out for a closeout game, in every regard.”Unlike the Spurs, who have been relying on their bench throughout the series, the Clippers are driven by Paul and Griffin, who are in the fourth season of their partnership. The Clippers’ reserves contributed only 15 points in Game 6, which was nothing new. Paul and Griffin combined for 45 points and 21 assists, with one turnover.“We don’t have that kind of talent,” Popovich said. “We have to do it as a group. The ball has to move. If it doesn’t move, we have big problems.”The Spurs already have a trophy collection. But if not now for the Clippers, when? On the verge of first-round elimination, they plotted an escape from San Antonio, but nothing is guaranteed in Los Angeles. That much has been made plain in this astonishing series, with the visiting team winning four of the first six games.So fraught are these contests that home-court advantage does not exist. All the boos and cheers, all the flashing lights and hyperactive music, all the dancing mascots and T-shirt tosses? Only the game seems to matter. The Clippers, with an assist from the Spurs, made sure to produce one more.A version of this article appears in print on May 2, 2015, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Only Round One, It Feels Like More.
