In their other five games, against stronger opponents, they have been crushed by a combined 170-104, a total that would be far more lopsided if Atlanta and Miami had made serious attempts at playing defense in the second half. (It was hardly necessary as Atlanta had a 42-point lead after three quarters and Miami was up, 41-0, at halftime.)The good news for Houston is that Tennessee is still struggling to figure things out. The bad news is that Arian Foster is out for the season.If Marcus Mariota starts for Tennessee, the Titans should come away with a victory, but if Zach Mettenberger is forced to start for a second consecutive week, the outcome is anyoneâ€™s guess.PICK: TITANSAdvertisement
