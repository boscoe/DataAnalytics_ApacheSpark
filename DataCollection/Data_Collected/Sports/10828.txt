Steps Up Pressure Over New Indiana Law,” March 31: When Donald Sterling made bigoted remarks, N.B.A. athletes were at the forefront of the protests that ultimately led to his being stripped of his ownership of the Clippers. In contrast to mere words, what Indiana has done is far worse. It has embraced, by statute and the force of law, bigoted policy. Yet the Final Four athletes will still show up in Indiana and millions of people will watch and companies will pay millions for ads.All the athletes (or the N.C.A.A., which so far has simply voiced “concern”) need to do is say, “The games will be held in some other state or we do not play,” and Indiana’s policy would be revoked faster than the last minute of a basketball game.EUGENE D. COHEN, Phoenix•To the Sports Editor:I was surprised and disappointed to read the assessment by the N.C.A.A. president, Mark Emmert, that “inclusion and diversity are real touchstone values in higher education.” I thought the goal was to provide an environment where students could meet and surpass their full potential for learning and become mature and responsible citizens.I was also surprised to learn that the N.C.A.A. has become a lobbyist on such social issues as same sex-marriage and religious freedom. What gives this organization the right to speak out on these matters on behalf of their member institutions, particularly those with religious affiliations?FRANCIS T. COLEMAN, Chevy Chase, Md.Helmets a NecessityTo the Sports Editor:Re “A Push for Safety Draws an Angry Shove,” March 31: As the parent of a daughter who played lacrosse in high school and sustained a concussion from a direct hit by a ball to her head, I would have welcomed a requirement for head protection, preferably a helmet. Watch any girls’ game and you will see all the hallmarks of the boys’ game: speed, finesse and power. Just because there is no allowed physical contact does not mean there is no physical danger.LYNN FILIPSKI, New YorkMore Than a CelebrityTo the Sports Editor:Re “Portraying Bill Bradley, a Star Who Had a Sense of Where He Was,” March 29: As Bradley himself has acknowledged, the pressure of celebrity, to be all things to all people, at an age when most of us are just finding our way, was stifling. One reason he decamped to Oxford was to escape its grasp. I’ve always believed that the hallmark of Bradley’s career is not excellence per se, but his willingness to push beyond mere celebrity, to think for himself and find his own voice. It’s why Bradley said, “You’re also always working on who you are.”VIVEK VISWANATHAN, Palo Alto, Calif.•To the Sports Editor:I played on the freshman basketball team when Bill Bradley was a senior at Princeton. He was the best college basketball player I have ever seen, but, more important, he was a fine and wonderful human being. When he returned from Oxford, he was not quite the same player he was in college, but he made that Knicks team as solid as he was as a person. Our greatest loss is that he didn’t become president. He was destined to lead our country with his ideas, intelligence, ethics and inspiration.JEFFREY BOURNE, Short Hills, N.J.Advertisement
