TAMPA, Fla. —  Yankees center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury said Thursday that the mild oblique strain that had sidelined him since Sunday would not prevent him from being in the lineup on opening day, which is less than three weeks away.Ellsbury said that he felt a twinge in his side while warming up Sunday and that he notified the team when he woke up sore the next morning. The team decided Wednesday that it wanted him to have a magnetic resonance imaging test. Manager Joe Girardi expects Ellsbury to return to baseball activities early next week.Ellsbury was sidelined for the latter part of spring training last year with a calf injury, but he returned in time for the opener and had a strong start to the season. He batted .312 with 11 extra-base hits and 11 R.B.I. during April.One of the few roster spots for position players that is open for competition is backup catcher, where Austin Romine and John Ryan Murphy are competing to spell Brian McCann. Girardi said Romine (3 for 15) and Murphy (2 for 20) were pressing at the plate.“That will probably be one of our last decisions,” Girardi said.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
