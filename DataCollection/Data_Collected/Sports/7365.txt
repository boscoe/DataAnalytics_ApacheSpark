GLENDALE, Ariz. —  After a Super Bowl performance that had people raving about his toughness while questioning his team’s training staff, Julian Edelman of the New England Patriots is sure to be a hot topic in the coming weeks.Edelman, who has completed a journey from college quarterback to elite pro receiver, entered Sunday’s game as Tom Brady’s favorite target, and it was more of the same in the Patriots’ 28-24 win over Seattle: Edelman, who was targeted 12 times, finished the game with nine receptions for 109 yards. He also scored the decisive touchdown with a 3-yard catch in the fourth quarter.His achievement will come with some criticism, however.Edelman took a vicious helmet-to-helmet hit from Kam Chancellor early in the fourth quarter, got up and tried to extend the play.

Lee/The New York Times        “He made a great catch, took a great hit,” Brady said. “It was the play of the drive.”Edelman had another reception on the drive, but cameras showed him on the sideline afterward looking somewhat disoriented, and there was immediately an online outcry for the team to evaluate him for concussion symptoms.AdvertisementHe did not visibly go through the league’s concussion protocol after the hit by Chancellor, remaining in the game and even going back to return a punt, which resulted in a fair catch.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The question remains, however, if he should have been allowed back on the field.A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page D9 of the New York edition with the headline: Hit in Head, a Patriot Stays In, Leaving Questions.
