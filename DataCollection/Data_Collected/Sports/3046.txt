Behind Dalton, the Bengals are 1-3 against the Texans, with two of the losses coming in the playoffs. Dalton has tossed two touchdown passes and five interceptions in those games, with the team averaging only 16 points.The Texans have a losing record but enter this matchup only a half-game behind the Indianapolis Colts in the A.F.C. South. For Houston to have a chance against the Bengals, its J. J. Watt-led defense will have to play up to its lofty expectations from before the season and keep this a close, low-scoring game. Otherwise, Houston’s anemic offense may not be able to keep up with Cincinnati’s output. Pick: Bengals BRETT MICHAEL DYKESAdvertisement
