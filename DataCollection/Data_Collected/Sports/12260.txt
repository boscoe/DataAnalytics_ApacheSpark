Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees’ lightning rod slugger, hit his 660th home run at Fenway Park on Friday night, tying him with Willie Mays for fourth on baseball’s career home run list.Rodriguez, appearing as a pinch-hitter, belted a pitch from Junichi Tazawa in the eighth inning over the left-field wall of Fenway’s fabled Green Monster. The solo blast put the Yankees ahead, 3-2.It was the sixth home run of the season for Rodriguez, who, despite nearing his 40th birthday and returning from a yearlong suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs, has been a surprisingly significant player for the Yankees as their regular designated hitter.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            The home run provided another turn in the limelight for a player who has craved it — and has had no problem finding it, thanks to his bat and his impolitic behavior. This milestone is a melding of both.AdvertisementIt has created an awkward moment for the Yankees, who have told Rodriguez they will not honor the marketing agreement that calls for him to receive a series of $6 million bonuses for tying Mays (660), Babe Ruth (714) and Henry Aaron (755), and for tying and passing the career leader, Barry Bonds (762).AdvertisementThe Yankees say that the agreement, reached in 2007, is void because Rodriguez’s use of performance-enhancing drugs will keep them from being able to recoup the bonuses through the sale of merchandise connected to the events. Two years after the agreement, Rodriguez admitted using steroids, and six years later he was suspended for his role in the Biogenesis scandal.The bonus issue almost seemed a moot point back in 2013, when Rodriguez, after a long rehabilitation for hip surgery, returned to play the final leg of the season even as he was being hit with a mammoth drug suspension by Major League Baseball. He appeared diminished on the field and, as he appealed his suspension, lashed out at the Yankees, his own players’ union and baseball officials.
            For nearly all of Alex Rodriguez’s career, he reached home run milestones at an earlier age than any of the game’s top sluggers. But on his way to tying Willie Mays’s career mark of 660, he had injuries and was suspended, and he fell behind the pace of the other hitters he is still chasing.        800Barry Bonds762700Hank Aaron755Babe Ruth714600Willie Mays660Alex Rodriguez660500400300When Rodriguez passed the 600 milestone at age 34, he seemed destined to become the next career home run king.2001002025303540AGE AS OF JUNE 30 EACH YEARsuspended, did not play800Barry Bonds762Hank Aaron755700Babe Ruth714Willie Mays660600Alex Rodriguez660500400When Rodriguez passed the 600 milestone at age 34, he seemed destined to become the next career home run king.3002001002025303540AGE AS OF JUNE 30EACH YEARsuspended, did not playMAY 1, 2015
Rodriguez lost his appeal and sat out the 2014 season. And the relationship between Yankees management and Rodriguez turned so bitter that as spring training approached this year, there were questions whether the team would cut him despite owing him $61 million over the final three seasons of his contract, or if it would pressure Rodriguez to take an injury retirement, which would have allowed him to collect the remainder of his contract and for the Yankees to recoup the loss through insurance.Though the team has made mention of other recent milestones, such as second baseman Stephen Drew’s 100th career home run or Rodriguez’s passing Derek Jeter on the career runs scored list, it did not, until recently, mention Rodriguez’s pursuit of Mays in its daily notes to the news media.Rodriguez is also closing in on 3,000 hits — he now has — but because there is no disputed bonus tied to that achievement, the Yankees will presumably have no problem publicizing that pursuit as it heats up.For his part, Rodriguez has been well behaved in his return. The only time he has miffed the Yankees was when he showed up two days early to spring training without notifying them. He has consistently taken a humble public stance, saying he is simply happy to be playing a game he loves and that he was not sure what to expect this season. He has not expressed any displeasure about losing his third-base job to Chase Headley.General Manager Brian Cashman, who has feuded with Rodriguez in the past, struck a conciliatory tone early in spring training, saying Rodriguez’s spot on the roster was assured. And he, like Manager Joe Girardi, tempered everyone’s expectations. Even after a strong spring training, Rodriguez began the season batting seventh. He has now moved into a more customary spot, third.Advertisement“I wasn’t sure what to expect in spring training,” Girardi said last week. “But Alex is a worker and he knows how to play the game. And he’s been a really smart player for a long period of time, so if there’s anyone who can figure it out quickly, it would be Alex.”Rodriguez’s performance has moved him into the good graces of many, but not all, Yankees fans. On the road, Rodriguez has been booed, though it often seems as if it is a matter of course. As Rodriguez noted recently, he has been a popular villain since 2001, when he signed a then-record $252 million free-agent contract with the Texas Rangers.“I’m going to have some good days, some bad days and some ugly days,” Rodriguez said recently. “What I want to do all year is just enjoy the game as much as I can.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
