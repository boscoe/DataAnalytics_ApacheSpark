 Panthers (4-0) at Seahawks (2-3)4:05 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 8N.F.L. Week 6 scores and highlightsThe Seahawks were well on their way to a third consecutive win last week when Andy Dalton of the Bengals pulled off an incredible fourth-quarter comeback, erasing a 17-point deficit before beating Seattle in overtime. It was enough to make the “Kam Chancellor is back so all is well” narrative ring a bit hollow. Things will not get any easier against the Panthers, a team that runs the ball well, limits opposing runners and boasts a league-leading plus-8 turnover differential.Running back Marshawn Lynch will return this week, but the Seahawks were in good hands with the rookie Thomas Rawls. Both will be needed against a Panthers defense that allows just 92 yards a game on the ground, sixth in the N.F.L.The Seahawks are nearly unbeatable at home, winning 28 of their last 30 in Seattle, and are talented enough to fend off the rapidly improving Panthers. But an 8-point spread seems insulting to Carolina.PICK: SEAHAWKSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
