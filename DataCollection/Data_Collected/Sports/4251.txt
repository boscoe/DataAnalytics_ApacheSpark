1 p.m. Eastern, CBSMATCHUP TO WATCH: Jets wide receivers vs. Giants cornerbacksWhen healthy, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Prince Amukamara have done a good job controlling the opposition’s top receivers, with one exception: Atlanta’s Julio Jones had 13 catches in Week 2. But the Jets’ Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker have complementary abilities that will pose a difficult challenge for the Giants’ veteran cornerbacks. Marshall and Decker have combined to make 122 catches for 1,631 yards and 17 touchdowns. The duo is averaging 13.4 yards per catch. This season, the Giants’ pass defense has been most hurt by tight ends running free in the middle of the field. But the Jets have not yet emphasized throwing to their tight ends, which may put the onus on Marshall and Decker to get open against the strength of the Giants’ secondary: Rodgers-Cromartie and Amukamara.NUMBERS TO WATCH: 12 and 24The Giants have 12 sacks, their lowest 11-game total since sacks were first tracked, in 1963.
