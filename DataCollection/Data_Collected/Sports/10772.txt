PISCATAWAY, N.J. —  The given name of Karl-Anthony Towns — the 7-foot Kentucky center who wears size 20 sneakers and just might be the N.B.A.’s next superstar big man — often came to represent two distinct personalities braided within one oversize body.There was Karl, staid and sturdy, the name of his father, the coach, the driving force behind a 3.96 high school grade point average and a rigorous basketball routine: 1,000 jump shots made, six days per week, with only Sundays off for church.And there was Anthony, the name spliced onto the end by his sister, Lachelle, bonding the boy to his mother’s Latino heritage. It was as if she knew her younger brother would need more than just basketball in his life. He would need to teach himself how to play piano; to play golf and Ultimate Frisbee; to bake cookies for his teachers; to study kinesiology; to even collect coupons.Karl and Anthony seemed to converge in name alone. At St. Joseph High School, a Catholic preparatory school in Metuchen, N.J., Towns brought the Falcons to unprecedented heights on the court, winning three state titles in three years and cementing his legacy as one of New Jersey’s most esteemed high school basketball products and the top target of Coach John Calipari of Kentucky.AdvertisementBut in classroom No. 323, on the third floor of O’Neill Hall, Towns often lingered late, hoping to discuss life and spirituality with his religion teacher, Tom Cunningham, who came to know Towns as thoughtful and introspective. They seldom talked about basketball. Though raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, Towns eagerly adopted lessons from the textbook, “Path Through Catholicism,” to inspire winding conversations, frequently ducking back to visit Cunningham during lunch hour to ask more questions.Advertisement“I think he saw my class as a perfect vehicle to express his fears,” Cunningham said. “He needed a refuge from basketball 24-7.”Towns seemed riveted by the allegorical tales about overcoming adversity, which took Cunningham by surprise. Here was a celebrated teenage phenom, gifted both athletically and intellectually.At the Final Four in Indianapolis, Towns will be the focal point of Kentucky’s momentous effort to complete an undefeated season, as he has been all year. And when the season is over, he will most likely be one of the top two picks in June’s N.B.A. draft, falling perhaps into the lap of the Knicks, whose hat hangs on the back of his bedroom door.If storm clouds were brewing, they would seem to be well off in the horizon. His appeared to be a charmed life, sustained by a steady home, a close-knit family, and an affable personality, which helped him become class president as a high school freshman. And yet he diligently prepared for choppy waters he half-expected would come. He raced through 135 high school course credits in three years, and his interest in kinetics seemed rooted in curiosity about his abnormal physical structure, how long his athletic career might realistically last.It was as if Towns actively bolstered Anthony thinking he might need to support Karl — testing out other passions, in case something happened to his main one.The KarlWhen the Towns family moved into their split-level home in Piscataway, N.J., when Karl-Anthony was around 8, they knew adjustments already needed to be made. The dining-room ceiling was raised, and a big bed was lugged into Karl-Anthony’s room. By the fifth grade, he was 6 feet 3 inches tall.He needed his own desk at school, since the round table the other children sat at was much too small for his legs to fit underneath. Children teased him. At the library, he picked out books about Shaquille O’Neal and Yao Ming to read about how other athletic giants handled their awkward formative years. Mostly, Towns longed for the moment, at 3 p.m., when his father would pick him up and take him to practice at Piscataway Technical High School, where Karl Towns coached.AdvertisementThere, even as a fifth grader, Towns practiced with the junior varsity. His mother, Jacqueline Cruz-Towns, noticed something about his ability early on: She thought he looked like a ballerina on the court.“He was so graceful, even though he was so big,” Cruz-Towns said. “That’s when I knew he was going to do something with basketball.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            His father, a coach at Piscataway Tech for 15 years, noticed the balletic movements, too, but opted to press Karl-Anthony on his fundamentals, the sort of skills that enabled him to become one of the nation’s leading rebounders for Monmouth in 1984, at only 6 feet 5 inches. Despite Karl-Anthony’s obvious size, Karl Towns wanted his son to be able to dribble, pass and defend. On Saturdays, his mother and father would stand at opposite free-throw lines for hours as Towns dribbled around cones, pulled up for jump shots or drove to the rim, just speed and agility drills, Karl Towns called it.“I didn’t want him to have any limitations,” Karl Towns said. “I made sure Karl’s game was complete.”He was almost too complete. By the summer after his freshman year, Towns already had scholarship offers from programs like Michigan State, Syracuse and Connecticut. But his coach, Dave Turco, believed he had barely scratched the surface of his athletic potential, preferring to hover toward the 3-point arc rather than bang bodies in the paint. He led the team in 3-pointers, drawing comparisons to his favorite player, Len Bias, the former Maryland swingman, whom Towns watched on VHS tapes growing up.But he worked at it, physically and mentally. He also watched tapes of Hakeem Olajuwon and Shawn Kemp, then spent hours in the gym replicating their moves. Cruz-Towns can remember him standing on top of his bed, magic marker in hand, scribbling inspirational quotes onto the walls, his handwriting large and loopy.“The Harder You Work, The Harder It Is to Give Up,” one read.“Play to Prove. Prove to Win. Win to Succeed,” said another.A third read: “Greatness Comes At A Price.”There were doubters, Karl Towns said, and he recalls plenty who thought his son’s game was too soft, his legs too skinny, his feet too big, and his personality too friendly to evolve into a successful big man at even the college level.AdvertisementAt Kentucky, the fiercest critic has been Calipari, who said he had been harder on Towns than on any player on the team this season. It is a function of his understanding that Towns can handle the appraisals, needed to toughen up — and also that Towns’s father had asked Calipari to keep the criticism coming. When Towns finished with only 1 point in 13 minutes in the round of 16 game against West Virginia, his father texted Calipari: “Stay on him, Coach. Don’t let up.”“You have to let kids know what’s right and wrong,” Karl Towns said. “That’s the problem with a lot of programs today. Everyone’s just telling kids ‘You’re great, you’re great, you’re great, you’re great.’ And they’re not great.”Towns scored 25 against Notre Dame two days later, leading the Wildcats back to the Final Four.Not long ago, Turco, St. Joseph’s coach, teased Towns about the N.B.A., and what it would be like if he was drafted by either the Knicks or the Philadelphia 76ers. Towns enjoyed that idea. He told Turco he would be able to live with his family in Piscataway to save money and simply take a car service to either city.“I’m like, ‘Karl,’ ” Turco said, shaking his head, “ ‘you really have no idea what’s about to take place.’ ”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

After school, he would eat a footlong sub before his mother’s home-cooked dinners, even after having a hefty lunch of homemade chicken, rice and vegetables and his favorite snacks, granola bars and Buncha Crunch.Grocery shopping became a weekly endeavor, straining the budget, until Towns figured out a way he could help: He started collecting coupons.On Sundays, he and his father would dash to a convenience store, grab the newspapers and gather up the inserts.“We didn’t buy nothing,” Karl Towns said. “We’d just get those coupons.”Towns was organized; he put a coupon book together. Their laundry room was soon filled with surplus food, drinks, paper towels and dish soaps. Towns loved the idea that he was helping, that he was making life easier for his parents to provide, and then he loved passing along his little secret to others.“He taught me how to coupon,” said Kelly Schnier, his guidance counselor at St. Joseph.It did not surprise her to hear that Towns painstakingly clipped and collected coupons, and then planned how he would use them to maximize savings. She knew his favorite class, finance, was helping him learn about frugality and investment strategies.Advertisement“He’s always been realistic,” Schnier said. “He’s always done stuff to make sure he’d be O.K. if basketball didn’t happen.”Did he need to become president of his freshman class and a three-year member of the student council? Probably not. He did so anyway. He joined Ultimate Frisbee and flag football teams, raised funds for a local charity, became a member of a social justice club, played golf and once told his parents he wanted to take up lacrosse (that he did not do).“I’ve always felt the bigger picture is no matter what happens, just try to be the better human being,” Towns said. “That will get you through any adversity.”When he brought in homemade cookies for Schnier it surprised her — not that she doubted he was capable of baking, but that he had the time to bake. He chose to blitz through his classes and graduate in only three years, a rare feat, according to Adele Ellis, the school’s director of scheduling.“He wanted to show everyone he could handle the work,” Cunningham, the religion teacher, said. “He wanted to tackle it.”Ellis, who also met regularly with Towns to keep him on track, had her own theory about why Towns sought such a diverse and laborious academic schedule.“He would always say to me he knows that basketball is going to only take him so far in life,” she said.It was a sentiment echoed by Schnier, who wound up eating lunch with Towns almost daily in her office. They chatted about movies and video games, but also about his interest in human kinetics, which he said he developed after visiting a hospital in the Dominican Republic with his mother, where the poor conditions startled him.AdvertisementSchnier had a hunch he wanted to learn more about the causes of certain aches and pains already rippling through his 7-foot physique.It became a teaching tool, like the lessons he absorbed in Cunningham’s class.“I spent a lot of time explaining to him that I don’t care how many people are telling you that this is going to happen,” Schnier said of the N.B.A. “My job is to tell you it may not happen, and you need to make sure you have a good education and a good support system, and other skills to fall back on.”The WildcatsKentucky first formed a connection with Towns in 2011 when he played for the Dominican Republic’s under-17 national team, which was coached by Oliver Antigua, the brother of the former Kentucky assistant Orlando Antigua.One year later, as a 16-year-old rising sophomore, Towns was named to the Dominican national team as it attempted to qualify for the 2012 London Olympics. The coach of the Dominican team just so happened to be Calipari, and the coincidence raised a few eyebrows from competing recruiters.Calipari, who became the Dominican team’s coach in 2011, has insisted he knew nothing about Towns, then only in eighth grade. But Calipari did something else that benefited Kentucky down the road. He and the assistant Del Harris urged Towns (who was six years younger than anyone else on the team) to practice his inside game with his N.B.A. teammates Al Horford and Francisco Garcia, building confidence in Towns’s post game.Towns hit 127 3-pointers over three seasons at St. Joseph; with the Wildcats this season, he has attempted only eight. He was named the Southeastern Conference’s top freshman and a freshman all-American, after averaging 10.1 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.3 blocks in 20.8 minutes of play this season entering Saturday.“My team needed me to be a force around the basket,” Towns said. He added, about his shooting ability, “It’s always in my back pocket if I need it.”Towns has jockeyed back and forth with Duke’s Jahlil Okafor as the projected top pick in June’s N.B.A. draft by most accounts, although his parents said the decision rested with him. Asked repeatedly about his plans Friday, Towns volleyed each inquiry.“I haven’t declared to go anywhere yet,” he said.The signs, since high school, point toward the pros. He always seemed to be rushing through, tasting as many opportunities as possible while speeding on toward what was prophesied: an N.B.A. career, hopefully long, hopefully successful, but prepared for something else, if not.A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Two Parts to His Name, but One Complete Player.
