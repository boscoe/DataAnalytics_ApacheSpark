The case stems from self-reported violations involving the university’s drug policy and stretching back to the Orange’s 2003 national championship.Syracuse provided no details of the violations, but published reports have said that former players failed tests for banned recreational substances and that the program did not appropriately discipline them.Syracuse said that none of the misconduct, which also could include academic violations by the former star center Fab Melo, occurred after 2012 or involved any current players. The N.C.A.A. held a hearing on the case in October.The ban would apply to the N.C.A.A. tournament, the N.I.T. and the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament. Syracuse (15-7) lost in the N.C.A.A. tournament’s round of 32 last season.“I am very disappointed that our basketball team will miss the opportunity to play in the postseason this year,” Coach Jim Boeheim said in a statement. He added, “However, I supported this decision, and I believe the university is doing the right thing.”Advertisement
