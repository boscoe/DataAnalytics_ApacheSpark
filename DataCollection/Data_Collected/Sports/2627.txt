Niersbach, 64, who has been the president of the federation, known as the D.F.B., since 2012, is also a member of the executive committees of FIFA and UEFA. He had been seen as a possible successor to Michel Platini as UEFA’s president. ■ The Spanish club Real Sociedad fired Coach David Moyes, a year after he was hired. Advertisement
