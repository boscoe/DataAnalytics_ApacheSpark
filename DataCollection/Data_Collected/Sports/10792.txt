Charles C. Lopez has won more than 4,000 races in 36 years as a jockey, with most of those victories coming aboard mediocre horses at middling tracks. Yet he kept the faith that a major opportunity would come. And now, at age 54, one is finally at hand.Lopez, in the twilight of his career, will bid for his lone Grade I victory and the chance to reach his first Kentucky Derby when he rides the highly regarded El Kabeir in the $1 million Wood Memorial Stakes on Saturday at Aqueduct Racetrack.“I always believed it would happen if I was in the right place at the right time,” Lopez said during an interview at Aqueduct. Lopez, who was born in Brooklyn, has gone by C. C. since he started riding to distinguish him from his father, Carlos Lopez Sr., who also was a jockey.Ahmed Zayat, who purchased El Kabeir for $250,000 as a yearling on behalf of Zayat Stables, intended to have Calvin Borel, a three-time winner of the Derby, as the horse’s regular rider after Borel guided the gray colt to a narrow victory in a Grade II race at Churchill Downs on Nov. 29.AdvertisementBorel was scheduled to fly in from Kentucky for El Kabeir’s 3-year-old debut in the Grade III Jerome Stakes at Aqueduct on Jan. 3, but a death in his family kept him from coming and began a scramble for a replacement.Advertisement“All of the big riders were out of town that day,” said Justin Zayat, who assists his father in managing the racing operation.The trainer John Terranova and the owners settled on Lopez because of his experience, his familiarity with Aqueduct and his reputation as a good fit for horses who prefer to run on the lead, as El Kabeir had done for Borel to close a promising 2-year-old campaign.Lopez’s business has recently fallen off — he did not have any riding assignments Thursday or Friday — and he assumed he would be nothing more than an emergency replacement.“I was perfectly cool with substituting,” he said. “I had no visions of riding him back.”When Lopez relaxed El Kabeir (“the boss” in Arabic) off the pace in third before they dominated the $200,000 Jerome Stakes by four and three-quarter lengths, he retained the mount for the $250,000 Withers Stakes on Feb. 7. When El Kabeir was outdueled by Far From Over by one and three-quarter lengths in the Withers, he expected a familiar call, notifying him he had been replaced.The connections stuck with Lopez because they were intent on running El Kabeir on the lead in the $400,000 Gotham Stakes on March 7. They thought Lopez could help the 3-year-old colt settle into a good rhythm in that position. The plan made sense; races often do not go according to plan.
                Joe Drape and Melissa Hoppert weigh in on some of the contenders for the 141st Kentucky Derby, which is set to be run May 2.            El Kabeir had an uncharacteristically slow start and continued to falter. The horse who was expected to set the pace was instead running last. And that is when Lopez, knowing he needed to win to retain perhaps the most important mount of his career, distinguished himself.“I dealt with it the right way, the way my 36 years of experience taught me to,” he said. “I didn’t lose my mind. I didn’t rush him because he was supposed to be in front and wasn’t.”AdvertisementLopez bided his time until El Kabeir found his best stride. They wove their way through traffic and made a breathtaking charge to win by two and three-quarter lengths and stamp the Florida-bred as a prime contender for the Wood Memorial and the Derby.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He turns them away.“There is no need to change anything,” Terranova said. “Everybody has been on board with C. C. the whole time.”The stiffness of the competition will significantly increase with the mile-and-an-eighth Wood, which is worth 100 Derby qualifying points for the winner. Daredevil, who trounced El Kabeir by 17 ¾ lengths in the Grade I Champagne Stakes in October at Belmont Park, is favored at 9-5. He will be ridden by Javier Castellano, who received the Eclipse Award as the leading jockey in North America in 2014. Frosted, a runner-up in the Remsen Stakes in November at Aqueduct, is the second choice at 5-2. Joel Rosario, winner of the Kentucky Derby in 2013, will be aboard him. El Kabeir, winner of half of his eight career starts, is 3-1.Lopez’s best finish in a Grade I race occurred when he placed second with Gottcha Gold in the Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile in 2007. His excitement is palpable when he discusses the Wood.“I’m allowing myself to envision riding the race,” he said. “I allow myself to picture winning the race. I’m trying not to think what it might mean if he loses.”Although El Kabeir has enough points to qualify for the 20-horse field for the Derby on May 2, Lopez could be left behind if he cannot deliver a victory in the Wood.“We’re worried about the biggest race in New York before we worry about the biggest race in America,” Justin Zayat said when asked about the commitment to Lopez.Bobbi Lopez, C. C.’s wife for the last two years and a former trainer, said: “He has given so much of his life to this industry. It would be nice to finally get the roses.”A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: At 54, Jockey Has Best Shot to Reach the Kentucky Derby for the First Time.
