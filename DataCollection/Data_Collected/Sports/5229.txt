The Mets are close to completing a one-year deal with Alejandro De Aza, who will split time with Juan Lagares in center field, according to a person in baseball with knowledge of the situation.
                If so, we’d like to talk to you. We want to hear from you about what your experience was in watching Game 5, and specifically, the slide by the Royals’ Eric Hosmer that tied the game against the Mets in the ninth inning.            In spring training before the 2015 season, the Mets signed Lagares to a four-year, $23 million contract extension, betting that he would continue to improve after winning a Gold Glove Award in 2014 and showing improvement at the plate. But over the course of last season, he continued to struggle against right-handed pitching, and his defense seemed to regress a bit.De Aza, who will turn 32 in April, is a left-handed batter who can play all three outfield positions, although he played only one game in center field last season. Over all in 2015, he played for three teams — Baltimore, Boston and San Francisco — and batted .262 with a .333 on-base percentage in 114 games. In his eight-year major league career, in which he has played for five teams, De Aza has never won a Gold Glove or made an All-Star team, but against right-handed pitching, he has batted .274 with a .338 on-base percentage.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Mets previously acquired Neil Walker and Asdrubal Cabrera this off-season to play the middle infield next season, and re-signed Bartolo Colon and Jerry Blevins, adding veterans to their rotation and bullpen.The addition of De Aza, who will be paid $5.75 million by the Mets, according to multiple reports, probably means that he, Lagares, Michael Conforto and Curtis Granderson will see the bulk of the playing time in the outfield in 2016. Yoenis Cespedes, the most dynamic outfielder for the Mets in the second half of last season, is a free agent and seems certain to sign an expensive multiyear deal with a team other than the Mets.A version of this article appears in print on December 23, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Mets Are Said to Be Near One-Year Deal With Outfielder.
