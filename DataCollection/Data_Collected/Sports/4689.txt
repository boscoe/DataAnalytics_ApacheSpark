It has not helped that they have consistently blown fourth-quarter leads all season, surely a byproduct of having the league’s worst pass defense.Whether Miami can capitalize is the question. The Dolphins’ anemic offense is ranked 29th, and quarterback Ryan Tannehill has struggled mightily at times. He was just 9 for 19 for 86 yards in a 15-13 victory against the Ravens last week.The game will be a reunion for wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. of the Giants and Jarvis Landry of the Dolphins, close friends and former teammates at Louisiana State.“This game has been marked on the schedule for a long time,” Beckham told The Associated Press. “It finally being here is so surreal.” Landry said that the bond he and Beckham shared “goes well beyond the game” and added: “His success means everything to me, as mine is to him. I want him to have the game of his life, but I want to win the game.”PICK: GiantsAdvertisement
