BEAVER CREEK, Colo. —  Early this winter, Mikaela Shiffrin was beaten three times at her best event, the slalom. The youngest Olympic champion in the history of the event, Shiffrin was not even making it to the podium.Though it was midseason, she replaced her coach. She switched to stiffer ski boots and more supple skis and re-examined her training methods. Just 19 years old, Shiffrin came to realize that as quick and seamless as her ascent to the top of the ski world had been, staying there could take more fortitude.“It opened my eyes; that’s for sure,” Shiffrin said last week. “I knew that people were wondering what was going on with me.”The second-guessing does not appear to have had much effect. Facing the pressure to defend her slalom title at the Alpine world ski championships on Saturday, Shiffrin fell asleep alongside the start gate 30 minutes before the second of two runs. Napping, even on race day, is a Shiffrin habit.AdvertisementBut once upright and affixed to her skis, she approached the opening stage of her run as if still slumbering and quickly squandered a lead she had built in the first run. With 10 gates left, Shiffrin was still losing and knew she had to take every risk to salvage a victory.AdvertisementBlazing through the final gates, Shiffrin lunged and attacked the racecourse, summoning every bit of energy from her skis to successfully defend her title and defeat Frida Hansdotter of Sweden by 0.34 of a second.In the finish corral, with a hometown crowd cheering wildly, Shiffrin had no reaction, her arms limp by her sides.“I think I was still sleeping,” Shiffrin said afterward, laughing. “I knew I had to hammer that last pitch of the race, and I had put so much effort into it, by the end, I had nothing left.“I’m going to have to improve my celebrations; there’s no doubt about it.”The winner of three major ski racing titles before her 20th birthday, she could have many years to work on how she rejoices after her victories.Shiffrin’s combined winning time after two runs was 1 minute 38.48 seconds. Sarka Strachova of the Czech Republic finished third, 0.77 of a second behind Shiffrin.“Everyone at the bottom of the race keeps telling me that I scared them to death with my slow start in the second run,” Shiffrin, who led by 0.4 of a second at the halfway point, said with a laugh. “It wasn’t intentional. I wasn’t just trying to put on a show.”Even Shiffrin’s mother, Eileen, asked her daughter during the official postrace news conference why she had skied so tentatively out of the gate.AdvertisementShiffrin, who lives in Eagle-Vail, a few miles from Beaver Creek, conceded that she had been nervous.“I was so worried I was going to mess it up,” Shiffrin said. “We all feel pressure, but it’s how you handle it that matters. But at that moment, I think I got caught between going all out and skiing smart.”Still, Shiffrin knew she was not charging down the turning, demanding course fast enough to win, and that was when a different motivation kicked in.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Now Ligety’s teammate had won her second world championship in two tries.
                Some of the top ski racers in the world describe the sounds of a World Cup downhill.            “I cannot rank my victories,” Shiffrin said. “But this will be close to my heart for the rest of my career. To win at home — I was 4 years old the last time the world championships were in America — that is historic. That’s pretty cool.”Shiffrin’s victory may not have been an upset, but it was hardly a sure thing. Hansdotter leads this season’s World Cup slalom standings, and she skied solidly in both her runs.Advertisement“Mikaela is a gifted skier, and all of us know that,” Hansdotter said. “I was hoping I had done enough. But with the fans, I knew she would be inspired.”Another Shiffrin rival who was expected to be perhaps her chief competition was Tina Maze, who had already won three medals at the championships.But Maze skied as if she were fatigued or feeling the rigor of five races in 12 days. Maze was fifth after the first run and eighth at the race’s conclusion.During her first run, Shiffrin displayed the efficient, smooth style that had made her the discipline’s dominant performer for most of the last two years.The race was contested in bright sunshine, which softened the snow on the course. Shiffrin said she had been training in soft snow for the last three weeks, anticipating the conditions of Saturday’s race.“I’ve been training in ruts, slushy snow, anything to replicate what I might see on race day,” Shiffrin said. “So I feel prepared. It’s a beautiful day here, and Valentine’s Day. I love the atmosphere. It will be my last day competing in the U.S. for a long time. I’m trying to soak it all in.”Shiffrin will turn 20 in about a month. Late Saturday afternoon, still clutching the flowers given to the medal winners, she was asked whether she was looking forward to no longer being called a teenager.“I’d like to stay 19 forever,” Shiffrin said. “Actually, sometimes I feel like I’m always the same age. I feel like I’m still 5 years old and just looking forward to the next time I get to ski. I don’t know that I ever feel any differently.”A version of this article appears in print on February 15, 2015, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: After a Nap, Shiffrin Plods, Then Bursts to a Slalom Repeat.
