The result will determine if it is also the last.As the regular-season champion in M.L.S., the Red Bulls were guaranteed to host the league’s title game — but only, of course, if they advanced that far. The lure was not an insignificant one: The home team is unbeaten in the three M.L.S. Cup finals since the league abolished neutral-site championship games in 2011.Everything was on track for the Red Bulls until they lost at Columbus last Sunday, 2-0, in the first leg of the Eastern Conference final. Now they must not only reverse that two-goal deficit at Red Bull Arena, but most likely do it without surrendering a goal. If Columbus scores even once, the Red Bulls will need at least four goals to advance, because away goals count as a tiebreaker in the playoffs.Still, the dream of a home final endures for the title-starved Red Bulls and their long-suffering fans. But they were not interested in discussing it on Friday.“No point in thinking about that,” forward Mike Grella said, “unless we get past this test.”ANDREW DASAdvertisement
