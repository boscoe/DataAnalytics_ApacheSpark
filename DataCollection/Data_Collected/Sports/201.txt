Fans and pundits have been calling him a disappointment, and with only six solo tackles through three games, and no sacks, it is easy to understand why.Coach Todd Bowles, who has shown a subtle sense of humor with the Jets, is not letting a slow start convince him that Suh has lost a step. When asked what the key was to slowing Suh down, Bowles said, “Him not playing.”At some point Suh and Cameron Wake will get back to doing what they do best, which is hitting quarterbacks very hard, and with Ryan Fitzpatrick showing a pronounced problem with turning the ball over, the Jets’ trip to London may not feel like much of a vacation.Pick: DolphinsAdvertisement
