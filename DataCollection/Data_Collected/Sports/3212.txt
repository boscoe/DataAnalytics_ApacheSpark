Late Monday, the New Orleans Saints finally parted ways with defensive coordinator Rob Ryan. The move was a reaction to a historically poor defensive performance on Sunday in Washington. Against a mediocre Redskins offense, New Orleans allowed over 300 passing yards and over 200 rushing yards, while giving up 8.9 yards per offensive play. The Saints defense is just the sixth since 1970 to allow an opposing offense to hit those three marks in a single game.On the season, the Saints rank last in nearly every major defensive statistical category, including points (315), yards (4,259), yards per play (6.7), passing touchdowns (28), net yards per pass attempt (7.9), and rushing yards per carry (5.0). New Orleans has an opponent’s passer rating allowed of 116.6, better than the passer rating of Tom Brady (111.1) and every other quarterback this season.This is Ryan’s 12th season in the N.F.L., and he has consistently fielded below-average defenses. Among the 18 coaches who have been defensive coordinators for at least 10 seasons since 1990, Ryan’s defenses have allowed more points per game and more yards per game to opponents than any other:Rob Ryan: 23.9 points per game; 351.2 yards per gameJim Haslett: 23.8 ppg; 339.0 ypgBob Slowik: 22.9 ppg; 330.8 ypgGet the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Ryan did have one truly remarkable performance, his first season in New Orleans. In 2012, the Saints defense ranked 31st in points and 32nd in yards; after hiring Ryan, New Orleans ranked 4th in both categories in 2013. But the Saints defense regressed significantly in 2014 — ranking 28th in points and 31st in yards — before plunging to new depths so far in 2015.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
