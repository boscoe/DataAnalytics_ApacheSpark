Is Devonta Freeman the next Arian Foster or Jahvid Best? Our money is on somewhere in between.Freeman has scored more standard fantasy football points in his first two N.F.L. starts than anyone in history (69), more than Foster and Best, who are also on that list, and in Points Per Reception leagues, he is easily the best with 104 points through four games.It is always fun to crown someone the next big fantasy football star, as many did with Best in 2010. After scoring 55 fantasy points in his first two starts, Best was the 38th best fantasy running back the rest of the season, averaging 6.3 fantasy points per game over 13 games.We are not saying the same thing will happen to Freeman. It is just one example of how overreactions can be made early in the season.The fantasy stat projection website NumberFire.com predicts Freeman will be a top-10 back the rest of the way, and there are reasons to be optimistic. Most important, the Atlanta Falcons’ offensive line, which was rated by ProFootballFocus.com as the 29th best run-blocking unit last season, has been much better than many expected.AdvertisementBut if we have learned anything over the years, it is to take things one week at a time, and in Week 5 against the Washington Redskins, you may want to temper your expectations of Freeman, as the Redskins have allowed only one rushing touchdown and the fewest fantasy points of any team in 2015 (9.7 F.P.P.G.).AdvertisementBe sure to check out our complete player rankings for N.F.L. Week 5. You can also find us on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy.
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            1 p.m. Line: Falcons by 7.5 Quarterback  Matt Ryan (ATL) — The Redskins’ depleted secondary was burned for 270 yards and three touchdowns by the previously struggling Sam Bradford last week.Kirk Cousins (WAS) — Cousins completed 31 of 46 passes for 290 yards and two total touchdowns against the Eagles. He has been turnover-free for two consecutive weeks. Atlanta ranks 29th against the pass (310 Y.P.G.).Running Back Devonta Freeman (ATL) — No back has managed more than 53 rushing yards in a single week against the Redskins this season, but Freeman is impossible to sit right now.Matt Jones/Alfred Morris (WAS) — Morris reasserted himself as the Redskins’ main back with 19 touches to Jones’s 7. Nobody has allowed more fantasy points to the position than Atlanta so far in 2015, making Morris a must start.Wide Receiver/Tight End Julio Jones/Leonard Hankerson (ATL) — Hankerson has posted two start-worthy games this season and has a great matchup this week considering Rueben Randle’s 117 yards and a touchdown in Week 3 and Riley Cooper’s 72 yards and a touchdown in Week 4.Pierre Garcon/Jamison Crowder (WAS) — Garcon is currently the WR1 option in the passing game and is a solid WR2 play while DeSean Jackson remains out. Crowder appears to have won the starting slot job over the fading Andre Roberts.AdvertisementJordan Reed/Derek Carrier (WAS) — Reed is unlikely to play after suffering a concussion, which leaves Derek Carrier as the Redskins’ starting option for the foreseeable future, making him worth a look in deep leagues.1 p.m., Eastern time. Line: Bengals by 3QuarterbackRussell Wilson (SEA) — The Bengals have yielded consecutive 350+ passing games to Joe Flacco and Alex Smith.Andy Dalton (CIN) — Fantasy’s best quarterback play outside of Aaron Rodgers through four weeks faces his toughest challenge yet. The Seahawks have allowed the sixth fewest fantasy points to the position and the third fewest passing yards per game (203).Running Back Marshawn Lynch/Thomas Rawls (SEA) — Rawls would again see most of the carries if Lynch sits. But after putting up 48 yards on 17 carries against a weak Lions run defense, we’re not excited.Jeremy Hill/Gio Bernard (CIN) — Good luck figuring out this one from week to week. Both will find the going tough against the Seahawks, who are the second toughest team for fantasy backs to play this season.Wide Receiver/Tight End A.J. Green/Marvin Jones (CIN) — Seattle allows the third fewest fantasy points to tight ends, and limited Calvin Johnson to 56 yards on seven grabs last week.Jimmy Graham (SEA) — Graham is becoming a boom or bust kind of guy. He’ll be tough to trust against the Bengals, who shut down Travis Kelce last week (five catches for 49 yards).1 p.m. Line: Packers by 9 Quarterback  Aaron Rodgers (GB) — The Rams allow the third fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks, but that’s mostly because they cannot stop the run. Rodgers should not have any problems against this unit.AdvertisementNick Foles (STL) — Foles somehow managed three touchdown passes against the talented Cardinals defense last. Do not be fooled: He remains a desperate QB2 option against a stout Packers secondary.Running Back Eddie Lacy (GB) — The Rams have allowed 120 yards per game on the ground this year, and the sixth most fantasy points to backs.Todd Gurley (STL) — The Packers are yielding 115 yards per game on the ground, despite limiting Carlos Hyde to just 20 yards in Week 4. The rookie could break out in a major way this week.Wide ReceiverRandall Cobb/James Jones (GB) — The Rams have kept Antonio Brown and Larry Fitzgerald out of the end zone, but both managed at least seven catches and 99 yards.1 p.m. Line: Bills by 2.5Quarterback Tyrod Taylor (BUF) — The Titans have held opposing quarterbacks to 194.7 passing yards per game. Proceed with caution, especially if Sammy Watkins sits.Marcus Mariota (TEN) — The Bills have surprisingly allowed the second most passing touchdowns (10) and the fourth most fantasy points to quarterbacks.Running Back Anthony Dixon (BUF) — The only healthy back left in Buffalo will start against a suspect Titans run unit that yielded solid fantasy outings to the likes of Isaiah Crowell and Frank Gore before the bye.Bishop Sankey/Antonio Andrews (TEN) — Only the most desperate owners should consider starting one of these runners against Buffalo’s third best run defense. The Bills have not allowed more than 49 rushing yards to a single back this year.AdvertisementWide Receiver/Tight End Sammy Watkins/Percy Harvin (BUF) — Harvin was held to three catches for 26 yards against the Giants despite eight targets. He is a WR3, even if Watkins remains sidelined.Kendall Wright (TEN) — Buffalo rendered Odell Beckham Jr. mostly useless last weekend (five catches, 38 yards). Over all, opposing WR1 threats have averaged 72 yards per game.Charles Clay (BUF) — Clay is coming off nine receptions for 111 yards against the Giants’ soft middle in Week 4. He will be the Bills’ premier pass-catching option if Watkins sits.1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 9.5Quarterback Jay Cutler (CHI) — The Chiefs are on the hook for allowing consecutive 300-yard passing days to Rodgers and Andy Dalton in Weeks 3 and 4, and have been burned for nine touchdown passes over the last three weeks. Alex Smith (KC) — The Bears rank second against the pass with 203 Y.P.G., but have surrendered the second most touchdown passes (10). Smith is allergic to touchdown passes, however, with just four to his name entering Week 5.Running Back Matt Forte (CHI) — The Chiefs permitted four rushing touchdowns and 102 yards to the Bengals’ backs in Week 4. Forte is an elite RB1 play.Jamaal Charles (KC) — The Bears rank 24th against the run (119 Y.P.G.). Charles is primed for a huge bounce-back performance this week.Wide Receiver/Tight End Jeremy Maclin (KC) — He is coming off consecutive 100-yard games and should keep rolling against a Bears unit that permits the eighth most points to the position.AdvertisementAlshon Jeffery/Eddie Royal (CHI) — Jeffery is still day-to-day after missing Week 4. Royal caught seven of 10 targets for 54 yards and a touchdown in his absence. Martellus Bennett (CHI) — Cutler’s go-to last week led all Bears receivers with 13 targets. He warrants strong daily league consideration if Jeffery sits again.1 p.m. Line: Eagles by 4Quarterback Drew Brees (NO) — The Eagles have allowed at least 290 passing yards in three of their four games this season.Sam Bradford (PHI) — He is coming off a promising Week 4 outing (270 yards, 3 TDs), and the Saints have allowed the second most fantasy points to the position. A possible shootout with Brees is a plus.Running BackMark Ingram/C.J. Spiller (NO) — Both backs face a stiff challenge as an opposing runner has yet to top the Falcons’ Tevin Coleman’s 8 fantasy points in Week 1. The Eagles are allowing 3.3 yards per carry, and have permitted only one touchdown.DeMarco Murray/Ryan Mathews/Darren Sproles (PHI) — Middle-of-the-road matchup, but this backfield is a fantasy nightmare right now and none of these backs can be trusted.Wide Receiver Brandin Cooks (NO) — Another disappointing showing in a favorable matchup last week has landed Cooks in the WR3 tier. Jordan Matthews/Nelson Agholor (PHI) — The Saints had cornerback Keenan Lewis and safety Jairus Byrd together on the field for the first time this season, so the jury is still out on this secondary. Matthews gets the green light almost every week regardless, and Agholor is showing promising signs and playing 80 percent of the snaps.1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 3 Quarterback  Jameis Winston (TB) — Consecutive 12-point fantasy outings and four interceptions last week make him hard to trust despite the favorable matchup (10th best).Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.Running Back  T.J. Yeldon (JAC) — The Bucs rank 30th over all against the run (136 Y.P.G.) and have permitted the eighth most points to the position.AdvertisementDoug Martin (TB) — The Jaguars have held their own against the run despite LeGarrette Blount’s impressive Week 3, limiting backs to an 8-point fantasy average in the other three contests. Martin is not locked in for success this week despite his breakout Week 4. Wide Receiver Allen Robinson/Allen Hurns (JAC) — The Bucs secondary allowed Carolina’s Ted Ginn Jr. to score twice last week, and both Kendall Wright and DeAndre Hopkins each managed at least 100 yards and a touchdown against them.1 p.m. Line: Ravens by 6.5Quarterback Joe Flacco (BAL) — The Browns secondary has been shredded by Derek Carr and Philip Rivers over the last two weeks (672 yards, 5 TDs), but Flacco was a total train wreck last week against a generous Pittsburgh defense and will be without his top option, Steve Smith. He remains a middling QB2 play.Running Back  Justin Forsett (BAL) — Forsett has a chance to keep the party going against the league’s second worst rushing defense, which is allowing 141 yards per game on average.Duke Johnson (CLE) — He is emerging as an every week P.P.R. play. But the Browns’ backs are in a tough spot this week, as the Ravens are the sixth worst fantasy matchup for the position.Wide Receiver/Tight End Kamar Aiken (BAL) — Will assume WR1 duties with Steve Smith sidelined. If the Browns’ top cornerback, Joe Haden, returns this week, it will make this a tougher matchup.Gary Barnidge (CLE) — The veteran enters this game with consecutive six-catch performances, but the Ravens have given up one whole fantasy point to the position this year (worst TE matchup).4:05 p.m. Line: Cardinals by 3Quarterback  Carson Palmer (ARI) — The Lions are permitting 291 yards per game through the air and 19 F.P.P.G. to guys like Palmer heading into Week 5.AdvertisementMatthew Stafford (DET) — The Cardinals are the fifth best defense against the pass and are surrendering 13 F.P.P.G. to the position despite Foles’s fluky three touchdowns last week. It’s best to look elsewhere until Stafford shows a pulse.Running BackAmeer Abdullah (DET) — Gurley torched the Cardinals for 146 yards last week, and Forte and Ingram both topped double-digit fantasy points against them this season.Chris Johnson/David Johnson/Andre Ellington (ARI) — Chris Johnson should remain the lead back, even if Ellington returns. Detroit is a middle of the road matchup for backs; it held a Lynch-less Seahawks team and a struggling Broncos running game in check the last two weeks.Wide Receiver/Tight End Calvin Johnson/Golden Tate (DET) — You cannot sit Johnson, but his struggling quarterback and a date with a Patrick Peterson lessens the appeal this week. Tate, you can sit.Eric Ebron (DET) — Arizona has been the second best defense against tight ends (3 F.P.P.G.), and Ebron is unlikely to suit up anyway.4:25 p.m. Line: Patriots by 8.5 Quarterback Tom Brady (NE) — Dallas has yielded consecutive 20-point games to Ryan and Brees. Brady is set up for another huge week.Running BackDion Lewis/LeGarrette Blount (NE) — The Cowboys’ run defense let Freeman run wild for 37 fantasy points and the Saints’ Spiller and Ingram totaled 28.AdvertisementJoseph Randle/Darren McFadden/Christine Michael (DAL) — We are avoiding this committee in what very well could be a blowout win for the Patriots.Wide Receiver/Tight End Julian Edelman (NE) — Dallas is allowing 68.5 percent of its opponent’s targets to be completed (10th highest).Terrance Williams (DAL) — New England is the fourth best fantasy matchup for receivers. Perhaps some garbage time points are in store for Williams this week. Jason Witten (DAL) — The Patriots have coughed up two touchdowns to the position and an 84-yard day to Heath Miller through three games.4:25 p.m. Line: Broncos by 5Quarterback Peyton Manning (DEN) — The Raiders have permitted 19.3 fantasy points a game to the position this season (sixth most).Derek Carr (OAK) — Quarterbacks are averaging 8 F.P.P.G. against Denver this season (worst QB matchup), including just two touchdowns.Running Back Latavius Murray (OAK) — He is expected to carry the load despite last week’s benching. Denver’s soft spot on defense is against the run, where it has allowed opposing backs to reach double-digit fantasy points in three of four games.Ronnie Hillman/C.J. Anderson (DEN) — Hillman is expected to lead this backfield going forward after his standout game against the Vikings.AdvertisementWide Receiver/Tight End Demaryius Thomas/Emmanuel Sanders (DEN) — Both Denver receivers are no-brainer starts against this suspect secondary.Amari Cooper (OAK) — It is a scary matchup, but Mike Wallace’s 87 yards and a score in Week 4 offer some hope against this season’s worst fantasy matchup for receivers.Owen Daniels (DEN) — The Raiders have been decimated by opposing tight ends this season, having allowed six touchdowns and 388 yards through four weeks.8:25 p.m. Line: Giants by 7Quarterback Eli Manning (NYG) — The 49ers defense is better than expected this season and it held the Packers’ Rodgers to 224 yards and one touchdown last week.Colin Kaepernick (SF) — The Giants cooled off the Bills’ Taylor on the road (14 F.P.) and Kirk Cousins the week before (12 F.P.). We are not expecting the struggling Kaepernick to turn things around this week.Running Back  Carlos Hyde (SF) — Believe it or not, the Giants are holding opponents to 69 yards per game on the ground, making them the best run defense in N.F.L.Rashad Jennings/Andre Williams/Shane Vereen (NYG) — San Francisco has allowed 27 F.P.P.G. to opposing RBs over the last three weeks. Vereen has gone without a reception in two straight games.Wide Receiver Odell Beckham Jr./Rueben Randle (NYG) — The Niners managed to shut down the Packers wideouts in Week 4, holding Cobb to five catches for 44 yards.AdvertisementAnquan Boldin (SF) — Boldin has vanished the last two weeks. A breakout seems unlikely against the Giants, as he will be up against a healthy Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Prince Amukamara, along with his struggling quarterback.8:25 p.m. (Monday) Line: Chargers by 3Quarterback Philip Rivers (SD) — Coming off an outstanding 338-yard, three-touchdown performance, he gets his favorite red zone target back this week (Gates) and another soft secondary. The Steelers allowed 25-point fantasy days in Weeks 1 and 2.Running Back Le’Veon Bell (PIT) — The Chargers have allowed a jaw-dropping 417 rushing yards, 177 receiving yards and four touchdowns to opposing backs over the last three weeks. Bell is the top overall fantasy play for Week 5.Melvin Gordon/Danny Woodhead (SD) — The Ravens’ Forsett had his way with this defense last week (150 rushing yards), but Gordon cannot be trusted as more than a low end RB2 after his Browns performance last week.Wide Receiver/Tight End Antonio Brown/Martavis Bryant (PIT) — The Chargers permit the second fewest fantasy points to the position next to Denver, but Brown never sits and you are probably itching to get Bryant into your lineup for the first time this year.Keenan Allen/Stevie Johnson (SD) — Pittsburgh has surrendered double-digit points to the position in all four games this year, though Johnson’s status for Monday is iffy. Antonio Gates (SD) — The Steelers have dominated tight ends since Rob Gronkowski’s 27 fantasy points in Week 1, although they have faced the likes of Vernon Davis, Maxx Williams and Jared Cook.The Sablich Brothers have provided award-winning fantasy football advice for The Times since 2010.
