A Kenyan government pathologist said that the Olympic marathon champion Samuel Wanjiru did not commit suicide, but that he died after being struck on the head with a blunt object. Wanjiru died in 2011 after falling from a balcony at his home in Nyahururu, in Kenya’s Rift Valley.The pathologist, Moses Njue, told an inquest it was not possible for the fall of 14 feet to have caused the head injuries that killed Wanjiru.■ The family of Abebe Bikila, an Ethiopian who won the 1960 Olympic marathon running barefoot, is suing Vibram, the maker of a line of minimalist running shoes, saying it used his name without permission. In a lawsuit filed in Washington state, the family said Vibram did not have permission to name models of its running shoes after him.A version of this brief appears in print on February 11, 2015, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Suicide Finding Is Disputed.
