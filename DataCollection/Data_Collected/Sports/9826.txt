No. 1 Kentucky led 16th-seeded Hampton, 18-14, with 8 minutes 27 seconds left in the first half, and John Calipari, the Kentucky coach, fumed at his players from the bench for misdeeds in execution.The throng of Wildcats fans who filled KFC Yum Center were entertained, but not quite as agitated as Calipari. They expected to get what they had come for — a rout — and in due time, that was what they got.Kentucky (35-0) went on a 14-0 spurt over a stretch of nearly five minutes to take a 32-14 lead before coasting to a 79-56 victory over the Pirates (17-18).Karl-Anthony Towns, a 6-foot-11 freshman, led the Wildcats with 21 points.
