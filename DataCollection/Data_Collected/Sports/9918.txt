The No. 8-seeded Ducks (26-9) shot 54.7 percent from the field over all and 60.9 percent in the second half, and it took just about all of those baskets to hold off the Cowboys (18-14). Oregon led, 70-69, with four minutes to play, but a 3-pointer by Dillon Brooks and Jordan Bell’s rim-rattling dunk gave the Ducks enough of a cushion to hang on. The Cowboys missed six of their last seven shots.The senior guard Joseph Young, the Pacific-12 player of the year, had 27 points for the Ducks, making all eight of his foul shots. Le’Bryan Nash led Oklahoma State with 18 points, while Anthony Hickey sank five 3-pointers and had 17 points. Altman grew up in Wilber, Neb., a small town about 90 miles southwest of Omaha. He won 327 games at Creighton with seven N.C.A.A. tournament appearances before heading to Oregon in 2010. Altman’s wife, Reva, is also from Nebraska, and Altman said they had left more than 50 tickets to accommodate both families. Advertisement
