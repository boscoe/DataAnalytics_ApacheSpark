AdvertisementSupported byBy Agence France-PresseThe Board of Control for Cricket in India, the sport’s governing body there, toppled Narayanaswami Srinivasan from the helm of the International Cricket Council, the sport’s world governing body. Srinivasan, 70, once the most powerful man in world cricket, was appointed I.C.C. chief in June 2014 after being chosen by the B.C.C.I. as India’s representative for the role, which rotates among nations every two years. But his reputation was dented by corruption scandals in the Indian Premier League, and he agreed to step aside as B.C.C.I. chief after a Supreme Court panel found him guilty of a conflict of interest for having commercial dealings in the sport. I.C.C. rules state that administrators removed by their home boards cannot serve in the world governing body, which effectively ends Srinivasan’s tenure immediately. Advertisement
