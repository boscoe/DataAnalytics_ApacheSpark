He signed a four-year, $55 million contract with the Twins after pitching last season with Atlanta, but he will now miss the first half of the season.He had been expected to pitch in the No. 2 spot, behind Phil Hughes, in the Twins’ rotation.The penalty was the third for a positive stanozolol test reported by M.L.B. in the last eight days. Seattle pitcher David Rollins and Atlanta pitcher Arodys Vizcaino also tested positive.Santana is set to lose more than $5.9 million of his $13.5 million salary this season. In a statement, he issued his “deepest apologies” to his family, his fans, his colleagues, his teammates and the Twins.Advertisement“I am very disappointed that I tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug,” Santana said. “I am frustrated that I can’t pinpoint how the substance in question entered my body. I would never knowingly take anything illegal to enhance my performance.”Twins General Manager Terry Ryan said: “It’s disappointing. It’s difficult. We had a fairly decent spring. Now we’ve got to regroup here, and hopefully it won’t affect us as we move forward.”AdvertisementPaul Molitor, the Twins’ manager, said he had talked to Santana about the news, but he did not discuss the specifics.A version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: 80-Game Drug Suspension for Twins’ Santana.
