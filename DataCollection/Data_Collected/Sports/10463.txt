       HORSETRAINERJOCKEYRECORDPTSODDS  1. DortmundBob BaffertMartin Garcia5-5-0-0706-1Joe Drape: This big, powerful colt has faced and beaten a deep and talented bunch of 3-year-olds on the West Coast. He’s earned the title of Derby favorite.   Melissa Hoppert: Like his father, the 2008 Derby and Preakness winner Big Brown, the colt has a chance to enter the starting gate on the first Saturday in May with a perfect record. But how will he react to racing against a 20-horse field? Next up: Santa Anita Derby on April 4.  2. American PharoahBob BaffertVictor Espinoza4-3-0-0605-1JD: He is the 2-year-old champion and is continuing to improve. He’s a serious threat to his stablemate, Dortmund. The Baffert barn is loaded.   MH: He overcame a stumble at the start and a displaced shoe to win the Rebel in the slop by six and a quarter lengths. But how strong was the field? Next up: Arkansas Derby on April 11.  3. Carpe DiemTodd PletcherJohn Velazquez4-3-1-06410-1JD: He’s bred to go long and has the relaxed stalk and pounce running style that is often rewarded on the first Saturday in May.   MH: His 2-year-old form has held up. He demonstrated in the Tampa Bay Derby that he has the ability to sit back and make a move late. Next up: Blue Grass Stakes on April 4.  4. MaterialityTodd PletcherJohn Velazquez3-3-0-010012-1JD: Looked like a real horse dispatching Upstart in the Florida Derby. But I’m betting against him winning off so little foundation.   MH: He was impressive in staying perfect in the Florida Derby. Still, he faces long odds: no horse has won the Derby without racing at 2 since 1882. Next up: Kentucky Derby on May 2.  5. UpstartRick VioletteJose Ortiz7-3-3-17618-1JD: This is a very workmanlike colt, but he took a step back in the Florida Derby.   MH: He had a career-best 108 Beyer speed figure in finishing second in the Florida Derby and has never really run a bad race. Next up: Kentucky Derby.  6. International StarMike MakerMiguel Mena9-5-2-017117-1JD: Leave him off your ticket at your own risk. If you get 17-1 Derby day, pound it with both hands.   MH: He swept the Fair Grounds’ prep races (the Lecomte, the Risen Star and the Louisiana Derby) and progressed in all three. Next up: Kentucky Derby.  7. Firing LineSimon CallaghanGary Stevens5-2-3-05813-1JD: Another threat from California. He couldn’t hang with Dortmund earlier this year, and won’t be able to in the Derby.   MH: This speedy colt showed in the Sunland Derby that he can win with ease once free of his shadow. Next up: Kentucky Derby.  8. El KabeirJohn TerranovaC.C. Lopez8-4-2-17528-1JD: Who’s he beaten? Not much, but it was impressive that he changed his running style in the Gotham from front runner to closer.   MH: He won the Gotham by two and three-quarter lengths against a weak field. But this versatile colt has thrived at Aqueduct, despite a dreadful winter. Next up: Wood Memorial on April 4.  9. Prospect ParkClifford Sise Jr.Kent Desormeaux6-2-1-12018-1JD: In California, this guy’s trainer is often called Sisa-at-a-price for his penchant of delivering long odds winners. Beware.   MH: Rallied to finish two and three-quarter lengths behind Dortmund in the San Felipe. Next up: Santa Anita Derby.10. MubtaahijMike de KockChristophe Soumillon7-4-1-01008-1JD: His trainer has won major races worldwide. They say they are coming to Kentucky. Love to see it happen.   MH: Won the UAE Derby by an impressive eight lengths, setting Twitter abuzz. But will he be able to bounce back in five weeks and after being shipped overseas? Next up: Kentucky Derby.Advertisement
