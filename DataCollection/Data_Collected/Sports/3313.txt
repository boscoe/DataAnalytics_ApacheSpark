Bidding for that tournament is expected to begin next year after it was delayed amid the FIFA corruption scandal.The Copa América, the world’s oldest international soccer championship, doubles as the South American championship and has always been held on that continent. But in 2014, officials from the Americas’ two soccer confederations — Conmebol in South America and Concacaf, which governs North and Central America and the Caribbean — joined U.S. Soccer in announcing a special Centenario tournament to mark the event’s 100th anniversary.The field next summer will include the 10 members of Conmebol and six teams from Concacaf: the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica, and the winners of two playoffs, between Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago, and Panama and Cuba.The complete list of next summer’s sites: Gillette Stadium, Foxborough, Mass.; MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J.; Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia; the Citrus Bowl, Orlando; Soldier Field, Chicago; NRG Stadium, Houston; University of Phoenix Stadium, Glendale, Ariz.; the Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Calif.; Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif.; and CenturyLink Field, Seattle.Three of the stadiums are home to teams in M.L.S., which confirmed Thursday that it was considering pausing league play for part of the tournament. Another issue is that about half the stadiums have artificial playing surfaces, which, while approved for use by FIFA for international matches, are traditionally replaced by grass for top-level matches (though not, memorably and controversially, for last summer’s Women’s World Cup in Canada). U.S. Soccer said Thursday that it would install grass in all stadiums for the Copa América.The tournament will be played June 3-26, setting up a full summer of top-level soccer. The 2016 European Championship will be held in France from June 10 to July 10.OpinionMoya DoddAdvertisement
