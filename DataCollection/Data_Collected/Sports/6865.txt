Thompson, who hopes to play in the All-Star Game, made all 13 of his shots from the field, including a league-record nine 3-pointers, and hit both of his free throws during a 12-minute span.The previous record for points in a quarter was 33, reached by George Gervin in 1978 and Carmelo Anthony in 2008.

He hit one remarkable basket after another — including a 28-footer — and added an alley-oop from Curry on a fast break.Thompson seemed to love every minute of it, flapping his hands to the crowd every time he went down the court. At one point during a timeout, he sat on the bench with his hands over his head, staring at the scoreboard in apparent disbelief.Thompson scored 19 consecutive points during one stretch, which ended with him zipping a left-handed pass to Draymond Green for a layup.
