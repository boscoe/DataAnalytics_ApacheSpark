A brilliant second-half performance by Grayson Allen lifted No. 5 Duke over Georgetown, 86-84, in the championship of the 2K Classic at Madison Square Garden on Sunday afternoon.Allen scored 17 of his game-high 32 points after halftime, and 9 came within the opening five minutes of the half, turning what was a 5-point deficit into a lead the Blue Devils would not relinquish.Allen also added four assists, five rebounds and two steals, and he shot 9 of 12 from the field.“His stat line is one of the sensational stat lines,” Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. “Thirty-two points on 12 shots is crazy.”Isaac Copeland scored 11 of Georgetown’s first 22 points, helping the Hoyas jump out to a 6-point lead midway through the first. But Allen’s shooting kept Duke alive for most of the half, and an 8-0 run late gave the Blue Devils their first lead since the score was 14-13.Advertisement“The first 12 minutes we were completely disorganized for some reason,” Krzyzewski said. “Grayson kept us in the ballgame. We could have been blown out of there.”AdvertisementA 3-pointer by Allen, a sophomore guard, with 2 minutes 45 seconds left put Duke up by 8, but Georgetown kept fighting. After two missed free throws by Derryck Thornton with 5.4 seconds left, the Hoyas still had a chance to win at the buzzer. But Copeland’s 3-pointer missed.VIRGINIA 83, GEORGE MASON 66 Malcolm Brogdon had 21 points, London Perrantes had 16 points and 11 assists and No. 6 Virginia (4-1) beat George Mason (2-3) to win the Charleston Classic championship in South Carolina.
