CreditAndrew Testa for The New York Times        YEOVIL, England — On Friday morning, Yeovil Town’s tiny stadium — Huish Park, with a capacity of about 9,500 — was both empty and buzzing.A group of electricians maneuvered through the seats, balancing loops of cable and step ladders on their shoulders. A woman, busy with her clipboard, wove her way around a tower of burger-bun boxes stacked near the touchline. A squeaking, elderly turnstile was oiled, and the air rung with the sound of hammer blows on hollow scaffolding poles as temporary stands and TV camera positions were assembled at the corners of the field.Behind one goal, the very low-tech scoreboard was being tested, flashing up the state of play before Sunday’s kickoff: F.A. Cup Third Round; Yeovil Town 0, Manchester United 0.The third round, which was played across England this weekend, is when the big teams of the Premier League enter the tournament, and when the little ones start to dream of the impossible. For smaller clubs like Yeovil Town and its fans, advancing this far offers a glimpse at a dream — a trip to a grand stadium or, better, a visit to yours from a giant like United. It also offers the opportunity to soak in the so-called magic of the F.A. Cup — and to daydream, as Yeovil did for much of Sunday, of harnessing enough of that magic to write a new place in that history.Winning against world-class talent is always going to be difficult for teams like Yeovil, which has struggled this season even in its own league, two divisions below the mighty Premier League. The goal on Sunday, Yeovil Manager Gary Johnson wrote in his notes for the matchday program, was to “give the fans a day they will remember for the rest of their lives.”AdvertisementManchester United may not be too accustomed to playing this kind of game at this kind of stadium, but the home team is an expert. The F.A. Cup is open to all clubs in the English league system, which includes some from Wales, and over the last 90 years Yeovil has been matched against some of the biggest teams in the third round. It has given a few a run for their money: Liverpool in 1935; Sunderland, whom Yeovil beat in 1949 by 2-1; Arsenal in 1992; and Liverpool again in 2004.AdvertisementThis year Yeovil drew the biggest club of all. Just to put it in perspective, United is 65 places higher in the English league structure, and it has revenue probably 250 times bigger: Think of seeing the Yankees sent to play at the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes.In 1949, Yeovil did go on to play Manchester United, away in the fourth round, and was soundly thrashed, 8-0. But win, draw or lose, these great clashes of unequals bring in a small fortune. Sunday’s game alone was expected to increase Yeovil Town F.C.’s annual turnover by around a third, team officials predicted.Still, the gap in stature between Huish Park and Old Trafford was obvious. The press office at Yeovil is a khaki portable cabin set down by a mini traffic circle that also serves as the club’s garden of remembrance, where fans’ ashes can be buried. Inside it on Friday, team officials prepared more than 140 credentials for the match (seven times the usual crowd, and representing reporters from as far away as the Persian Gulf, the Netherlands and Denmark) and noted that they had already run out of chairs, desks and even electrical outlets.The same problem of scaling up was evident in the kitchens and hospitality rooms. As cleaners vacuumed every inch of the almost threadbare carpets woven wall to wall with Yeovil club crests, a team employee named Clive Robinson seemed unperturbed as he pondered menus, silver service for Manchester United’s directors and an order for the stadium tea bars that had requested six times the normal volume of hot dogs, diced onions, ketchup and burgers.“It’s all about the prep,” he said.By Sunday, Huish Park was polished and painted and primed for its big day, right down to the fresh flowers in every rest room — a touch overseen by a devoted volunteer, Pat Custard, that is unique in English soccer. Custard also runs the tea bar, which means she does not even get to see the games as the bars need to be cleaned and closed up. She makes do with specially recorded DVDs.Yeovil Town may not have been the favorite, but it was ready to be a good host.As it turned out, Manchester United was ready to be a good guest. Its support, around a quarter of the crowd, made plenty of noise and offered villainous swagger, chanting, “Do you know what it’s like to win the league?” Its former manager Alex Ferguson added a bit of celebrity flash by arriving in a helicopter.It was not quite the all-star United team on display, but Manager Louis Van Gaal started Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao, and sent on Juan Mata and Ángel di María in the second half. Most generous of all, for 60 minutes, United played with the kind of disconnectedness that gave Yeovil Town hope as its players relentlessly pressed and scurried about.Advertisement“We just might do this,” one fan whispered early in the second half, but United was not quite that generous. A goal from Ander Herrera and a last-minute breakaway from di María produced a 2-0 victory and Yeovil was out.“I wasn’t surprised by the performance because I knew this was a massive game and some of these lads may never get this type of game again,” Johnson said in a postmatch news conference that was briefly interrupted by the din stirred up by Ferguson’s departing helicopter.“It was important we put on an event, and I think the supporters are happy. Everything went very well, and we’re proud of our club.”Perhaps it was best that Pat Custard was still in the tea bar counting the takings when the match ended; it’s the dashed aspirations that hurt the most. But Yeovil’s team, on and off the pitch, had surely earned its moment of hope.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about Yeovil Town’s soccer match against Manchester United in the third round of the F.A. Cup, referred incorrectly to the teams that are eligible for the tournament. The F.A. Cup is open to all clubs in the English league system, not all British clubs.A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: When Goliath Came to Yeovil.
