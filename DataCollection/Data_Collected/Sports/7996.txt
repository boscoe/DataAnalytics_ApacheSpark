StephensonBernard Lagat, who has won the Millrose Games’ signature Wanamaker Mile a record eight times, will probably finish toward the back when the race is contested Saturday at the 168th Street Armory. But he has his sights set on another significant accomplishment.Lagat will be trying to dip under 3 minutes 58.15 seconds, which would break Eamonn Coghlan’s world record for runners 40 and older.Almost four years ago, the Millrose Games were moved out of Madison Square Garden in an effort to reclaim some of their old luster in Upper Manhattan at the more intimate New Balance Track & Field Center. The depth of this year’s Wanamaker men’s field suggests that the event is well on its way to doing so.In addition to Lagat, 40, the field includes the defending Wanamaker champion, Will Leer of the United States; Matt Centrowitz, the American who won in 2012; the 2008 and 2012 Olympic 1,500 silver medalists, Nick Willis of New Zealand and Leo Manzano of the United States; and Edward Cheserek, an Oregon sophomore who has won five N.C.A.A. cross-country and track titles.“Whoever wins this mile, they’re thinking of an American record, possibly,” Norbert Sander, president of the Millrose Games and of the Armory Foundation, said last week at a news conference.Willis won the mile last weekend in Boston at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix, running a meet-record 3:51.61. Centrowitz won the 1,000 in a meet-record 2:17.00, 24-hundredths of a second off David Torrence’s American indoor record.Still, Lagat’s quest promises to be compelling in its own right. He turned 40 in December and has chased Coghlan before. Coghlan, an Irishman who starred at Villanova and on the international stage, was known as the Chairman of the Boards as he won seven Wanamaker titles from 1977 to 1987 on the tight, steeply banked board track at the Garden. Lagat surpassed him in 2010. Coghlan’s 3:58.15, set indoors at Harvard in 1994 when he was 41, remains the fastest masters time, indoors or outdoors.“The guys that are favorites right now really are doing better than what I can do now,” said Lagat, who has gravitated toward longer distances and finished second in the 3,000 in Boston last Saturday, running 7:48.33 and shattering — by nearly 12 seconds — the record for runners 40 and older. “It’s a natural process,” Lagat said. “And for me, it’s a process that I accept.”He added, “My place in history has been written already, but I’m going to be in there, trying to do what I can do — trying to challenge them, if I can still.”If he does, it may be the biggest story of the meet, Centrowitz said.“I was telling Bernard up in Boston, ‘You know, if you run a 3:55 and get the world record and I run something fast, like a 3:50, you’re going to get more press,’ ” Centrowitz told reporters. “And he looks at me and he goes, ‘And I should!’ ”The men’s mile is not the only intriguing event at the meet. Mary Cain, 18, of Bronxville, N.Y., who won the women’s Wanamaker Mile last year as a high school senior, will defend her title against three of her Nike Oregon Project teammates: Shannon Rowbury, Treniere Moser and Jordan Hasay. Rowbury, 30, is a two-time Olympian and was the bronze medalist at 1,500 meters in the 2009 world championships. Last weekend, she ran the fastest indoor mile for a woman this year, clocking a 4:22.66 on a flat track at the Carmel City Elite Miles in Winston-Salem, N.C.Sanya Richards-Ross, the top women’s 400-meter runner and the 2012 Olympic gold medalist, will run her only race of the indoor season in the Millrose 400. Richards-Ross, whose 2013 and ’14 seasons were hampered by two operations on her right big toe to correct an arthritic condition, said she was training well and feeling confident. She is preparing for her outdoor season, which will begin in late April or early May.Ajee Wilson, 20, from Neptune, N.J., who won the 800 meters two weeks ago at the Armory Invitational, headlines the women’s 800 field. And there will be a showdown in the men’s 60 hurdles, with Ashton Eaton, the 2012 decathlon world-record holder and 2012 Olympic gold medalist, going against Jason Richardson, the 2012 Olympic silver medalist in the 110 hurdles, and David Oliver, the 2013 world championships gold medalist and 2008 Olympic bronze medalist in the 110 hurdles.Advertisement
