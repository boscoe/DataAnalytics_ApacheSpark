Lundqvist writhed in pain with his legs flailing, but he remained in the game after being treated for about five minutes. “When I got hit, it was obviously extremely painful and it was hard to breathe for a couple of minutes,” Lundqvist said. “It could have been a lot worse. I feel lucky.”Lundqvist’s best save came just over a minute into the second period, when he got his skate on the puck to prevent Andrej Nestrasil from scoring.The Rangers spent much of the first period pinned in their zone. They were outshot, 15-8, and relied on Lundqvist to bail them out multiple times, but they carried a 2-0 lead into the intermission.Advertisement
