Smoltz has called games for Fox the last two seasons but has chiefly worked for MLB Network. As analysts for Fox and Fox Sports 1, Reynolds and Verducci were seen as overly talkative and lacking strong chemistry.“We thought Tom and Harold did a good job,” said John Entz, the president for production and executive producer of Fox Sports. “But we think John can bring something, with his unique combination of on-field credentials and postseason experience, that few people can provide. It’s another level of insight.” Referring to Smoltz’s performance during the past two years, Entz added: “We’ve seen how much work he’s put into his broadcasting. A lot of guys don’t want to put in that much work. He’s become a quality broadcaster.” Verducci will continue to call games for Fox next season, the last year of his contract. Reynolds’s contract has expired, but he may continue to work for Fox, Entz said.Verducci said in an email: “I appreciate that Fox provided me this great opportunity as a baseball writer to serve as a lead analyst, including on the World Series, and I look forward to continuing to be an integral part of MLB on Fox.”Advertisement
