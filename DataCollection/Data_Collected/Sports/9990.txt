CHARLOTTE, N.C. —  When San Diego State forward Dwayne Polee II collapsed in the middle of a game against U.C.-Riverside on Dec. 22, it could have meant the end of his basketball career. But an irregular heartbeat that requires a monitor implanted in his chest hasn’t stopped Polee or his team.Polee has played in seven of the last eight games and scored 15 points to help the Aztecs beat St. John’s in the round of 64 on Friday. The Aztecs will face Duke on Sunday in a South Region game.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “I just love the game, so I wasn’t going to let my situation stop me from playing,” said Polee, who began his collegiate career with St. John’s in 2010 before transferring to San Diego State.San Diego State did not waver, either, although Coach Steve Fisher admitted he was nervous when Polee first returned.“I vividly remember his first official team practice,” Fisher said. “Even though he had done things, very strenuous things, away from me and away from the team, when I saw him practice, I went with our trainer, I said, ‘Stand here next to me and watch every move he makes.’ So, yes, you go through that.“Now he’s back to Dwayne Polee. I don’t even think about it now when he practices or when we’re playing.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
