The final-four bracket that makes up the College Football Playoff was announced Sunday, with, as expected, Clemson, Alabama, Oklahoma and Michigan State as the four teams.The only surprise, and it was a mild one, was the order: Michigan State leapfrogged Oklahoma for the third spot. In the previous rankings, released last week, Clemson was No. 1, Alabama No. 2, Oklahoma No. 3 and Michigan State No. 5.In the coming weeks, those teams will play in search of a national championship.The two national semifinals — the Orange Bowl, featuring Clemson and Oklahoma, and the Cotton Bowl, featuring Alabama and Michigan State — will be held on Dec. 31. The Orange Bowl, at Sun Life Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla., will start at 4 p.m. Eastern. The Cotton Bowl, at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Tex., will start at 8.The winners will play for the title on Jan. 11 at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz.This is the second year to feature the four-team Playoff and the 18th with a college football postseason designed to name a consensus national champion, a stretch that began in the 1998 season with the introduction of the Bowl Championship Series.AdvertisementWhile last year’s Playoff contenders included three college football blue bloods (Alabama, Florida State and Ohio State) and a fourth team, Oregon, that had played for a national title just four years earlier, this year’s mix is more diverse.AdvertisementAlabama — the only team to play in the Playoff both years — and Oklahoma are two traditional powers. Clemson has been competitive of late but has claimed only one national title, for the 1981 season — which was also the last time, before this season, that it was ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press poll. And although Michigan State had a string of national titles in the 1950s and ’60s and has experienced a resurgence under the ninth-year coach Mark Dantonio, it has tended to be overlooked in favor of Big Ten rivals such as Michigan and Ohio State.1.

The teams were selected by a 12-member committee composed of sitting athletic directors from most of the so-called Power 5 conferences, the former coaches Tom Osborne of Nebraska and Bobby Johnson of Vanderbilt, and other luminaries, such as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, now a Stanford professor.Because the committee had released preliminary rankings each Tuesday for the past several weeks, expectations for the final four were in place, and Saturday’s results — the favored team won in all four of the major conference championship games — all but ended the mystery of which four teams would qualify Sunday.On ESPN, the selection committee’s chairman, Jeff Long, acknowledged, “Last year was more difficult.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Tigers, who had been 12-0, held off North Carolina, 45-37, to win the Atlantic Coast Conference title. The Crimson Tide, who were 11-1 in the regular season, cruised past Florida, 29-15, for the Southeastern Conference championship.The Sooners (11-1) had already finished their season; the Big 12 does not hold a championship game.Where last season the Big 12 was the sole Power 5 conference with no members included in the Playoff, this season that league is the Pacific-12. Stanford, which was 10-2 in the regular season, finished its campaign with a dominating 41-22 win over Southern California on Saturday for the conference title. But its two losses, to the ranked teams Northwestern and Oregon, doomed it in a playoff system that values winning percentage even as it places a premium on conference championships.Unlike last year’s Big 12 contenders, Baylor and Texas Christian, which were apparently penalized for nominally sharing the designation of champion and for playing in one fewer competitive game, this year Oklahoma became an undisputed and respected champion by beating a strong nonconference opponent, Tennessee, on the road and then rolling over the Big 12’s other contenders, T.C.U., Baylor and Oklahoma State, with its only loss to Texas. The conference’s lack of a championship game may actually have ended up an advantage.The committee released its full final rankings later Sunday, and the matchups in the four other so-called New Year’s Six bowls — including the Rose Bowl and the Sugar Bowl — were announced.At No. 18, Houston, which beat Temple on Saturday for the American Athletic Conference title, was the highest-ranked team from the so-called Group of 5 conferences. The Cougars received a berth in the Peach Bowl, against No. 9 Florida State.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
