Baker Mayfield threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, and No. 5 Oklahoma beat No. 9 Oklahoma State, 58-23, on the road Saturday night to take the Big 12 title and quite likely a spot in the College Football Playoff.Mayfield was knocked out of the previous game with a concussion, but he was fearless against the Cowboys, rushing for 77 yards and a touchdown. The Sooners (11-1, 8-1), who are third in the playoff rankings, gained 524 yards, including 344 on the ground, to claim their third win over a ranked opponent in three weeks.Jordan Thomas intercepted two passes and returned one for a touchdown for the Sooners.J. W. Walsh passed for 325 yards and two scores, and James Washington caught seven passes for 169 yards for the Cowboys (10-2, 7-2).ALABAMA 29, AUBURN 13 Derrick Henry ran 46 times for 271 yards and Adam Griffith kicked five field goals to propel No. 2 Alabama (11-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) to the West Division title with a victory over host Auburn (6-6, 2-6).AdvertisementGriffith emerged as an Iron Bowl hero for the Crimson Tide two years after his final-play field-goal attempt touched off the Tigers’ winning “Kick-Six” play. Henry, meanwhile, just did more of the same against Auburn.AdvertisementHenry, a Heisman Trophy candidate, produced his fourth 200-yard game of the season against an SEC defense. He helped put it away with 19 runs in the fourth quarter, then extended his team-record streak of games with a rushing touchdown to 17 in the final minute.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            FLORIDA STATE 27, FLORIDA 2 Whatever chance No. 10 Florida (10-2) still had to make the Playoff disappeared in another abysmal offensive performance. The Gators, who have relied on their defense throughout the season, could make no significant plays in the passing game and hardly looked the part of a playoff contender in a home loss to No. 14 Florida State (10-2).The Gators have struggled for points since the suspension of quarterback Will Grier on October 12 because of a failed N.C.A.A. drug test.Grier completed 65 percent of his passes in Florida’s 6-0 start to the season, but his replacement, Treon Harris, has not given the Gators an effective passing game. Harris was 19 of 38 passing for 134 yards for the Gators, who played without their leading receiver, Demarcus Robinson, after he was suspended just before kickoff.Florida scored its only points on a safety with 8 minutes, 58 seconds left in the game. RAY GLIERCLEMSON 37, SOUTH CAROLINA 32 Deshaun Watson ran for three touchdowns and passed for a fourth as No. 1 Clemson (12-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) capped an undefeated regular season by holding off host South Carolina (3-9, 2-4).Watson threw for 279 yards and ran for 114 to keep the Tigers on track for a spot in the Playoff, and moved their record to 12-0 for the first time since their 1981 national title season.Next up is No. 11 North Carolina in the conference title game on Dec. 5. (AP)N. CAROLINA 45, N. CAROLINA ST. 34 Elijah Hood and T. J. Logan ran for two touchdowns each in a dominating first quarter as No. 11 North Carolina (11-1, 8-0 A.C.C.) won at North Carolina State (7-5, 3-5).Logan scored on runs of 42 and 40 yards, while Hood had a 39-yard run before scoring from a yard out in the Tar Heels’ 35-point avalanche.AdvertisementNorth Carolina also had touchdown receptions from Quinshad Davis and Mack Hollins, tying the team’s single-quarter scoring record in rolling to a 35-7 lead. That was too big a hole for the Wolfpack, who managed to slow the Tar Heels’ early onslaught.Hood finished with a career-high 220 yards rushing and two touchdowns to lead North Carolina, which had already wrapped up the A.C.C.’s Coastal Division title and a trip to next week’s league championship game. (AP)MICHIGAN STATE 55, PENN STATE 16 Connor Cook threw three touchdown passes in his return from a shoulder injury, and No. 6 Michigan State (11-1, 7-1 Big Ten) wrapped up a spot in the conference championship game by routing visiting Penn State (7-5, 4-4).The Spartans will play unbeaten Iowa for the conference title next weekend, with the winner in good position to advance to the Playoff.Michigan State finished tied atop the Big Ten East with Ohio State, but the Spartans upset the Buckeyes last weekend with Cook on the sideline. Cook came back and was brilliant against the Nittany Lions. He went 19 of 26 for 248 yards.
