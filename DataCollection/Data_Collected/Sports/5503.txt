CreditLibrado Romero/The New York Times        Meadowlark Lemon, who died on Sunday in Scottsdale, Ariz., at age 83, dazzled a generation of basketball fans with his halfcourt hook shots and his wit as a longtime member of the Harlem Globetrotters.He left a lasting impression on hundreds of commenters on the New York Times Facebook page, who shared their memories of Lemon and his performances.“Never saw anyone leave the show who wasn’t smiling,” Buzz Anderson wrote.“What kid during that era did not love Meadowlark Lemon? His antics with the ball inspired kids to play basketball, do tricks, dribble better and play with a smile. When they were on Wide World of Sports, every kid with a TV watched them,” Frank Soos wrote.In a highlight reel with archival footage of the Globetrotters, admirers described Lemon as an “ageless court magician,” “like a ballerina” and “one of the greatest showmen that ever played basketball.”In 2003, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In his acceptance speech, he noted two other hook shot artists, Cliff Hagan and Kareem Abdul-Jabaar.Advertisement“Those were the three hook shots that I’ve known in my life,” he said. “Hagan, Kareem and Meadowlark’s hook shot with a lot of lemon flavor on it.”In his later years, he focused on charitable and ministry work. “I took the joy from the basketball court to the pulpit,” he told MassLive in August.He founded his evangelist Christian organization, Meadowlark Lemon Ministries, in 1994, and frequently spoke about his faith. He released a gospel album, “Welcome to My World,” in 1998.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
