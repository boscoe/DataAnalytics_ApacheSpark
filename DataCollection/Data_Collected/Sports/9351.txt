Capuano was hurt while facing his second batter of the game, and will almost certainly open the season on the disabled list.“I’d be surprised if he’s not out for a while,” Manager Joe Girardi said. He indicated that Esmil Rogers, Bryan Mitchell and Adam Warren were the early favorites to fill in for Capuano as the Yankees’ fifth starter.Rodriguez, who missed all of last year after being suspended in a performance-enhancing drug scandal, said the home run served as a building block because he had some doubt about whether he could still do it.“You always have doubt,” he said. “I haven’t played in a long time.”He credited a pep talk from Gene Michael for giving him a boost of confidence.“I told him that he can hit,” Michael said.Advertisement
