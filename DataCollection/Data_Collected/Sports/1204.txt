The Giants have held opponents to 80.6 rushing yards per game, a mark that ranked second in the N.F.L. entering Sunday, but the team’s weakness against the pass heavily skews that number. If an opponent can find success through the air, there is little reason to grind it out on the ground.A matchup with Philadelphia should let the Giants know where they really stand against the run. Sam Bradford has thrown for plenty of yards, but his propensity for turnovers, combined with the Eagles’ success in the running game last week, should lead to an emphasis on the ground game. Philadelphia’s offensive line is not elite, but the rushers DeMarco Murray, Darren Sproles and Ryan Mathews (who is listed as questionable) have enough talent that they could give the Giants a great deal of trouble.With the health status of Odell Beckham Jr. unknown and Victor Cruz still out, the Giants are very likely going to have a hard time keeping up.Pick: EaglesAdvertisement
