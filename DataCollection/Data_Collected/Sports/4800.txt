Frazier had in many ways become the face of Cincinnati’s franchise — even more popular than Joey Votto — after he won the home run derby so dramatically in July.It turned out to be the best moment in Cincinnati’s disappointing season, which ended in a 64-98 record and prompted the Reds to start rebuilding. They dealt the starting pitchers Johnny Cueto and Mike Leake in July, leaving them with an all-rookie rotation. They had a deal in place to ship closer Aroldis Chapman to the Dodgers this month before an off-season domestic dispute became public.Advertisement
