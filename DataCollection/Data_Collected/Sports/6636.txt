The Jets have not been in a Super Bowl for 46 years, but they do provide some backdrop for this one. Here’s why:After Bill Parcells guided the New England Patriots to the Super Bowl after the 1996 season he quit as head coach, frustrated that he did not have more power over personnel decisions. Off he went to coach the Jets, taking his trusted deputy, Bill Belichick, with him.Robert K. Kraft, the Patriots’ owner, then hired Pete Carroll to replace Parcells. Carroll, who had once coached the Jets, spent three seasons manning the sidelines for the Patriots. He did all right — one division title, one playoff victory, a 27-21 record over all — but was hurt by the fact that he was no Parcells. After the 1999 season, Kraft fired him.On that same day, Parcells resigned as Jets coach, to be replaced by Belichick. Except that Belichick immediately changed his mind, delivering a famous note to Jets management that stated he had “decided to resign as HC of the N.Y. Jets.”Where did Belichick go instead? Back to the Patriots, to replace Carroll and become the pre-eminent head coach in the N.F.L., with three Super Bowl titles to his name. Carroll, on the other hand, is now hoping to make it two Super Bowl victories in a row for Seattle.Both men have done well from the days when they seemed to be intersecting with each other regularly. The Patriots and Kraft have prospered, too. The Jets? Well, that’s another story.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: As Close as It Gets for the Jets.
