Georgia hired Alabama’s defensive coordinator, Kirby Smart, as its head coach on Sunday, hoping he can accomplish something for the Bulldogs that has been routine for the Crimson Tide but eluded Mark Richt during his 15 years in charge: a national championship.Smart was formally approved as Richt’s successor during a meeting of the university athletic association’s executive committee.Smart, who will turn 40 on Dec. 23, played at Georgia in the 1990s and has been Nick Saban’s defensive coordinator at Alabama since 2008. Richt has taken a job as Miami’s coach — returning to his alma mater, as Smart has.Smart agreed to a six-year contract that will pay him at least $3.75 million a year, with a base salary of $400,000 and $3.35 million from apparel deals, television and radio appearances and other endorsements.A version of this brief appears in print on December 7, 2015, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: New Coach at Georgia.
