Manfred put a time frame on the plan Wednesday by telling The Wall Street Journal that the most likely time to do it would be during spring training next year.“We’re in ongoing discussions with federal agencies regarding how the law applies,” said Pat Courtney, the chief communications officer for Major League Baseball.President Obama said in December that the United States intended to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba and open an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than half a century.The idea of playing in Cuba is a natural fit for Major League Baseball because the sport has remained extraordinarily popular there for many years. Cuba has been a part of the World Baseball Classic, which has been held in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and more and more Cuban players — including Aroldis Chapman, Yoenis Cespedes, Yasiel Puig, Jose Fernandez and Jose Abreu — are making a significant impact in the majors.During his visit to the Miami Marlins’ spring training camp this month, Manfred, who took over for the retired Bud Selig as commissioner in January, told reporters that the tradition of baseball in Cuba, and the talent there, made it a logical fit for exhibition play.“I can envision a situation, assuming that is consistent with the government’s policy on Cuba, where we could have ongoing exhibition game activity in Cuba,” Manfred said then. “We’re going to follow the government’s lead on when it makes sense for us to try to play some games there.”Major League Baseball last played in Cuba in 1999, when the Baltimore Orioles had an exhibition game against the Cuban national team during spring training. The Cuban team then played an exhibition in Baltimore during the 1999 regular season.Advertisement
