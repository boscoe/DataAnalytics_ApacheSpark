The Giants continued their understated accumulation of free agents Friday by signing the former Dallas Cowboys defensive end George Selvie to a one-year, $1.4 million contract. Selvie is the seventh free agent the team has acquired in the last 10 days, a list that includes signed the former Jets defensive tackle Kenrick Ellis.The Giants’ rushing defense was among the worst in the N.F.L. last year, and Selvie and Ellis are seen as veterans who could make the Giants stronger against the run. The team is hoping that defensive end Damontre Moore, the team’s third pick in 2013, can mature into a dependable pass-rushing threat with defensive end Robert Ayers and tackles Johnathan Hankins and Cullen Jenkins joining a deep rotation of lineman that Spagnuolo likes to employ.The signing of Selvie also reunited former college teammates as Selvie joins Jason Pierre-Paul, the Giants’ right defensive end and best defender, who played with Selvie at South Florida.Selvie was drafted in the seventh round by St. Louis when the Rams’ head coach was Steve Spagnuolo, the Giants’ defensive coordinator in 2007-8 who has returned to his former job with the Giants. Spagnuolo’s Giants defenses were always stout against the run.Selvie, 28, played in every game for the Cowboys in the last two seasons, including 29 starts, and had 69 tackles and 10 sacks.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
