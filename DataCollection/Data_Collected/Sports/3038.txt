Behind Dalton, the Bengals are 1-3 against the Texans, with two of the losses coming in the playoffs. Further, Dalton has tossed two touchdowns and five interceptions in those games, with the team averaging only 16 points.The Texans enter the week only a half-game behind the Colts in the A.F.C. South. For Houston to have a chance in this one, its J.J. Watt-led defense will have to play up to the lofty expectations set for it going into the season and keep this a close, low-scoring game. Otherwise, it’s doubtful Houston’s anemic offense can score enough points to keep up with the Bengals’ scoring output.PICK: BengalsAdvertisement
