Fantasy football analysis for N.F.L. Week 14 games, including Monday’s matchup between the Miami Dolphins and the Giants. You can also follow the Sablich brothers on Twitter at @5thDownFantasy and see their complete Week 14 player rankings.1 p.m. Line: Bengals by 3Quarterback Andy Dalton (CIN) — He had one of his more disappointing performances against the Steelers in Week 8 (231/1/2), but over all, the Steelers, with the league’s 29th ranked pass defense (275.5), are quite beatable. Dalton has put up solid performances in each of the last three games and is a solid QB1 this weekend.Ben Roethlisberger (PIT) — The Bengals’ mighty pass defense shut Roethlisberger down in Week 8, intercepting him three times and limiting him to one touchdown. We’re ranking him as a low-end QB1 option in Week 14.Running BackDeAngelo Williams (PIT) — The Bengals have not allowed at least 10 fantasy points to a back since Williams ran for 71 yards on nine carries in Week 8. He recently overcame another tough matchup in Week 12 against the Seahawks (17.7 points). He remains a top-five RB play.AdvertisementJeremy Hill (CIN) — Hill’s 22 carries in Week 13 were his most of the season, and he looked strong, gaining 98 yards and a touchdown against the Browns. A much tougher matchup awaits in the Steelers, who allow the third fewest fantasy points to the position (13.9 F.P.P.G.) and held Hill to 60 scoreless yards in Week 8.Advertisement Wide Receiver/Tight End Antonio Brown (PIT) — Three of his last four games have produced huge fantasy numbers, and he caught the team’s lone touchdown pass against the Bengals in Week 8.A.J. Green (CIN) — He’s back on track in a big way, topping 18 fantasy points in each of his last two games. He also had one of his best fantasy performances of the season against the Steelers in Week 8 (11/118/1). He’s a top-five WR play.Tyler Eifert (CIN) — He scored his 12th touchdown of the season last weekend against the Rams, his sixth in the last four games. The Steelers held him to four catches for 40 yards in Week 8, but they remain one of the better fantasy matchups for the position (10.1 F.P.P.G.).
                These player rankings from the Sablich brothers are for standard and PPR scoring formats and will be updated throughout the season.            1 p.m. Line: Bears by 3Quarterback Jay Cutler (CHI) — He has not topped 20 fantasy points since Week 10, and is coming off his worst fantasy performance of the season, so he’s impossible to trust, even against a mediocre Redskins pass defense.Running Back Matt Forte/Jeremy Langford (CHI) — After both backs saw a fairly even workload in Week 12, Forte was back as the lead back last weekend with 22 carries, totaling 131 yards and a touchdown. Langford will still be stealing some work, which limits Forte’s upside, but he’s back in the RB1 conversation.Wide Receiver/Tight End Alshon Jeffery (CHI) — He been targeted plenty over the last two weeks, but doesn’t have the fantasy production to show for it, mainly because he has no touchdowns. That could certainly change against the Redskins, who have allowed the seventh most F.P.P.G. to the position. We still like him as a solid WR1.DeSean Jackson (WAS) — With a touchdown in each of his last three games, he’s in the WR2/WR3 mix once again. His fantasy value does depend a lot on touchdowns, but the Bears have allowed 15 of them to the position this season (tied for 11th most).Advertisement Jordan Reed (WAS) – The Bears have allowed only two touchdowns and 5.6 F.P.P.G. to the position.1 p.m. Line: Browns by 1.5 Running Back Shaun Draughn (SF) — The good news for Draughn owners is that the Browns have the second worst run defense in the N.F.L. (136.3 Y.P.G.). The bad news: He is averaging only 3.3 Y.P.C. this season. He did have his first touchdown of the season last weekend, and we think the matchup outweighs the other concerns and expect low-end RB1 production.Wide Receiver/Tight End Travis Benjamin (CLE) — Assuming he can play through his shoulder injury, he is an interesting WR3 play with Johnny Manziel at quarterback. Three of his five touchdowns have come from Manziel, and the last time they played together, Benjamin had seven catches for 113 yards on 11 targets in Week 10. The 49ers allow the sixth most receiving yards in the league (281.8 Y.P.G.).Anquan Boldin (SF) — He is a low-end WR3 against the Browns, who have allowed the fifth most fantasy points to the position.Gary Barnidge (CLE) — He is averaging 9.2 F.P.P.G. with Manziel, compared with 16.4 with other quarterbacks, but he remains a solid TE1 play given the lack of reliable options at the position.1 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 10Quarterback Philip Rivers (SD) — He managed just 178 yards and an interception the last time he played this stingy pass defense. The Chiefs won that matchup in a blowout, 33-3. There’s no way to feel good about Rivers as your starting quarterback in a fantasy playoff game this weekend.Alex Smith (KC) — He has been quietly consistent of late, with two games surpassing 20 fantasy points in a row, but he was held without a touchdown pass against the Chargers in Week 11. You can take a chance on Smith this week if you’re thin at the position, but don’t expect QB1 numbers.Running Back Charcandrick West/Spencer Ware (KC) — The Chargers allow the fifth most F.P.P.G. to backs (23.2), but West had only 16 yards on 11 carries in Week 11 (though he did tack on 46 receiving yards). Ware is firmly in the mix, making either difficult to trust this weekend.Advertisement Wide Receiver/Tight End Jeremy Maclin (KC) — He had another WR1-like performance in Week 13, with 95 yards and two touchdowns against the Raiders. But we still see him as an WR2 against the Chargers, who held him to three receptions for 29 yards in Week 11 and who allow the sixth fewest F.P.P.G. to receivers.Antonio Gates (SD) — Against the Chiefs, who allow the fewest fantasy points to tight ends, Gates had one reception for 6 yards. His talent keeps him in the TE1 conversation, but do not expect much.Travis Kelce (KC) — The Chargers are the sixth best matchup for fantasy ends, though Kelce managed only 46 yards on five receptions in Week 11. Still, given the lack of depth at the position in terms of fantasy value, Kelce remains a top-five play.1 p.m. Line: Pick ‘emQuarterback Matthew Stafford (DET) — On paper, the Rams are the eighth toughest fantasy matchup for quarterbacks (15.2 F.P.P.G.). But two of their last four opponents have topped 20 fantasy points, and another, Andy Dalton, threw for three touchdowns. Stafford is a solid QB2 play for those dealing with depth issues at the position.Running Back Todd Gurley (STL) — After struggling against the run early in the season, the Lions have kept all opposing backs under 50 yards each over the last four games, including Eddie Lacy and DeMarco Murray the last two games. Wide ReceiverCalvin Johnson (DET) — The Rams allow the fourth fewest F.P.P.G. to the position, but have yielded four touchdowns to the position over the last three weeks. Johnson is still a solid WR1 this weekend.1 p.m. Line: Jets by 7Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (NYJ) — The Titans have given up eight passing touchdowns over the past two games. Fitzpatrick has six during that span. He has earned his place as a QB1, be it on the lower end.Marcus Mariota (TEN) — He is coming off a monster performance against the Jaguars (37.9 points, including 112 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown). The Jets’ pass defense has certainly been beatable this year, though Darrelle Revis is expected to return. Mariota is a QB2 worth taking a chance on if you’re hurting at the position.AdvertisementRunning Back Chris Ivory (NYJ) — The Titans have not allowed a back to top 100 rushing yards since Devonta Freeman in Week 7, and yield the fourth fewest F.P.P.G. Ivory is a low-end RB2 in this tough matchup.Wide Receiver/Tight End Brandon Marshall/Eric Decker (NYJ) — We’re running out of things to say about these two consistent performers. We like Marshall as a top-five WR play in this matchup (25.5 F.P.P.G., 11th most).Delanie Walker (TEN) — The Jets have let tight ends find the end zone just twice this season, but as Mariota’s favorite target, Walker remains an elite option at the position.1 p.m. Line: Bills by 1Quarterback Tyrod Taylor (BUF) – He has forced his way into the QB1 conversation with two very big games in a row. Four of the last five quarterbacks to play the Eagles have topped 23 points (even Matt Cassel). A third QB1 performance is certainly a strong possibility.Running Back DeMarco Murray (PHI) — The Bills have allowed an opposing back to top 12 fantasy points in nine of 12 games. Murray hasn’t played well of late, with just 14.5 fantasy points in his last three games combined, but the matchup makes him an interesting low-end RB2 play.LeSean McCoy (BUF) — Nine backs have topped 12 fantasy points in the last six games against the Eagles, which seems impossible. There is no reason not to view McCoy as a top-five RB play this weekend. Wide Receiver  Jordan Matthews (PHI) — With three touchdowns in his last five games, he’s worth low-end WR3 consideration the rest of the season.Sammy Watkins (BUF) — How do you not love Watkins this week? He has the best fantasy matchup for the position (28.9 F.P.P.G.) and has 44.7 fantasy points in his last two games combined.1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 4 Quarterback Jameis Winston (TB) — While he has only two touchdown passes in the two games since his five-touchdown performance against the Eagles, he will be a tempting play this week against the Saints, who, astonishingly, have allowed 24 touchdowns in their last six games. Over all, they are, by far, the best fantasy matchup for quarterbacks (25.1 F.P.P.G.).AdvertisementDrew Brees (NO) — The Buccaneers held Brees to 12.1 F.P.P.G. in Week 2. There’s always potential for a big game from Brees, but his inconsistency this season keeps him on the lower end of the QB1 spectrum, especially with Brandin Cooks now expected to sit this one out.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They did hold Martin to under 10 fantasy points in Week 2, but odds are good for a big performance from fantasy’s third best back.C.J. Spiller/Tim Hightower (NO) – With Mark Ingram done for the season, Spiller and Hightower will fill the void. The Saints may have to pass a lot more than run to keep pace with the Buccaneers’ offense, and the uncertainty regarding which back gets more touches keeps both as flex-only starts for the desperate.Wide Receiver Mike Evans/Vincent Jackson (TB) — Given the matchup, we like Evans as a very solid WR1 with Jackson warranting WR2 consideration. Jackson had 54 yards and a touchdown in Week 2.Willie Snead/Brandin Cooks (NO) — Snead will move up to an WR3 play if Cooks sits, but has been limited at practice this week with a calf injury. Chances are he’ll play, but keep an eye on the injury reports Sunday morning.1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 7.5 Quarterback Matt Ryan (ATL) — While the Panthers allowed Drew Brees to throw for three touchdowns in Week 13, they are the third toughest matchup for quarterbacks this season (14.2 F.P.P.G.). With only two touchdowns in his last two games, he is barely on the QB2 radar in this difficult matchup.Cam Newton (CAR) — The Falcons should give Newton a true test (14 F.P.P.G., second fewest), but Newton, who is averaging 27.5 F.P.P.G., has dipped below 20 fantasy points only three times, with a floor of 16.3 in Week 1. He is our top QB play despite the matchup.Running Back Devonta Freeman (ATL) — The Panthers have allowed only one 100-yard rusher this season, and only two rushing touchdowns over the last six games, making Freeman more of a midrange RB1 than an elite play.Advertisement Jonathan Stewart (CAR) — The Falcons continue to be one of the more favorable fantasy matchups for backs, allowing 23.4 F.P.P.G.Wide Receiver/Tight End  Julio Jones (ATL) — He has not had a touchdown since Week 8, and the Panthers allow the seventh fewest fantasy points to the position, knocking Jones down to a low-end WR1. Greg Olsen (CAR) – Fantasy’s second best tight end is our top tight end play in this favorable matchup.1 p.m. Line: Pick ‘EmQuarterback Blake Bortles (JAC) — Nobody expected five touchdowns from Bortles last week against the Titans, but there’s no way to ignore the fact that he is fantasy’s seventh best quarterback through 12 games. He has either 300 yards or two touchdowns, or both, in nine of 12 games. He threw for 298 yards and a touchdown against the Colts in Week 4.Running BackFrank Gore (IND) — The Titans’ Antonio Andrews was the first back to top 10 fantasy points and score a touchdown against the Jaguars since Week 9, and they still held him to 58 rushing yards.T.J. Yeldon (JAC) — He ran for 105 yards on 22 carries the last time he faced the Colts, who allow the ninth most fantasy points to the position (19.9 F.P.P.G.). Wide Receiver T.Y. Hilton/Donte Moncrief (IND) — Both were kept around 7 fantasy points without a touchdown in Week 4. Minus his two-touchdown game against the Buccaneers in Week 12, Hilton is averaging just 3.9 F.P.P.G. in his other four games since Week 7. He is a risky low-end WR2.Allen Robinson/Allen Hurns (JAC) — With Hurns out last week, Robinson cashed in on Bortles’s big performance, finishing with three touchdowns and 33.3 fantasy points. Hurns is set to return as a strong WR3 play with Robinson earning WR1 status.Advertisement4:05 p.m. Line: Broncos by 7.5Running Back Latavius Murray (OAK) — Only one back has run for 100 yards or more against the Broncos this season, and Murray was held to 39 yards on 13 carries against them in Week 5.Ronnie Hillman/C.J. Anderson (DEN) — Both are banged up, and there is talk that Juwan Thompson could end up starting. Hillman is the preferred play, if healthy, given his recent workload. Keep an eye on the injury reports and add Thompson if he’s available in your league.Wide Receiver Demaryius Thomas/Emmanuel Sanders (DEN) — Thomas is averaging 3.4 fewer receptions per game without Peyton Manning, but still has two touchdowns in his last three games, while Sanders, who had nine receptions and 111 yards against the Raiders in Week 5, has none. Both are solid WR2 plays.Amari Cooper/Michael Crabtree (OAK) — Do not expect a touchdown from a Raiders receiver this weekend. The Broncos have given up only one to the position.4:25 p.m. Line: Packers by 7Quarterback Aaron Rodgers (GB) — The Cowboys enter Week 14 with the fifth best passing defense in the N.F.L., and have not allowed a quarterback to top 20 fantasy points since Week 5. But Rodgers is not a quarterback you get too worried about when it comes to matchups, and he has averaged 21.8 F.P.P.G. over his last five games.Running BackDarren McFadden (DAL) — He has at least 11 fantasy points in five of his last seven games.Eddie Lacy (GB) — After two strong performances, Lacy bombed last Thursday against the Lions and was benched. It’s unclear whether he or James Starks will get the start, but one could assume Starks will be more involved. The Cowboys have been very good against the run over the last four weeks, allowing no touchdowns and only one back to top 50 yards (68 by Jonathan Stewart, Week 12). Wide Receiver Dez Bryant (DAL) — He’s just not nearly the same player with Matt Cassel behind center. We won’t tell you to bench your top draft pick in your playoff game this weekend, but know that he has just five catches and no touchdowns in the last two games combined.AdvertisementRandall Cobb (GB) — Cobb has fewer than 10 fantasy points in each of his last four games. He can no longer be considered more than a WR3 play, with the tight end Richard Rodgers emerging as Aaron Rodgers’s favorite red zone target.1 p.m. Line: Seahawks by 6QuarterbackRussell Wilson (SEA) — He’s on a tear, with 11 touchdown passes over his last three games, including three against a very tough Vikings pass defense in Week 13. He’s our second ranked quarterback this week against the Ravens (19.2 F.P.P.G.).Running Back Javorius Allen (BAL) — He’ll get his toughest matchup yet since taking over as the team’s starting back. In fact, it’s the toughest fantasy matchup for any running back at 12.8 F.P.P.G. Still, the way Allen has played, particularly in the passing game (12 receptions for 107 yards and a touchdown last weekend), he is still worth RB1 consideration.Thomas Rawls (SEA) — He continued to shine with 101 yards and a touchdown against a very good Vikings run defense. The Ravens are also tough against opposing backs, but that’s not stopping us from putting Rawls in the top five of our running back rankings. He has 69.9 fantasy points, or 23.3 F.P.P.G., since taking over for Marshawn Lynch in Week 11.Wide Receiver Doug Baldwin (SEA) – He has over 400 yards and six touchdowns in his last four games. He has earned a WR2 spot in your lineup, especially against the Ravens, who have allowed the fourth most F.P.P.G. to the position (27.3).8:30 p.m. Line: Patriots by 3.5Quarterback Tom Brady (NE) — It was ugly, but Brady ended up with four touchdowns and over 300 passing yards (and two interceptions) last weekend against the Eagles. While Rob Gronkowski returned to practice Thursday, in a limited way, it’s unclear whether he will play. Brady is not the same without him, but regardless, Brady is a top-five QB play.Running BackLeGarrette Blount (NE) — He is a risky RB2, given the fluctuation in his workload from week to week. If the Patriots can get off to an early lead and lean more on the run, especially if Brady struggles the way he has without Gronkowski, Blount should produce.Wide Receiver DeAndre Hopkins (HOU) — Fantasy’s top receiver will receive plenty of unwanted attention from cornerback Malcolm Butler and the Patriots secondary. But there’s no good reason not to expect WR1 numbers again from Hopkins.AdvertisementBrandon LaFell/Danny Amendola (NE) — Amendola, who had seven catches for 62 yards and a touchdown last week, is your WR2 play in a fairly tough matchup with the Texans (20.8 F.P.P.G., 11th fewest). 8:30 p.m. Monday. Line: Giants by 11.5.Quarterback Eli Manning (NYG) — Who knows what you’ll get from the inconsistent Manning against a beatable Dolphins pass defense (11th in N.F.L.). He has four interceptions compared with three touchdowns over the last two games, but he also has Odell Beckham Jr., and the Giants are still fighting for a division title. You cannot trust him, but he has QB1 potential.Running Back Lamar Miller (MIA) — He had his best game in several weeks against a tough Ravens front, averaging 5.7 Y.P.C. on his way to 113 rushing yards. The Giants allow the seventh most fantasy points to the position. Wide Receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (NYG) — Fantasy’s third best receiver has topped 140 yards in each of the last two games, and 100 in each of the last five. He also has a touchdown in three consecutive games. WR plays do not get any safer at this point in the season.Jarvis Landry (MIA) — Against the Giants’ last-ranked pass defense, Landry is a very tempting WR2 play. Ryan Tannehill and the Dolphins have come to lean more on the run, which limits his upside.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
