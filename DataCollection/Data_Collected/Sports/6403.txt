Updated: Wednesday, Jan. 14Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson have completed “the hardest completed rock climb in the world”:On the 19th day, Caldwell and Jorgeson reached the summit of El Capitan’s Dawn Wall, completing a quest that included years of planning and that many considered the most challenging rock climb in the world.Dozens of family members and friends greeted the climbers when they reached the top at 3:25 p.m. on a cloudless day.They are the first to free climb every inch of the 3,000-foot Dawn Wall in a single expedition, long considered impossible, using only their hands and feet to pull themselves up. Ropes were merely safety devices to break the occasional fall. By virtue of its scale and difficulty, the climb was considered by some to be the most difficult ever accomplished.About three dozen people are waiting at the top, mostly friends and family. At front of the group is Caldwell’s wife, Rebecca. (She ultimately decided not to bring their 20-month-old boy, Fitz.) Jorgeson’s girlfriend, Jacqui Becker, and his father, Eric, are also near the front of the group preparing to greet the climbers.AdvertisementUpon their arrival, the climbers will receive two trophies purchased at a vintage story by one of Caldwell’s friends — a bowling trophy and a preaching trophy. There are also several bottles of sparkling wine nearby.AdvertisementThe top of El Capitan is not flat, so there will be no cartoonlike arrival — no hand appearing on the ledge from the abyss below. The vertical wall has no sharp edge at the top, but gives way to a steep slab of granite, sprinkled with crumbling rocks and small pines and shrubs. A dropped ball 100 yards from the cliff would bounce and roll downhill and then plunge out of sight. The climbers are expected to finish the last pitch and perhaps scramble or crawl the last few feet to their awaiting friends and families.An hour ago, there were about a dozen people — a few reporters, cameramen and representatives from the climbers’ sponsors, who are trying to manage whatever reception the climbers receive. A group of friends and family climbed up the East Ledges, about a three-hour hike and climb up fixed ropes, and Jorgeson’s father, Eric, hiked the eight-mile trail that passed Upper Yosemite Falls and climbs 3,600 feet to the back side of El Capitan.The reporter John Branch hiked an eight-mile trail to get up there, departing at 3:30 a.m. and arriving about five and a half hours later. The trail ascended 3,600 vertical feet, and now John has a sweeping view of the Yosemite Valley.Many of the climbers’ family and friends are taking an alternate route — one suitable for experienced climbers. It’s known as the East Ledges, a series of fixed ropes that takes less time than the hike but requires some climbing skills. Among those on the way now via the East Ledges is the climber Alex Honnold, who is carrying Tommy Caldwell’s 1-year-old baby, Fitz.The weather is clear in the Yosemite Valley, John says, the sun illuminating El Capitan’s southeastern face, known as the Dawn Wall. Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson hope to reach the summit Wednesday, becoming the first ever to free climb the route in a single push.They reached the small ledge of the Ship’s Bow on Tuesday night, leaving them perhaps 500 vertical feet from the top. By the standards of other pitches on the Dawn Wall, the four remaining pitches are not extremely difficult, but they are relatively unfamiliar to the climbers, who last spent time on the upper parts of the wall several years ago.They woke in the portaledges to temperatures near freezing, but the forecast calls for the mid-50s by midday, when the climbers hope to complete their 19-day trek.AdvertisementWho are these guys? Veteran rock climbers who have done this sort of thing — well, perhaps not quite this difficult — all over the world. Caldwell, originally from Estes Park, Colo., was named one of National Geographic’s adventurers of the year for 2014-15. Jorgeson is from Santa Rosa, Calif.Why is this such a big deal? No one has ever free-climbed the Dawn Wall route on El Capitan. Free climbing means they are using ropes and other gear, but only for safety. They are not actively pulling up on bolts or other equipment to help their ascent. (That’s known as aid climbing.)“What makes the Dawn Wall so special is that it’s almost not possible,” the renowned climber Alex Honnold said. “The hardest pitches on the Dawn Wall are harder than I’ve ever climbed.” Honnold is famous for free-solo climbing, which means he does not use any ropes at all. But he has never attempted the Dawn Wall.Tom Evans, a climber who has chronicled pursuits at El Capitan for years through his camera lens and a blog, said that only about 13 of El Capitan’s climbing routes had been free climbed. The Dawn Wall, so named because its southeast orientation catches the first light of morning, is far harder than any of the others, climbers said.So, have Caldwell and Jorgeson fallen? Yes, many times, but their ropes prevent them from falling too far. Major injuries are still a concern, since it is common to slam against the wall on a fall.
                Where’s Kevin? Zoom in to find Kevin Jorgeson perched on the face of El Capitan’s Dawn Wall.            A little more background and context: There are about 100 routes up El Capitan, first summited from the valley floor in 1958. The tip of El Capitan is about 3,000 feet up from the base. There are about 31 pitches, or sections, of varying difficulty and length in the Dawn Wall route.Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell (no relation to Tommy) were the first to climb Dawn Wall, in 1970, using ropes and countless rivets over 27 days. They endured a treacherous four-day storm and made national news. They also turned down the National Park Service’s attempt to rescue them, offering their would-be saviors wine instead.We received a lot of questions from readers about rock climbing in general and about the Dawn Wall effort specifically. So we had two world-class climbers, Alex Honnold and Beth Rodden, field some questions.AdvertisementQ: If one of the climbers can’t get to the top, do they rappel all the way down? If they are injured, how do they get rescued?A: They will both be able to get to the top, it’s just a question of whether or not they will both be able to free climb the route. Both of them are incredibly talented climbers that can either ascend the fixed ropes to the summit or aid climb if they cannot free climb the route.Yosemite Search and Rescue is very talented if they got seriously injured. But again, they are both extremely talented and competent, so I think that is a slim chance. — Beth RoddenQ: Can you guys explain how Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgesen will measure their success on this Dawn Wall free climb attempt? — Guy McCarthy A: I think success will be both of them free climbing the wall. Anything less than a team ascent would be hugely disappointing, though I’m sure they are open to all potential scenarios. But they both hope to free the wall. — Alex Honnold Q: Is this a new route, and if so has Tommy named it yet? How many rope lengths is it and how many vertical feet altogether would you estimate it is from base of the cliff to the high point? — Guy McCarthyEpicTV spoke with Tommy Caldwell before he embarked on the Dawn Wall climb. A: I’m pretty sure they’re just calling it the Dawn Wall. Or the free Dawn Wall, to differentiate it from the aid routes. It’s probably about 3,000 feet from the bottom to top, though some of the climbing is horizontal, so they actually climb more than that, I think. — Alex Honnold Q: Back to how they will measure whether this will be a successful free climb ascent. Is the measure of success that each member of the climbing team — Tommy and Kevin — climb each pitch without falling? In other words, are an unlimited number of falls allowed on this multiday attempt, so long as the bottom line is: each climber ultimately does climb each pitch without aid and without falling? — Guy McCarthyAdvertisement A: Yes, as many falls as it takes, as long as they ultimately free climb each pitch without falling. — Alex Honnold Q: It seems to me that the mental strength required to complete a climb of this sort is even more impressive than the extreme physical difficulty of each pitch. Periods of almost inhuman focus and concentration surround by hours and hours of nothing. Waiting for parts to heal, staying limber and ready for the next pitch could be incredibly tedious and boring. And alongside that, there is fear to surmount, anxiety about the prospect of failure, etc. I’d love to hear Alex and Beth’s thoughts on this, their own techniques for dealing with this sort of thing, and, to the extent they know, how Caldwell and Jorgeson each deal with the mental side of this battle with El Cap.— Yetsuh Frank A: There is definitely mental strength involved, but maybe not as much as you think. Yes, I’m sure they’re anxious about failure and conditions and weather and all those things. But they definitely aren’t feeling any fear about the actual climbing. They’ve worked on the route for seven years — they’re well prepared both physically and psychologically. Yes, it must be really hard for them to maintain their psyche and motivation while spending entire days resting their skin. Not being able to move at all must be tedious, and I’m sure they’re pretty tired. But they are climbing what will probably be the biggest route of their lives. I’m sure it’s not that hard to stay motivated. — Alex Honnold Q: If Kevin sends the dyno pitch, does Tommy come back and try to do it, too? It’s my understanding that the dyno is part of the original Dawn Wall line. It is also a much cooler movement and is not a giant loop-de-loop top rope. Wouldn’t Kevin’s ascent then become the stylistically better of the two? — Hayden MillerPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters. A: The dyno is definitely a cooler looking way to climb that section, but whether you jump across a blank section or climb around it, either way you’re free climbing it. Style can be argued any way you want. Yes, dynos look cool. But either way is valid, and considering few people in the world will ever be able to do the dyno, the circle around makes a lot of sense. Generally a first ascentionist chooses the path of least resistance. In this case, they’ve both chosen what they consider the easier way. To each their own. — Alex Honnold Q: How does a climber decide to make a leap or go around the leap in this section? — Loraine Powell A: They decide based on their own personal strengths and abilities. In Tommy’s case, the jump is really, really hard, so it makes more sense for him to go around. But Kevin is naturally better at that kind of jump, so for him it makes more sense to jump than have to climb in a long and difficult 100-foot circle. Basically it’s personal choice, depending on what seems easier. — Alex Honnold
                A graphic tracks an attempt by Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson to free-climb the 3,000-foot Dawn Wall, a vertical sheet of mostly smooth granite that many believe is the hardest climb in the world.            Q: How do Tommy and Kevin belay each other when they are separated by several pitches? — Tom HermannA: They have fixed lines on the wall so they can commute up and down between the particular pitches. So they are belaying each other, just moving back and forth for each climber. — Alex HonnoldAdvertisementQ: How are anchor points established in the wall in very hard to reach points on the wall? Does someone come from the top down? — Eric WeiA: Some of the anchor points follow the old aid route line, others have been established by the free climbers. Most free routes these days try to follow the “no hands stance” approach. This means that at the end of each pitch, you are able to get into a stance where you can stand without hands and set up your belay. This allows for the entire route to go free with zero points of aid. Hypothetically if you set an anchor at a “hanging belay” (one where you couldn’t stand without hands) then there would be a section of wall, however small, that you didn’t free climb, where you had to hang on the rope to move upward. After you reach the no hands stance, you are able to hang on the belay. Some pitches are long, as in a rope length which is approximately 180-200 feet. Others are shorter where it makes sense because of rope drag, etc. — Beth RoddenQ: Is there a bigger team accompanying Caldwell and Jorgensen other than the extra photographer? How did Caldwell climb to top of pitch 20 without Jorgensen belaying him? When Caldwell climbs back to the top of pitch 20 after helping belay Jorgensen will he use aid on his re-ascent so he won’t wear himself out? — Seth WheelerA: There have been 2 or 3 cameramen on the wall with them each day, some shooting video and some shooting still photos. Kevin did belay Tommy on all the pitches, they were able to descend their fixed lines back to their camp at night. I would imagine Tommy will “jumar” (ascend the rope not the rock) behind Kevin to reach his high point. — Beth RoddenQ: Did Tommy relocate his ledge after climbing pitch 17 and 18, and/or 19 and 20? Or does he keep coming back to the same base camp? What can you tell me about their approach to shoes? How long do they use a pair? Do they re-file the soles for better edging? — Phil EsraA: He did go back to the same camp. I’m not sure the duration of approach shoes. — Beth RoddenQ: I don’t understand how: 1. Caldwell is multiple pitches above Jorgenson at this point. In free climbing, don’t they have to ascend pitch by pitch together? 2. Caldwell can complete the climb on his own without Jorgenson. Doesn’t one have to manage the rope for the other as he climbs upward? — Lucas PollockA: 1. In the ideal world you ascend the pitches together, what we climbers call “swapping leads” where one person leads the pitch cleanly then the other follows it cleanly. You would alternate who leads and follows each pitch for the entire route. Tommy and Kevin currently have ropes fixed on the route for the camera crew and to make it so they can get back and forth to their camp. In this regard, Tommy can ascend the rope to his high point, Kevin can do the same, belay him on a pitch, jumar (a term using ascenders that attach to the rope to ascend the pitch) behind him to clean the pitch. This way Kevin avoids having to grab the sharp holds and he can “rest” while belaying Tommy. 2. If Tommy did do the route by himself, Kevin would most likely follow in this way, by “jumaring” behind him instead of free climbing. — Beth RoddenQ: Wondering who takes their gear/portaledges up for them and how. Also, did they bolt the routes in advance or how are they clipping in? — Laura HuffmanAdvertisementA: They have had their portaledges on the route for the season while they have been working on the route. They have people resupplying them with food and water during their push. Some of their protection is pre-place bolts, but some is “traditional” gear — like self camming devices and passive protection such as “nuts.” — Beth RoddenQ: Why are they climbing at night? — Chris FallerA: They’re climbing at night because it’s too hot in the sun. That part of the wall bakes in direct sunlight as soon as it rises [hence the name, Dawn Wall]. In cool conditions they can stick to the holds better, which makes the climbing feel easier. In full heat it feels impossible. — Alex HonnoldQ: If Tommy is several pitches above Kevin, they can’t be belaying each other, so who is? Or are they using self-belaying devices to protect themselves individually? Or are they rappelling and/or using ascenders to get together so one can belay while one climbs and then each goes back to the start of the next pitch he’s up to, now 16 for Kevin and 20, I think, for Tommy?Similarly, one story a few days ago said they were climbing two or three pitches above their portaledges. We’re they rappelling down to eat and sleep and then using ascenders to get up to the next pitch they were up to?And lastly, are they placing bolts for the rappelling, portaledges, etc., or are they using existing ones?Thanks much. As a very mediocre climber — like up to 5.7s here in New Hampshire — I’m following this story with much interest. — Norman MichaelsA: As far as I know, they’re belaying each other. They have static ropes running all the way up the wall so that it’s possible to commute up and down between where they’re climbing where they’re sleeping. Using ascenders to go up and down is basically trivial compared to the difficulty of the actual rock climbing, so it’s not a big deal for them to move around and work on particular pitches.They’ve had to place some bolts to protect blank faces, but for the most part they’ve been using natural protection and bolts that were already in place for various aid routes. But they’ve been very conservative about their bolting. — Alex HonnoldQ: Do you think that, as new generations of climbers enter Yosemite, ascent times for the Dawn Wall will become the new standard for climbing excellence? Do you foresee athletes eventually speed climbing the Dawn Wall just as today’s climbers do with Half Dome? — Jonathan TritesAdvertisementA: I really doubt it, thought it’s certainly possible. That’s sort of the case for normal El Cap free routes like Freerider. But it’s really hard to imagine climbing progressing so far that the Dawn Wall is ever easy. But someday someone will repeat it, and it will probably take less time than Tommy and Kevin are taking. We’ll see. — Alex HonnoldFor those of you unfamiliar with climbing lingo, Phil Powers, the executive director of the American Alpine Club, has provided what he calls “a short glossary of terms to put the vertical world in context”:Free climbing is the most common form of climbing today. This is the style that Caldwell and Jorgeson are using to work up the Dawn Wall. Prudently, they have ropes that catch them if they fall, but those ropes do not help them ascend in any way. Clearly there is a huge psychological advantage in using a rope as a safety system to back up one’s climbing ability. But the rope provides no physical advantage in making progress up the rock. Progress is only made with strength, skill, perseverance and creativity.Bouldering has become very popular in the past 20 years. It is just plain old climbing as we all have done on jungle gyms. Bouldering is generally done near to the ground on free-standing boulders, and it requires no protective equipment aside from a ground pad to soften a fall.Free soloing is just like bouldering but taken to extreme heights. This is the style of climbing that Alex Honnold has made so famous. Whether one is 75 feet off the ground or 2,000, like Honnold, the results of a fall are the same — fatal. It seems crazy, I know. But think of a 2-year-old “free soloing” up a flight of wooden stairs. You and I “solo” that staircase with ease. At 2 it is potentially deadly. An accomplished and mentally adept climber can free solo unthinkable routes with great control. But let’s be clear: The consequences of a mistake or a miscalculation are devastating.Aid climbing describes the style used to climb the Dawn Wall before Caldwell and Jorgeson. Aid refers to relying on tools — metal wedges, cams, hooks and pitons — to make upward progress. They are set in cracks or hooked onto edges in the rock, and climbers pull on them or hang short rope ladders from them. They effectively climb the tools, not the rock. Until now, aid was the only way climbers had ascended this route on El Capitan. Note that this type of climbing is not described by the word “free.” Free basically means free of aid.A pitch is a general term that describes the distance between places where a team of climbers can anchor and rest. Free climbers like Caldwell and Jorgeson are using 200-foot ropes, so they must stop periodically at a logical anchor spot before running out of rope. A shorter rope would limit their access to resting spots on such a blank wall. A longer rope would be too heavy. On a wall like this, comfortable resting spots are rare. Rather than rest on ledges or terrain features, they rest by hanging on equipment anchored in the rock. It is expected that Caldwell and Jorgeson will complete the 3,000-foot Dawn Wall in roughly 31 pitches.At some of those resting spots the team must sleep. From those anchors, they hang nylon tents built on aluminum frames. These “portaledges” are really quite comfortable. The trick is making one’s anchor safe enough that sleep is possible. I liken it to investing. Just as one must invest one’s money safely enough to sleep at night, one must build enough of an anchor to sleep with ease on a big wall (in addition to the tent, they wear harnesses and are tied in to their anchors with a rope — always). They carry or haul all of this equipment, as well as food and water, with them as they progress up the wall.There is a lot more to climbing, and its various incarnations, than I have described here. Alpine climbers venture into the treacherous realms that include high altitude, snow and ice. Ice climbers swing picks into frozen water. But no matter the style, the question that many people have is: Why? All of us can identify with the tendency Americans have had to explore. We pushed west to the Pacific, deep into the ground for oil and minerals and to the moon and Mars out of our innate desire to explore and to expand the envelope of human potential. The vertical exploration, of both terrain and human potential, is, in my mind, just the logical extension of our basic desire to go places where none have gone before. — PHIL POWERSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
