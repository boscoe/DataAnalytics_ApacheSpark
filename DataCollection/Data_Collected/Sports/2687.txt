Coach David Beaty sounded hopeful that Cozart’s replacement, the freshman Ryan Willis, who continues to be hampered by a sore groin muscle, would play Saturday at Texas Christian.Last year’s starter, Michael Cummings, sustained a season-ending knee injury in the spring game, and the backup Deondre Ford had season-ending surgery to his thumb.
