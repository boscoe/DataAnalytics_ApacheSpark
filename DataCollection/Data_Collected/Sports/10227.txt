Meeks, who finished eighth in the Atlantic Coast Conference with 46 blocks, will face a tall order deflecting Wisconsin shots when the teams meet Thursday in an N.C.A.A. West Regional semifinal in Los Angeles. And not just because he has been nursing a sprained knee.The Badgers’ opponents averaged 2.0 blocks (while Wisconsin, led by its 7-foot senior forward Frank Kaminsky, who rejected 53 shots for a four-year total of 149, averaged 3.4). During the Badgers’ open practice Wednesday at Staples Center, the secret to their success in getting unobstructed shots was laid bare. In shooting drills, the players executed pump fakes and lunged forward before leaning back to shoot.The fakes and feints are playground moves that Wisconsin Coach Bo Ryan, 67, acquired as an undersize player in pickup games in Chester, Pa.“When I was 10, 11, 12 years old, a lot of the guys were a lot longer and could jump higher and were faster than I was,” he said. “So in order to be able to get my shot off, I figured out ways to put the defense on the defensive.”The shot fake became a particular favorite, he said, because “you don’t have to run fast or jump high in order to shot fake.”BADGER RETURNS The Wisconsin senior point guard Traevon Jackson, who had surgery on his right foot on Jan. 15, four days after injuring it in a game at Rutgers, will return to the lineup against North Carolina. Jackson, who had a team-leading 49 assists at the time he was sidelined, has missed 19 games.“I’m sure there will be some nerves,” Jackson said. “Other than that, it should be fine.”His strategy is to pick up where he left off. “Just having no fear, just having fun,” Jackson said. “Playing aggressive, just playing the way I play.”Advertisement
