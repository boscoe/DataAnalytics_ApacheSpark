Mississippi defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche, who was hospitalized over the weekend, was charged with possession of marijuana. The police said Nkemdiche broke a window at an Atlanta hotel, walked about 15 feet, climbed over a wall and fell roughly 15 feet late Saturday. A police report said that the hotel room was in “complete disarray” and that there were “approximately seven rolled marijuana cigarettes” in plain sight.Nkemdiche, a junior considered a potential first-round N.F.L. draft pick, has stitches in his back and leg and a swollen ankle, Coach Hugh Freeze said. Freeze said he had not made a decision regarding Nkemdiche’s status for the Sugar Bowl, on Jan. 1 against Oklahoma State.■ Clemson defensive end Shaq Lawson, the Atlantic Coast Conference’s defensive player of the year, said he would give up his final season of eligibility to enter the N.F.L. draft.■ State Representative Rick Brattin, a Republican in Missouri, proposed a bill that would strip scholarships from any college athlete who “incites, supports or participates in any strike,” a response to a threat by University of Missouri football players not to play over the handling of racial discrimination complaints.A version of this brief appears in print on December 15, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Sports Briefing | College Sports; Ole Miss Star Is Charged.
