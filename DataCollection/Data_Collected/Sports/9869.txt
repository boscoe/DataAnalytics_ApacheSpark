FIFA awarded the 2019 Women’s World Cup to France on Thursday, rewarding a rising power in women’s soccer with the chance to win the title on home soil.France is among the favorites to win this summer’s Women’s World Cup in Canada, and in four years it will look to follow the precedent of its men’s team, which won soccer’s global championship as host in 1998.South Korea, which co-hosted the men’s World Cup with Japan in 2002, was the losing finalist for the 2019 World Cup.The announcement, made by FIFA’s president, Sepp Blatter, at the organization’s headquarters in Zurich, confirmed France as a key player in world soccer over the next four years. France will host the men’s European Championship in 2016 and then the under-20 women’s World Cup in 2018 as a warm-up to the senior event the next year.France will be the third European country to host the Women’s World Cup, joining Sweden (1995) and Germany (2011). China (1991 and 2007) and the United States (1999 and 2003) have hosted twice, and Canada will bring the event back to North America in June.A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: France to Host in 2019.
