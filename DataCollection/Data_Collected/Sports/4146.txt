Two lawsuits filed for college athletes, one of which seeks to eliminate limitations on N.C.A.A. scholarships, cleared a hurdle Friday when a federal judge, Claudia Wilken, found that the suits, known as the Jenkins and Alston cases, could proceed as class actions.The Jenkins case is seen by some as the more threatening to the status quo. It seeks an order barring the N.C.A.A. and several top conferences from jointly regulating scholarship limits for the most prominent players in football and men’s basketball. The case, some say, could lead to a free market for those athletes.In the so-called O’Bannon case, Judge Wilken found last year that N.C.A.A. rules restricting athletes from profiting off their images and likenesses violated antitrust law. Earlier this year, an appellate court reversed much of that ruling, but it upheld the notion that N.C.A.A. rules intended to preserve amateurism are subject to antitrust law.Donald Remy, a lawyer for the N.C.A.A., said in a statement, “As other federal court decisions have consistently stated, agreeing to appropriate limits on financial aid does not violate antitrust laws.” MARC TRACYA version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Step Forward for Two Suits Filed Against the N.C.A.A.
