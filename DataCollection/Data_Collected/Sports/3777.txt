No. 8 Ohio State at No. 12 MichiganNoon, ABCWhichever team wins this one will turn its focus to a 3:30 game between Penn State and Michigan State. If Penn State can knock off the Spartans, the winner of this game will claim a spot in the Big Ten championship game and a chance to face Iowa with a spot in the College Football Playoff on the line. If Michigan State wins, it is in.That possibility was set up last week when the Buckeyes scored only 14 points in a loss to Michigan State that snapped their 23-game winning streak and reduced their chances of repeating as national champions. Much attention will be paid to running back Ezekiel Elliott, who was held to 33 yards rushing and had some choice comments about the play-calling. Elliott now faces a run defense that allowed Indiana’s Jordan Howard 238 yards on the ground.Michigan’s offense has improved as quarterback Jake Rudock has found his groove. Receivers Jehu Chesson, Amara Darboh and Jake Butt have emerged as solid options. Ohio State’s stout defense, especially the secondary, has bailed out a struggling offense.This is one of the best rivalries in college football, but Ohio State (10-1) has not lost in it since 2011, and a win by Michigan (9-2) would be only its second in the series in 12 years. You may remember Michigan Coach Jim Harbaugh guaranteed a Wolverines victory (and backed it up) in 1986 as a player. His presence on the sideline adds fuel to the fire.
                In the college football playoff rankings, many analysts focus on the teams. That’s the wrong way to think about the playoff picture.            No. 5 Oklahoma at No. 9 Oklahoma State8 p.m., ABCThe Sooners are tantalizingly close to a spot in the College Football Playoff, but they will need to beat their archrival. For the fifth time in eight years, this game, known as Bedlam, will have a direct impact on the Big 12 championship. Oklahoma (10-1) is in the driver’s seat. With a win, it takes home the conference crown, but a loss clinches the conference for the Cowboys, thanks to Texas Christian’s defeat of Baylor on Friday night.AdvertisementWhile a victory here would seem to clinch a playoff spot for the Sooners, they looked less than impressive last week: They needed to stop a late 2-point conversion to beat injury-riddled T.C.U. Anything can happen with the playoff rankings (as the Big 12 learned last season), but a decisive victory would help solidify the Sooners’ standing. Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield is in the hunt for the Heisman, but suffered a concussion last week. He is expected to play.AdvertisementNo. 4 Notre Dame at No. 13 Stanford7:30 p.m., FoxNotre Dame’s lone loss of the season came on the road to Clemson, the top-ranked team in the Playoff rankings. Quarterback Deshone Kizer was stopped on a late 2-point conversion that would have sent that game to overtime. Despite a 10-1 record, the Irish are on the outside of the Playoff picture looking in. One of the Irish’s biggest wins came on the road over Temple, but then the Owls lost two weeks later to South Florida, which did not help the Irish’s case. Stanford (9-2) opened its season with a loss on the road to Northwestern, then reeled off eight straight wins before losing a thriller to Oregon at home. Stanford clinched the Pac-12 North last week with a victory over California. The Irish need to make a statement on the road here. Keep an eye on Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey, who makes plays all over the field and has inserted himself firmly into the Heisman conversation.No. 14 Florida State at No. 10 Florida7:30 p.m., ESPNFlorida (10-1) won a very weak Southeastern Conference East thanks to a solid defense that helped it win close games against teams like East Carolina and Florida Atlantic. The offense has struggled mightily and is ranked 100th in the nation in yards per game. The Seminoles (9-2) lost to Georgia Tech on a blocked field goal that was returned for a game-winning touchdown, then lost to undefeated Clemson two weeks later. Both of those losses were on the road. Seminoles running back Dalvin Cook has looked unstoppable at times. Florida is still alive for a playoff spot. It would need to win here in the conference title game. That seems like a long shot; they have looked shaky lately and are underdogs at home in this one.Penn State at No. 6 Michigan State3:30 p.m., ESPNAfter last week’s victory over Ohio State, Michigan State (10-1) needs only a victory here to clinch a spot to face Iowa for the Big Ten title with a Playoff spot on the line. Michigan State has won its two biggest games (Michigan and Ohio State) in thrilling fashion. It knocked off the Buckeyes last week as a big underdog with a backup quarterback under center. The status of the starting quarterback Connor Cook is likely to be a game-time decision.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Of course, a victory here would go a long way toward turning its season around. That might be asking a lot, however, as Alabama (10-1) seems to be playing its best football down the stretch. Running back Derrick Henry is the front-runner for the Heisman, and the defense is playing well.No. 1 Clemson at South CarolinaNoon, ESPNClemson sits atop the College Football Playoff rankings, but needs to keep winning to stay there. South Carolina lost to the Citadel last week and is more than a two-touchdown underdog at home, but anything is possible in a rivalry game.No. 11 North Carolina at North Carolina State3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN (Regional)North Carolina (10-1) is putting together the program’s best season in a long time. It clinched the Coastal title and will play Clemson in the A.C.C. championship game. A victory here makes the game against the Tigers that much more intriguing.No. 22 U.C.L.A. at U.S.C.3:30 p.m., ABC/ESPN2 (Regional)Neither team has lived up to preseason expectations, but here they are with the winner of this one claiming the Pac-12 South and facing Stanford for the conference title. The Trojans were routed by Oregon last week; U.C.L.A. is coming off a statement victory over Utah.No. 19 Mississippi at No. 23 Mississippi State7:15 p.m., ESPN2The Egg Bowl ought to be an entertaining affair. It would be more entertaining if Auburn found a way to knock off Alabama earlier in the day. Then Ole Miss could win the SEC West with a victory in this one. The game features fine quarterbacks in Mississippi State’s Dak Prescott and Mississippi’s Chad Kelly.An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the game between Ohio State and Michigan. It is being played at Michigan, not at Ohio State.A version of this article appears in print on November 28, 2015, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Games to Wacth.
