The Huskies had not reached the N.C.A.A. tournament in 24 years, but their campus knew how to react.“What we’ve done with basketball for this school means so much,” said Ford, a junior forward. Northeastern’s basketball team occupies a distinctive niche in the sporting culture of a university that does not have a football team, which was disbanded in 2009 because it was too expensive. The hockey team is perennially good, and perhaps the university’s most prominent athletic program, but it has not won the Beanpot — the tournament among the four major Boston-area college hockey teams — since 1988.Into that void barged the basketball team, which last made the N.C.A.A. tournament as a member of the North Atlantic Conference, the predecessor of the America East. Northeastern continued its stunning turnaround — to 23-11, from 11-21 last season — by toppling the Colonial Athletic Association’s top two seeds, North Carolina-Wilmington and William and Mary, in that conference’s tournament to capture its first N.C.A.A. berth since 1991. The Huskies, seeded 14th in the Midwest Region, play Thursday afternoon against No. 3 Notre Dame, whose coach, Mike Brey, is wary of their outside shooting. Speaking generally, Brey said that 3-pointers were crucial for low-seeded teams hoping to spring upsets in the N.C.A.A. tournament. In their conference tournament, the Huskies made 55.3 percent (26 of 47) of their 3-point attempts, and they are shooting 38.8 percent over all from behind the arc, a mark that ranks 26th among the 351 Division I teams. With similar success on Thursday, mayhem could reign at Northeastern. Eighteen No. 14 seeds have won first-round games. “Hopefully, we’re going to make history,” Ford said.Advertisement
