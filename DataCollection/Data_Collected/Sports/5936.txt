A similar surge next January should get him the 75 percent needed for induction.The ballot for the 2016 Hall of Fame class includes two notable first-time candidates — Ken Griffey Jr., who seems a lock to be elected, and Trevor Hoffman, whose 601 career saves are second only to Mariano Rivera’s 652. Still, it is a less imposing ballot than this year’s and might make it easier for Piazza to squeeze through.Piazza was one of the best-hitting catchers in baseball history, with 427 home runs and a .308 batting average in a career primarily divided between two teams, the Dodgers and the Mets. His 396 home runs hit while playing catcher set a major league record.Those are standout numbers. But in an era in which the voting is shadowed by baseball’s entanglement with steroids, Piazza has suffered from the perception, among some writers, that he might have been a user, although no evidence has emerged that he was. Meanwhile, players who have been directly linked to performance enhancers — such as Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Sammy Sosa — have been rejected so far.Advertisement
