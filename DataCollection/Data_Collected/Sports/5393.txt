If we decide not to play guys for a different reason, that could happen. That’s not going to be because we’re going to take a step off the gas pedal right now.”The Rams generally give the Seahawks a fight, but if quarterback Russell Wilson is active, the rest of the roster might not matter. Wilson has been on fire during a five-game winning streak, with 19 touchdown passes and no interceptions. Ten of those touchdowns have gone to Doug Baldwin, who injured a hamstring last week and is listed as questionable.Pick: SeahawksAdvertisement
