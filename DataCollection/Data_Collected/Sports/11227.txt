ALLAN KREDA/THE NEW YORK TIMESBecause of an editing error, a timeline on April 13 about significant events in the Rangers’ season misstated the number of days into training camp that Rangers center Derek Stepan fractured his left leg. It was seven days, not five. The timeline also misstated goalie Henrik Lundqvist’s statistics after he returned from a two-month absence. He had a 2.29 goals-against average and a .924 save percentage — not a 2.00 goals-against average and a .925 save percentage.Advertisement
