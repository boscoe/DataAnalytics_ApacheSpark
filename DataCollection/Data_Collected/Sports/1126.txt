Broncos (5-0) vs. Browns (2-3)1 p.m. Line: Broncos by 4N.F.L. Week 6 scores and highlightsThe Broncos have had one of the most depressing undefeated starts in N.F.L. history. Every week they seem to be explaining how they won despite an unreliable running game or a struggling Peyton Manning. Last week, Denver could not manage an offensive touchdown against the Oakland Raiders, but was once again bailed out by a defense so dominant that it no doubt leaves Manning wondering how many Super Bowls he would have won if the Colts had had a similar group.Josh McCown has put together some nice numbers over the last few weeks, but even if DeMarcus Ware sits out, the Broncos’ defense should be too much for him to handle. The Broncos do not make anything look pretty, but their undefeated start should continue.PICK: BRONCOSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
