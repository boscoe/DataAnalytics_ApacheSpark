They have looked dominant at times, and inept at others. The Bengals, meanwhile, have been an offensive juggernaut so powerful that no deficit seems out of reach.Andy Dalton has had his share of ups and downs, but last week against Seattle he looked like one of the best quarterbacks in the N.F.L., marching his team to victory against long odds. He passed for 331 yards against the vaunted Legion of Boom secondary, and if not for a holding penalty that negated a 72-yard touchdown strike to A.J. Green, he would have broken 400.The Bengals are probably not quite as good as they have played, and the Bills are not quite as bad as they looked in losses to the Patriots and the Giants. The winner will find itself on the short list of A.F.C. contenders.PICK: BILLSAdvertisement
