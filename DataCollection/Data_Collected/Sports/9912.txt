Tournament NotebookBy Tom SpoustaOccasionally at the tournament, coaches go on entertaining tangents during their off-day news conferences.Georgia State Coach Ron Hunter, whose 14th-seeded team upset No. 3 Baylor on Thursday, launched into a classic that had those in the room laughing hysterically.After his son, R. J., hit the game-winning 3-pointer, Hunter poked fun at President Obama for not picking the Panthers to win in his bracket. Political trolls seized on his comments, and Hunter was bombarded with emails and posts on social media that said he was disrespecting the office of the president, among other transgressions.So Hunter figured he would have the final say.“Stop the emails and all the political stuff,” he said. “I’m not a political guy. I could care less. I exercise my right to vote. But quit sending me emails about that, that I’m disrespecting the office. The office of what? I’m not causing anything. We’re talking about a basketball game.”He went on: “Please stop with the emails. I’m nervous. I’m thinking my taxes are going to get something. I’m not getting money back anyway, but I think I’m going to owe more money, and I’m looking for Secret Service guys coming to get me. So please stop. They got me so nervous about it. I was asked a question, and I answered it, but President Obama, listen: You’re a great president, man. I’m sorry; I did not mean anything. Please get your people off of me.”Advertisement
