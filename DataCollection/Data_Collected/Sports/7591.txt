The family of a football player who committed suicide and was later found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease, has sued the youth league Pop Warner, claiming that it failed to warn players about, and protect them from, the dangers of head trauma.The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in Wisconsin, seeks at least $5 million in punitive damages for the death of the player, Joseph Chernach, who killed himself in 2012 at age 25. In a 27-page complaint, Chernach’s estate said Pop Warner “knew or should have known that tackle football was dangerous for children and exposed children to head injuries, including dementia pugilistica,” a variant of C.T.E.Pop Warner, the complaint said, failed to train coaches properly, did not use the safest helmets, did not teach players how to wear their helmets properly and did not limit the amount of hitting in practice. The organization also failed to follow concussion protocols published by medical professionals as early as 1997, according to the complaint.The lawsuit claims that Pop Warner’s conduct “was deliberate, an actual disregard of the plaintiff’s right to safety, health, or life, and sufficiently aggravated to warrant punishment by punitive damages.”
                The family of a football player who committed suicide in 2012 at age 25 has filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court in Wisconsin against Pop Warner.            The case has the potential to upend the economics of youth football leagues. If a court ruled against Pop Warner in Chernach’s death, insurers could potentially increase their premiums to offset legal risks. While Pop Warner is the largest and most established youth football organization in the country, smaller leagues could have a harder time paying for more expensive coverage.Advertisement“The most significant thing we’re doing is telling the courts that strict liability should apply,” said Gordon Johnson, a lawyer at the Brain Injury Law Group, which is representing Chernach’s estate. “It would establish remarkable precedent that would change youth football, because I don’t think anyone would insure you if strict liability applied.”AdvertisementA spokesman for Pop Warner declined to comment on the lawsuit.Other youth organizations and schools are also grappling with legislative and legal hurdles related to head injury protocols. The New York City Council is considering a bill that would require a doctor to be present at every youth football game, a potentially expensive mandate. And on Tuesday, the mother of a teenage water polo player sued USA Water Polo in federal court in California, claiming that the organization had failed to properly protect players from the dangers of concussions.The Chernachs’ case against Pop Warner has its challenges, some of them similar to those that confronted the suit against the N.F.L. brought by more than 5,000 former players. The Chernachs’ legal team will probably have to document that the head trauma Chernach sustained in Pop Warner led to his death, but his parents said they did not recall him ever receiving a diagnosis of a concussion.Chernach, however, was found posthumously to have C.T.E., which doctors have said is evidence of repeated head trauma.In addition to his four years in Pop Warner, Chernach played football in high school, wrestled for 12 years and was a pole-vaulter on the track team, activities that could have contributed to his C.T.E. The plaintiffs will also have to prove that C.T.E. was the cause of the suicide, said Michael Kaplen, a lawyer who specializes in lawsuits involving traumatic brain injuries.Chernach played Pop Warner football in Wisconsin and Michigan starting at age 11, and was a running back and linebacker who sometimes took part in every play of the game. His father, Jeffrey, was a volunteer football coach and also coached his son’s wrestling team. He is not part of the lawsuit.At Central Michigan University, Chernach stopped going to class and later dropped out. He returned to live with his father and became depressed and reclusive. He told one of his two brothers that he needed alcohol to face people, his father said, adding that Joseph left his room only at night.“He was burrowed in his bedroom and turned into a vampire,” Jeffrey Chernach said. “It was obvious to all of us that he wasn’t happy and there was something very wrong, but no matter what tactic we took, we couldn’t get him to get any help.”AdvertisementAfter Joseph Chernach committed suicide in June 2012, tissue samples from his brain were sent to Boston University. The next year, Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine, released the results of an autopsy that found “considerable pathological tau deposits” and “very severe changes in the brain stem.” Some of the changes “were the most severe I’ve seen in a person this age,” McKee wrote in her pathology report.“Really, it’s the worst example of this in someone this young,” McKee said in a telephone interview, adding that some of the worst pathology was found in the parts of the brain normally associated with depression. She said that C.T.E. was evidence of repetitive brain trauma, not necessarily concussions.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But he was very depressed and angry in his last few months, she said, something she would never wish on another parent.“I don’t want to see this happen again, but I think it will,” she said.A version of this article appears in print on February 6, 2015, on Page B12 of the New York edition with the headline: Family Sues Youth League Over Suicide of Player Who Had Brain Disease.
