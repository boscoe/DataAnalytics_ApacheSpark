With 31 games remaining in the regular season, there about two billion ways the N.F.L. season could end. Which of those outcomes is best for your team? Such a question led us to build our N.F.L. simulator, which can be found at nytimes.com/sports, allowing you to explore which games matter the most for your team’s playoff chances.Here is an overview of how this weekend’s games affect the teams still in playoff contention.A.F.C. EastPATRIOTS (12-2) Things are simple for the Patriots: They will receive either the No. 1 seed in the A.F.C. — and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs — or the No. 2 seed, possibly playing the conference championship game in Cincinnati.A win in either of their next two games guarantees the Patriots the top seed in the A.F.C., but they can get the top spot even if they lose their next two.AdvertisementThe worst possible case for New England: If they lose out and the Bengals or the Broncos win out, the Patriots will receive the No. 2 seed.AdvertisementBest outcome: Patriots beat Jets; Broncos beat Bengals.JETS (9-5) The Patriots have clinched the A.F.C. East title, so a wild-card berth is the Jets’ only hope. Unfortunately for them, they have the same record as the Steelers and the Chiefs — and will lose tiebreakers to both if all three teams finish 11-5. Worse yet, the Jets play New England on Sunday.Winning out is obviously the Jets’ best strategy; it is unlikely that both the Chiefs and the Steelers will do the same. If the Jets finish 11-5, a single loss by either the Chiefs or the Steelers would put the Jets in the playoffs as a No. 5 or No. 6 seed.Realistically, though, the Jets will probably not win their next two games. If they go 1-1, they will need the Broncos, the Chiefs or the Steelers to lose out.The Broncos play the 11-3 Bengals and the 4-11 Chargers; the Steelers play the 4-10 Ravens and the 3-11 Browns; and the Chiefs play the 3-11 Browns and the 7-8 Raiders. You may take your pick as to which is the most likely.Of course, if the Jets lose out, they have no chance at the postseason.Best outcome: Jets beat Patriots; Ravens beat Steelers; Browns beat Chiefs; Bengals beat Broncos.A.F.C. NorthBENGALS (11-3) The Bengals’ best outcome is to get the top seed in the A.F.C., a bye week and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. To do that, the Bengals must win out while the Patriots lose out.Cincinnati’s second-best outcome is to get the No. 2 seed, guaranteeing a bye week. This is simpler: The Bengals need to win one of their remaining games, and the Broncos need to lose at least one. Why not take care of both in Denver on Monday night? Even if the Bengals lose, they can still win the No. 2 seed by beating the Ravens at home in Week 17 if the Chargers beat the Broncos to end their season.AdvertisementNext, a highly likely outcome: winning the division. To do that, the Bengals must win one of their next two games or hope the Steelers lose at least one.The worst possible case for the Bengals is a wild-card berth. That will be the result if the Bengals lose out, ending the season at 11-5 along with the Jets, the Chiefs and the Steelers, with the Broncos finishing 12-4. The Bengals would be the No. 6 seed, playing all their postseason games on the road.Best outcome: Bengals beat Broncos; Ravens beat Steelers.STEELERS (9-5) The Steelers are very likely to make the playoffs; they have a shot even if they lose out, ending their season at 9-7.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            The best possible outcome for the Steelers is the A.F.C. North title, which is theirs if they win out and the Bengals lose out. Regardless of how Cincinnati ends its season, two wins by the Steelers would guarantee them a playoff spot.If they win just one game, a playoff berth is almost certain. One Steelers win and one Jets loss would guarantee the Steelers a berth. (Bonus: The Jets face the 12-2 Patriots on Sunday.)If the Steelers lose twice, they can still make the playoffs, but only if the Jets also lose twice.Bottom line: Unless things go terribly, terribly wrong, the Steelers will be in the playoffs.Best outcome: Steelers beat Ravens; Patriots beat Jets; Broncos beat Bengals.A.F.C. SouthTEXANS (7-7) The Texans need one victory in their final two games — against the Titans and the Jaguars — to win the mediocre A.F.C. South and grab the No. 4 seed in the A.F.C. Even if they win both games, the Texans have no chance to climb to No. 3.Could Houston lose its final two games, finish 7-9 and still win the division? Why, yes — this is the A.F.C. South, after all. But the Jaguars would have to lose a game, and the Colts would have to lose at home to Tennessee next week. (Because of the way tiebreakers work, the Colts’ game against the Dolphins this week is irrelevant.)AdvertisementBest outcome: Texans beat Titans. If Houston loses, its fans should keep an eye on the Saints-Jaguars game.COLTS (6-8) The Colts need a lot of help. They blew their chance to control their playoff chances by losing at home to the Texans last week. Indianapolis now needs the Texans to lose their final two games — to Tennessee and Jacksonville — while the Colts need to win at least one game, with the crucial game being their finale against Tennessee.The strangest aspect of the Colts’ situation is that their game this week, against Miami, has almost no bearing on their playoff chances. If the Texans lose their last two games, they will finish 7-9 and lose any tiebreaker to the Colts, as long as the Colts beat the Titans to finish the season. In that case, the Colts would win the division either by beating Miami this weekend (and ending the season 8-8, one game ahead of the Texans) or by losing to Miami (and ending 7-9, but winning the tiebreaker over the Texans because of a better division record).Bottom line: The most important game for the Colts this week is not their own; it is the Texans’ game against Tennessee. If the Texans win, the Colts are out. If they do not, the Colts are alive for another week regardless of what happens in their own game.Best outcome: Titans beat Texans.JAGUARS (5-9) The Jaguars are somehow still alive. They could win the A.F.C. South and the No. 4 seed — allowing them to host a playoff game in the wild-card round.The good news for the Jaguars is that if they win their final two games — at New Orleans and at Houston — they need only two other games to go their way. The bad news is that the Titans — 5-25 over their last 30 games — must win those other two games. The Titans host Houston this weekend and travel to Indianapolis next weekend.Best outcome: Jaguars beat Saints; Titans beat Texans.A.F.C. WestCHIEFS (9-5) The Chiefs are very likely to make the playoffs and still have a decent chance to win their division, despite having started the season 1-5. Kansas City fans should root hard for the Bengals during their Monday night game in Denver this week.The Chiefs, on an eight-game winning streak, are a game behind the 10-4 Broncos in the A.F.C. West. A win in either of their next two games essentially assures them a spot in the postseason. Perhaps best of all, the Chiefs are facing two relatively weak teams, the 3-11 Browns and the 7-8 Raiders.AdvertisementThe best outcome for the Chiefs would be the A.F.C. West title and a home playoff game. (There is even a highly unlikely sequence of events in which the Chiefs vault to the No. 2 seed and earn a first-round bye.) To win the division, Kansas City needs to win one more game than Denver over the final two weeks. The most plausible outcome is that the Chiefs sweep their final two games while Denver loses on Monday night to the 11-3 Bengals.If the Chiefs lose one of their last two games, they will make the playoffs if the Steelers or the Jets also lose once. The fact that the Jets have to play the Patriots this week could help.Best outcome: Chiefs beat Browns; Bengals beat Broncos; Patriots beat Jets; Ravens beat Steelers.BRONCOS (10-4) The Broncos have perhaps the widest variety of outcomes of any playoff contender. With two wins in the final two weeks, they clinch at least the No. 2 seed in the A.F.C. and a bye week before a home game in the second round. But with a loss at home this week — to the 11-3 Bengals — the Broncos are at risk of missing the playoffs.The best outcome for Denver involves two wins in their final two games, and losses by the Patriots. Denver would then be the top seed, forcing other A.F.C. teams to visit Denver in January to make the Super Bowl. The Patriots travel to the Jets this week and to the Dolphins next week.The next-best outcome would be the No. 2 seed, for which the Broncos do not need any help. You can think of this week’s Bengals-Broncos game, in Denver on Monday night, as effectively a playoff for the No. 2 seed. The winner will get the second seed so long as it dispatches a weak team (San Diego, in the case of the Broncos) in the final week.The disaster possibility for the Broncos — missing the playoffs, despite having started the season 7-0 and then 10-2 — emerges if the Broncos lose both of their remaining games. But it is possible even if Denver loses to the Bengals and then, as expected, beats the Chargers in the final week. How? The Chiefs, the Jets and the Steelers all win their final two games.Best outcome: Broncos beat Bengals; Browns beat Chiefs.N.F.C. EastREDSKINS (7-7) Washington wins its division and grabs the No. 4 seed in the N.F.C. by beating Philadelphia on Saturday night. If Washington loses, it is not eliminated but will need help.If the Eagles win this week, they will be in control — and can clinch the division by beating the Giants in the season’s final week. But if Philadelphia loses that game while Washington beats Dallas, the division and the No. 4 seed fall back to Washington.AdvertisementBest outcome: Redskins beat Eagles.EAGLES (6-8) Philadelphia wins its division and grabs the No. 4 seed by winning its final two games, at home against Washington this weekend and at the Giants to finish the season.The Eagles are in second place in the N.F.C. East, but they do not need help to get into the playoffs. If they win out, they are in. A loss to the Redskins would eliminate them.If they win this week, they can afford to lose next week, at the Giants, but only if the Giants lose to the Vikings in Week 16 and the Redskins lose to the Cowboys in Week 17. In that situation, all three teams finish 7-9, and the Eagles win the division on tiebreakers.Best outcome: Eagles beat Redskins; Vikings beat Giants.GIANTS (6-8) The Giants are in deep trouble. To make the playoffs (as the N.F.C. East champion, their only available route), they need to win their last two games and hope that Washington loses its last two games.For the Giants, winning out guarantees nothing. Their problem is that they cannot win a tiebreaker against Washington. So the Giants need to finish 8-8, in a tie with Philadelphia, while Washington falls to 7-9.Remarkably, this situation means that Giants fans need to root for rival Philadelphia this week (against Washington) and then, if all goes well, for another big rival, Dallas (again, against Washington), next week. The Giants could have avoided this situation by winning one or two of their five last-second losses this year (to the Cowboys, the Saints, the Patriots, the Jets and the Panthers). There is good reason to believe that the Giants are the best team in their division.Best outcome: Giants beat Vikings; Eagles beat Redskins.N.F.C. NorthPACKERS (10-4) They could win the N.F.C. North, enjoy a bye week and host their first playoff game — mid-January in Wisconsin, anyone? — or they could enter the playoffs as the No. 6 seed, playing all their games on the road.The best possible case for the Packers is the No. 2 seed in the N.F.C. and the bye week that comes with it. To get that, they must win out, and the Cardinals must lose out. (Easier said than done: The Packers face the 12-2 Cardinals and the 9-5 Vikings.)AdvertisementIf the Packers lose Sunday at Arizona, they cannot finish higher than No. 3.The more important game is in Week 17, when they host the Vikings for what will effectively be an N.F.C. division championship game. If the Packers beat the Vikings, they win the division, regardless of what happens in Week 16.If the Packers lose out, they will enter the playoffs as a wild card, most likely as the No. 5 seed.Best outcome: Packers beat Cardinals; Giants beat Vikings.VIKINGS (9-5) The Vikings have all but clinched a playoff spot and are now hoping to win their division, which would let them play their first playoff game at home. If they do not win the division, they also have a slim chance of earning the top wild-card spot — rather than the second spot — which would let them face the relatively weak N.F.C. East champion in the first round, rather than the Packers or the Cardinals.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Winning out guarantees it, giving the Vikings the No. 3 seed and a home playoff game during the wild-card round. The Vikings could also win their division if both they and the Packers lose this week, and the Vikings beat the Packers in Week 17.The Vikings’ second-best outcome is to win the first wild-card spot, which comes with the No. 5 seed. In the first round, the No. 5 seed will travel to play the No. 4 seed, which will be the winner of the N.F.C. East — most likely Washington or Philadelphia. (As the No. 6 seed, the Vikings would instead have to travel to Green Bay or Arizona.) Minnesota can only get the No. 5 seed if Seattle loses its final two.We are sorry to mention the worst case for the Vikings, because after the last quarter-century of Minnesota sports pain, nothing seems out of the question, but here goes: If the Vikings and the Seahawks lose out and the Falcons win out and the 49ers beat the Lions and the Bucs beat the Bears in Week 16, the Vikings will miss the playoffs.Best outcome: Vikings beat Giants; Cardinals beat Packers.N.F.C. SouthFALCONS (7-7) To make the playoffs, the Falcons must win out, ending their season at 9-7, and have about seven other games in the final two weeks go their way.For starters, the Vikings and the Seahawks need to lose their remaining games. A 49ers win in one of their final two games would also be helpful, as would a Buccaneers win over Chicago this week. Strangely, a Denver win against the Chargers in the season’s final week would help — even though Denver and San Diego are in the other conference. (Ah, N.F.L. tiebreakers.)AdvertisementBut start with the simple part: The Panthers are 14-0, and the Falcons need to beat them this week.Best outcome: Falcons beat Panthers; Rams beat Seahawks; Giants beat Vikings; either the 4-10 49ers or the 6-8 Buccaneers win.N.F.C. WestCARDINALS (12-2) The Cardinals have clinched their division title and at least the No. 3 seed in the N.F.C. They would clinch the No. 2 seed, and a first-round bye, with at least one win in their final two games. The No. 1 seed is a long shot.The best outcome for the Cardinals is the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage until the Super Bowl, but this will happen only if Arizona wins its final two games and Carolina — now 14-0 — loses its final two games.The second-best outcome is the No. 2 seed, which would let the Cardinals rest during the first week of the playoffs and play at home in the second week. They would grab the second seed by beating the Packers this weekend or the Seahawks next weekend — two tough opponents, sure, though at least both games are at home.If Arizona loses its final two games, its seed will be determined by the Vikings-Packers game in Week 17. A Vikings win still gives Arizona the No. 2 seed, while a Green Bay win drops Arizona to No. 3.Arizona will be able to rest some of its starters in Week 17 if it beats Green Bay this week and Carolina also wins. That combination would lock in Arizona as the No. 2 seed, regardless of its result against Seattle in the final week.Best outcome: Cardinals beat Packers; Falcons beat Panthers.SEAHAWKS (9-5) The Seahawks have clinched a wild-card spot but cannot win their division. Their best case is to win the top wild-card spot, which would let them travel to play the relatively weak winner of the N.F.C. East in the first round (most likely Washington or Philadelphia). The alternative is ending up as the No. 6 seed and having to travel to Arizona, Green Bay or Minnesota, all of which seem stronger than any team in the N.F.C. East.The Seahawks will have their best shot at the No. 5 seed by winning their final two games, a relatively easy home game against the Rams and a potentially tough game in Arizona. If Seattle wins both, they will get the No. 5 seed so long as any of these three outcomes also happens: Arizona wins at home this week over Green Bay; the Giants win in Minnesota; or Green Bay wins at home in Week 17 over the Vikings.AdvertisementIf the Seahawks split their final two games, it gets a little more complicated. They would still get the No. 5 seed so long as Green Bay beat Minnesota in Week 17. Or they would get it if Arizona beat Green Bay this week and the Giants won in Minnesota.Two more things for Seattle fans to watch this week: If Arizona beats Green Bay and Carolina beats Atlanta, Arizona will have nothing to play for in Week 17 against Seattle — and will most likely rest some players.Best outcome: Seahawks beat Rams; Giants beat Vikings; Packers beat Cardinals. Seattle would then clinch the No. 5 seed and could rest its banged-up players in Week 17 at Arizona.A version of this article appears in print on December 26, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: 11 Wins May Not Be Enough for a Playoff Spot, but 7 May Be.
