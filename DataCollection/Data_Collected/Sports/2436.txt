In a showdown of unbeatens, the Warriors improved to 5-0, beating the Clippers, 112-108, Wednesday night. Draymond Green is hitting some 3s and Festus Ezeli is blocking some shots, but Golden State’s fast start is mostly due to superhuman performances by Stephen Curry.Here are eight of the most impressive statistics by the Warriors and Curry from the early season.1. The 4-point win over the Clippers was the Warriors’ closest game of the season. The next closest win was 16 points.2. The Warriors beat the Grizzlies, who won 55 games last season, by 50 points Monday. They outscored the Grizzlies, 40-15, in the third quarter.3. The Warriors are beating opponents by an average of 20.8 points a game. Even if you toss out the 50-point victory as a fluke, the Warriors have outscored opponents by 13.5 points. That is more than last season’s championship team (10.1) or even the legendary 1995-96 Bulls (12.3).Advertisement4. Stephen Curry has 28 3-pointers. The next leading player (Damian Lillard) has 16. Curry is hitting 3s at a .519 clip, which would be a career high.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Curry is averaging 35.8 points a game, which would be the highest total since Michael Jordan in 1986-87.Advertisement6. Curry is producing 149 points per 100 individual possessions, Basketball-Reference estimates. Since 1977-78, when data become available, no player has ever rated better than 133.7. As a team, the Warriors have scored 116.2 points per 100 possessions, 6 more than their nearest rival, Oklahoma City.8. The Warriors are shooting .500 from halfcourt or farther (2 for 4). They are the only team with more than one halfcourt bucket.So when are the Warriors going to lose? Their next six games are against the Nuggets, the Kings, the Pistons, the Grizzlies, the Timberwolves and the Nets. A sweep of that crew would take them to 11-0 before a home game against the Raptors, currently the only other undefeated team. Game 13 is a Clippers rematch in Los Angeles.It is ridiculously early for such speculation, but the record for the longest undefeated start to a season is 15-0, set by the 1993-94 Houston Rockets of Hakeem Olajuwon and the 1948-49 Washington Capitols of the Bob Feerick and Bones McKinney.The Warriors could be hit by injuries, and they are playing without their coach, Steve Kerr, who is recovering slowly from back surgery. But at this point, they look like one of the most terrifying teams in a long while.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
