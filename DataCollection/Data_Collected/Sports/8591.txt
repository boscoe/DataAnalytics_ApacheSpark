The committee, which is composed of representatives from each of the world’s soccer confederations, can offer the November-December World Cup only as a proposal. A final decision is expected next month, when the proposal is voted on by FIFA’s executive committee at a meeting in Zurich.At this point, however, the switch to a November-December tournament seems a foregone conclusion. In a news release Tuesday, FIFA said that the committee considered a number of options and “aimed to find the most viable solution for all stakeholders” given the extreme temperatures in Qatar during the traditional summer World Cup window.Many of those stakeholders responded to Tuesday’s announcement with anger, but also resignation. A spokesman for England’s Premier League said a winter World Cup was “neither workable or desirable,” and the chairman of the European Club Association, the former German player Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, hinted that his organization might pursue millions of dollars in payments if league schedules and television contracts were affected by a midseason tournament.“The European clubs and leagues cannot be expected to bear the costs for such rescheduling,” Rummenigge said. “We expect the clubs to be compensated for the damage that a final decision would cause.”Spanish, German and French soccer officials also issued statements critical of the FIFA proposal, which would disrupt not only domestic league schedules for at least two months, and perhaps for more than one season, but also continental competitions like UEFA’s Champions League and Europa League. And FIFPro, the world players’ union, said that while “a switch to the winter months is the only viable solution” it remained concerned about the welfare of players who would be expected to absorb a World Cup into the middle of an already challenging league season.“Changes to the match schedule that could potentially place extra strain on the workload of the players is for FIFPro to analyze together with all stakeholders in due course,” the organization said.Officials involved in the Qatari bid have long maintained their willingness to host the event during the summer, and a bevy of cooling technologies have been in development. But medical experts largely found the premise of staging an event that stretches for more than a month during the year’s hottest period to be too dangerous.Instead, the tournament will be held for the first time in what is the middle of the club season for a majority of the richest and most popular leagues around the world. Some soccer officials had pushed for the tournament to be held in January or February 2022, but FIFA said in the news release that the two cities bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics — Beijing and Almaty, Kazakhstan — planned to run the Games from Feb. 4 to 20. Since Ramadan begins in early April in 2022, and the hottest temperatures in Qatar are from May to September, the news release said, “the only remaining effective option is the November-December window.”Television networks, like Fox in the United States, were among the many critics of the move. Fox said initially that it was displeased because it had bid on the rights to the tournament with the expectation that the games would be played during the summer window as opposed to later in the year, when the tournament will conflict with more premium programming like N.F.L. games.In a development that many observers thought to be related to that situation, FIFA recently announced that Fox and Telemundo, the Spanish-language TV-rights holder in the United States, would have their contracts to broadcast the tournament extended for an additional cycle, to 2026. It was a surprising announcement given that broadcast rights are typically offered up for bidding by multiple networks.Advertisement
