Week 7 scores and highlightsIt will be interesting to see how the Redskins’ banged-up secondary will fare against the Buccaneers’ two towering wide receivers, Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson, who both stand 6 feet 5 inches. Redskins cornerback Bashaud Breeland forced two fumbles and intercepted a pass last week against the Jets, earning some praise from Coach Jay Gruden.“He’s good,” Gruden said after the game. “He’s a tough guy, a competitor, has some injuries he’s dealing with, fought through them, made a good strip and then obviously his interception.”PICK: REDSKINSAdvertisement
