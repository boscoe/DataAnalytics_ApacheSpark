It’s easy now. Well, relatively easy. Not the writing, but getting your copy to your newspaper’s office. If you’re a sports reporter at ringside for a big fight, like the Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Manny Pacquiao extravaganza on Saturday night, you set up your laptop, type your words into the keyboard, move your mouse on the screen, click-click, hit “send,” and moments later, your article appears on a screen in your office. What a wonderful world.It wasn’t always this simple.In the late 1800s, when the heavyweight champions John L. Sullivan and Gentleman Jim Corbett popularized boxing in the United States, most reporters used those newfangled bulky metal typewriters, while others preferred longhand. Either way, they handed their copy to a Western Union telegrapher who transmitted Morse code over an electric connection to their newspaper offices, where another telegrapher translated those dots and dashes back into prose.Heavyweight Champions John L.

The code was named for its inventor, Samuel Morse, who sent the first message over an experimental line from Washington to Baltimore in 1844: “What hath God wrought!” The dots and dashes may sound confusing, but to telegraphers, they were perfectly clear.Telegraphers were at ringside through the heavyweight reigns of Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney in the Roaring Twenties after World War I, notably Dempsey’s wild second-round knockout of Argentina’s Luis Ángel Firpo, the 216-pound Bull of the Pampas, before more than 80,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds in 1923.AdvertisementIn the first round, Dempsey knocked down Firpo seven times, then stood over him and punched him as he rose, a tactic that eventually led to the three-knockdown rule and the rule ordering the puncher to a neutral corner during the count. Late in that round, Firpo knocked the 192-pound Dempsey through the ropes into the ringside of reporters, photographers and telegraphers, the scene that inspired the artist George Bellows’s celebrated painting.AdvertisementNot that I was at ringside that night. After I began covering boxing in 1964, I met Dempsey at his Broadway restaurant and talked to him occasionally, although he didn’t tell his best story. Others did: how late one night, two muggers approached what they thought was a defenseless old man on a dark street, until he threw a right and a left, knocking down both, and continued on his way.As the nation stumbled through the Depression, telegraphers and radio announcers ushered the young Joe Louis to the heavyweight throne as the first popular African-American sports idol. He once defended the title with a first-round knockout of Max Schmeling, a fighter from Hitler’s Germany. After Pearl Harbor, Louis put the war in perspective when he said, “We’re on God’s side.”After World War II, operators of Western Union Teletype machines gradually replaced the telegraphers, but not completely. When I first entered the Ebbets Field press box in 1952 as a young reporter for The Brooklyn Eagle, the click-click of dots and dashes welcomed me.“See that distinguished gentleman over there,” someone said, pointing to silver-haired Roscoe McGowen, who covered the Dodgers for The Times. “You can’t get a scoop past Roscoe. He knows Morse code.”By then, boxing had a dynamic new name. On Labor Day 1950, my father said: “Sugar Ray Robinson is fighting at the Coney Island Velodrome this afternoon. Let’s go.” Half an hour away from our Bay Ridge apartment, Robinson danced through a unanimous 10-round decision over Billy Brown, ballooning his record to 112 wins, 1 loss (to Jake LaMotta in 1943) and 2 draws. Five months later, he stopped LaMotta in the 13th round for the world middleweight title, which he would regain four more times before he retired.Little did I think that day in Coney Island that I later would help the man most boxing people considered, pound for pound, the best boxer in history write his autobiography, “Sugar Ray,” for Viking Press. In our taping sessions at his Riverside Drive apartment, Ray spoke openly about his highs and lows in boxing and in life, but after about an hour, he would tire.“You my man, Dave, but that’s it for today,” he would say.“You went 15 rounds with Jake LaMotta,” I would say with a smile, “but you can’t go more than an hour with a tape recorder.”Advertisement“Tomorrow,” he would say.Around that time, I was at ringside at the old Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue between West 49th Street and West 50th Street, in 1967 when Dick Tiger, the world light-heavyweight champion from Nigeria, was awarded a 15-round split decision over Jose Torres, the popular New Yorker from Puerto Rico. In that Garden’s steep balcony not far above the ring, many of Torres’s countrymen disagreed. Empty liquor and wine bottles suddenly were crashing in and around the ring.As I turned to look up at the balcony, a bottle thudded into the ring padding not far from my head. “Under the ring,” barked Jimmy Cannon, the New York Journal-American sports columnist. “Quick, under the ring.”Crouching, we hunched into the space under the ring as bottles continued to smash onto the floor around us. Minutes later, after security guards had herded the bottle-throwers out of the balcony, I hurried to the press room to write.The Sports of The Times columnist Dave Anderson describes meeting Muhammad Ali for the first time.Two years earlier, when I was a rookie boxing writer on The Journal-American, another ring provided my introduction to Muhammad Ali before his second fight with Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Maine. On my way to Lewiston, I stopped in Chicopee, Mass., where Ali was training. After a workout, his trainer Angelo Dundee asked me when I was going to drive to Lewiston.“Tomorrow morning,” I said. “I’ll be there around noontime.”“Will you do me a favor?” he said. “Will you measure the ring for me?”“Measure the ring?”“I hear they’ve got a small ring in the arena. My guy needs a 20-foot ring. He needs room to maneuver. In a small ring, Liston’s got an edge. Do me a favor. Measure the ring. Then call me.”When I arrived in Lewiston, I walked into St. Dominic’s Arena, where workmen in overalls were setting up rows of wooden-board desktops at ringside. On one of the boards was a steel measuring tape.“May I borrow that tape?” I asked.One of the workmen handed it to me and then held one end of the tape as I measured the ring inside the ropes: 16 feet by 16 feet.AdvertisementWhen I phoned Dundee, he said: “Then the fight’s off. If they don’t get a 20-foot ring or move this fight somewhere else, the fight’s off. And you can tell Bob Nilon I said that.”I found Nilon, one of the fight’s promoters, at an empty storefront that was being used as a ticket office. I told him I had measured the ring at 16 feet.“Is that so?” Nilon, whose brother Jack was one of Liston’s managers, said innocently. “Only 16 feet.”“And Angelo told me,” I said, “to tell you that if you don’t get a 20-foot ring here, the fight’s off.”The Sports of The Times columnist Dave Anderson recalls covering Muhammad Ali in a championship fight for the first time, against Sonny Liston in Lewiston, Me.It turned out the promoters had borrowed a small ring from the nearby Brunswick Naval Air Station gym. But when Dundee called their bluff and I wrote the story for a late edition of The Journal-American, a bigger ring was trucked up from Baltimore the next day.“It’s only 19 feet 6 inches,” Dundee told me at the weigh-in, “but that’s big enough.”Big enough for Ali to flatten Liston in 1 minute 52 seconds of the first round with a right hand that many ringside and television observers didn’t think was hard enough for a knockdown. I was at ringside, but when Ali threw that punch, his back was to me. I saw his shoulder muscles move, but I didn’t see the punch.When Joe Frazier knocked down Ali in the 15th round of their first fight in 1971 at the new Madison Square Garden, I also didn’t see the punch — Frazier’s thunderous left hook. But I did hear the thunderclap when Ali landed about three feet from me in a furious fight that lived up to its magical marquee. Each fighter was undefeated, each had a claim to the heavyweight title and each was guaranteed half of an unprecedented $5 million.Ali-Frazier I was also a morality play. Ali was the loudmouth, the Greatest, disliked by many for having refused to be drafted into the Army during the Vietnam War, a decision that led to his being stripped of the heavyweight title and exiled from boxing for three and a half years. Frazier was the friendly good guy who sometimes trained by punching sides of beef in a Philadelphia meat locker.AdvertisementWith an unruly crowd expected, ringside reporters and columnists were issued red,white and blue baseball caps that, after the fight, would provide instant access past the security guards at the press room door where they would write.If you glance at the Associated Press photo of Frazier standing over Ali, you’ll see the Times delegation in the background, left to right, Robert Lipsyte on the telephone, Arthur Daley and me, with a ballpoint pen in my mouth as I typed round-by-round copy.Frazier’s unanimous and undisputed 15-round decision ignited what would be a dazzling decade dominated by the Frazier-Foreman-Ali heavyweight triumvirate. Frazier would be dethroned by George Foreman in a second-round knockout in Kingston, Jamaica, and then Foreman would be dethroned by Ali in an eighth-round knockout in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo).With the worldwide reporters lodged in a diplomatic compound outside Kinshasa, the promoters arranged for phone calls to their offices to go through special overseas operators, who would redirect their calls to their newspapers.In the days leading up to that fight, I dialed a special overseas operator who connected me to The Times and then I dictated my stories to The Times’s telephone room. But the night of the fight, which began at 4 in the morning so it could be shown at 10 in the evening on theater TV in the Eastern time zone, we had a special open telephone line from ringside to The Times.Sitting next to me was Tom Johnson, a Times foreign correspondent based in Kenya. During the early rounds, whenever I completed a paragraph or two on my Olivetti portable, Tom would lean over and dictate it to the telephone room in New York while I kept writing.When Ali knocked out Foreman in the eighth round to regain the heavyweight title, I wrote a quick lead and then dictated it while Tom hurried to the fighters’ postfight news conferences. As I wrote my final lead and then dictated it, Tom wrote his story, then dictated it.For one big fight on one big night, the telephone had replaced the telegrapher’s dots and dashes and the Teletype machine.AdvertisementAbout a year later, at what Ali titled the Thrilla in Manila, with Frazier, the Teletype reigned again in what I described as an “epic in brutality.” When Ali wobbled to his corner after the 11th round, he appeared exhausted. The way he plopped onto his stool, I wondered if he would answer the bell for the 12th round. But when that bell rang, he was on his feet and throwing punches, especially right handed — punches that continued to close Frazier’s left eye.

When the 14th round ended, Frazier’s left eye was virtually closed. He staggered to his corner where, I learned later, his trainer, Eddie Futch, asked him, “What’s with the right hand?” Joe replied: “I can’t see it. I can see the left but when I move away, I get hit with the right.”Hearing that, Futch said: “I’m going to stop it, Joe. The fight’s over.” Frazier hopped up from his stool and said: “Don’t do that. I can finish.” Futch tapped him on the shoulder and said: “Sit down. The fight’s over. This is the best thing to do.”Not every trainer would have thought, “This was the best thing to do,” especially a trainer thinking, as Futch was, that his fighter was ahead on points. Actually, Ali was far ahead on the scorecards of the referee, Carlos Padilla, and the two Filipino judges. I didn’t agree. I had Frazier ahead. So did some of the other writers at ringside.Whatever the scoring, when Futch told the referee that Frazier wasn’t going to answer the bell for the 15th round, the fight was over. Ali had retained the heavyweight title. But about 15 minutes later, the loser, Frazier, was first to appear in the interview room. He answered questions for about 10 minutes. Nearly half an hour later, the winner, Ali, finally appeared.Asked what the fight had been like, Ali whispered, “Next to death.”At Frazier’s postfight party at his Manila hotel, the great Times columnist Red Smith told me the loser danced and sang. When I stopped by Ali’s party, which President Ferdinand Marcos had arranged, the winner sat virtually motionless, his hands cupped as if he were holding a baby bird. When a visitor extended a hand, he would make a small fist with his right hand and gently touch his visitor’s right hand. He hardly spoke. He hardly looked up.If a stranger were to judge, by their postfight condition, which fighter had won the Thrilla in Manila, the loser would have been the winner.As the 1980s approached, SportsComm, basically a fax machine, briefly invaded press rooms everywhere, but computers soon ruled, including a bulky bubble-topped monstrosity that accompanied Larry Holmes’s coronation as champion in Las Vegas with his almost gentle termination of the Ali era.The Sports of The Times columnist Dave Anderson describes Muhammad Ali’s reaction to security precautions for the gloves in Kuala Lumpur.With a classic left jab, Holmes streaked to a 48-0 record. Hoping to match the heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano’s 49-0 career, he lost a unanimous decision to Michael Spinks, who was upstaged by Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns seemingly trading the lightweight, welterweight and middleweight titles among themselves.AdvertisementAnd then Mike Tyson arrived: Iron Mike, the “baddest man on the planet,” who mauled his terrified opponents until the journeyman Buster Douglas punched him back and knocked him out, and the fearless Evander Holyfield punched him back and knocked him out. Sitting ringside at a Tyson fight, I never knew what I might see, and in their rematch, I saw what I really didn’t want to see: Holyfield’s bloody ear, which Tyson had bitten.I didn’t cover many big fights after that, and now that I’m retired, I won’t be at Mayweather-Pacquiao in the MGM Grand on May 2, when millions of words will be transmitted from hundreds of laptops belonging to what is known now as the media.Somewhere the inventor Samuel Morse must be wondering: What hath all those dots and dashes wrought?
