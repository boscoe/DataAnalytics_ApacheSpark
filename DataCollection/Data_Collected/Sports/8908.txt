CreditBrendan Bannon for The New York Times        LANCASTER, N.Y. —  Hundreds of people in this Buffalo suburb braved a freezing rain Tuesday night to pack into the Lancaster Central High School cafeteria and debate an issue that has ranged for years over the American sports landscape, from scholastic leagues to the N.F.L.: the use of Redskins as a team’s nickname.Driven at least in part by the national debate over the Washington Redskins, which many Native Americans and others regard as offensive, the superintendent and school board members in this district began an inquiry into Lancaster’s nickname and mascot, which have been in use since 1953. The school’s motto is “Once a Redskin, Always a Redskin.”“Our name’s been put in a box,” said Len Jankiewicz, a 1969 Lancaster graduate. “I don’t like what’s in that box,” added Jankiewicz, a retired math teacher, football coach and athletic director who has a fondness for the Redskins name and said he was hoping for a compromise that would keep it.Jankiewicz cited the decision by Miami University of Ohio to change its nickname from Redskins to RedHawks in 1997. Then, referring to the Washington Redskins’ owner, he said, “Let’s show Dan Snyder what we can do, but from a different point of view, because we’re educational.”AdvertisementMany people in the community are opposed to a name change, and at the debate, those who supported the name appeared to outnumber those who wanted to get rid of it. Last month, village workers hung a banner over Central Avenue, the community’s main street, that read, “Save the Redskins Tradition.”AdvertisementAt Tuesday’s meeting, more than 100 people — including alumni, students and Native Americans — were divided into groups to discuss the team’s name. Their comments were recorded and will be considered while officials decide whether to alter the school’s nickname. School officials said there was no timetable for a decision.A local group that supports the nickname paid to fly two Native Americans to Buffalo so they could attend the forum: Joe Milk, an Oglala Sioux who lives on a reservation in Martin, S.D., and Mark One Wolf Yancey, of Connecticut, a founder of Native American Redskins Nation, a group that supports retaining the Washington Redskins’ team name.“We share a commonality in our love for our team and heritage,” Yancey said about his group.But his view seemed rare among the Native Americans at the meeting. “You’re taking elements of our cultural heritage and plugging it into a non-Native community,” said John Kane, a Mohawk and a radio host who speaks on Native American issues. “You have this alumni class of people dressing up and playing Indian.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

I just hope we keep the name. That’s all I care for.”Jim Everett, a 1973 graduate whose children and grandchildren have attended the school, was part of a group that wore T-shirts in the school’s colors, red and white. “We’re here to demonstrate that there’s another meaning to it, and the meaning here in Lancaster is nothing to do with how they feel about it,” he said about Native Americans. “We hope they start to understand that it’s all positive values. It’s all goal-oriented. It’s all commitment to excellence. Why wouldn’t you want to have a name associated with those core values?”Arguments like those failed to sway Gigi Ground, a Seneca from the nearby Tonawanda reservation, who carried a sign that read, “Dignity Above Tradition.”“I hope they pick something else that people could get behind that wouldn’t have the Native Americans depicted where they are,” she said. “I don’t think people know how it’s offensive to us.”Before the meeting, Hilary Weaver, a former president of Native American Community Services, said she found the nickname offensive and believed it was only a matter of time before Native American mascots at high schools became a thing of the past.Advertisement“Things are headed in a direction where Lancaster and all other school districts will do away with insensitive mascots,” said Weaver, a professor and associate dean at the State University at Buffalo School of Social Work. “Many have done away with them already.”A version of this article appears in print on March 4, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Debate Over ‘Redskins’ Reaches Upstate School.
