ZURICH — The FIFA officials tried hard. They did. On Thursday afternoon, the acting president and the acting secretary general and the permanent reform committee chief (who just seems to like acting) wanted desperately to talk about change. About progress. About the future.It didn’t quite work, of course. A big part of that was the arrests, only hours earlier, of two more FIFA vice presidents in another police raid at the Baur au Lac hotel, which made news around the world. But the arrests were not the only reason that most of the questions from the news media did not focus on FIFA’s hopeful message of the day; there was also the matter of the messengers.
                The 16 men arrested Thursday include five current or former members of FIFA’s ruling executive committee and the current presidents of Concacaf and Conmebol.            Issa Hayatou, the acting president, dismissed inquiries about any personal improprieties and then read an opening speech about governance that was both hollow and clearly scripted by someone else. Markus Kattner, the acting secretary general, dismissed questions about any personal improprieties and clung blindly to PowerPoint slides that seemed to lack specifics. François Carrard, the reform committee chairman, did not have any previous improprieties to answer for but did appear to adore having the microphone and went back on previously stated promises: extolling the virtues of salary transparency in one breath and then refusing to directly answer a question about how much he is being paid for his work.All of that made for a somewhat comic atmosphere, but it was nonetheless meaningful because of a single truth: FIFA’s biggest battle is one of perception. Few people love the minutiae of corporate governance, and even fewer are passionately interested in knowing the details of how FIFA makes its important decisions. Most simply want to trust that the process is fair. And for a long time, that trust has been missing.AdvertisementTo change that, there are generally two approaches. One is a total housecleaning, which essentially acknowledges that an organization in its current form is irreparable. The other is a crafted approach to finding the right people with magnetic personalities, ease of explanation and, of course, believable motivations to bridge the surface relationship that exists between a group like FIFA and an astronomically larger group that is the world’s soccer fans. As it stands, FIFA has taken neither approach.
                The Justice Department unsealed a 236-page indictment on Thursday that described charges against some of the most powerful leaders of international soccer.            And that is why it is failing. Most soccer fans do not know anything about Alfredo Hawit or Juan Ángel Napout, the two men arrested at the Zurich hotel Thursday morning. Most soccer fans do not know much about the other 14 people named later that day in the United States Department of Justice’s indictment. What they do know is that FIFA is going through a crisis and that, after years of scandal, FIFA officials, in rising numbers, appear to be corrupt. More arrests, more suspensions and more controversy only feed that perception.AdvertisementTo counter that opinion, it takes new policies, sure, but also the right sales pitch and the right marketing plan. There have been plenty of criticisms of the proposed reforms that FIFA has put forth — a lack of independent oversight and a regional structure that would continue to allow patronage are two obvious ones — but just as important is the poor platform on which FIFA is attempting to sell it.Mr. Hayatou, after looking disinterested in his own opening remarks on Thursday, appeared to doze off while Dr. Carrard was speaking (at length) about the reforms. Mr. Hayatou is 69 and has had several recent health problems, but his somnolence is less an issue than his demeanor. When he was asked why — after years of serving on an executive committee that was against age limits or term limits or transparency — Mr. Hayatou chose to support the reform package, Mr. Hayatou snapped at the questioner and demurred.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He did not address why he never formally solicited input from key sponsors in helping his committee prepare its proposal; did not address why his group’s initial proposals had changed so radically from one meeting to the next; and did not reveal his own salary when asked, in the interest of transparency, to share it. He also defended as proper the bizarre inclusion of an item in the proposal that had nothing to do with governance — the imminent expansion of the World Cup to 40 teams from the current 32 — when it seemed to be little more than a sweetener for FIFA members who will vote to ratify these changes at February’s Congress.Mr. Kattner, too, seemed either naïve or willfully ignorant about that inclusion. At a briefing with reporters Wednesday night, Mr. Kattner staunchly defended the right of the executive committee to implement such a change on its own, despite the significance of the decision and despite its lack of consultation with any of the stakeholders it would affect, notably television rights-holders, sponsors and national and continental federations.Even Thursday, after more reasoned voices on FIFA’s executive committee prevailed and the possible World Cup expansion was separated from the governance items, Mr. Kattner did not seem to grasp the latent hypocrisy that would have come with an executive committee’s endorsing proposals that would reduce its power while, simultaneously, using that power to make a unilateral decision on a huge change to a showpiece event.In recent months, FIFA has hired a well-regarded American public relations firm, Teneo, to shepherd it through this crisis. It was a good decision, but one that cannot be a panacea. FIFA needs to change. Identifying and effecting new structures and policies and functions is one part of that. The other part — a part that, in some ways, is even more significant — is finding the right people to make the public believe in the changes.A version of this article appears in print on December 5, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Message in the Hands of the Wrong Messengers.
