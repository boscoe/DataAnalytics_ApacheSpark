Week 9 Scores and HighlightsYou have to think that if either of these teams is going to make a run for an A.F.C. wild card, it will be the winner of this game. The Bills do have a leg up, though, having thumped the Dolphins, 41-14, in Week 3. But that game was against a Joe Philbin-coached Dolphins team that resembled a cold bowl of oatmeal compared with the spicy breakfast burrito of a team we saw immediately after Dan Campbell took over.The suddenly resurgent Dolphins did suffer some setbacks last week, though, getting beat handily by the Patriots, 36-7, and losing the four-time Pro Bowl defensive end Cameron Wake to a torn Achillesâ€™ tendon.Tyrod Taylor is expected to return as the starting quarterback for the Bills. He was 3-2 in that role before sustaining a knee injury that forced him to miss the last two games, both losses.PICK: BILLSAdvertisement
