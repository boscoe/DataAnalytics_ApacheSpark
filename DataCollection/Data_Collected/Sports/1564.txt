Week 7 scores and highlightsConventional wisdom would very likely hold that the Steelers’ success or failure in this game hinges on whether Ben Roethlisberger will be able to play now that Michael Vick is out with a hamstring injury. But the Steelers’ defense and running game seem capable of keeping the team in any game, so if the third-string quarterback Landry Jones winds up under center, you might want to think twice before betting against Pittsburgh. It does indeed look as if Jones will be the starter in Kansas City, even though Roethlisberger practiced during the week.Jones looked good in relief of Vick last week, completing 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns in a win over the Cardinals. And according to some of his teammates, he may be in a better position to succeed than Vick was when he took over.“Landry kind of plays a lot like Ben with check downs and things like that, so he kind of knows where I’m at at times,” running back Le’Veon Bell said. “Obviously it was a little different with Vick because he didn’t always know where the check down was and he’s kind of new to the offense.”On the other side, the 2015 Chiefs seem to be even more of a lost cause without running back Jamaal Charles, who is out for the year with a knee injury. The team was held to season lows in rushing yards and points in a loss to the Vikings last week.PICK: STEELERSAdvertisement
