Bears (2-3) at Lions (0-5)1 p.m. Line: Lions by 3N.F.L. Week 6 scores and highlightsThe only thing making this game watchable is the fact that both teams are bad enough that it should at least be close. The Bears have beaten two consecutive mediocre opponents mainly on the strength of their defense, but to become relevant the offense will need to come up with solutions at wide receiver, where injuries have given quarterback Jay Cutler little to work with. The Lions, meanwhile, endured a week in which the team’s commitment to its starting quarterback, Matthew Stafford, was questioned and its coach acknowledged that his players did not show maximum effort in a loss to the Cardinals. In a competition of who has it worse, the Lions appear to be winning.PICK: BEARSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
