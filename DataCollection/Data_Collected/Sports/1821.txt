Dallas, Vancouver and Columbus — earned byes and will await the winners for home-and-home conference semifinals that begin Sunday. (The winners will be reseeded for that round.)NEW ENGLAND AT D.C. UNITED 7:30 p.m. Eastern, Wednesday, UniMásD.C. United tumbled into the playoffs by losing six of its final nine games, including a 5-0 thumping at Columbus on Sunday that cost the team a first-round bye. United is home for this match, but it may stay there for the winter if it doesn’t show some life.LOS ANGELES AT SEATTLE10 p.m. Wednesday, UniMásLike D.C. United, the Galaxy faded late. Los Angeles has the offensive players to contend for a title in Robbie Keane and Gio dos Santos, and it has a great playoff history against Seattle, but stopping Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins in front of a full house — again — will be a daunting task.TORONTO AT MONTREAL 7 p.m. Thursday, UniMásMontreal won the right to host this game on the strength of two Didier Drogba goals in Sunday’s regular-season finale. Drogba (11 goals in 11 M.L.S. games) has been almost unstoppable since joining the Impact in midseason, but Toronto’s Sebastian Giovinco (22 goals) has been even better.SPORTING KANSAS CITY AT PORTLAND10 p.m. Thursday, UniMásPortland, in contrast to several other playoff teams, won its way in, with four victories in its final five games and 10 goals in its last three. With so little separating so many M.L.S. teams this season — the third-best point total in the league was only 6 points above the 13th — that recent run of finishing could be the difference.Advertisement
