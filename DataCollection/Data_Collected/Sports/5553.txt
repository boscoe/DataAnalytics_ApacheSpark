That’s all we teach.” Devin Chafin added 161 yards and a touchdown, and Terence Williams rushed for 97 yards and two touchdowns for the Bears (10-3).North Carolina (11-3) tried to match Baylor’s scoring output but had a crucial fumble in the third quarter that stifled its comeback efforts. Marquise Williams passed for 243 yards and three scores for North Carolina and rushed for two more. Elijah Hood added 118 yards rushing.The biggest question leading up to Tuesday’s matchup was how Baylor’s offense would adapt with quarterbacks Seth Russell (neck injury) and Jarrett Stidham (broken ankle), the Biletnikoff Award winner Corey Coleman (hernia surgery) and running back Shock Linwood (broken foot) all sidelined.Though the sophomore Chris Johnson started at quarterback, five players all took snaps for the Bears within the first two series. They continued to use the quintet in multiple Wildcat formations.CALIFORNIA 55, AIR FORCE 36 Jared Goff threw for 467 yards and six touchdowns as California won in the postseason for the first time in seven years, beating Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth.Goff had three of his scoring tosses in a span of five plays in the second quarter as the Bears (8-5) broke a 14-14 tie and cruised in a rematch of the 2007 Armed Forces Bowl, won by Cal, 42-36.Receiver Kenny Lawler had three touchdowns for Cal, whose last bowl win was by 24-17 over Miami in the 2008 Emerald Bowl.Weakened by the ejection of the secondary anchor Weston Steelhammer for targeting on Air Force’s third defensive play, the Falcons (8-6) lost for the fourth time in five Armed Forces Bowl appearances since 2007.NEVADA 28, COLORADO ST. 23 James Butler scored on a 4-yard run with 1:06 left, and Nevada beat Colorado State in the inaugural Arizona Bowl in Tucson.Colorado State (7-6) trailed for most of the game before taking the lead on Wyatt Bryan’s 38-yard field goal with just under four minutes left.
