PHILADELPHIA —  Greeting entrants to the locker room at the Eagles’ training complex is a nearly 7-foot-tall orange tackling dummy. Its right arm, elevated at a 90-degree angle like a passer’s, and its left, lowered and tucked into the body like a runner’s, each have half of a football stitched into them.Every time that defensive end Fletcher Cox walks by, he hits the passing arm’s elbow, just as he did in a recent drill in which rushers approached a dummy on the practice field and prioritized stripping the ball over sacking the quarterback. The extra dummies around the complex help reinforce that. As the mantra emblazoned on team T-shirts says, habits reflect the mission.“It’s creating that muscle memory and the sense of that attention to detail,” safety Walter Thurmond III said, noting that he, too, hit the dummy every time he walked past.Philadelphia, despite ranking near the bottom of the N.F.L. in total defense, is popping the ball out of opposing carriers’ arms at a league-high rate. The Eagles led the N.F.L. with 24 forced fumbles last season, and they again rank first, with 16.AdvertisementForcing fumbles is largely a lost art in the sport, despite the frequent sight of defenders’ exaggerated efforts to strip the ball. N.F.L. fumble rates have been steadily declining for four decades. Entering Week 12’s games, there had been only 2.59 fumbles per game this season, the third-lowest average in history, behind 2011’s (2.54) and 2013’s (2.56). The record high, 4.53 per game, occurred in 1976.AdvertisementThe fumble rate has declined on a per-touch level, too, from 3.6 percent (one for every 27.6 touches) in 1982 to 2.3 percent (one for every 43.1 touches). At the same time, the overall number of touches has declined only from 116 per game in ’82 to 111 now.That the Eagles, and some other teams, would go to extraordinary lengths to preach takeaways (and ball protection) stems from the outsize importance of turnovers. Since the A.F.L.-N.F.L. merger in 1970, teams with a positive turnover margin have won 78 percent of all games. A plus-one margin correlates to a .667 winning percentage; at plus-two, the percentage jumps to .810.“The conversation I have with guys is kind of like this: You’re carrying 52 other guys every time you touch it,” the Pittsburgh Steelers’ running backs coach, James Saxon, said in a telephone interview, referring to the 53 players N.F.L. teams can carry on their active rosters. “That’s a privilege that the head coach gives you, so you’ve got to respect what you’re doing with the ball. If a play breaks down, don’t turn into Superman.”That awareness — and the risk of reduced playing time — has been instilled in all ball carriers. And rushing attempts have plummeted, from 73.8 per game in 1976 to a record-low 52.9 per game this season. Still, they generally account for only a quarter of fumbles. The majority occur on sacks, whose frequency has remained relatively stable since the 1990s despite an increased emphasis on the protection of a quarterback’s blind side.“Turnovers are always part preparation, part execution and part luck,” said Houston Texans defensive end J. J. Watt, who had four forced fumbles in each of the past three seasons but has only one this year.The greater emphasis on offensive preparation and execution is reflected in the refrain espoused in nearly every drill at every training complex: ball protection.“That’s the whole practice,” Giants running back Andre Williams said with only mild overstatement.AdvertisementWilliams added that when he arrived at Boston College, his focus was on running and making plays until, as a freshman, he fumbled on back-to-back carries.“Ever since then,” he said, “I always think the ball is a bar of gold and I’m trying to deposit it in the bank.”The high-and-tight technique of carrying the ball — in which the hand, forearm and biceps all cinch the ball against the chest — has been popular since at least the 1990s. The idea is to have four points of pressure to lock the ball in place.Some coaches also teach the claw, which means enveloping the nose of the ball with the palm. Saxon said he emphasized lowering the level of a runner’s shoulder pads to better absorb contact. Many rushers use a second arm to cradle the ball, too.After Tiki Barber fumbled 35 times from 2000 to 2003 while playing for the Giants, he adopted the high-and-tight form and fumbled only nine times over the next three seasons.
                How can my team make the N.F.L. playoffs? It’s a simple question, but answering it can be devilishly complicated. This interactive simulator walks you through the scenarios.            “We’ve benefited from the direct example of how that works, but there’s also the other hand,” Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said. “The other hand has to go on the ball, too, today because, quite frankly, people are not too worried sometimes about the tackle, and they’ll take the ball first.”Philadelphia’s DeMarco Murray — who has worked with the Eagles’ running backs coach, Duce Staley, since fumbling six times last season with the Dallas Cowboys — had not put the ball on the ground a single time this season until Sunday, in his 164th touch of the year.“I’m trying to be cautious about it,” Murray said. “We do a lot of ball-security drills. Duce does a good job of emphasizing it.”AdvertisementThere is one saving grace for players who fumble: Whereas defenses once recovered more fumbles than offenses nearly every season, in the last 20 years, offenses have recovered more fumbles in 18 seasons — not since 2004 has the defense had the advantage.The record for fewest fumbles in a season is six, by the 2011 New Orleans Saints, although this year’s Broncos have fumbled only three times in 10 games and not once on a running play. The Giants (11 total fumbles) and the Saints (13) have done so just once each.“A lot of times when you go after a running back, he has two hands on the ball by the time you get to him unless you catch him in the open field when he’s trying to make a move on a guy,” Jets linebacker Demario Davis said. “Just like our reflex and second nature is to go for the ball, their reflex is to protect it.”Under the longtime N.F.L. coach Dick Vermeil, and with Saxon as their running backs coach, the 2002 Kansas City Chiefs had just seven fumbles, a mark that now ranks second. Vermeil began studying the impact of turnovers years ago and identified them as the most critical game statistic. He reinforced the point endlessly, explaining now, “I just never thought it was enough.”Vermeil said: “I’ve had people say, ‘Well, how can running backs think about not fumbling the ball when they’re running and being chased and being hit?’ My response to them is, well, if a football player can — instantaneously after he finishes up a play — jump forward to draw attraction to himself and pound himself on the chest and point to the sky and all that, then he can consciously think that quick to prevent a fumble.”In the late 1990s, with the St. Louis Rams, Vermeil’s special-teams coach was Frank Gansz, who, when he was not working on kicking and punting, spent his time working on protecting the ball with offensive players and on stripping it with defensive players. (Coughlin said he first heard the term “high and tight” from Gansz, who died in 2009.)Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Vermeil was a young assistant on Allen’s 1969 Rams staff.When Vermeil became a head coach for the first time, in 1976, he had six assistant coaches on his Eagles staff. Now, the Eagles’ website lists 23 assistants.Advertisement“More things are being coached in greater detail,” Vermeil said.Officials’ increased use of replay, Vermeil said, may also have negated some fumbles, with rulings that some apparent fumbles (after the ball slipped out of a receiver’s arms or out of a quarterback’s moving hand) were actually incompletions.The downside of aiming to knock the ball out of a runner’s grasp is that a defender could miss the tackle and allow more yards. Eagles linebacker Brandon Graham, who has forced seven fumbles over the last two seasons, described tackling with one arm and swiping with the other. Several players said it was usually the second tackler to arrive who had the best chance to jar the ball loose.“It’s more important that you secure the tackle before you try to strip the ball,” Jets Coach Todd Bowles said.When they do get to the ball, defenders appear increasingly eager to, in the words of Jets safety Calvin Pryor, “scoop and score.” But it remains a matter of field awareness. When the ball is free near the pileup along the line of scrimmage, defenders typically fall on it for possession; when the ball is free in open space, they think 6 points.From 1976 to 1980, 4.3 percent (one in 23.4) of defensive fumble recoveries were returned for a touchdown. In the five most recent seasons, 9.3 percent (one in 10.7) were taken all the way back.When every loose ball is an immediate scoring opportunity, the importance of holding on to the football is only heightened.“It’s a basic fundamental,” Coughlin said, “but it’s the difference between winning and losing many times.”A version of this article appears in print on November 28, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Extracting a Football Protected Like Gold.
