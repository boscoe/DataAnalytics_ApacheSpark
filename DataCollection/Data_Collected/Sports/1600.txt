But they are hardly cowed by it. Even in games they lose against New England, the Jets tend to make Brady uncomfortable, and the fierceness of their pass rush and of their secondary could pose a challenge he eluded in the recent past when facing Jets teams with less talent. These Jets have allowed the fewest yards and points per game in the N.F.L., but according to research by NFL Network, Brady is 6-0 in his career against teams that rank first in total defense and scoring defense in Week 7 or later.Number to Watch: 4.84That is how many yards per carry New England has allowed this season, the fourth-highest average in the league. The Patriots’ struggles began in the opener, when they allowed 127 yards to the Pittsburgh backup DeAngelo Williams, and continued through last week, when Frank Gore averaged 6 yards per attempt. Opponents’ success against New England bodes well for Chris Ivory and the Jets, who average 146 rushing yards per game, most in the league.Quotation of the Week‘I don’t see anybody covering him. That’s the problem.’Jets Coach TODD BOWLES, when asked how other teams have covered Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who has caught 23 passes for 425 yards and five touchdowns.Advertisement
