Redskins (7-7) at Eagles (6-8)8:25 p.m. Line: Eagles by 3With a victory, the Redskins will win the N.F.C. East for only the second time in the last 16 seasons. An eighth victory would also guarantee that Washington will finish with at least a .500 record, thus avoiding a losing team winning the division for the first time since the N.F.L.’s Capitol Division became the N.F.C. East in 1970.For that to happen, Kirk Cousins will have to win a third consecutive game for the first time in his career. But playing against an underperforming and depleted Philadelphia defense, a red-hot Cousins seems very likely to thrive even as the Eagles will be fighting to stay in playoff contention.It would help Cousins considerably if DeSean Jackson were healthy. Jackson looked like his old self last week while hauling in 8 catches for 153 yards, including a spectacular 77-yard catch-and-run that would look familiar to the Eagles fans who watched him pull off plays like that from 2008 to 2013. Jackson did not practice Wednesday with foot and knee injuries, but he is expected to play.Pick: RedskinsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
