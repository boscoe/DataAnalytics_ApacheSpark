Week 14 scores and highlightsParis is probably not on anyone’s shortlist of hotbeds for American football, but on Rue St.-Jacques in the Latin Quarter, near the Sorbonne and Notre Dame, is an establishment, called W.O.S. Bar, where Packers fans gather each week to watch the team play. Patrons of the bar, where a self-proclaimed American expatriate troubadour who goes by the name of Cisco Kid performs after most games, claim that the Packers are the most beloved American football team in Europe, and the bar bills itself as “the official Green Bay Packers bar in Europe.” Perhaps it’s the shared love of cheese that is responsible for such an unlikely Paris-Wisconsin pairing.Taking this into consideration, maybe this game should be billed as one that pits America’s team versus Europe’s team.PICK: PackersAdvertisement
