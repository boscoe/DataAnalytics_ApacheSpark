CreditRichard Perry/The New York Times        Nick Young was slouched in a booth inside Santina, a restaurant under the High Line park, where the Italian fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna had organized a private dinner Thursday to fete the Knicks’ Carmelo Anthony, a featured face in one of its coming campaigns.Young, a Los Angeles Lakers guard who is dating the rapper Iggy Azalea, was rehashing a familiar point about the growing synergy between the N.B.A. and the world of fashion — how and why the league has become such a fertile source of brand pitchmen and style icons — but he interrupted himself to get something off his chest.“I don’t consider myself an N.B.A. fashion guy,” he said, raising his voice above the thumping music. “I’m outside of that. I’m like Kanye, Pharrell. You could compare me to those levels.”Young’s pivot toward Kanye West and Pharrell Williams was one of the clearer signs that the N.B.A. fashion movement had fully matured. Players, and their publicists, are insisting that they are not merely part of the pack; it is no longer cool to just be an “N.B.A. fashion guy.”AdvertisementFor years in the N.B.A., players have viewed being well dressed as a given, as much a part of modern basketball culture as layup lines and pregame stretches.AdvertisementBut now, players are not content with merely landing on best-dressed lists. Today’s most fashionable players, who are teaming up with luxury brands, flying overseas for fashion shows and releasing personal product lines that make sneakers seem quaint, do not see themselves only as extremely tall male models; they see themselves as fashion icons. This was never more evident than on Thursday, the start of the N.B.A.’s All-Star weekend in New York and also, by chance, New York Fashion Week. It seemed as if the N.B.A. players who arrived immediately dispersed to a multitude of fashion events and parties around the city.Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder was perhaps the most active player, bouncing to three events, all of them in some way devoted to him, in the span of a few hours. James Harden of the Houston Rockets caused a minor commotion when he helped open a pop-up shop at Bloomingdale’s, while John Wall of the Washington Wizards appeared at Macy’s. The list went on.Anthony strolled into the meatpacking district restaurant at about 9 p.m. in a charcoal suit and black turtleneck and posed for photographs with his wife, the actress LaLa Vazquez. Asked why fashion brands were clamoring to be partners with N.B.A. players, Anthony’s response was quick. “Exposure,” he said. “Basketball is one of the biggest sports out there — and it’s global, at that.”Men’s fashion in the United States, which has been viewed as lagging behind the rest of the world, has had a renaissance in recent years, as increasing numbers of men have become comfortable adopting clothing and style as a pursuit.Brands, Anthony said, recognized years ago that professional athletes allowed access to demographics that were previously closed to them, “people that they would not have normally tapped into.” American men are happy to follow the lead of their sports heroes.“There’s an edgy, cool factor having a real guy — who’s an athlete, who’s handsome, who has muscles or a distinct look — and putting your clothes on them instead of a model,” Mark Anthony Green, an editor at GQ magazine, said.Westbrook is one of the fashion front-runners among his basketball peers, and his distinguishing trait — as on the basketball court — may be his unbridled energy. He has a team identifying business opportunities for him, and he throws himself into them headlong.AdvertisementEarly Thursday night, he sat in front of an audience to discuss fashion with a reporter from The Wall Street Journal. From there, he was whisked to an intimate dinner hosted by the fashion industry journal WWD, which drew a clutch of boldfaced names in the fashion industry.He arrived at his final official event of the night, a party celebrating a collaboration between Westbrook Frames, his eyewear line, and JackThreads, a members-only online men’s retailer, at about 10:30 wearing shredded white jeans.The event was held in a five-story townhouse in SoHo. Synchronized swimmers in a windowed, second-floor pool waved to those who arrived through the front door. A member of his publicity team referred to it as his “graduation party.”As Westbrook ascended one level to the next, the music seemed to get louder, the bodyguards bigger, the greetings warmer. On the top floor, Westbrook leaned against the arm of a couch and spoke about his style influences and inspirations in a sort of free association exercise: “I love travel, hotels, different textures, women’s wear, women’s shoes, street style, photographs,” he said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The men’s suit section of Bloomingdale’s had been converted Thursday afternoon into cozy event space.Last summer, the department store and the N.B.A. agreed to collaborate on a merchandising concept in light of the two industry events occurring simultaneously, and Harden was picked as the spokesman.A D.J. booth was erected near the escalators. Mannequins were outfitted with basketball jerseys and suits. Curious shoppers stopped to gawk. Things were running slightly behind schedule.“It’s different for me,” said Harden, who showed up in a blue pinstripe suit. “I’m starting to move in this direction. This is a big step for me.”AdvertisementHarden posed in front of a dense crowd of photographers, then was shuttled around the store while another layer of people holding camera phones followed closely behind, shouting things at him.Kevin Harter, vice president for men’s fashion direction at Bloomingdales, said it made sense for brands and retailers to join with basketball players.“They have the confidence to mix it up and be bold,” he said. “They are making fashion fun for men.”And the players are having fun doing it, even if the scene has evolved into yet another competition for the players.After trying to establish a line between himself and his peers, Young, who wore an asymmetrical black sweater with gold patches and red Nike hightops to Anthony’s party, smiled about the convergence of the two worlds this weekend in New York.“We all in the N.B.A. feel like we’re fashion gurus,” Young said amid the hubbub. “Fashion kings.”A version of this article appears in print on February 14, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Posing for Fashion Houses, N.B.A. Stars Feel at Home.
