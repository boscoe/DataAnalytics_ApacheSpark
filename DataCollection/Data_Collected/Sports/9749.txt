Anyone can pick favorites to advance in the N.C.A.A. tournament. But this year, The New York Times produced a bracket with a market-based twist. It features a scoring system that rewards upset picks with bonus points based on how common a choice is among readers. 
We asked some athletes and celebrities to fill out our nontraditional bracket and give readers a chance to play against them. 
Of the nine people in the group, less than half picked the No. 1 overall seed Kentucky to become the first Division I men’s basketball team to have a perfect season since Indiana in 1975-76. All but two people had at least one No. 1 seed in the championship game.
