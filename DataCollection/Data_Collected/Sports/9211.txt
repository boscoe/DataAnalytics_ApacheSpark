Marshals went to the team’s base at Pier 80 and determined that the 45-foot catamaran and related components were in three shipping containers the team was preparing to send to Bermuda. The dispute will return to federal court, where Spooner is seeking at least $725,000 in a wrongful termination suit. Advertisement
