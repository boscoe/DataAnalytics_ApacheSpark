Wide receiver Julian Edelman, Tom Brady’s most frequent target, broke his right foot and was expected to be out for six weeks. “You wish you could just plug someone else in, but that’s impossible,” Brady told reporters. “Julian Edelmans just aren’t sitting out on the street, or else they’d be playing for another team.”Brady may be overstating things; the Patriots have a perfectly suitable replacement in Danny Amendola, who has generally performed well in place of Edelman. Amendola had a season-high 10 catches for 79 yards last week against the Giants.The Bills have been inconsistent, but they are 5-2 with Tyrod Taylor at quarterback, and their defense has enough talent to keep them in any game. Still, beating Brady in Foxborough is at this point beyond the capabilities of the up-and-coming Bills. Pick: Patriots  BENJAMIN HOFFMANAdvertisement
