The tournamentâ€™s owner, International Players Championship Inc., has an eight-year commitment with Miami-Dade, but the lawyer, Eugene Stearns, said the agreement was invalid because of county inaction in making upgrades.Tournament officials declined to comment on the court ruling. Potential alternative locations for the event include Orlando, Fla.; South America; and China. Advertisement
