Y. Hilton — also have four catches of at least 40 yards. Last week, Cooper became the first rookie to record at least 100 receiving yards in three of his team’s first six games since Mike Ditka in 1961, but on Sunday he visits Revis Island. Revis has six takeaways this season — three interceptions, three fumble recoveries — though he was beaten for a touchdown two weeks ago by Pierre Garcon of Washington and almost again last week in New England until Julian Edelman dropped the pass. Cooper may not have their experience, but he has Revis’s respect. Said Revis, “He’s a talent.”NUMBER TO WATCH39That is the age of Oakland safety Charles Woodson, who remains a force, even as one of the league’s oldest players. In October, Woodson was selected as the conference defensive player of the month for the fifth time, trailing only the former Bills defensive end Bruce Smith (six) for the most times. This season, he also became the only player in league history to intercept two passes in a game — doing it against Peyton Manning — at age 39 or older.QUOTATION OF THE WEEK‘That’s my favorite stadium to play in.
