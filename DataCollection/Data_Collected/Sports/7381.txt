SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. —  Keegan Bradley, the Patriots’ No. 1 fan on the PGA Tour, woke up Sunday with an uneasy feeling. Not about New England’s coming game, but his own. A down comforter of fog blanketed the area, causing a ground stop at Sky Harbor Airport 21 miles away and reducing road visibility in many areas to a few hundred feet.Bradley, who is strung tighter than a violin, had four tickets to Super Bowl XLIX and a 9:15 a.m. tee time for the final round of the Phoenix Open. Before the tournament began, he said: “I’m so pumped. I never thought I’d get to go to a Super Bowl in my life, let alone go and watch the Patriots play and win one. It’s going to be a lot of fun.”With football’s version of Christmas here at last, Bradley did not relish the prospect of his tee time being pushed back, not with 18 holes and a 31-mile commute to University of Phoenix Stadium ahead of him.“It did go through my head that there might be a fog delay,” Bradley said before teeing off. “I got a little nervous.”AdvertisementBradley was playing Sunday in a threesome that included Brendan Steele, his best friend on the tour. It was a serendipitous pairing because Steele and his wife, Anastassia, were attending the Super Bowl with Bradley and his girlfriend, Jillian Stacey.AdvertisementIn Saturday’s third round, Bradley was in the group directly ahead of Steele and bogeyed the 18th for an even-par 71 and a 54-hole total of four-under 209. A few minutes later, Steele signed for his 71, which left him at four under. After pointing out with a laugh that he had helped make their felicitous final-round pairing happen by bogeying his second-to-last hole, Steele said, “It wasn’t the number we wanted to be at, but it’s nice how it worked out.”An hour before Steele and Bradley were due to start their final round in a threesome with K. J. Choi, the fog continued to hold departing passengers captive at Sky Harbor and shroud University of Phoenix Stadium in a curtain of gloom. At the course, the skies overhead were clear, the sun was gaining strength and the Super Bowl-bound pair were side by side on the driving range. They discussed their postround plans between shots while teeing up balls or settling into their stances at address.Before the tournament, Bradley said: “I will do whatever it takes to get to that game, so if I have to get in a car and go 150 miles an hour, I’m going to do it. I can’t be this close to a Super Bowl and not go. So I will be there at some point.”On Saturday night, Bradley still had not secured a car. Someone suggested using a helicopter service, but that was not an option because it would cost $900 a head. Besides, not everybody in the traveling party was comfortable flying in a helicopter. Limousines and sedans for hire were scarcer than double eagles. At one area rental agency, Mirage Limousine Service, no sport utility vehicles were available as of Sunday morning. Its fleet of cars seating four to six people had been booked at costs from $1,500 to $4,000 an hour with a 12-hour minimum.

Lee/The New York Times        Between his third and fourth rounds, Bradley had contacted Jordan Spieth, who was attending the game with his caddie, Michael Greller, a Seattle area resident and die-hard Seahawks fan. Spieth’s manager, Jordan Lewites, had secured an S.U.V. through the concierge at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, where Spieth, Bradley and many of the out-of-town players were staying.The booking cost $126 an hour, with a 12-hour minimum. Lewites also had to buy a parking pass, at a cost of more than $300, so the driver could wait outside the stadium.Spieth offered Bradley and Steele a lift, but it was going to be a tight fit. Including the driver, there would be seven people in a car designed to seat six comfortably. “I’ll sit in Keegan’s lap,” Steele joked between shots on the range.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Steele finished two strokes behind. They struck their final putts at 1:50 p.m. Bradley walked into the scoring area with a sponsor’s cap on his head and emerged wearing a Patriots cap.Advertisement“This is a dream of mine my whole life, to go to the Super Bowl, and I got to play with Steeley,” Bradley said. “It’s a day I’ll never forget. It’s pretty crazy how it worked out. We’re itching to go, for sure.”They still had to return to their hotel to shower and retrieve the tickets, which Bradley stowed in his room. At 2:30 p.m., roughly 20 minutes after the Patriots arrived at the stadium, Bradley and Steele approached Greller. He was waiting for Spieth, who bogeyed the last hole for a 65 and a 72-hole total of 11-under 273, which was four strokes behind the winner, Brooks Koepka.“How long will it take you to get ready?” Bradley asked.Greller replied, “I’m going to shower and in two minutes I’ll be ready.”Bradley: “What about Jordan? How long will it take him?”Greller: “He’s the one you have to get on.”Bradley exchanged glances with Steele. Bradley’s caddie, Steven Hale, was driving to San Diego, site of the next tournament, and he offered to drop Bradley, Stacey, and Steele and his wife at the stadium on the way. Should they call an audible and go with Hale?They decided to stick with the original plan. “See if you can get Jordan going,” Bradley told Greller as he headed for the exit. “Tell him we want to leave by 3.”Less than an hour before the scheduled kickoff at 4:30 p.m. local time, Bradley posted a selfie on his Twitter account showing the six of them in the car, on the 101 loop. From the front passenger seat, Bradley looked as relaxed as he had all day. The rest of the day was out of his control.A version of this article appears in print on February 2, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: From Tee Time to Kickoff.
