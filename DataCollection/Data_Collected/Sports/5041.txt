Packers (9-4) at Raiders (6-7)4:05 p.m. Line: Packers by 3The Raiders have held opposing teams to fewer than 100 yards rushing in eight of their last 11 games, but in two of the other three they were burned for a combined 495 yards on the ground, by Pittsburgh and Minnesota.Oakland could be in for another long day against Packers running back Eddie Lacy, who has rushed for more than 100 yards in three of his last four games and looked comfortable last week with Coach Mike McCarthy calling the plays again.With quarterback Aaron Rodgers having a rough season by his standards, and Raiders defensive end Khalil Mack having emerged as one of the most terrifying pass rushers in the game, it may come down to Lacy and James Starks running Green Bay to a road win. But the dynamic duo is up to the task.PICK: PackersWeâ€™re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
