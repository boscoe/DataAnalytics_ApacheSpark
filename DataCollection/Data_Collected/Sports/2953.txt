Cowboys (2-6) at Buccaneers (3-5)1 p.m. Line: Buccaneers by 1N.F.L. Week 10 scores and highlightsWill the Cowboys ever win without quarterback Tony Romo? They keep trying, bless their hearts, but have fallen short each time since Romo went down in Week 2, the most recent being a 33-27 overtime heartbreaker to the Eagles. Perhaps the football gods are punishing Jerry Jones for signing Greg Hardy. Dallas’s last chance to win without Romo may be this one, since he is expected to return for its Nov. 22 game against the Dolphins.But this one will not come easy. The Buccaneers, led by quarterback Jameis Winston, have proved to be a feisty bunch, a team capable of beating anyone when it is playing well and the ball bounces its way a time or two.PICK: BuccaneersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
