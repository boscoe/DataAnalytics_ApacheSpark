BOSTON — On the day that the promoters of Boston’s plan to host the 2024 Summer Olympics finally made their bid public, a surprising bit of counterprogramming emerged from City Hall.It turned out that Mayor Martin J. Walsh had signed an agreement with the United States Olympic Committee to prohibit city employees from speaking negatively about the Olympics.It is not clear what punishment might await employees who disparage the Games. But the agreement, obtained by The Boston Globe through a public records request, showed that not all was smooth sailing as Boston made its debut as America’s entry for hosting the Games.The mayor issued a statement saying he was not trying to limit free speech; the agreement, he said, was simply “standard boilerplate language” that all applicant cities had signed.AdvertisementIn any case, as the promoters of Boston’s Olympic bid began the process on Wednesday of sharing their plan with the public and trying to build support for it, the speech prohibition was not the only point of disconnect.AdvertisementIn the bid, which they had submitted privately to the U.S.O.C. last year, the promoters wrote that the city was “overwhelmingly united in its bid for the 2024 Games.”But a poll on Tuesday for WBUR, NPR’s Boston station, showed that a bare majority of Bostonians — 50 percent — supported the bid while a third opposed it.That same poll also showed that 75 percent of residents want a referendum on whether the city should host the Olympics. Mayor Walsh, who had said that a referendum was not necessary, responded that while he did not want a vote, he would not stand in the way of one. Still, the prospect of a vote could chill the interest of the U.S.O.C. in sticking with Boston.
                The bid prepared by Boston 2024, a group of business leaders, construction magnates and politicians that was presented to the United States Olympic Committee in December. The committee chose Boston over Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington on Jan. 8.            Some of Boston’s neighboring cities are also expressing concerns about the enterprise. Last month, the City Council in Cambridge, where various events would be staged, passed a measure instructing its officials not to spend any time or resources on Olympic planning. The councilman who introduced the measure, Timothy Toomey, called the idea of Boston’s hosting the Olympics “insane.”Whether all this adds up to a scuttled bid or just a bump in the road remains to be seen. Other cities, including London, have started out with skeptical citizens only to see support increase as more information is shared and plans are completed.The promoters of the Olympic bid, called Boston 2024, held their first meeting on Wednesday for the general public. A few hundred people attended. Most seemed to be supporters or came to learn more; there were some skeptical questions but no disruptions from opponents.The Boston 2024 committee put on a professional show, setting the stage with a stirring video that it showed the U.S.O.C. last month. It then shared details of the bid that had led to Boston’s selection on Jan. 8 as America’s entry over Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington.AdvertisementThe committee was well aware of criticism that it had not been transparent and said that was a thing of the past.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

He noted that all recent Games held in the United States — in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Lake Placid — had been “cash positive.”Apart from certain infrastructure costs, he said, “no public funds would be utilized.”But doubts remained on this point.Andrew Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College and the author of “Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup,” said in a telephone interview Wednesday that after reviewing the bid, he expected the Olympics to cost “billions” more than Boston 2024 indicated.Boston 2024 had been saying publicly that the operating budget for the Games would be $4.5 billion, but its bid said it would be $4.7 billion. Even $4.7 billion, Mr. Zimbalist said, was unrealistic.“It is grossly irresponsible for them to make the claims of no public money,” he said.The broad outlines of the bid had been made public earlier. Boston presented itself as capable of hosting “the most walkable Games in modern times.” The dates it proposed were from July 19 to Aug. 4, 2024; the Paralympic Games would run from Aug. 14 to 25.The bid centers on the city’s potential use of its waterfront — it has 47 miles of publicly accessible waterfront and what planners called “one of the cleanest urban harbors in the world” — and its universities, more than 100 of which are in the immediate area.AdvertisementOf the 33 venues for the Games, 28 would be within a radius of about six miles, in effect making Boston itself the Olympic Park. Many of the venues would also be within a 10-minute walk of a subway station or commuter rail line.A temporary Olympic Stadium would be built in what is now a parcel of no-man’s land hard by several highways; it is called Widett Circle, but proponents would rebrand it as Midtown Boston. The stadium would be disassembled after the Games left town.However, there was some disappointment expressed that the photogenic Charles River did not meet the specifications for Olympic rowing competition.When Wednesday’s meeting ended after two hours, Erin Murphy Rafferty, the executive vice president of Boston 2024, promised that all questions that had been submitted in advance would be answered on the group’s website, “for good or ill.”An article on Thursday about Boston’s public release of its proposal to host the 2024 Summer Olympics omitted, in some editions, part of a quotation by Dan O’Connell, president of Boston 2024, about the transparency of the bid process. He said, “My apologies for a process that until now, a proof-of-concept process where there wasn’t as much outreach as there should have been, as there might have been.” He did not say “a concept process.”A version of this article appears in print on January 22, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Decree Reflects Rift in Boston Over Games.
