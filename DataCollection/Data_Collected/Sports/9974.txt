PORTLAND, Ore. —  A tight game between Utah and Georgetown, two teams rich in height and bulk, was decided in large part by the smallest player on the court.Utah’s 5-foot-10 Brandon Taylor made four 3-pointers Saturday, including a pivotal one with 2 minutes 46 seconds left that proved too much for Georgetown to overcome. Taylor’s drive and assist to Dakarai Tucker moments later helped clinch a 75-64 victory for fifth-seeded Utah, sending fourth-seeded Georgetown home early from the N.C.A.A. tournament again.Just two days earlier, Utah earned its first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in a decade. Now it is in the round of 16, a milestone in the rebuilding project underway with Coach Larry Krystkowiak.“Going on to the Sweet 16 is just amazing,” Taylor said. “It feels good.”Krystkowiak, seated nearby, interrupted.Advertisement“It feels great,” he said.In his fourth season, each better than the last, Krystkowiak is hoping to re-establish Utah as the national power it was under Rick Majerus, who led the Utes to the national championship game in 1998. The Utes (26-8) head to the South Regional in Houston to play the winner of Sunday’s game between top-seeded Duke and eighth-seeded San Diego State.AdvertisementSaturday’s game at the Moda Center featured two programs with pedigrees but only one with an immediate future in the tournament.Georgetown, one of the great brands of college basketball, last reached the round of 32 in 2007, when it continued on to the Final Four. It has spent most of the years since being ejected from the tournament by teams with double-digit seeds.Utah — ranked in the top 10 a month ago, before a few late-season losses — was a far more formidable foe, and the Utes occasionally dazzled with crisp passes and high-percentage shots, making 57.9 percent of their attempts for the game. Georgetown (22-11) countered with a hunger for rebounds, especially on offense.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            All the leads, until the last one, were elastic. At halftime, the teams were tied at 32-32. Utah surged ahead on the strength of three 3-pointers, including two within a minute by Taylor. Georgetown came back, went into a scoring funk to let Utah loose again, and then rallied again to tie the game, 49-49, on a Joshua Smith dunk with 8:35 remaining.With seven minutes remaining, the teams were tied at 53-53.That was about the time that Krystkowiak, a 6-foot-9 former N.B.A. player, shed his suit jacket. Tucker, a reserve who finished with 11 points, broke the tie with a short jumper, and Utah never trailed again.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Georgetown was led by L. J. Peak’s 18 points. Isaac Copeland added 14 points, and D’Vauntes Smith-Rivera had 12.Georgetown made 5 of 7 3-point attempts in the game’s first seven minutes to take a 21-10 lead. But Wright helped pull the Utes back with a one-play highlight reel — a steal, a behind-the-back dribble on the break and a pass for an easy layup.AdvertisementMoments later, a Taylor 3-pointer finished erasing the gap, giving Utah a 24-23 lead with 8:49 left in the half.Utah combated Georgetown’s size with the 7-foot freshman Jakob Poeltl, who helped muscle the Utes past scrappy Stephen F. Austin with 18 points in their opening game of the tournament, and the 7-foot senior Dallin Bachynski.Against the Hoyas, Poeltl scored 12 points but was benched sporadically because of foul trouble. Bachynski had 9 points and 8 rebounds.Krystkowiak’s first Utah team won six games. Players on Saturday said they would not have dreamed of reaching the round of 16 so quickly. Krystkowiak said he would have said the same thing.“It’s like, pinch me,” he said. “Here we are.”A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Small Player Helps Utah Beat Georgetown by Thin Margin.
