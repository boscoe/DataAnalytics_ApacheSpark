CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times        As a persistent drizzle drowned out the last fleeting moment of sunshine, Ben Rotstein scurried from field to field, chirping into his walkie-talkie and assuaging grievances of visiting rugby players, fully immersed in his first experience as the director of the New York Sevens Tournament.“Looking at the date, the weather, and how far people travel, it’s a little confusing why people come,” Rotstein said. “But rugby is such an incredible sport. A lot of these teams have been coming for a long time.”The New York Rugby Club has hosted its annual event on the Saturday after Thanksgiving since 1959. This year, 139 teams from across the United States, Canada, Mexico and Fiji descended on the southern tip of Randalls Island in one of the country’s largest amateur rugby tournaments.Beneath the relentless drone of traffic on the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, the speed of the game was evident. Unlike the traditional 15-a-side rugby union, with two 40-minute halves, sevens is seven-on-seven, played over two seven-minute halves. Men’s and women’s teams register to compete in high school, collegiate, social, club and premier divisions.AdvertisementNew York Sevens is a decidedly unpretentious gathering, illustrated by the minimal corporate sponsorship presence, abundance of volunteers, even the large white tournament bracket board filled with handwritten results. The New York Rugby Club uses the entry fees to cover the costs of field permits and game officials throughout the year.“It’s not easy to be grass-roots anymore,” said Rotstein, who is also the vice president of the club’s men’s 15s team. “The same energy is there, but I don’t know if they had to worry about having insurance and collecting waivers as much 20 years ago as we do today. Things aren’t as loose. We have trainers and doctors roving through the fields, and an ambulance on standby.”AdvertisementBut as the popularity of rugby in the United States takes off, the New York club is trying to figure out how to grow with it.According to a 2015 report from the Sports and Fitness Industry Association, there were 1,276,000 casual and core rugby players in United States in 2014, up from 720,000 in 2009. Rugby’s participation has soared while tackle football’s numbers have dropped steadily in the same span.“We’ve seen tremendous growth in the youth area, particularly in noncontact rugby,” said the former England team captain Nigel Melville, now the chief executive of the national governing body USA Rugby.With rugby sevens on the bill at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Melville suspects the game will earn greater credibility.“It’s a good time for rugby,” he said. “We have a groundswell of players for the future of the game.”Some teams in the upper echelon of play used Saturday as an opportunity to evaluate players for future tournaments, like the USA Sevens in Las Vegas in March, which will feature competitive divisions up to the national team level.Advertisement“This is a tryout,” said Omar Rivera, who coached the Atlantis squad, an invitational club that took first in the top men’s collegiate bracket at New York Sevens. “It’s all about developing the kids. You get seen when you go to these tournaments. They attract good clubs. I don’t want to win every game; I want my players to get better.”Advancing elite men is not the only goal of rugby’s stewards. In 2015, the New York Rugby Club expanded its opportunities for top female competitors by adding a premier girls’ high school series. The Atlantis women won the final.“Putting out a premier boys’ division, that’s the easy the thing to do,” said Rosalie MacGowan, a New York Rugby Club player and the club’s treasurer. “Premier girls? That’s definitely harder.”Rotstein, the tournament director, said high school girls’ teams registrations at New York Sevens had tripled in the last three years, to 18.In Canada, women’s competition can be sparse. The Royal Military College of Canada women’s club, which attended New York Sevens for the second year, plays in only three tournaments a year because there are few opponents near the institution’s campus in Kingston, Ontario.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The event is not sanctioned by USA Rugby, which Rotstein considers the next step toward becoming a more corporate event. But compliance requirements could deter the historically heavy international contingent from attending.“All tournaments like this are dealing with these kind of issues,” Rotstein said.MacGowan, the club treasurer, also said that perceptions of rugby as a sport closely tied to imbibing, and bouts of cultural insensitivity, could inhibit its expansion. She cited the suspension last March of the University of Mary Washington men’s rugby club in Fredericksburg, Va., after a recording of a song surfaced with some team members referring to sexual violence against women.On the ground, the number of playing fields available to the tournament this year increased to 13. But the reality is that accommodating more teams would be tricky, despite Randalls Island’s having two official rugby pitches and multiple dual-use soccer fields.Regarding the evolution of the New York Sevens, MacGowan said: “We have a tremendous asset here. We need to chart our own path so that other clubs can benefit from us.”A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Island Paradise for Rugby, Honking and Skyline Views Included.
