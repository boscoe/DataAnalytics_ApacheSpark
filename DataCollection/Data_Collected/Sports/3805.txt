Patriots (10-0) at Broncos (8-2)8:30 p.m. Line: Patriots by 2.5The records of these teams make the matchup seem far more appealing than it actually is. Tom Brady and the Patriots have looked and acted like a team with a perfect record, but the Broncos could easily be 2-8 rather than 8-2, that if you listen to the litany of criticism from their fans.With Peyton Manning out for at least this week, and plenty of speculation that he may consider retiring in the middle of his 18th season, Brady-Manning XVII has become Brady-Osweiler I, and Brock Osweiler, while quite tall, is not likely up to the task of taking down the mighty Patriots.For Denver to win would require the its superb defense to shut down Brady, and for Osweiler to have the kind of performance he had last week against the Bears, when he did enough to keep the score decidedly in Denver’s favor.Patriots Coach Bill Belichick has often relished the chance to devise a game plan against an inexperienced quarterback, and his pursuit of a second perfect regular season is becoming more realistic every week.Pick: PatriotsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
