Martin Brodeur acknowledged on Thursday that he could have found other opportunities to continue to play goaltender in the N.H.L.But he is leaving the game with more victories than any other goalie in league history and, he said, “with a smile on my face.”Brodeur, the longtime face of the Devils, played seven games with the St. Louis Blues this season and will become a senior adviser to the team’s general manager, Doug Armstrong.“This is a great day for me,” Brodeur, 42, said at a news conference at Scottrade Center. “I’m excited to start a new chapter of my hockey career. This is something I’ve been thinking about for a long time.”AdvertisementArmstrong said Brodeur would be with the Blues daily and would travel with the team. “We’re very excited to have Marty join our organization in a different capacity,” he said.AdvertisementThe Blues signed Brodeur in December to a one-year deal when their starting goalie, Brian Elliott, sustained a lower-body injury. When Elliott returned later that month, Brodeur no longer had a role on the team.“I’m a competitive guy, and it’s hard to stay on the sideline,” Brodeur said. “That’s why I decided to take my retirement.”Brodeur spent his first 21 seasons with the Devils, winning three Stanley Cups in five trips to the finals. He retired with 691 wins and 125 shutouts; both are N.H.L. bests. Although many believed that Brodeur should have retired with the Devils after last season, Brodeur insisted that this season was essential for his career.“I’m really competitive, but I love to have fun, and I’m leaving the game with a smile on my face,” he said. “I don’t think if I had done that last year, that would’ve been the case.”Having lost nearly two full seasons to work stoppages, Brodeur fell nine wins short of 700. That bothered him, he said, but he acknowledged that “691 is not too bad.”“It would’ve been nice to get 700,” he added, “but again, it is what it is. I wish I could’ve played more games. It’s all these lockouts. I got killed on it.”

He played a hybrid style, sometimes remaining on his feet like an old-style goalie but also incorporating butterfly elements. He also was renowned for his puck handling. Brodeur scored three career goals and is widely seen as the reason the N.H.L. adopted rules restricting where goalies could play the puck.Advertisement“When you really take a step back and realize what he’s accomplished and the type of career he’s had and the type of ambassador he is for the game, and you realize they made a rule change for him,” said Lou Lamoriello, the Devils’ president, general manager and interim coach, “he’s had quite an impact on the game.”Brodeur’s former teammates and coaches in New Jersey and elsewhere celebrated his career.“At his position, he’s the best who has ever played; it’s fairly clear,” said Devils forward Dainius Zubrus, who played with Brodeur for seven seasons.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

You have a lot of these moments, but definitely being beside Marty was pretty cool.”David Clarkson, a Toronto forward who spent his first six full seasons with the Devils, said Brodeur had a significant influence on his career.“He’s helped a lot of young guys in their careers just become the players they are,” Clarkson said. “He taught you how to act in the room. He was a really good guy in the locker room. I think he had impact on a lot of guys’ careers, not just what he did on the ice — that speaks for itself — but off the ice he was one of the best teammates I’ve played with.”Lamoriello said Brodeur was suited for a management position at hockey’s highest level.“He’s a student of the game; he studied the game,” Lamoriello said Wednesday. “He studied shooters, and there’s nothing he let pass. When you become a student of the game and you love the game, you have the ability to do just about anything in the game.”Lamoriello has said that he expects Brodeur to return to the Devils’ front office in some capacity after this season. He said Wednesday that the trial run in St. Louis would benefit both Brodeur and the Devils to “see whether he likes what this is all about.”Brodeur confirmed Thursday that he had had conversations with Lamoriello about returning to the Devils, but they did not have any positions available for him now.Advertisement“I’m committed to stay here through the end of the season — hopefully as long as we can, that’s for sure,” Brodeur said, referring to St. Louis. “There’s no commitment that I’ll go back to New Jersey or stay in St. Louis. I just want to make sure I’m going to enjoy what I’m going to do, and I’ll make a decision when it’s time.”Brodeur was such an integral part of the Devils’ organization that his shadow hung over it even after he left.“I wasn’t here with Marty, so for me, coming to the organization, you feel like Brodeur was such a big part of it,” Devils forward Mike Cammalleri said. “You think of the New Jersey Devils, you think of Lamoriello and Brodeur.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
