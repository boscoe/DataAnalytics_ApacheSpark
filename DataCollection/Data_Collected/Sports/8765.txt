Organizers called off the event following a third interruption, after a blanket of fog obscured the top of the 1.7-kilometer course.Thirteen of the 56 competitors raced before the event was canceled, with three failing to finish, including Switzerland’s Fabienne Suter, who protested after crashing into a gate in heavy fog. Italy’s Elena Curtoni had led with a time of 1 minute 15.74 seconds.

She led by more than a minute for much of the race and had time to grab a Norwegian flag to wave before the finish line.Johaug beat Bjorgen, a six-time Olympic champion, by 52.3 seconds. Charlotte Kalla of Sweden, who won the 10-kilometer freestyle race in Falun, was 1:31.6 behind and took bronze.

Norway won bronze, 19.4 seconds back, with Finland more than a minute behind in fourth place.France had a narrow lead after the ski jump portion and stayed in front during a race on an increasingly soft surface that slowed the skiers down.Also in Falun, Norway won the ski jump team event, ending Austria’s streak of five straight victories at the world championships.The normal hill champion Rune Velta earned his fourth medal in four events at the worlds by safely landing his jump in the final round after his teammates had given Norway a big lead.
