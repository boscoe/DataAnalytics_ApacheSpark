But rather than receiving plaudits and congratulations, these technological marvels, created by the finest minds in mechanical engineering from around the world, were met with a much bigger kind of noise: From within and outside the series came complaints about how quiet the engines had become and how much excitement they had therefore removed from the series, once characterized by the ear-shattering racket of V8 engines.The new turbos were so efficient that they ate up the noise and heat in the exhaust to recycle it as energy to power the engine. Ultimately, however, nothing has been done to change this state of noiselessness, since the engineers who create the cars care about only one thing: winning.“It’s not of interest; noise is wasted energy,” Pat Symonds, the technical director of the Williams team, said this winter.In fact, even the Formula One promoter, Bernie Ecclestone, who was among the most vocal critics of the change, saying the series had lost some of its excitement through the lack of aggressive attack of spectators’ eardrums, should have been happy with the new formula for the immediate effect on the business. Not only did the new environmentally relevant engines keep the major manufacturers Renault and Mercedes involved in the series — Renault had made it a stipulation for their staying — but in 2015 the hybrid technology has also brought the return of Honda.After leaving the series in late 2008 amid the global financial crisis, the Japanese company has returned in 2015 to learn to develop and to show off a technology that is relevant in selling passenger cars. And it chose to rejoin McLaren, the team where it achieved its greatest successes, in the 1980s and 1990s.“McLaren Honda is a partnership focused on performance, technology and innovation, and there’s no better example of that than the results achieved in our first collaboration in the 1980s and 1990s,” said Ron Dennis, who still directs the McLaren team.“While I don’t tend to like looking back to the past, our previous record of sustained success was certainly instrumental in creating the confidence to make the decision to partner with Honda again,” Dennis added. “Now, there’s real hunger to demonstrate the capabilities of the huge talent pool we share between us, and I’m totally committed to driving progress and achieving further success.”Although the introduction of the new engines raised costs significantly for the manufacturers and the teams — customer teams pay about $30 million per season for their engines — the rules were set to limit spiraling engine costs by freezing their development once the engines were introduced last year.Such an engine-development freeze had existed since the previous generation of engines, which had nearly stagnated on a fixed design for half a decade. At the turn of the century, engine development was nearly unlimited and the engine manufacturers and teams spent millions per season in developing the engines from race to race.But after Mercedes dominated the series last year, and gave an advantage to other Mercedes-powered teams — like Williams, McLaren and Force India — the competing manufacturers, Ferrari and Renault, fought the other teams and the International Automobile Federation, the governing body for the series, to open up the regulations to allow for engine development.Over the winter, the federation, known by its French abbreviation, the F.I.A., and the teams agreed to allow for engine development throughout the season, but within a system that limits it through a series of so-called tokens, with each engine manufacturer being able to use the same number of 32 tokens for development, whenever they want to. Previously, they had the right to make minor changes before the season started, but had to live with whatever they had throughout the season.This new rule was at first limited to Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault, the companies that had already introduced their engines last year. Honda was told it had to begin under the same rules as the latter companies in its first year, but could then develop the engine next year. After much negotiating, however, Honda — whose engine has had a sluggish start in winter testing — has now been allowed to develop its engine like the other manufacturers throughout the season.In the end, this system should help not only by allowing the manufacturers to catch up to Mercedes, but also by making the show more exciting for spectators, who might otherwise be resigned to another season of complete domination by the German manufacturer and the teams that use its engines.But as with just about every rule change in Formula One, this opening up of engine-development rules has created a new strategic crisis for the manufacturers: Deciding precisely when during the season is the best time for them to do their development and use their tokens.Cyril Abiteboul, who runs the Renault engine program, said the group was looking closely at when and how to use the rest of the development program to best profit by it next year.“I think that there is a bit of strategic thinking to employ for this decision and therefore for the in-season development strategy for 2015,” said Abiteboul, adding that Renault might wait until near the end of the season to make most of the engine developments.“We have options,” he added. “We have to see how we play with the resources we have to develop this year’s engine or bring forward a bit of next year’s engine regulations.”Advertisement
