Of course, Krzyzewski and Duke won that game for their second consecutive title. For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.The coaches will meet again Sunday in a South Region round of 32 game at Time Warner Cable Arena.The two have remained friends for years. And Fisher, who was hired in 1999 by San Diego State after being fired by Michigan in 1997 after a scandal over payments to players from boosters, credits Krzyzewski with helping him rebuild the Aztecs. The coaches arranged a meeting at Cameron Indoor Stadium in 2001 that was San Diego State’s first nationally televised game and gave the Aztecs a higher profile in recruiting.“We robbed a bank to go there, and we played well,” Fisher said of the fee given to San Diego State to play the game. “We had Randy Holcomb on that club and wound up going to the N.C.A.A. tournament ourselves that year, and it was a great experience for us, for our kids, for the program — a nationally televised game that was helpful in starting the growth of the program.”Now San Diego State is on the short list of programs with a streak of N.C.A.A. tournament appearances. The Aztecs have made the field six years in a row, with only seven other programs boasting longer streaks. Among the seven is Duke, which is in the tournament for the 20th year in a row.Advertisement
