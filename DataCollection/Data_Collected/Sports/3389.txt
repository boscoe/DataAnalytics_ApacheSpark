Redskins (4-5) at Panthers (9-0)1 p.m. Line: Panthers by 8.5N.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsThese teams are probably closer in ability than their records suggest, but all anyone wants to talk about is Cam Newton’s dancing.Newton is known for his enthusiastic celebrations, and when he performed a “dab” in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s victory, it seemed to drive the football world to distraction. Newton’s dance inspired one mother to write to The Charlotte Observer to complain about the example he was setting for her 9-year-old daughter.Still, rather than scold his quarterback, Coach Ron Rivera seemed mostly amused by the situation. He told reporters that instead of having to worry about football, “ Newton made it possible to “worry about dancing.”Panthers defensive end Jared Allen had perhaps the best response.“This isn’t ‘Footloose,’ ” Allen told reporters. “You are allowed to dance.”Newton should get several chances to dance against the Redskins’ defense, and quarterback Kirk Cousins and Washington’s offense will learn the meaning of regression to the mean when their offensive outburst last week becomes a distant memory against Luke Kuechly and the Carolina defense.PICK: PanthersWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
