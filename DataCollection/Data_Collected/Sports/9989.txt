PORTLAND, Ore. —  In a game featuring soon-to-be N.B.A. players and beefy big men, it was Arizona’s long-bombing guards who led the Wildcats to the round of 16 with a 73-58 victory over Ohio State.T. J. McConnell and Gabe York each scored 19 points, combining for 28 in the second half to crack open a tight game and send second-seeded Arizona to the West Regional in Los Angeles, where the Wildcats (33-3) will play sixth-seeded Xavier.The game featured a pair of freshmen expected to leave college to become high N.B.A. draft picks this year. Tenth-seeded Ohio State’s 6-foot-5-inch guard D’Angelo Russell had 28 points in an overtime victory over Virginia Commonwealth two days earlier. Arizona’s 6-8 forward Stanley Johnson, surrounded by a deeper cast, averaged 14 points per game during the season.But the stars got off to slow starts in a sluggish first half, each missing five of his first six shots, and never found a groove. Russell, guarded mostly by Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, made just 3 of 19 shots and finished with 9 points. He offset some of his trouble with 7 rebounds and 6 assists.AdvertisementJohnson had 4 points on 1-of-12 shooting while pulling in 10 rebounds. Arizona’s 7-foot Kaleb Tarczewski and 6-9 forward Brandon Ashley were similarly suffocated by Ohio State’s zone defense, daring the Wildcats to win from outside.AdvertisementThat was what they did.“When they shrink like that, the only thing that’s left for me is to knock down shots,” York said.After a taut first half in which both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and neither could build a lead bigger than 6, McConnell and York drained 3-pointers to help build Arizona’s lead to 41-34.At the time, the two were a combined 9 of 13 from the field, while the rest of Arizona’s roster was just 6 of 26.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            “There have been questions about whether we were going to score enough points and are we going to make enough shots,” Johnson said in the locker room as he munched on a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich and shrugged away his shooting statistics. “I think it’s pretty established that we can get you in different ways.”York added another 3-pointer to push the lead to 10, then another to lift it to 13 with 9 minutes 55 seconds remaining. Russell and the Buckeyes (24-11) could not close the gap, as the Wildcats proved themselves the deeper team.McConnell and York were the only Arizona players to make at least half their shots. Combined, they were 13 of 22. Their teammates were 10 of 41.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Wildcats, not happy with their performance against Texas Southern two days earlier, took it out on the Buckeyes.“Our guys did an excellent job on D’Angelo Russell,” Arizona Coach Sean Miller said. “I thought we defended with a lot of purpose. We won our way.”AdvertisementOhio State’s Sam Thompson scored 18 points, but no one else chipped in more than 10. Arizona outrebounded Ohio State, 43-26, including an 18-7 margin in offensive boards.The game had a rare personal twist between the coaches. Thad Matt and Sean Miller were assistants together, sharing an office, at Miami of Ohio more than 20 years ago. When Matta got the head-coaching job at Xavier, he hired Miller as an assistant, and they lived in the same neighborhood. When Matta left for Ohio State, Miller succeeded him before leaving for Arizona in 2009.“First thing I do when I’m shaking his hand, I’m trying to get my $400 I loaned him back in 1999,” Matta said on Friday. “He never repaid me for all the lunches I bought him.”It was a joke, but Saturday’s game was just the latest that the men have coached against one another that have been all business. In 2007, top-seeded Ohio State beat Xavier in overtime. Two years ago, Matta’s Buckeyes beat Miller’s Wildcats with a tie-breaking shot with two seconds left to lift Ohio State to the round of eight.This time, Miller got the best of Matta. And Arizona, a perennial power with its best roster in years, now riding a 13-game winning streak, is a title-or-bust locomotive, building steam.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP6 of the New York edition with the headline: Arizona Goes Long to Defeat Ohio State.
