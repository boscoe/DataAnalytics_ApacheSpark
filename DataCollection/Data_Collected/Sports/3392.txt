Chiefs (4-5) at Chargers (2-7)4:05 p.m. Line: Chiefs by 3N.F.L. Week 11 scores and highlightsChiefs linebacker Justin Houston is paid like a superstar, and has the statistics of one, but he never seems to garner the attention of other players of his caliber. He led the N.F.L. last season with 22 sacks and should be able to boost his 7.5 this season while facing Philip Rivers and the Chargers. In last season’s finale, Houston had four of Kansas City’s seven sacks, helping the Chiefs keep their division rival from a playoff berth.The Chiefs are coming off a defensive masterpiece against Denver, which included five interceptions and five sacks. The Chargers, meanwhile, have lost seven of their last eight games, and even their noted passing game should be rendered ineffective against the opportunistic Chiefs defense. It will not help the Chargers that Keenan Allen, their best wide receiver, is on injured reserve, and Malcom Floyd, their second best receiver, is not expected to play while he works his way back from a torn labrum.PICK: ChiefsWe’re interested in your feedback on this page.
