The two are accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to pro athletes. On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges against Allen, Susan Daub and their investment firm. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the N.F.L. from 2001 to 2012, playing for the Giants and the Miami Dolphins.■ New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount was suspended for the first game next season for violating the N.F.L.’s substance abuse policy. The league announced the suspension without pay without saying when the violation had occurred. Blount was arrested last August and charged with possession of marijuana while with Pittsburgh.■ Jurors began deliberating in the murder trial of the former New England player Aaron Hernandez after his lawyer, James Sultan, acknowledged for the first time that his client had been at the scene of the killing of Odin Lloyd and had seen it happen. But Sultan described Hernandez as a young man who had simply not known what to do. Hernandez is charged in the June 2013 death of Lloyd, 27. Sultan said Hernandez’s co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were the killers. They will be tried later.■ The former 49ers and Raiders offensive lineman Kwame Harris was tied to two hit-and-run crashes in San Francisco before falling asleep in a running car and trying to bite a police officer, the authorities said. Harris was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, aggravated assault on an officer, hit-and-run and resisting officers.Advertisement
