CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times        UNIONDALE, N.Y. —  Standing at ice level and facing the Islanders’ runway, Mike Artusa smiled broadly and had a handshake or a hug ready for all the familiar faces. And there was a seemingly endless supply of those.Countless hockey fans at Nassau Coliseum have been welcomed by Artusa, who at 81 proudly wears a dark blue sweater emblazoned with an Islanders logo and does his best to maintain order and add to the fun in Section 101.Like so much at the arena, which dates to 1972, Artusa and his fellow ushers, ticket takers and security guards are fixtures. And they revel in their roles, treating the jobs more like a family reunion than work.“I’m here since Day 1,” Artusa said as the Islanders warmed up before a recent game. “There are so many people I’ve known through the years, coming with their families and now with their kids’ families. That’s what this place is all about and what I’ll miss most when the team moves to Brooklyn.”AdvertisementArtusa, who cannot recall missing a game, is enjoying this final season as the home dates dwindle, including Tuesday’s last regular-season game against the archrival Rangers. The excitement of witnessing the Islanders’ best season since the early 1980s has been a bonus.“They are playing great, and I feel it, too,” he said. “I watch the faces of fans during play because I have to look away from the ice. Everyone is happy.”AdvertisementBut like many of his co-workers, he cannot prevent wistfulness from coloring the conversation when he thinks about what next season will be like without the team nearby.“They belong on Long Island,” said Artusa, who lives in Woodmere and volunteers as a fire department ambulance driver. “It’s hard to see the team leave. Nobody is happy.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They are my family, too.”Memories of the team’s four Stanley Cups from 1980 to ’83 help restore his happiness.Where was he when Bob Nystrom scored in overtime in Game 6 to beat the Philadelphia Flyers for the Islanders’ first championship?Pointing straight down. Artusa said, ”Right here!”A version of this article appears in print on March 9, 2015, on Page D8 of the New York edition with the headline: Standing Till the End.
