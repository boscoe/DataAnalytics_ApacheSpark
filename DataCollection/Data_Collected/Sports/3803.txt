They were 1-4, and their best player was lost for the season. They lost again the next week, and that seemed to be the end of any postseason aspirations.Since then, the Chiefs have been rolling, with their suffocating defense doing much of the dirty work but the offense delivering, too. They have gone 4-0, winning by a combined score of 130-39.The defensive schemes devised by the coordinator Bob Sutton have put significant pressure on opposing quarterbacks, with linebackers Justin Houston and Tamba Hali leading the way with a combined 13 sacks, and the unit has been opportunistic with 14 interceptions and 7 fumble recoveries.The Bills have most of the pieces to be a top team, and look the part on occasion, but in traveling to Kansas City to face a red-hot opponent, victory seems beyond their reach.Pick: ChiefsAdvertisement
