CreditChristopher Smith for The New York Times        KANSAS CITY, Mo. — There were no first-pitch inside-the-park home runs, no power failures and no starting pitchers working out of the bullpens into the 14th inning this time. It was just ordinary baseball in Game 2 of the World Series.After the series opened with an unusual and entertaining Game 1 Tuesday, a sense of normalcy returned to Kauffman Stadium on Wednesday except for one important distinction: For the first time in the postseason, Jacob deGrom was not unbeatable, and Johnny Cueto was.Cueto threw a two-hit complete game, and the result was a 7-1 victory for the Kansas City Royals over the Mets and a two-games-to-none lead in the series. Of the 53 teams that have jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the World Series, 42 have gone on to win. Two of the clubs that defied the trend, coincidentally, were the 1985 Royals and the 1986 Mets.Game 3 is set for Friday at Citi Field, where Noah Syndergaard is scheduled to pitch against Yordano Ventura as the Mets seek the comforts of home to gain their first win.“We’ve got to pick it up offensively,” Manager Terry Collins said. “We’ve got to do a better job of using the field to hit. And we’ve done it. We certainly have done it. We’ve got to do it again.”AdvertisementDeGrom, who won two games in the Mets’ division series against the Los Angeles Dodgers and one in the National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, took his first postseason loss. This time, facing a relentless lineup that is undeterred by even the most accomplished pitchers in baseball, deGrom gave up four runs and six hits, walked three and struck out two.AdvertisementHe was unhittable for three innings, but then things began to unravel in the fifth, when the Royals scored four times. DeGrom, known for his ability to collect strikeouts, was not missing the Royals’ bats with his pitches. He induced only three swings and misses, and he labored more than usual with too many balls crossing the hitting zone.“I told Jake not everything has to be a strike,” Collins said. “You’ve got to move it around. You’ve got to change speeds, give them something to look at. If you continue to pound the strike zone, they’re going to put it in play, and that’s what they did.”Cueto, on the other hand, pitched the game of his life, allowing only two hits while striking out four and walking three in a magnificent effort.Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

From one start to the next, the Royals did not know whether Cueto would be good or bad. In the postseason, he was very bad in his most recent start against the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series, but he pitched fine in Game 5 of the division series. Over all, he carried a 1-3 postseason record and a 6.93 earned run average into Wednesday’s game. But he was much better, and the Royals’ offense supported his valiant effort.With three add-on runs in the eighth providing a cushion, Yost felt free to send out Cueto to finish the game, much to the delight of the fans, who roared when they saw him emerge from the dugout. Cueto said he was saddened by the news on Tuesday that Daniel Volquez, the father of Cueto’s teammate and fellow Dominican pitcher Edinson Volquez, had died that day.“It was a very sad day for me yesterday,” he said. “And there was a lot of focus on my part. I dedicated the game to Volquez’s dad and the whole family.”AdvertisementTrailing by 1-0, the Royals broke through in the fifth by scoring four times against deGrom, and doing it in a most Royals-like way — sending nine men to the plate without even collecting an extra-base hit.
                This season, the Mets had four of the top 20 pitchers who threw the most pitches over 95 m.p.h.            There were five singles after a leadoff walk by Alex Gordon. Alex Rios singled to left, and then Alcides Escobar twice tried to lay down a bunt before rapping a single to center, scoring Gordon. DeGrom got two outs, one of them coming on Lorenzo Cain’s nerve-racking line drive to center that was as well struck as any hit — better than even the ground ball by Hosmer in the next at-bat.But Hosmer’s ball went up the middle, beyond the diving shortstop Wilmer Flores and into center field. Rios and Escobar scored, and Hosmer turned to his teammates in the dugout and gave an emphatic celebratory gesture.“Jake came out pitching great,” David Wright said. “But they just grinded him out.”Kendrys Morales followed with a single to right field, barely over the shifted infield, and Mike Moustakas came to the plate with runners at first and third and two outs and three runs in. Moustakas drove one pitch from deGrom down the right-field line, but it hooked foul by only two feet. Then he drove another to the opposite corner, also foul.Finally, he settled on a ground ball up the middle, this one eluding the belated diving effort of Daniel Murphy, and Hosmer scored to make it 4-1.The Royals’ pitchers have done a good job keeping Murphy in check. He entered the World Series with home runs in his previous six postseason games and then went 2 for 7 in Game 1 with a run scored. In Game 2, he went 0 for 2 with two walks and struck out twice.“We stressed it enough,” Collins said. “When we play good, our lineup produces throughout. It just shows you right now with us not hitting how big Daniel Murphy really was in the N.L.C.S. with the home runs.”A version of this article appears in print on October 29, 2015, on Page F1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Gem, but Not by DeGrom.
