LOUIS — The St. Louis Rams saved some of their best for last.Tavon Austin scored twice, Todd Gurley topped 1,000 yards rushing, and the Rams beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31-23, on Thursday night in what might have been the franchise’s final game in St. Louis.The Rams’ 31st-ranked offense had an inspired effort in front of another half-filled but spirited Edward Jones Dome crowd, rolling to a 21-3 halftime lead behind Case Keenum’s two touchdown passes.Fans chanted, “Keep our Rams!” and carried signs, one of them reading, “We Don’t Need Kroenke, We Just Want Our Rams.”The team’s owner, E. Stanley Kroenke, who wants to move the Rams (6-8) to Los Angeles, attended the finale but kept a low profile.The team announced that 51,295 tickets had been distributed for the 66,000-capacity dome.Leading by 31-13, the Rams became conservative, and Jameis Winston took advantage with two touchdown passes in a big fourth quarter. He had just 125 passing yards in the first three quarters but finished with a career-best 363 for Tampa Bay (6-8).The halftime deficit was the Buccaneers’ largest since they were down by 35-7 against the Titans in their opening 42-14 loss.The Buccaneers’ Mike Evans had nine receptions for 157 yards and topped 1,000 yards for the season.Austin Seferian-Jenkins’s 9-yard scoring catch cut the deficit to 8 with 1 minute 34 seconds left.Advertisement
