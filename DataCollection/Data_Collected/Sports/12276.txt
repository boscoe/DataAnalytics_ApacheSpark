CHICAGO — The Jets’ checkered history with first-round draft picks is no secret. Neither is their fans’ frustration, which usually manifests in a flurry of boos inside the draft hall each spring.So when Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., stepped to the lectern inside the Auditorium Theatre here on Thursday night to announce the Jets’ first-round pick, the sixth over all, Joe Piacente and Isaac Reichman were ready. Sitting in the third-floor balcony, the two Jets fans had ESPN cameras trained on them, and a pact between them.“If they didn’t pick Kevin White, we were going to boo,” Reichman said.Instead of opting for White, a West Virginia wide receiver, the Jets’ new general manager, Mike Maccagnan, selected Southern California defensive lineman Leonard Williams. Piacente and Reichman, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., natives now living in Chicago, immediately jumped to their feet, waved a Jets flag and booed like any good Jets fan would. Then they stopped.“I realized he might be the best player on the board, so we started cheering,” Piacente said.Since ESPN first broadcast the N.F.L. draft in 1980, Jets fans have made jeering at the event an art form and a tradition. It began that year with Johnny Lam Jones, a wide receiver from Texas. Other notable — and roundly booed — selections over the years include fullback Roger Vick in 1987 and Penn State running back Blair Thomas, selected second in 1990 ahead of the Hall of Famers Cortez Kennedy, Junior Seau and Emmitt Smith.AdvertisementBut no blunder compared with the one in 1995, when Miami defensive lineman Warren Sapp was available to the Jets at No. 9. Jets fans, giddy with anticipation, chanted, “We want Sapp!” Then the Jets’ new coach and general manager, Rich Kotite, selected Kyle Brady, a tightend from Penn State.AdvertisementBrady spent four seasons in New York. Sapp, selected 12th by Tampa Bay, won a Super Bowl and was inducted into the Hall of Fame.When the draft moved 800 miles away, to Chicago, the question was whether Jets fans would take their ire on the road. The booing ritual continued, but with less fervor.

He will join a potentially imposing defense with Muhammad Wilkerson, Sheldon Richardson, Damon Harrison, Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie.“I’m a Jets fan, so I hate everything, so of course I’m going to boo,” Reichman said before the draft. But by the end of the night, there was less doom and gloom.“Their defense looks pretty good,” he said.There was a handful of Jets fans in Chicago, both in the theater and outside at the sprawling complex known as Draft Town. Most were East Coast transplants, living in the city or elsewhere in the Midwest. There were certainly more Jets jerseys — Joe Namath, Laveranues Coles and Revis among them — than those representing the Giants, but surely not as many as when the draft was held at Radio City Music Hall, the Theater at Madison Square Garden or Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.While their numbers were fewer in Chicago, the mood was lighter. Outside the theater, at the Jets tent in Draft Town, fans gathered to watch the announcement of the team’s pick. When Williams’s name was called, there were no boos at all, in fact — at least from Jets fans.

We’re so tense.”AdvertisementChicago, she said, was different.“We’re absorbing that Midwest energy,” Youssouf said. “It’s kind and welcoming here, and it’s rubbing off. Even on Jets fans.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
