CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Having made the N.C.A.A. tournament for only the second time in Coach Steve Lavin’s five-year tenure, and only the second time since 2002, No. 9-seeded St. John’s will be short-handed in its South Region game against San Diego State (26-8), the No. 8 seed, Friday in Charlotte, N.C.The Red Storm (21-11) will play without starting center Chris Obekpa, who was suspended for two weeks for violating team rules after reportedly failing a drug test. Obekpa averaged 3.1 blocks per game, fifth best in Division I, along with 5.8 points and 7 rebounds for St. John’s.“It’s less than ideal to not have Chris Obekpa’s services for the N.C.A.A. tournament,” Lavin said Thursday.“Yet this group over the past three years has had a number of stretches where we’ve had to play without Chris and have been successful. So whether it was through foul trouble, being disqualified from a game or fouling out or a number of injures that he’s endured, this team has found a way to offset the loss of Chris in games and stretches of the season and still been successful.”Obekpa will not be eligible to return until the Final Four weekend, if the Red Storm makes it to Indianapolis. The last time St. John’s won a game in the tournament was in 2000.The team’s last Final Four?
