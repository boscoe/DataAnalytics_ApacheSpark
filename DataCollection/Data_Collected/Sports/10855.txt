That said, I am reasonably certain — or as certain as one can be about these things — that the Chicago Cubs will be playing in the World Series this October.This belief is not born of the syrupy, early April optimism that is bred into Cubs fans. That was beaten out of me long ago, either by so many years as a sportswriter or by Larry Himes’s stint as general manager. (For the uninitiated, he is the one who let Greg Maddux leave.)Instead, there are plenty of perfectly plausible, rational reasons this is really going to be the Cubs’ year. The new manager, Joe Maddon, won’t treat the 107-year wait for a championship as a 107-ton weight. Jon Lester is a war horse of a pitcher, Anthony Rizzo is a franchise cornerstone, and Kris Bryant looks like a star in waiting.Still, my belief is more personal.My father, Mort, died last year, and while he was everything I could have wanted in a father — a role model who showed me the importance of following a passion (photography for him, writing for me) as well as a best friend and best man — I have long blamed him for the Cubs’ not reaching the World Series since 1945. And he knew it.He was a senior at Sullivan High School in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago the last time the Cubs played for baseball’s championship. He worked occasionally as a vendor at Wrigley Field, but never made much money because he was too busy watching the games. When the Cubs forced a Game 7 against the Detroit Tigers that year, his father got him a bleacher ticket. The only problem was he had to cut football practice to go to the game.The excitement of being at Wrigley that day did not last long. The Tigers scored five times in the top of the first inning and clinched the World Series with a 9-3 victory. My father was so mad he decided to run home, which was about five miles away. Along the way, a car pulled up alongside him: It was his football coach, a gruff, gravel-throated, not very likable man who wanted to know why my father hadn’t been at practice.All my father could do was apologize. “I promise it won’t happen again,” he said.And, of course, it hasn’t.I was born in Chicago, but by the time I was 2 years old we had moved to Los Angeles so my father could go to Art Center College to study photography. I am not quite sure why I became devoted to the Cubs, although I believe it had less to do with a connection to Chicago or Wrigley Field than to just being a sucker for lost causes.The first time I saw the Cubs play was at Dodger Stadium with my father and my grandfather. A perfectly good afternoon came to an abrupt end when the Dodgers’ Bill Sudakis hit a two-out home run off the right-field foul pole in the bottom of the ninth. Wait, I remember thinking, the game is over?What makes a baseball record unbreakable? Sometimes the game changes and that puts a record out of reach. Sometimes an exceptional performance is too dominant to be matched. When the two combine, the record could last for centuries.A few years later, back at Dodger Stadium, I sneaked down to the seats behind home plate, where I had an up-close view of my favorite Cubs pitcher, Bruce Sutter, giving up a game-ending grand slam to Davey Lopes.It was in moments like these, or trips back to Wrigley during the summer, that my father would invariably remind me that when the Cubs finally made it back to the World Series, we would go. His uncle’s wife’s nephew was an official in the parks department in Chicago and had a connection for tickets. As a parent now, I realize there are times when you’ll say anything to your child to make him or her feel better.As I grew older, I figured there had to be some greater meaning, a reason I made such an emotional investment in a team that never experienced a happy ending. In 1984, after I watched a ball go through the legs of Leon Durham, another one eat up the otherwise impeccable Ryne Sandberg and the Cubs complete their playoff collapse against the San Diego Padres, I got a call from my college girlfriend. She told me we were through. One of those losses still stings. In 2003, I was in Chicago on a football assignment during the last week of the regular season. I was free on Saturday and bought a ticket at Wrigley to watch the Cubs sweep a doubleheader against Pittsburgh, while Houston was losing — a combination that clinched a playoff berth. As the Cubs turned a game-ending double play, I was on the phone with my father, giving him the play-by-play, if not quite as hysterically as Ron Santo did on the radio broadcast.After the Cubs then eliminated the Atlanta Braves in the first round of the playoffs, we thought about going to Florida, where we knew we could get tickets to see the Cubs play in the National League Championship Series against the Marlins.But no, we decided, we had waited too long. It was World Series or bust.So when the Cubs collapsed against the Marlins, how else could I explain it all? It was not Steve Bartman’s fault, even if he got in the way of that foul pop. Nor was the Cubs’ shortstop, Alex Gonzalez, to blame, even though he botched a double-play ball shortly after the Bartman fiasco. As someone whose job sometimes requires the deconstruction of events on the field and parsing blame, I knew exactly where to point the finger: at my father, and his vow.Until his health began to fail, we traveled to see the Cubs in San Francisco and San Diego, and Arizona, where in 2007 we took my son, Alex, to the first round of the National League playoffs so he could be duly indoctrinated: two games against the Diamondbacks, two losses by the Cubs.In truth, as time passes, the results have mattered less than the time we had together. The Cubs have been, more than anything else, a shared experience.I will remember that this October, when they reach the World Series. I plan to take Alex with me. But first I will have to speak with his high school basketball coach. I do not imagine he will be happy about my son missing practice right before the start of the season, so I am prepared to explain that the Cubs do not play in a World Series every day. If necessary, there is a deal I am prepared to make.I will promise it won’t happen again.Advertisement
