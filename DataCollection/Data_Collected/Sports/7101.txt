In the divisional round of the N.F.L. playoffs, the New England Patriots dived deep into their playbook for a series of trick plays. What the Patriots did surprised even rule-book aficionados, to say nothing of the team’s opponent, the Baltimore Ravens. It was also entirely legal, and a result of Coach Bill Belichick’s ingenuity and deep understanding of the rules.The N.F.L. publishes a rule book each year titled the “Official Playing Rules of the National Football League.” Rule 7, Section 5 of the 2013 edition covers eligibility. It is that section that contains a rule so commonly adhered to that it goes unnoticed by most observers: There must be at least seven players on the line of scrimmage at the snap of each play.Of those seven, only the two outside players are eligible to catch a pass. But not only are the two outside players the only ones on the line of scrimmage eligible to catch a pass, they must be eligible receivers.To understand fully what this means, one must understand not only N.F.L. rules but also N.F.L. numbering. What is an eligible receiver? The league requires that all offensive linemen (who are typically the ineligible receivers on the line of scrimmage) wear a numeral ranging from 50 to 79. This rule is strictly enforced: In fact, if a player changes his position, moving from a position as an ineligible pass receiver to one of an eligible pass receiver, or vice versa, “he must be issued an appropriate new jersey numeral” (Rule 5, Section 1, Article 2).AdvertisementFor example, Steve Maneri, a tight end who was with the Patriots until being released Jan. 17, wore No. 86. But when he entered the N.F.L. in 2010, he was an offensive tackle, wearing No. 65 and then No. 68. In 2012, while Maneri was with the Kansas City Chiefs, his official position was switched to tight end, prompting a change in uniform number.Who’s going to win? What color will Katy Perry’s hair be? What about the commercials? Make your Super Bowl picks and predictions and share your ballot with your friends.This is not a situation in which the league makes up rules for bureaucracy’s sake: Defensive players are keenly aware of opposing players’ jerseys, and they mentally note that a player with a uniform number between 50 and 79 can be disregarded as a pass catcher.AdvertisementBut there is an exception that allows a player who would normally be ineligible to become eligible for a particular play; it is how the former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, who wore No. 50, caught 12 touchdowns in his career, including two in the Super Bowl. The exception occurs when the offense declares such a player to be eligible to the referee, who then relays that message to the opposing team and to the fans.To put it all together: On a typical play, a team will have five offensive linemen, all wearing numbers between 50 and 79, lined up directly on the line of scrimmage. Two other players must be lined up on the line as well, and since only the outside two players are eligible receivers, the offense typically places a receiver or a tight end on each side of the linemen.When a team has two or three receivers line up on one side, only one will typically be directly on the line of scrimmage. If, for example, a team lined up two receivers to the right of the offensive line, and had both players on the line of scrimmage at the snap, then the outside wide receiver and the player in the nominal left tackle spot would be the eligible pass receivers.That sort of thing rarely happens because a team would have to declare its left tackle to be eligible on the play, and there is little benefit to making a wide receiver ineligible just to make an offensive lineman eligible. But that is what the Patriots did against the Ravens.
CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times        It began when center Bryan Stork went out with a knee injury in the first half, leaving New England down an offensive lineman. And while inserting an offensive lineman off the bench would be the normal response (and how the Patriots initially responded), for a portion of one drive the Patriots tried something different.New England kept just four offensive linemen in the game. New England then had tight end Michael Hoomanawanui (who wears No. 47) line up in the left tackle position. On one play, the Patriots lined up Hoomanawanui on the line of scrimmage, and placed two receivers to the right side on the line of scrimmage. That made the inside player of the two receivers, No. 34 Shane Vereen, ineligible, leaving Hoomanawanui and the outside receiver as eligible.AdvertisementThe “trick” here is that because Hoomanawanui was wearing the number of an eligible receiver, the Patriots did not need to announce that he was eligible. Since he was lined up at left tackle, the Ravens assumed he was ineligible, but because Vereen was lined up on the line of scrimmage (and not, as the Ravens probably assumed, a yard off the line), it was Vereen, and not Hoomanawanui, who was ineligible.To be fair, the referees did announce that No. 34 (Vereen) was ineligible, but that came just seconds before the snap. Baltimore was unprepared to cover Hoomanawanui, who simply ran straight down the middle of the field; Tom Brady hit him for a quick 16-yard gain. (On the play, Vereen simply dropped back; had he run a route, he would have been flagged.)The Patriots ran the same play later in the drive, and Brady connected with Hoomanawanui for 14 yards. After that, Baltimore Coach John Harbaugh became enraged and picked up an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. But it allowed Harbaugh to speak with the officials for some extra time, and the Patriots never ran that play again.New England got creative against the Indianapolis Colts, too, in the A.F.C. championship game. On one play in the first quarter, New England lined up with only four players along the offensive line and had Hoomanawanui (who was lined up in the slot as a receiver) declared ineligible. This did not catch Indianapolis by surprise — after all, a four-man line screams “trick play” — and Brady’s short pass to the right (thrown where Hoomanawanui was lined up as an extra blocker) fell incomplete.The Patriots frequently sent a sixth offensive lineman, Cameron Fleming, onto the field against the Colts. And while he was often announced as an eligible receiver, the Patriots usually called a running play; after all, the main advantage to having a sixth offensive lineman is that the offense may find it easier to overpower the defense. But New England did have one trick up its sleeve.After setting up the Colts to expect a run when Fleming entered the game, New England sent him in on third-and-1 from the Indianapolis 16-yard line. The Patriots lined up in an obvious running formation, with a seven-man line: all six offensive linemen (including Fleming) and Rob Gronkowski were bunched tightly on the line of scrimmage. Nate Solder was lined up where he always is, at the left tackle spot.But the Patriots placed Fleming and Gronkowski on the right side of the line (before this play, New England had usually placed Fleming and Gronkowski on each side). That meant the two outside (and therefore eligible) players were actually Gronkowski and Solder. And while Solder (who wears an offensive lineman’s number) was announced as eligible, the Colts — expecting the run and seeing him at left tackle — never guarded him.Solder began the play with a quick block as Brady faked a handoff to his running back. A moment later, Brady threw to a wide-open Solder, who rumbled in for a 16-yard touchdown.The Patriots have one of the most versatile offenses in the N.F.L., capable of shifting formations and philosophies at a moment’s notice. But New England’s newest wrinkle was particularly devilish. One downside, however, is that these sorts of plays can surprise only the unexpecting. That means the odds are on Belichick coming up with a new wrinkle against the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday’s Super Bowl.A version of this article appears in print on January 28, 2015, on Page B9 of the New York edition with the headline: Patriots’ Real Trick: Know the Rules.
