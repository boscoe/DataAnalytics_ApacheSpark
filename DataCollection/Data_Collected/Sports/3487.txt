Week 11 scores and highlightsWith the victory, the Cowboys are now only two games back in the N.F.C. East.Romo’s day included several off-mark passes, and two interceptions — one of which was the team’s first red-zone turnover in 17 games — but it also featured his 50th career touchdown pass to Dez Bryant, with broke Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin’s career record for connections between a quarterback and wide receiver.Romo ended up completing 18 of 28 passes for 227 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, with the rainy weather in the first half likely contributing to his early struggles.In all, a rusty Romo was far more effective than Brandon Weeden and Matt Cassel were in his absence. The team went 0-7 after Romo broke his left clavicle in a Week 2 win — its longest losing streak since 1989 — with much of the blame landing at the feet of a lackadaisical offense. But optimism reigned supreme as no team ran away with the N.F.C. East, letting Dallas remain in the running while waiting for Romo to heal.Tempering Cowboys’ enthusiasm, the Elias Sports Bureau reported that a team has never made the playoffs, or even finished above .500, after starting 2-7.Much of the credit for today’s improved showing should go to Darren McFadden, who ran the ball 28 times for 131 yards after working his way through an injured groin this week before declaring himself good to go.The Cowboys’ defense, which found itself on the field far too much during Romo’s absence, got some rest as Romo and McFadden helped Dallas control the ball on offense for more than 38 minutes.With less pressure on them to keep the game within reason, the Dallas defense was able to frustrate Ryan Tannehill and the Miami offense, holding them to 210 total yards. Tannehill did throw 2 touchdown passes, but he also threw 2 interceptions, one of which was returned 12 yards by Rolando McClain for the first touchdown of the day by either team.Now 3-7, the Cowboys will host undefeated Carolina on Thursday, with each game for the remainder of the season being a must-win should they want any chance of making the playoffs.Advertisement
