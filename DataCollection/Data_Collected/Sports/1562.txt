Week 7 scores and highlightsIn a game that pits two of the best teams in the league with losing records against each other, this looks on paper to be a quite favorable matchup for the Rams and running back Todd Gurley, who ran for 146 and 159 yards in his last two games, since the Browns currently have the N.F.L.â€™s worst run defense.The last three games Cleveland has played have been decided by a field goal, but this one could get ugly if the Browns do not find a way to prevent Gurley, who is looking increasingly like the back he was in college, from running wild.PICK: RAMSAdvertisement
