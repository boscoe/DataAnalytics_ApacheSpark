PITTSBURGH — If their game on Thursday were a Dr. Seuss book, Butler and Texas would have taken shots in a house; they would have taken shots with a mouse. They would have shot from here or there; they would have shot from anywhere.They also would have missed. Had they gone to a shooting range, the bullet would have traveled sideways. But No. 6 Butler made enough to edge No. 11 Texas, 56-48, in a Midwest Region game at Consol Energy Center.Over one span, the Bulldogs went nearly 11 minutes between field goals. That could have doomed Butler, of course, if not for the Longhorns’ embarking on a seven-minute drought of their own. It was not until Kellen Dunham, who had a game-high 20 points, drilled a 3-pointer with 1 minute 18 seconds remaining that the Bulldogs could feel confident in the outcome.
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            The Longhorns’ loss extended a miserable day for the Big 12. The conference lost two No. 3 seeds, Iowa State and Baylor, to upsets, and although Texas was seeded 11th in the Midwest Region, it was perceived in many precincts — including in Las Vegas sports books — as the favorite on Thursday.AdvertisementPerhaps that was because of the Longhorns’ conference affiliation, or their enviable talent, or their arduous schedule — only one of Texas’ 13 losses came against a team that failed to make the N.C.A.A. tournament — but Butler (23-10), still vying for respect after all these years, considered it a slight.AdvertisementAs its coach, Chris Holtmann, said, Butler had played big teams like Georgetown and Xavier, but no one that protected the rim like Texas, which led Division I with 260 blocked shots. The Bulldogs are savvy, though, and they countered Texas’ height by taking smart shots to avoid getting caught in transition.What Butler failed to do, for a while, was make those smart shots, missing 15 straight while going nearly 11 minutes without a field goal. Trailing by 26-15 with 4:24 left in the first half after a Dunham 3-pointer, Texas closed on a 9-0 run and led by 30-28 before Dunham swished a jumper that helped Butler regain its equilibrium.Then it was the Longhorns’ turn to struggle, missing 11 in a row — and 13 of 16 — as the Bulldogs offset the temporary absence of their second-leading scorer, Roosevelt Jones, who missed about eight minutes after leaving the court with an apparent leg injury, by getting baskets from the reserve forward Kelan Martin.A version of this article appears in print on March 20, 2015, on Page B13 of the New York edition with the headline: Butler Wins Few Style Points but Defeats Texas.
