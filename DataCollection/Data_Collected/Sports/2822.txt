A short time later, the acting president of the Russian track federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said he was ready to own up to some of the charges leveled in the World Anti-Doping Agency commission’s report on doping in the country. “We admit some things, we argue with some things, some are already fixed, it’s a variety,” he said, declining to provide further details.The governing body of track and field, the International Association of Athletics Federations, is expected to rule Friday on whether to suspend Russia from competition because of the doping scandal. If Russia is barred, its track and field team could be excluded from next year’s Olympics. Advertisement
