MIAMI —  The former owner of a Florida medical clinic who posed as a doctor and illegally supplied steroid injections and other performance-enhancing drugs to professional baseball players and even high school athletes was sentenced Tuesday to four years in federal prison.Anthony Bosch — who choked back tears in court and said the clinic was a legitimate business gone awry — sought a more lenient term because of his cooperation in the investigation, but Judge Darrin Gayles of United States District Court refused his request.“This defendant was the most culpable in this conspiracy,” the judge said.Prosecutors said Bosch could still have his sentence reduced through further cooperation, including potential trial testimony.
                From when Alex Rodriguez broke into the majors in 1996 to his retirement in 2016, he has been unable to escape the bizarre and controversial stories that seem to follow him on and off the field.            Gayles said Bosch had falsely held himself out as a licensed medical doctor at his clinic, Biogenesis of America, where he accepted thousands of dollars a month to provide steroid injections to players such as Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun. Most troubling, Gayles said, were Bosch’s injections of high school players in the Miami area.Advertisement“He was the mastermind,” Gayles said. “He was the one who recruited others to assist him.”United States Attorney Wifredo Ferrer issued a statement saying the message of the case was that “cheating doesn’t pay and individuals like Bosch, who distribute performance enhancing drugs to athletes and, more importantly, to our children, will be held accountable for their actions.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Bosch and Rodriguez are expected to testify if the last two defendants — Rodriguez’s cousin Yuri Sucart and Lazaro Collazo, a former University of Miami pitching coach — go to trial as scheduled.Baseball imposed a season-long suspension last year on Rodriguez, one of 14 players penalized in the scandal.AdvertisementBosch was joined by more than two dozen friends and family members at his sentencing hearing.“I’m ashamed of myself,” Bosch said. “I’m remorseful. I can’t put into words how sorry I am.”A version of this article appears in print on February 18, 2015, on Page B11 of the New York edition with the headline: Bosch Sentenced to Four Years in Biogenesis Case.
