Hardy was suspended with pay for almost all of last season and then suspended for 10 games this year before he appealed, and a league-appointed arbitrator reduced the punishment to four games.Even before the photos came out, prominent former players, including Terry Bradshaw in a nationally televised rant, lashed out at the Cowboys for putting him on the field.Compounding matters, the Cowboys’ owner, Jerry Jones, who signed Hardy this season, has defended Hardy even though the player has shown little apparent remorse. The attention on the case may continue because the Cowboys on Sunday play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whose quarterback Jameis Winston was investigated for rape but not charged, though questions about the investigation remain.Commissioner Roger Goodell was also criticized for his handling of Hardy’s case, but much of the fire this time was aimed at the players’ association for helping Hardy reduce his 10-game suspension.The messy truth, however, is that the league is still struggling to find a consistent way of adjudicating domestic violence cases. The criteria for prosecuting such cases vary widely across the country, and they get thornier when victims do not cooperate with investigations for fear of retribution. Sports leagues are left unsure whether and how to penalize a player who has been accused but not convicted of domestic violence.“The league is seeking a definite in a world where there are so many indefinites,” said Robert Boland, who teaches sports law at Ohio University.Boland views the problem through the prism of the league’s often testy relationship with the players’ association. The two sides have clashed over the league’s personal conduct policy, which Goodell has used to penalize players for a variety of off-field offenses. The union has complained that Goodell’s rulings are inconsistent, and it has helped players appeal their punishments, often successfully.Goodell said in September that he was open to appointing a disciplinary officer to mete out penalties, but that he wanted to have final say over decisions. Any changes, though, would have to happen within the context of the collective bargaining agreement, which does not expire for several more years.The renewed outrage toward Hardy may not lead to further disciplinary action, either.The N.F.L., whose spokesman confirmed that league officials had seen the photos as part of their review of the case, may find its hands tied because if it suspended Hardy again for the same offense, the union would almost certainly take the league to court. The league also cannot order teams to shun a player, because it could be accused of collusion or playing favorites.The union insists that its job is not to defend a player’s conduct but to defend the collective bargaining agreement. By law, unions must represent their members, even those who do nasty things.“We can’t ignore our members,” said George Atallah, a spokesman for the players’ association.Atallah said the union was eager to negotiate changes to the N.F.L.’s personal conduct policy to make it as transparent and predictable as the rules governing the use of recreational or performance-enhancing drugs. “There’s no reason why we can’t have the same thing for the personal conduct policy,” he said.While the league and union struggle to come up with a new formula, players are taking matters into their own hands.Two players on the Philadelphia Eagles, who played the Cowboys on Sunday, said they used “a little extra mustard” when blocking Hardy. “It’s a joke a guy like that is able to play this quickly,” Eagles center Jason Kelce said.The solution may be to create a system of carrots and sticks, according to Boland, a former prosecutor and defense lawyer. The commissioner, he said, should impose stiff penalties but offer players a way to reduce their suspensions if they seek counseling and make amends. That way, the league and union can claim they are tough on players who commit domestic violence but also keen to see it doesn’t happen again.“Roger Goodell has to focus on rehabilitation, not just punishment,” he said. “He needs to come up with a system of severe penalties with some conditions where reinstatement is possible.”Advertisement
