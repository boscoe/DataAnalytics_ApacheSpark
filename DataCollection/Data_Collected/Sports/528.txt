Their opponent that day: the Astros, who are as certain to start Keuchel as the Yankees’ pinstripes are straight.The usual opening day optimism, when every team is undefeated, stands as little chance of blossoming in the Bronx on April 4 as the Yankees’ bats had against Keuchel this season. Keuchel, a left-hander with a distinctive bushy beard, pitched 22 scoreless innings against the Yankees, allowing 12 hits (11 of which were singles) and two walks while striking out 28.Alex Rodriguez, the designated hitter, called Keuchel a left-handed Greg Maddux, who is in the Hall of Fame.Third baseman Chase Headley said: “I go back and watch my at-bats and I don’t know if he threw a ball over the plate to me all night. You have to tip your cap.”On the bright side, after opening day, the Yankees will have plenty of time to take their minds off Keuchel. They will not see him again until the end of July, except perhaps in their nightmares.Advertisement
