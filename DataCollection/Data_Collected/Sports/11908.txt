UNIONDALE, N.Y. —  Driving on the Meadowbrook State Parkway on Saturday morning, Robert Cincotta felt a chill when he saw the exit sign for Nassau Coliseum.“When it’s not there, I’ll cry,” said Cincotta, an Islanders fan dressed in a white away jersey.Three hours before the puck dropped for Game 6 of the Islanders’ first-round playoff series against the Washington Capitals, Cincotta took a photograph in front of the arena’s main entrance, just in case it was the last time he would attend a game there.Many fans followed suit throughout the afternoon, admittedly nervous that Saturday might be the Islanders’ final home game at the arena that, when built in the early 1970s, was described in The New York Times as “shaped like a loaf of bread and rising above a 500-acre wasteland in Mitchel Field.”AdvertisementA small segment of the 16,170 fans in attendance remembered when the spot housed an Air Force base and when, later, the Nets played there while they were in the American Basketball Association.AdvertisementOn Feb. 12, 1972, shortly before the Nets’ first home game at the Coliseum, workers were still installing seats, and they notified the box office whenever the seats became available to sell.Over the last week, crafty Islanders fans have done the reverse, stealing seat cushions as keepsakes of the 43-year-old arena.“As much as I’d like to leave with a relic, I’d like to avoid jail,” said Matt Etra, a Long Island native who was disappointed in the behavior of fellow Islanders fans during the playoffs. In the final games the team plays at the arena before moving to Barclays Center in Brooklyn next season, the fans have been leaving some bad impressions. Capitals fans have reported damage to their cars and verbal abuse. After the Capitals won Game 4 of the series, video replays showed a cup of beer being thrown at Capitals defenseman Brooks Orpik.Etra described the unruly behavior as “a black eye” on the Islanders’ farewell.On Saturday, Keith Cohen was tailgating in a white Capitals jersey. He had driven up from Washington in a van with nine other Capitals fans and said the locals had been “pretty friendly.”Anna Stenberg, a Capitals fan from Sweden, was approached by Islanders fan Pete Mandzych, who wished her a good game.“You should not be abused at an event,” Mandzych said.Fans largely ignored the arena security guards cruising the parking lots in golf carts or the two police officers on horseback outside Gate 15. With the smell of cigarettes and bratwursts cooking on charcoal grills filling the air, and Billy Joel’s “Piano Man” emanating from car stereos, they instead laughed and reminisced about Shawn Bates’s penalty-shot goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2002, or wrote goodbye messages to the arena on their cars’ rear windows.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Maybe that’s me just being hopeful.”AdvertisementAs fans entered the arena, many walked past tables advertising ticket packages for Barclays Center. Their thoughts drifted away from wishful thoughts of future games in Uniondale, giving way to nervous energy and excitement once the Islanders took the ice.Robert Anderson and his 9-year-old daughter, Sara, staked a spot by the glass boards for almost 90 minutes, waiting for the pregame skatearound. Sara sat on a folding chair, holding a sign that she had made with her father, with a quotation from Winston Churchill: “We shall defend the island, whatever the cost may be.”Within the first 40 seconds of the game, the Islanders heeded that advice, delivering four hits on Capitals players against the boards, each one receiving a cheer louder than the last.There were roars of approval when the actress Chloe Grace Moretz was shown on the scoreboard, and an even more raucous ovation when John Tavares scored the first goal of the game at 6 minutes 56 seconds of the first period.After the 3-1 win, the Islanders gathered at center ice to salute their fans.Even with Game 7 approaching on Monday in Washington and the possibility remaining that the Islanders had played their last game at the Coliseum, Robert Anderson said his family’s residual joy would last through Monday, when his daughter could brag to Rangers fans at school that her local team was still alive.“I don’t want to get my hopes up, though,” Sara Anderson said.A version of this article appears in print on April 26, 2015, on Page SP9 of the New York edition with the headline: Good, Bad and Optimistic Make Their Peace With an Arena.
