A controversial call in an N.F.L. game can certainly get Twitter buzzing. Sunday’s replay reversal on a seemingly key catch in the Dallas-Green Bay game by the Cowboys’ Dez Bryant was no exception, as people inside and outside the game were left questioning the rules governing pass receptions.
            Sorry @dallascowboys. We know the feeling: http://t.co/CfC95Nj3Q6. #CompletingTheProcess pic.twitter.com/7xuEA9FH49 
            I by no means cheer for Dallas but I have no idea what or how thts not called a catch . Thts a joke        
            In my opinion that should have been a catch BUT I understand the rules. That rule will be reviewed in the off season I promise you. #Truth

            It's a dumb rule. But thats the way it's been called ever since Calvin Johnson in Chicago.        
            What is the definition of a catch or not in the NFL? I really wanna know? No one can answer the ?        We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
