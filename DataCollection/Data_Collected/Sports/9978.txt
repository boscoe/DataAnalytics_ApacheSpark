PITTSBURGH —  Around North Carolina State’s program, its 1983 national title comes up from time to time. Coach Mark Gottfried makes sure it does. One of his top assistants, Dereck Whittenburg, played on that team, and he, too, reminds the current players of the Wolfpack’s brush with glory.North Carolina State has won some big games since then, upset some higher-seeded teams and enthralled some folks in its basketball-crazed nook of the country, where it vies with behemoths like Duke and North Carolina for attention.Still, none of those victories can compare to what happened Saturday, when the team ousted a No. 1 seed for the first time in 32 years, edging Villanova, 71-68, to upend the East Region of the N.C.A.A. tournament.In sending the Wildcats careening out of contention, the eighth-seeded Wolfpack advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 2012; they will play Northern Iowa or their conference foe Louisville on Friday in Syracuse.AdvertisementWhatever mojo North Carolina State unearthed on Thursday — when the Wolfpack stunned Louisiana State, taking their only lead of the second half with 0.1 of a second remaining — returned in full force Saturday.North Carolina State pummeled the Wildcats in the paint, outrebounding them by 45-32. And the Wolfpack complemented that strong play down low — forwards Abdul-Malik Abu and Lennard Freeman each had a double-double — with dynamic guard play. Trevor Lacey paced North Carolina State with 17 points, and Anthony Barber added 13.“Our size was going to bother them a lot,” forward BeeJay Anya said, “so we went out there to exploit the matchup.”
                For this bracket, the more unusual that your picks are, the more points you’ll receive — so long as those picks are correct.            In its scouting, North Carolina State sensed that the Wildcats were vulnerable inside, that if the Wolfpack could force Villanova’s lethal outside shooters into taking long 2-pointers, or contested 3s, they would be successful.Normally a strong 3-point-shooting team, Villanova capsized as four of its best shooters — Ryan Arcidiacono, Dylan Ennis, Josh Hart and Kris Jenkins — combined to go 0 for 14 from beyond the arc, unable to help Darrun Hilliard, who made six from outside and led all scorers with 27 points. The Wildcats shot 31.1 from the field over all.AdvertisementGottfried had defeated a No. 1 seed in this round once before, in 2004, when his Alabama team ousted Stanford, and he saw a similarity to that squad in his Wolfpack.“I think you have to believe that you have a chance to win,” he said Friday. “Our team this year believes that, as did that team in 2004. You know that comes from playing against great teams. We’ve played good teams. We’ve beaten really good teams.”Among them this season: North Carolina, Louisville and Duke. In the waning minutes Saturday, Gottfried reminded his players how well they had played late in those victories, but Villanova, which trailed by 12 points in the second half, cut the gap to 67-65 on a Hilliard 3-pointer with 41.1 seconds left.Lacey, a dynamo all game, threw away a pass on his own end of the court, giving Villanova possession with a chance to take the lead. Ennis missed an open 3-point attempt, though, and Barber, fouled, clinched the victory with two free throws.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

They were made the No. 2 overall seed in the bracket, behind Kentucky, but have proved unable to build on their prosperity. Villanova has not reached the round of 16 since 2009 despite being seeded first or second in its region three times in its last five tournaments.“We failed here in this N.C.A.A. tournament,” Coach Jay Wright said. “And we just got to accept it, and we’ve got to own it and live with it. But it won’t define us.”For the Wildcats, who made a season-high 63.2 percent of their shots against Lafayette in the round of 64, a correction was, perhaps, inevitable. It arrived early, and it stayed late.What normally makes the Wildcats so dangerous — their ball movement, that propensity for finding the open shooter — abandoned them.They took contested shots and inefficient shots, making two of their first 14 — including one of five from 3-point range — and eight of 28 over all before halftime. As diversified as their offense can be, the Wildcats could rely only on Hilliard and Phil Booth. Their teammates shot 2 of 17 in the first half, and forward Daniel Ochefu, in particular, was stymied near the rim.Advertisement“I don’t think missing those layups or those easy baskets really fazed us,” Hilliard said. “It was just our decision making in taking them.”That was just as North Carolina State intended, with Saturday’s game starting the way Thursday’s finished. That night, the Wolfpack maintained their composure and capitalized on a miserable shooting performance by L.S.U., which missed its last 12 field-goal attempts and final six free throws.The victory energized them, Anya said, and after leading for much of the first half Saturday, North Carolina State entered the intermission on a 7-0 run, a sequence that embodied its superiority.Caleb Martin made a 3-pointer and made a foul shot. Anya then blocked an Ochefu shot, restoring possession, with 3.4 seconds left, to the Wolfpack.Taking the inbounds pass a few steps before midcourt, Lacey zipped down the sideline, created separation by tricking Booth with a behind-the-back dribble and beat the buzzer with a step-back 3-pointer.After watching the ball swish through the hoop, Lacey turned and sprinted off the court, past his teammates and into the tunnel, 20 minutes from North Carolina State’s biggest tournament win in three decades.A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2015, on Page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: North Carolina State Adds to Its Lore by Shocking Top-Seeded Villanova.
