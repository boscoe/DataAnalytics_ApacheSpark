He received $5 million in guaranteed money.Rolle’s departure not only creates a gaping hole at a critical position but also leaves a leadership void. He was a strong supporter of Coach Tom Coughlin, and Coughlin was drawn to Rolle by his intelligence, intensity and willingness to fight through injuries.Rolle, 32, was one of the veterans chosen by Coughlin to make certain he was communicating well with the players. If the coach had a message to be sent, it was often Rolle who delivered it. Yet there is no evidence that the Giants came close to retaining him. He had indicated a desire to stay but also a determination to shop his considerable skills in a push for what would most likely be the last big contract of his career. He never indicated a willingness to accept less money to remain with the Giants.Rolle visited Chicago on Tuesday and was a primary free-agent target for new general manager Ryan Pace and John Fox, in his first year as coach after leaving the Denver Broncos. Pace, in responding to questions about how he wants to build his roster, had said, “We want passionate football players.” Rolle is certainly that.Rolle spent the first five years of his career with the Arizona Cardinals. The Giants moved quickly to sign him after the Cardinals made the surprising decision to release him; he is regarded as one of their finest free-agent additions. He is a three-time Pro Bowl selection who twice gained that distinction with the Giants, in 2010 and 2013, when he made six interceptions. He played a key role throughout the postseason as the Giants made their run to Super Bowl XLVI and defeated the New England Patriots to close the 2011 season.Advertisement
