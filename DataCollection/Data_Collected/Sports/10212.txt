After the cruelty of a 5:30 a.m. wake-up, a ride to the St. George Terminal with her father, a 6:20 Staten Island Ferry, the J train to the M train, Dominique Toussaint finally arrives at Christ the King High School in Middle Village, Queens. From her home on Staten Island, the trip can take two hours.So is it worth it?“This is my future,” said Toussaint, all of 16.With 11 seniors graduating last year from the girls’ basketball team, Christ the King entered this season as an afterthought. Before Saturday night’s Class AA Catholic state championship game, the Christ the King assistant coach Jill Cook reminded the Royals about the prevailing perception: This is a rebuilding year, a transition year. After trailing Archbishop Molloy for three quarters, the Royals looked very much like a work in progress. But a fourth-quarter surge led to a 62-55 victory, and a trip to the state championships this weekend in Albany.Most years, the Royals’ biggest challenge is living up to its past: With 28 league titles, 24 city titles and 15 state titles, there’s barely room on the banner to record this season’s accomplishments. “We haven’t won a state championship since 2010,” forward Kaela Kinder said. “It’s always in the back of our minds. We need to be the team to get the school back on top.”Sixteen years ago I chronicled the Royals for a season-long series for Newsday. Christ the King had graduated its top six players from an undefeated team ranked No. 1 in the nation at season’s end by USA Today; five of those seniors moved on to Division I, including Sue Bird, the most successful point guard the women’s game has seen. Left over were bit players with scant experience. But moderate expectations didn’t ease the blast-furnace pressure. The legacy of the past shadowed that team from the opening tip.Advertisement“I don’t know who we were playing against sometimes, probably the ghost of last year’s team,” the assistant coach Bob Mackey told me at the time. “They were so caught up in trying to replace them.”Advertisement•Decades of research have shown that high school girls who play sports are more likely to earn better grades and have higher levels of self-confidence. Last year, a survey conducted by the EY Women Athletes Business Network of 400 female business executives on four continents analyzed the connection between sports and leadership. Seventy-four percent of those surveyed said a sports background accelerated a woman’s leadership and career potential. That’s all well and good for those in the C-suite, but could the same be said for the group of headstrong girls I met 16 years ago?Clare Droesch was a sophomore and the Royals’ best player that season. Whenever she walked into the gym, fun followed. During study hall, she would rush her teammates to finish their homework, so she could put on a “game tape”: the latest episode of “Dawson’s Creek.” Raised in the Rockaways, the land of firefighters and police officers, Droesch was both carefree and sharp-elbow smart. Her smile had the same ease as her jump shot. All these years later, the smile is still there, if not her jump shot. Before the playoffs began this month, Droesch, now an assistant coach at her alma mater, stood on the court with Cook. She caught a pass and reflexively raised her arms as if to shoot. She didn’t.“I shoulda took the shot,” she told Mackey, now the head coach, the day after her doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center implanted a port on the right side of her chest.Her cancer had come without notice. One mid-December day in 2011, a friend bumped her with a forearm during a pickup game. It was the type of incidental contact that wouldn’t even merit a wince. But this felt different. A few days later, Droesch learned she had metastatic breast cancer, also called Stage IV or advanced breast cancer. It had spread to her lymph nodes, spine and sacrum.“They tell you the worst, which I love, but when my doctor told me I wasn’t going to be here in another six months, my first response was, ‘Yeah, good luck taking me out,’ ” said Droesch, leaning back in a chair in the Royals’ basketball office. “If you’re going to take me down, it’s going to be a hard, hard thing for you to do because I’m not going to give up.“It’s how competitive I am, and because I love family and friends so much I never want them to have to bury me one day.”Initially a clinical trial helped shrink the tumor, but there’s now another active tumor in her spine. “They put me on the harsh stuff again, so I lost my hair again, but it’s growing back,” said Droesch, her spiky shock of blond serving as proof.AdvertisementShe spends at least one full day a week at Sloan-Kettering. During the past three years, she has made (and lost) friends in the waiting room. When she arrives for chemo on Mondays, it’s as if Norm just walked into the bar in “Cheers.” One of her nurses will be at her Christ the King Hall of Fame ceremony in May. Droesch will join Bird and Chamique Holdsclaw, both previously inducted, in this holy hoops trinity.“Basketball has been my medicine through this whole thing,” Droesch said after spending the previous day at Sloan. “Basketball has always been my life, it’s been my passion. I love how much this program means to me. I love that I’m here, at the toughest time in my life. I’m surrounded by people that I know love me.”The promise of spending a few hours each day in the gym gets her through the pain and fatigue. “Honestly, every single day is like a game to me,” Droesch said. “I have to win.”Droesch has not seen her team in five days because of the surgery to implant the port and because of a trip to North Carolina, where she was honored during the Atlantic Coast Conference women’s tournament as one of the league’s “legends.” At Boston College, Droesch carried the Eagles to four N.C.A.A. tournaments and, before they joined the A.C.C., a 2004 Big East tournament title, scoring 1,136 points, with 158 3-pointers. (Foot injuries ended her postcollege career.)To a teenager, five days feels like five weeks. When Droesch arrived at practice after her trip, Royals players smothered her with sweaty hugs. She was swollen from all of the steroids, and her first treatment using the port had stung, but you would never know it. While Droesch was in North Carolina, Cook asked the Royals if they knew what their assistant coach was going through. “They didn’t have any clue,” Cook said. Now they know.“She’s very inspirational,” Kinder said. “She shows up here every day. If she can do it, why can’t we give it our all?”Mackey took over the program in 1999 and has known Droesch for most of her life. “Every day is a struggle,” he said. “Then again, every day is a gift.”Droesch was 16 when I met her and is 32 now. She lost friends in the Sept. 11 attacks, and another when a plane crashed into Rockaway, Queens, shortly after leaving Kennedy Airport. Hurricane Sandy took her family’s house, and cancer has invaded too much of her body. But she is not going down without a fight.She tells health classes here to get mammograms as well as check their family history. Droesch’s maternal grandmother had breast cancer, but she tested negative for the genetic marker. “They said what I got is a fluke, which makes it even more annoying,” she said. Her Christ the King teammates are still in her life. All five starters from that 1999 team played college basketball, and all pursued careers that demand strong leadership skills. After a standout career at Harvard, Tricia Tubridy received a nursing degree at Columbia and is married with two children. Droesch has dinner with Tubridy about once a week and keeps in touch with her other teammates through social media; her handle is Clare Bear. Toni Roker is a police sergeant in Queens. Amy Mulligan is the head coach at New Jersey City University and one of the few women in the country to have coached both men’s and women’s college teams. Before being hired at New Jersey City, she was the head men’s basketball coach at Vaughn College in Flushing, Queens, for three seasons.AdvertisementJessica Burch, the point guard on that ’99 team, is now the dean of students at a middle school in Elmhurst. Burch is also a referee, one of the handful of women in the ranks.Burch does not referee Christ the King games, but during the Catholic championships she refereed the other semifinal. As she sat on a bleacher for the Royals’ game, surrounded by so many memories, she shook her head.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As a point guard, I knew where my players were without even looking.”The Royals have long set the national standard for their sport. In the 1990s, they were one of the few high school girls’ teams in the country to have a major shoe contract and among the first to play a national schedule. Though gender inequity remains the norm on the high school level, the Royals from Queens had a wonderful sense of entitlement. They expected to be treated like the school’s top boys’ program. They refused to settle for less desirable practice times or cheaper uniforms. They were champs. They were a measuring stick not only for how far girls’ sports had come, but also of how far they needed to go.When I was here last, there were no banners in the gym recognizing the team’s achievements. “There is always the attitude that they’re just girls,” Coach Vincent Cannizzaro told me at the time. “Their achievements are not looked at with the same validity as if the boys won a championship. When we first won the federation championship, which is also the year we were undefeated and USA Today national champions in 1990, we all expected the banner to be raised, but it never happened. The girls kind of felt like it was a slap in the face.”At that time, Serphin R. Maltese, the state senator, was the chairman of Christ the King’s board, a position he still holds. Maltese said that part of the reason the gym was not wallpapered with banners was because the school did not want to slight the athletes in other sports. In other words, Maltese didn’t want to embarrass the boys’ program, a powerhouse in its own right, but one that doesn’t match the dominance of the girls.At some point during the ensuing years, banner equity has prevailed. Both basketball teams have their own, as do the softball, baseball, volleyball and football teams.AdvertisementStill, there is a long way to go for girls who play the city game. Last fall, Christ the King’s 1993 championship team was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame. It was the first female team to earn the honor.•Nearly 12 hours after her day began, Toussaint sits on a bleacher after practice. She is not the first Christ the King player to make sacrifices to go to school here. A few feet away, Sue Bird is sitting on a folding chair, being interviewed by a W.N.B.A. camera crew. Growing up in Syosset, N.Y., Bird transferred to Christ the King in her junior year. Instead of making the interminable journey from Long Island, she and her father rented an apartment in Middle Village for two years. “I used to walk to school,” Bird said.The year Toussaint was born, Bird was a freshman at Connecticut. The current Royal only knows the legend of the now famous one. After Christ the King, Bird went on to win two national championships at UConn, three Olympic gold medals, and two W.N.B.A. titles with the Seattle Storm. She is entering her 14th year in the league and will probably play in her fourth and final Olympics in 2016.“Downstairs in the locker room, there’s pictures and articles of her on the wall,” Toussaint said.A producer on the W.N.B.A. shoot approaches and politely asks us to keep our voices down.“Sure you don’t want me in the video?” Toussaint said playfully.“One day,” the producer replied.She just might be right.Kelly Whiteside is an assistant professor in sports media and journalism at Montclair State.
