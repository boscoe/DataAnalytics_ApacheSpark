Redskins (2-3) at Jets (3-1)1 p.m. Line: Jets by 7N.F.L. Week 6 scores and highlightsCoach Todd Bowles seems determined not to let his surprising Jets get ahead of themselves despite their strong start.“We understand that we’ve only played one quarter of the season and all we did was get off to a good start,” Bowles told reporters this week. “We haven’t accomplished anything.”One gets the feeling that if Bowles and not Neil Armstrong had been the first man to walk on the moon, he would have said: “That’s one small step for man. We shouldn’t try to read too much into it.”The Jets’ success has come from an opportunistic defense, and playing at home against the turnover-happy Redskins should keep the good times rolling. If the team wins by 30 or 40, Bowles may even claim to be pleased.PICK: JETSWe’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
