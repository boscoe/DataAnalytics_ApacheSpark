A 7-year-old boy in Chile discovered bone fragments of a previously unknown dinosaur. Named Chilesaurus diegosuarezi — after the country and the boy, Diego Suárez — the new dinosaur is closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex but was an herbivore. Chilesaurus was about the size of a turkey, had unusually short arms, a long neck, a small head and leaf-shaped teeth. Diego found the bones while accompanying his parents, the geologists Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz, as they studied rocks in Chilean Patagonia.A version of this article appears in print on May 5, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Fossil: Child Discovers Unknown Dinosaur.
