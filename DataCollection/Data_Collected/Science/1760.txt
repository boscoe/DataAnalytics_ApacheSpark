Chloroplasts are microscopic structures in plant cells that convert sunlight into sugars to help plants grow. But under harsh weather conditions, these tiny chemical factories may malfunction, damaging the plant. A new study reports that plant cells can target and destroy errant chloroplasts.Jesse Woodson, a biologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences, and his colleagues found that plant cells recognize stressed chloroplasts, mark these chloroplasts with a protein tag and target them for removal. “We could see stressed chloroplasts being sucked into the central vacuole,” he said. The vacuole’s function is to hold cellular waste.Scientists knew that the plant cell’s nucleus sent out occasional signals to destroy chloroplasts, but this is the first time researchers have demonstrated that the cell could target individual chloroplasts. The findings, which appear in the journal Science, could help researchers develop hardier crops that withstand climate change.In the current study, the researchers examined a mutant version of a laboratory plant called Arabidopsis. The mutant makes defective chloroplasts that produce reactive oxygen molecules, which can rapidly damage plant tissue.“It’s very important that once these molecules gets generated that the cell deals with it quickly,” Dr. Woodson said.A version of this article appears in print on October 27, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Botany: Plants Can Target Cell Damage, Study Says.
