No scientific researcher would be likely to undertake such an experiment because of possible health risks, but related research suggests that most people would quickly tire of even a favorite food if it were eaten to the exclusion of all others, and might even reduce their intake far enough to lose weight.Regular commercial potato chips are notably high in sodium, among other liabilities, at 148 milligrams per ounce out of a recommended daily allowance of 2,300 milligrams. Each ounce also delivers plenty of calories — about 149 — as well as about 10 grams of fat. (Plain potatoes, without added salt and fat, are well known as a cheap and nutritious food.)A study of women published in 2011 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that daily presentation of a food resulted in faster habituation and less energy intake than did once-weekly presentation of the same food, whether the subjects were obese or not. The appetite-depressing effect appeared within just a few weeks.A review article on food habituation, published in 2009 in Psychological Review, noted that boredom with taste was one of the two biggest reasons to stop eating; fullness is the other.Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that some people are more resistant to taste boredom than others, and one person whose story was reported in Britain claimed to have eaten virtually nothing but barbecue-flavored or beef-flavored chips for a decade. Scientific confirmation of this feat is absent. question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.Advertisement
