The first litter of puppies ever conceived by in vitro fertilization were born in July, and Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine, which pioneered the feat, released this footage on Thursday.Scientists at Cornell University announced Wednesday that for the first time they had been successful in delivering a litter of puppies conceived through in vitro fertilization.In what was described as a “breakthrough,” the results of the research, which took decades to accomplish, were announced in the scientific journal Public Library of Science ONE and online by the university.The successful multiple, live births open the door for the future conservation of endangered species and for the use of gene-editing technologies that could help scientists get rid of inherited diseases in dogs.The research could also help in the study of genetic diseases, because dogs share more than 350 disease traits with humans, almost twice as many as any other species.Advertisement“Since the mid-1970s, people have been trying to do this in a dog and have been unsuccessful,” said Alexander J. Travis, associate professor of reproductive biology in the Baker Institute for Animal Health in Cornell’s College of Veterinary Medicine.The scientists described two main challenges, such as finding the optimal stage for fertilization of the female dog’s eggs, and simulating the conditions in the lab for preparing the sperm. Ultimately, the team was able to achieve fertilization rates of 80 percent to 90 percent, Dr. Travis said.AdvertisementEventually, 19 embryos were transferred to a host female dog, which gave birth July 10 to seven puppies: five conceived from beagles and two that were a beagle and cocker spaniel mix.Dr. Travis’s team reported in 2013 the successful birth of Klondike, a beagle-Labrador mix puppy born from a frozen embryo in a procedure that used artificial insemination.But the announcement this week is different because it involves a litter and because the multiple embryos were cultivated in a dish and then implanted in the recipient female, Skylar Sylvester, one of the researchers, said in a telephone interview.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
