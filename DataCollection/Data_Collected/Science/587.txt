AccuWeather is predicting good or fair visibility across much of the United States, and with a waning crescent moon, the so-called shooting stars are expected to stand out against a darker backdrop.The Draconids are best seen during the evening, unlike most meteor showers that appear in the predawn hours. They will dart from the head of Draco the Dragon, the constellation from which the Draconids get their name, in the northern sky.But NASA cautions that they are likely to be faint as they move at the relatively slow pace of 40,000 miles per hour. Occasionally, the Draconids undergo outbursts that produce “really dramatic” light shows, said Bill Cooke, the lead for NASA’s Meteoroid Environment Office. But the next one isn’t projected until 2018. That doesn’t mean an outburst is impossible Thursday night, but it is considered unlikely.As with any stargazing, it’s best to get away from artificial lighting. NASA suggests leaving the telescope and binoculars at home, as they reduce the amount of sky you can see. You should also avoid the temptation to look at your phone, whose glowing screen can hamper your night vision.If you miss the Thursday night show, another chance comes later this month with the Orionids meteor shower, on the night of Oct. 21 into the morning of Oct. 22, when NASA is predicting an even better display — about 20 meteors per hour. The year’s flashiest show will come in December with the Geminids, when about 120 meteors will be visible per hour.Advertisement
