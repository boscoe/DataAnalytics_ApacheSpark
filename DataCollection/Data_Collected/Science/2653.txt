Many childhood dreams come to nothing, but here is a chance to make one come true: For the first time in four years, NASA is looking for more astronauts.With crewed launchings of American rockets expected to resume and future missions in the planning stages, the space agency said the job openings would be posted on the federal government’s USAJOBS website on Dec. 14.The annual salary ranges from $66,026 to $144,566. But the right stuff involves more than just wanting the job: Requirements include a bachelor’s degree in engineering, science or mathematics, as well as good eyesight. The application deadline will be in February, with the final selection in May 2017.
                An archivist has released thousands of never-before-seen images from NASA’s Apollo missions.            NASA does not have a target for the number of new astronauts it will select. “Generally it’s eight to 14,” said Tabatha Thompson, a NASA spokeswoman.AdvertisementThey will be joining an exclusive club. Currently, the agency has 47 active astronauts. That is less than one-third the number at the height of the space shuttle program in 2000, and down from 61 in 2011. Still, the uncertain future of a career in space has not proven discouraging.The last call for applications, in October 2011, brought in more than 6,300 applications. In 2013, NASA announced that eight of them had been selected, an acceptance rate of about 0.13 percent.AdvertisementThe odds of getting into Harvard are much higher.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
