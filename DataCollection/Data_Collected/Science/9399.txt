A NASA mission to study magnetic explosions high above Earth successfully launched to orbit on Thursday night.The $1.1 billion Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, consisting of four identical spacecraft, lifted off at 10:44 p.m. on top of an Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.About an hour and a half after liftoff, the four spacecraft detached from the rocket’s upper stage. When fully deployed, they will fly in a pyramid formation to take detailed measurements of the three-dimensional patterns of magnetic fields and charged particles.Scientists want to better understand the explosions, known as magnetic reconnections, that occur as high-speed particles from the sun buffet against Earth’s magnetic field. If a particularly powerful solar storm hit Earth, it could set off a chain reaction that could overload power grids and plunge large regions into darkness.Data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale spacecraft could solve unanswered questions of how the magnetic field realigns and releases energy. That could lead to better computer predictions of when the sun is about to unleash a ferocious fusillade and the damage it might cause when it arrives at Earth.Related: Read more about NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and how a solar storm is like pounding on a toothpaste tube.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
