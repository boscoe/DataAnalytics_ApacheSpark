The launch countdown of a rocket carrying equipment and supplies for the International Space Station was called off just minutes before the rocket was to lift off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Tuesday morning.A launch commentator on NASA Television said the rocket experienced an “actuator drift” issue with the second-stage propulsion system.The rocket — built and operated by Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX — is packed with a payload of more than 5,000 pounds.In addition, SpaceX plans to try an experimental, daring maneuver to land the first stage of the rocket on a floating platform in the Atlantic. The company hopes that the step will lead to reusable rockets, which would greatly cut the cost of space travel.The next launch opportunity is on Friday at 5:09 a.m. Eastern time. The forecast calls for an 80 percent chance of favorable weather.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
