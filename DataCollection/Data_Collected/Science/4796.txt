Q. We know that aquatic mammals communicate with one another, but what about fish?A. Fish have long been known to communicate by several silent mechanisms, but more recently researchers have found evidence that some species also use sound.It is well known that fish communicate by gesture and motion, as in the highly regimented synchronized swimming of schools of fish.Some species use electrical pulses as signals, and some use bioluminescence, like that of the firefly.Some kinds of fish also release chemicals that can be sensed by smell or taste. In 2011, a scientist in New Zealand suggested that what might be called fish vocalization has a role, at least in some ocean fish.AdvertisementIn the widely publicized work, done for his doctoral thesis at the University of Auckland, Shahriman Ghazali recorded reef fish in the wild and in captivity, and found two dominant vocalizations, the croak and the purr, in choruses that lasted up to three hours, as well as a previously undescribed popping sound.The sounds of one species recorded in captivity — the bigeye, or Pempheris adspersa — carried 100 feet or more, and the researcher suggested it could be used to keep a group of fish together during nocturnal foraging. Another species, the bluefin gurnard, or Chelidonichthys kumu, was also very noisy, he found.Advertisement“Vocalization” is a bit of a misnomer, as the sounds these fish make are produced by contracting and vibrating the swim bladder, not by using the mouth. question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.A version of this article appears in print on December 15, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Communication on an Aural Scale.
