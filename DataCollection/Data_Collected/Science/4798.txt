There are many ways to give directions, but some formats are more effective than others, according to a new study.The report, which appears in Frontiers in Psychology, finds that order matters: Identifying a hidden person in a picture is generally easier when a landmark is mentioned first.The study was done in two parts. In the first, the researchers asked volunteers to focus on a human figure hidden in a cluttered image taken from a “Where’s Waldo?” children’s book. The volunteers then had to describe how to find that figure quickly. Most began by describing a prominent feature in the background of the image, providing directions to the figure from there.“Almost always, people were likely to use a landmark as part of their directions,” said Micha Elsner, a linguist at Ohio State University and one of the study’s authors. “And if the landmark was larger than the target object, they were more likely to put it first.”AdvertisementOnly when the target was comparatively easy to find did the volunteers mention it first, Dr. Elsner said.In the second part of the study, the researchers asked 31 participants to listen to directions about the location of human figures on a “Where’s Waldo?” page.AdvertisementGenerally, when participants heard a highly visible landmark mentioned first and the target second, they needed less time to find the object or figure than those who heard the description in the reverse order.A version of this article appears in print on December 15, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Psychology: Giving Directions? Start With a Landmark.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
