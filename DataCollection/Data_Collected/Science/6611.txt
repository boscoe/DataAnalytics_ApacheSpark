When Pluto was demoted from planethood, the trusty mnemonic “My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas” lost its main dish. Teachers and students across the world came up with adjustments. “My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles” was an easy tweak. Others revamped the mnemonic entirely — “Mean Very Evil Men Just Shortened Up Nature” was the offering of Caltech astronomy professor Mike Brown.But there are still those who are rooting for the dwarf planets to be considered actual planets, which would require a new mnemonic. It’s not just that P - for Pluto — would be added back but also C for Ceres, E for Eris, H for Haumea and M for Makemake.
