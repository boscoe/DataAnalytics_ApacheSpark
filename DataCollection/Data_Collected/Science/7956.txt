Economists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology analyzed hundreds of studies in top academic journals and found that only 18 percent of such research used this rigorous method.In contrast, 41 percent of studies outside the United States on how to improve health care used the randomized trial design, as did 86 percent of American drug studies, 36 percent of education studies in the United States and 46 percent of studies of international development economics.Researchers not involved in the study, as well as those at J-PAL North America, which conducted the study, said the figure represented a missed opportunity in an era of rapid change and experimentation in the health care system. J-PAL North America is the domestic branch of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab in the economics department of M.I.T.Health care consumes about 18 percent of the American economy and accounts for about a quarter of federal spending, and experts expressed frustration that efforts to reform the health care system so rarely relied on the most rigorous methods of evaluation.“It’s very low,” said Jon Baron, president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, a nonprofit group in Washington, referring to the main finding. He pointed out that President Obama’s Affordable Care Act had unleashed change across the health care system, including funding experiments to improve how care is delivered and paid for, but that very little of that effort had used the randomized design.“At the end of the day,” Mr. Baron said, “they will have very little definitive evidence about whether these great innovations they are funding are actually working.”Randomized trials are critical because they enable researchers to isolate the effects of a treatment or program, such as a drug or a visit from a home health aide. They ensure that a change was due to the treatment or service and not some other factor.“The beauty of randomization is that it allows you to be sure of the cause,” said Amy Finkelstein, an economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the study.Professor Finkelstein, whose project at M.I.T. is dedicated to increasing the use of such randomized trials, said the approach was rarely used in part because of a perception that it is more time-consuming and expensive. But she said that there were ways to make the method less onerous, and that the failure to use it meant billions of dollars could eventually be spent on programs that do not work.Advertisement
