The division of labor in hunter-gatherer communities is complex and sophisticated, and crucial to their economic success, researchers report.A paper in the journal Philosophical Transactions B looks at two hunter-gatherer groups: the Tsimane game hunters of lowland Bolivia, and the Jenu Kuruba honey collectors of South India.“In contrast to the simple cave man view of a hunter-gatherer, we found that it requires a tremendous amount of skill, knowledge and training,” said Paul Hooper, an anthropologist at Emory University and one of the study’s authors.He and his colleagues found that there is a clear division of labor between Tsimane and Jenu Kuruba men and women.AdvertisementWomen tend to stay away from collecting honey and hunting, because neither is conducive to caring for young children — and because they aren’t given the opportunity to develop these skills, Dr. Hooper said.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
