BhanooBabies do not link the sensation of touch with the object or person touching them until they are about 6 months old, a new study suggests.At 4 months of age, “the sense of touch is still disconnected from other senses,” said Jannath Begum Ali, a psychologist at the University of London. “It is disconnected from visual information and auditory information.”She and her colleagues published their findings in the journal Current Biology.The researchers  tickled babies and evaluated their responses. When 6-month-old infants were tickled on their feet with legs crossed, they were often confused about which foot was receiving the sensation.“If we tickled their right foot, they would perhaps move their left foot,” Dr. Ali said. This sort of mistake indicates the babies are trying to process the sensation as well as the source of the tickle, she added.Four-month-old infants, however, were less likely to be confused when their legs were crossed. They were also faster to respond, a sign that their brains may be processing less information.Adults also make mistakes when identifying the origin of a sensation when their legs are crossed.Earlier studies have found that congenitally blind adults are able to accurately identify touches whether their limbs are crossed or uncrossed. Adults who lost their sight after birth, however, do not have the same ability.Advertisement
