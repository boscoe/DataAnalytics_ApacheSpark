It has been eight years since a computer program “solved” checkers, calculating a strategy so optimal that it guaranteed at least a draw. Now, an algorithm has done the same for poker, producing a winning strategy that researchers say no human can beat in a single lifetime.For computer scientists, poker presents a much more complex challenge than games like checkers or tick-tack-toe, in which every player is aware of every previous move. In poker, players don’t know what cards their opponents have been dealt, making it an imperfect information game. Such a variable, to say nothing of bluffing, makes the game far more difficult for a computer to pin down.But researchers at the University of Alberta in Edmonton developed an algorithm that manages data in unique ways, allowing it to take into account more of the variables. The result is a formula for mostly winning a variation of the game called Limit Texas Hold ‘em.“If the dealer is changing back and forth, it’s possible to guarantee we don’t lose any money,” said Michael Bowling, the lead author of the study. “And if the other guy makes some mistakes, it’s possible we may win some.” (Dr. Bowling has confirmed, as poker players have long suspected, that the dealer holds an advantage.)Dr. Bowling and his colleagues, who published their work in the journal Science, have built a website where anyone can see how the algorithm would play specific hands. Later this month, their poker whiz will take on human challengers at the A.A.A.I. Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Austin, Tex.A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Computing: Software That Knows When to Hold ’Em.
