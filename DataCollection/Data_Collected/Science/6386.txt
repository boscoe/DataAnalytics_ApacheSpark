The changes had been quietly made by a member of the West Virginia board before it adopted the standards in December.Once the extent of the changes — including an inserted reference that global temperature rise “and fall” — became known, they were criticized by local and national science educators, as well as West Virginia parents and environmental activists.The board voted to revert to the original standards, which emphasize the scientific consensus on human activity as a cause of climate change, and will adopt those standards after a 30-day comment period, said Gayle Manchin, the board president and wife of United States Senator Joe Manchin III.“We listened, we learned and, well, I think, grew in our knowledge and understanding,” Ms. Manchin said in an interview. “We all knew at the end of the day more than what we did at the beginning — and that’s what I’d hope for for our students.”One of the two “no” votes was cast by L. Wade Linger Jr., the member who said he had originally called for the changes to add balance to a politicized issue.Climate Parents, a national organization that took an active role in the debate over West Virginia’s actions, applauded the change. Lisa Hoyos, the group’s director, said, “Ensuring students are taught evidence-based facts in their science education is a fundamental principle that the board affirmed today, after veering off course in December in adopting altered climate science standards.”Advertisement
