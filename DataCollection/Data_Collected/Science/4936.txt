This week, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft will make its final flyby of Saturn’s Enceladus moon. The spacecraft has spent 12 years orbiting Saturn and studying its 62 moons. Spinnable maps of the major moons are below.
Note:  Large craters are labeled in roman type and  REGIONS and OTHER FEATURES are shown in italic caps.
After nearly two dozen flybys, Cassini will fly past Enceladus for the last time this Saturday, Dec. 19. Enceladus may be our best chance for finding alien life, as this video explains:
