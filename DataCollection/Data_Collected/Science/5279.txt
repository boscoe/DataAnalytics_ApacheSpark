And they had a chance to enjoy, however briefly, a snowy December denied to the rest of the country.The bears — Kalluk, Tatqiq and Chinook — who were all orphaned at young ages, slid on their stomachs and backs, plunged their heads into the cool powder and wrestled with each other all Friday morning, zoo officials said. The snow eventually melted away in San Diego’s mild weather, with temperatures in the mid- to low 60s.Zoo staff members also buried yams, carrots, melons and beef femur bones in the snow to create a sort of treasure hunt for the animals.“This was a special day for the polar bears, and I could tell they really loved it,” said Susan Purtell, a senior keeper. “It was great seeing them roll around in the snow, showcasing their natural behaviors.”The gift was made possible with donations to the zoo’s Animal Care Wish List program.Need more polar bear?
