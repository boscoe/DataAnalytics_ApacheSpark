Q. Why do many health insurers pay for the shingles vaccine only for people who are 60 or older?A. The reasoning has to do with the special nature of the shingles infection and with how the immune system changes as people age.Shingles is a reactivation of varicella zoster, the virus that causes chickenpox.Aging people produce fewer and fewer of the immune cells that are recruited and trained to fight new infections, so-called naïve T-cells, and so they are less reactive to most vaccines, the National Institute on Aging explains.But those who have had chickenpox still have a supply of the “memory” T-cells they produced to fight the original infection. The vaccine for shingles relies on these cells, making it particularly effective in older people.The vaccine has been approved for those as young as 50, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, but there is no recommendation for routine use by those under 60, because there are no long-term studies showing how long the shot remains effective in people ages 50 to 59.There is solid evidence showing that it remains effective for up to five years in the older age bracket.“Protection beyond five years is uncertain,” the C.D.C. says in its fact sheet on the vaccine. “Therefore, adults receiving the vaccine before age 60 years might not be protected when their risks for shingles and its complications are greatest.”question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.A version of this article appears in print on January 13, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: A Question of Timing.
