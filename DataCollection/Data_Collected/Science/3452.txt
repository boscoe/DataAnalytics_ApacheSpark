For Sébastien Moulinet, a French physicist, the artwork that caught his attention was a photograph of a balloon by Jacques Honvault.The balloon was in the middle of bursting and the way it was fragmenting made Dr. Moulinet, a lecturer in physics at the École Normale Supérieure, think of how to study the way cracks, or what look like rips or tears, spread in a surface under tension.He had also seen videos of weather balloons as they rose to a point in the atmosphere where lower pressure made the helium inside expand and the balloons burst into fragments.So he used high-speed video to record a latex balloon popping in the laboratory and he and his colleague, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia, a theoretician, analyzed the results.As they reported in Physical Review Letters on Oct. 30, the balloons had two modes of bursting. When the balloon was at low inflation and the latex at low tension, a popped balloon split along one or two cracks.But there was a threshold, and after that level of tension in the latex, the number of cracks increased along with the tension, from four at first up to 10 or 40, depending on the tension.Dr. Moulinet is interested in instability in different materials. The balloon splits in a way that indicates a particular kind of instability in which a single crack then turns into others.And the equations that describe the ways that latex under tension fragments will hold true for other materials as well, like glass, where the process of shattering is of practical as well as aesthetic and intellectual interest.Advertisement
