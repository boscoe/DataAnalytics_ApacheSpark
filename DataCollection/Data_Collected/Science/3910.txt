Now researchers report that these ants can also jump forward.A forward leap is probably an even more effective way to dodge threats, said Magdalena Sorger, an evolutionary biologist at North Carolina State University and the study’s author. She reported her findings in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.Although jumping is common in animals like kangaroos, frogs, grasshoppers and humans, it is rarely seen in ants. Only three of 326 ant genera are known to jump. When ants jump backward, they have little control and often land on their backs, Dr. Sorger said. The forward jump, however, allows the ants to aim for a landing site.The species that Dr. Sorger studied, Odontomachus rixosus, belongs to the subfamily Ponerinae and is found in Southeast Asia. Other jumping ants have been found in South America, Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia.It isn’t clear exactly how trap-jaw ants manage to jump forward, though Dr. Sorger has done some preliminary tests.“I do know that they don’t use their front legs at all,” she said. “Somehow they are using hind legs.”Advertisement
