Domestication of dogs has made them less able to reproduce, according to a new genetic study. Small population sizes and breeding for certain traits has led to an increase in amino acid variants, or changes to DNA that alter proteins, in dogs. “Most of these changes to proteins reduce reproductive fitness,” said Kirk Lohmueller, a population geneticist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and one of the study’s authors. He and his colleagues compared the genome sequences of 19 wolves, 25 village dogs descended from indigenous dogs, and 46 domesticated dogs belonging to 34 breeds. Village dogs were more genetically diverse than domesticated dogs, and wolves were the most diverse of all. Domesticated dogs had roughly 115 more deleterious genetic variants that altered proteins than wolves. Dr. Lohmueller and his colleagues reported their findings in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Genetics: Domesticated Dogs Lag in Reproduction.
