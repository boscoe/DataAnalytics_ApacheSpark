Gather around your laptops and smartphones, friends. It’s time for the crypt keepers of our Science department to share some seasonally appropriate stories (spooky alert). You’re not afraid? Hmmmm. Some polls suggest that you are more anxious about what you’ll see here than you care to admit. The Survey of American Fears, published by Chapman University, found that about a quarter of the people it surveyed in 2017 said they were afraid of reptiles, while one in five said they fear insects (a slight decline in each category from last year).Why not test yourself? Scroll down and enjoy the scientific curiosities of things that slither and crawl and fly.We hope that none of these poisonous millipedes make it into your candy bag. But if they do, they at least glow in the dark, so you’ll be able to see them in the midst of the chocolate kisses.Creepy-crawlies that can fly? That’s just crazy.Cannibalism following mating is not uncommon in the spider world. That might be why male nursery spiders developed a trick to reproduce without getting eaten: Entangling females in silk helps them escape their ravenous mates.A lot of people are terrified of snakes. But rats have more to fear.Zombies? Of course. Consider the plight of these undead arachnids. If you can’t get enough of videos like these, enjoy more entries in the ScienceTake series, many of which are not spooky or scary at all. The series, from James Gorman and colleagues, combines cutting-edge research from the world of science with stunning footage of the natural world in action. Advertisement
