Some of the world’s most prized violins were made in Cremona, Italy, in the 17th and 18th centuries by the Amati, Guarneri and Stradivari families. Researchers at M.I.T. wanted to know what accounted for the instruments’ unique acoustical properties.Using technical drawings, X-rays and CT scans of the instruments, the team compared hundreds of Cremona-era violins, conducting laboratory experiments to see how air flowed through the F-shaped holes on the surface. They also factored in the dimensions of other instruments, such as medieval fiddles and lyres.The scientists found that the length of the holes, not the width, and the strength of the back plate had the biggest effects on sound quality.When air escapes a violin, “most of the airflow is coming around the edges” of the holes, said Nicholas Makris, an engineer at M.I.T. and the senior author.Guarneri violins, which were the last produced during the Cremona period, had the most elongated holes, and hence produce the strongest sound. Dr. Makris, whose work was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society: A, said he believed the Guarneri construction was not a matter of design, but evolution.“If you try to replicate a hole exactly, you’ll always have a little error,” he said. The holes most likely grew gradually longer as violin makers tried to replicate the work of their predecessors.A report in the Observatory column on Tuesday about the acoustics of Cremona-era violins referred incorrectly to Nicholas Makris, an author of a recent paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: A. He is the paper’s senior author, not the lead author.A version of this article appears in print on February 17, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Acoustics: Sweetest Violins Explained: Holes Fill In Blanks.
