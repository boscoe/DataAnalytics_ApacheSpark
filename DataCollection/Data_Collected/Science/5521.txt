Turkey vultures use small-scale air turbulence to stay aloft at forest edges, according to a new study.The trick enables the vultures to soar continuously without much flapping, giving them more time to look for carrion.Julie Mallon, an ornithologist at the University of Maryland, and her colleagues call the behavior “contorted soaring.” They observed it most frequently in turkey vultures but also in black vultures.“It looked just like gliding, except that when they are gliding, they are always losing altitude,” Ms. Mallon said.Advertisement“Here, it looks kind of like a kiddie roller coaster bumping up and down.”Ms. Mallon and her colleagues observed vultures at 13 sites outside Williamsburg, Va., relying on only binoculars and a notebook to conduct the study, which appears in The Auk: Ornithological Advances.Turbulence is formed when horizontal air currents hit a barrier, like a tree line, creating the uplift that supports the vulture, she said.AdvertisementVultures also rely on thermals, columns of rising warm air. Ms. Mallon found that vultures were more likely to depend on contorted soaring when the weather was cool and cloudy, conditions not optimal for thermals.A version of this article appears in print on December 29, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Aerodynamics: How Turkey Vultures Stay Aloft for Dinner’s Sake.
