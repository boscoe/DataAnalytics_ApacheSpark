The bright green fuel tanks of the ship Perla del Caribe, 90 feet long, together will carry half a million gallons of liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit. This fuel source can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 15 percent to 20 percent compared with the heavy tarlike fuels used on most ships.CreditTara Pixley for The New York Times1 of 6
