The general answer probably involves the loss of part of the body’s insulation in the form of unwanted body fat, but the answer in any specific case could be far more complicated.Cold intolerance is a frequent complaint among those who have lost a considerable amount of weight. The body’s core has lost a significant part of its protection against heat loss. The problem is usually worse for those who become very thin, especially small women.While someone is losing weight through severe calorie restriction, the metabolism may slow down to protect the body’s heat-producing store of calories, leading to a cold feeling.And anyone who suffers inordinately from the cold, whether thin or not, should be checked for medical problems that can interfere with thermoregulation or slow the metabolism.Such problems include blood vessel disorders, which can impede warming circulation from reaching the extremities; an underactive thyroid gland, which interferes with heat production by slowing the metabolism; anemia, which involves a shortage of oxygen-carrying red blood cells; and problems with the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that normally acts as the body’s thermostat. question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.Advertisement
