Researchers have discovered a circuit in the brains of mice that controls thirst. Turn it on, and the mouse will drink regardless of how much water it has had. Turn it off, and the mouse avoids water.The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest a new role for the subfornical organ, or SFO, an unusual part of the brain already thought to help regulate appetite and fluid retention.Unlike most parts of the brain, the SFO lies outside the blood-brain barrier, meaning it receives significant blood flow. Biologists at Columbia University wondered if that might mean the SFO can determine when hydration is required.To find out, they introduced a light-sensitive protein into the SFO in mice, which contains two sets of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory). Using a laser, the researchers could then turn the neurons on or off.AdvertisementWhen the excitatory neurons were turned on, the mice drank avidly for prolonged periods, consuming as much as 8 percent of their body weight. (The mice showed no interest in other fluids.) When the inhibitory neurons were turned on, the mice reduced their water intake by 80 percent.The results suggest that the SFO serves as something of an internal blood taster, said Yuki Oka, the lead author.Advertisement“We think this SFO is sort of a tongue in the brain,” said. Dr. Oka, who has since moved to the California Institute of Technology. “Because it is exposed to the bloodstream, this structure is in a position to monitor internal states.”A version of this article appears in print on February 3, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Animal Behavior: Leading a Mouse to Drink, or Not.
