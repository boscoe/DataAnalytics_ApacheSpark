Tiny nematode worms called Caenorhabditis elegans have a peculiar reproductive story: Most females are hermaphrodites that make sperm, self-fertilize and produce more hermaphrodites. Males are few, and are known to mate with each other.Now, a new study reports that a variation in a single gene results in male worms with excretory pores that attract the sexual attentions of other males.“Other males copulate with this excretory pore, located on the neck,” said Matthew Rockman, a biologist at New York University.He and his colleagues reported their findings in the journal Current Biology. Although male worms are rare in the wild, they are easily bred in the laboratory.AdvertisementResearchers report that the gene variant, known as plep-1, may somehow be altering the chemical profile of the excretions in a way that makes them more attractive to other males.Copulation often does not work out well for the male that is approached, Dr. Rockman said. Males that mate with the excretory pore of another male usually leave behind a plug that weakens the worm and reduces life expectancy. Hermaphrodites with the variation of the same gene also have a lower life expectancy and do not reproduce as well.AdvertisementNext, the researchers want to learn what it is about a mutation in the plep-1 gene that makes males attractive to other males.A version of this article appears in print on October 13, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Animal Behavior: Gene May Draw Male Worms to Each Other.
