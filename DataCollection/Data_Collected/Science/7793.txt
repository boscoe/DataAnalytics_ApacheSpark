Q. Has anyone suggested piping or channeling water from the Pacific Ocean to the Salton Sea to replenish the disappearing body of water?A. The short answer is yes, said Roger Shintaku, general manager of the Salton Sea Authority in California, a group of five local entities seeking to preserve the increasingly saline lake. But he said that was only one of many solutions proposed over the years to save the lake, which was accidentally formed by a levee break along the Colorado River in 1905 and has become a valuable habitat.The problem with using ocean water to replenish the lake is that current agricultural runoff adds three million to four million tons of salt per year, Mr. Shintaku said. The same amount of ocean water would add about 10 times as much salt. As the water evaporates, the salt would be retained and the lake would become even saltier.Pumping the saltier water out has also been suggested, he said, but it would take an estimated 40 years to stabilize the lake.While numerous solutions are still being explored, the current plan, he said, is not to focus on external water sources, like the Colorado River, the Gulf of California or the Pacific Ocean, but to manage natural and agricultural runoff.The lake is now 50 percent saltier than the ocean, but the incoming water is only about a tenth as salty as ocean water. The less-saline water could be used for habitat restoration, dust mitigation and possibly recreation, Mr. Shintaku said.question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.A version of this article appears in print on February 10, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Bringing the Ocean to a Sea.
