Cosmic dust containing elements like iron, carbon or oxygen plays an important role in the formation of planets and stars. But early galaxies consisted only of gas, and the dust appeared later. Where the dust came from has long been a mystery.After years of searching, astronomers have observed cosmic dust that appears to have survived the hot aftermath of a supernova. The finding was reported in the journal Science.“When a supernova explodes, it forms a bunch of dust” said Ryan Lau, an astronomer at Cornell University and lead author of the new study. “But dust is pretty fragile material. So the question is, who’s to say the dust survives this extremely hot, violent environment? And if it does, how much?”Using infrared images from an observatory aboard a Boeing 747, Dr. Lau and his colleagues located a supernova remnant near the center of the Milky Way with substantial amounts of cosmic dust.“Were seeing a 10,000-year-old supernova, the oldest supernova found with dust inside it,” he said. According to the researchers’ measurements, “about 7 to 20 percent of the dust mass initially formed survived.”The findings suggest not only that cosmic dust in the earliest galaxies could have been formed from supernovae, but that more of the dust survived than many experts had expected.A version of this article appears in print on March 24, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Astronomy: Clues to the Cosmic Dust Mystery.
