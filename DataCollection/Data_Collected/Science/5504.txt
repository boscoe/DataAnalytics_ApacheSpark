A new type of basaltic rock has been discovered on the surface of the moon, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications. The rock is rich in a black mineral called ilmenite, which contains a high percentage of iron titanium oxide and has been found in other lunar rocks. The discovery was made by Chinese researchers operating the Chang’e-3 spacecraft, which landed on the moon in 2013 and was the first unmanned mission there since the Apollo and Luna explorations about 40 years ago. The researchers investigated the surface remotely using spectrometers. Chang’e-5, scheduled to land on the moon by 2017, is expected to bring samples of lunar soil and rock back to Earth.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
