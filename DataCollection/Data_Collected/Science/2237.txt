Bird eggs are fertilized by more than one sperm, a process called polyspermy. Penetration by multiple sperm may be unusual in the animal kingdom, but it is somehow crucial to the development of the bird embryo, a new study finds.“In humans and mammals, you only need one sperm to penetrate the egg,” said Nicola Hemmings, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield and one of the study’s authors. “If there’s more than one, it can be lethal and we end up with the embryo dying.”Dr. Hemmings and her colleagues studied eggs from zebra finches and chickens. They inseminated the finches with low doses of sperm, from one to 15, and compared this result with naturally fertilized eggs, which may be fertilized by 10 to hundreds of sperm.Dr. Hemmings and her colleagues also inseminated chickens with a low dose of sperm: approximately 10,000. Other chickens were inseminated with 10 million sperm.AdvertisementThe researchers found that when few sperm penetrated the egg, the bird embryo was unlikely to survive. They report their findings in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.Exactly why the extra sperm are needed is unknown.“Although the sperm do seem to be required for the embryo to survive, we don’t know how they contribute to the process of fertilization,” Dr. Hemmings said. Extra sperm may somehow support cell cycles necessary for early embryo development.AdvertisementThe research could help scientists develop more successful programs for endangered species in captive breeding programs, Dr. Hemmings added.A version of this article appears in print on November 3, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Reproduction: For Birds, One Egg Meets Many, Many Sperm.
