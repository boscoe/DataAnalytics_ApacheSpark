Even the mundane seems magnificent in space. Between blasting into orbit and planting flags on the moon, astronauts aboard NASA’s Apollo missions had a lot of downtime. Luckily for us, the crew carried several hand-held Hasselblad cameras to capture the less-than momentous moments like shaving and brushing one’s teeth 200,000 miles away from Earth. Now, more than 40 years later Kipp Teague, an archivist, has released thousands of NASA’s never-before-seen images from those space trips on Flickr. The archive comes unedited with limited information about the specifics behind each photo. Here is a selection.Harrison H. Schmitt, lunar module pilot, shaving while on Apollo 17. Ronald E.
