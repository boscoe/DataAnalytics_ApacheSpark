Human domestication may have helped save the wild ancestors of pumpkins, gourds and squash from extinction.Eons ago, wild gourds and squash relied on very large animals to disperse their seeds in dung. Seeds have been found in fossilized mastodon dung dating back 30,000 years.When mastodons and other large mammals became extinct 10,000 years ago, squash and gourds could have, too, said Logan Kistler, a molecular anthropologist at the University of Warwick in England and one of the study’s authors.So how did the plants survive?In a study published in Proceedings of the National of Academy of Sciences, Dr. Kistler and his colleagues analyzed the genomes of 46 modern day mammals — mice to humans to elephants. The smaller a mammal is, they found, the more taste receptors it has for bitterness.AdvertisementThat suggests that smaller mammals have never developed an appetite for wild squash and gourds, which have a bitter taste. “The wild forms of these plants were probably unpalatably bitter and toxic for small mammals,” Dr. Kistler said.Instead, squash and gourds may have found safe haven with humans, who began clearing large areas of land for themselves. These provided favorable conditions at a crucial time for the plants.Advertisement“Any sort of clearing or burned out area,” Dr. Kistler said. “That’s the sort of niche they favor.”An earlier version of this article misstated the number of taste receptors for bitterness small mammals have compared with larger animals. Smaller mammals have more bitter taste receptors than large animals, not fewer.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
