Therapy’s Reach” (Oct. 1) indicates that experts agree the heavily promoted worldwide “ABC” strategy — abstain, be faithful, use a condom — has not stemmed the epidemic. Left unsaid is that this strategy was politically motivated, and never had a chance against a primarily sexually transmitted epidemic.It certainly isn’t news that human behavior is powerfully influenced by the drive for sex, which can overwhelm people’s sense of caution, fidelity and honor. For most, the path of abstinence ultimately ends, and being faithful is a road not taken for others. People often lie about sex, and studies show those who know they have H.I.V. do not always tell their sex partners. So much for A and B. As for condoms, they help, but studies have revealed they’re not always effective, not always used, and not always used correctly.Now that there are drugs that can help prevent H.I.V. transmission, the World Health Organization appears to see the problems with ABC and is promoting guidelines that would “increase by nine million the number of people who should get treatment and untold millions the number who should get protective doses.”Untold millions translates to untold billions in costs, unless pharmaceutical companies are willing to dramatically reduce prices. At the same time, there are less expensive approaches to prevention, including extremely low-cost rapid H.I.V. tests — less than $1 — that can people can use at home to test themselves and find out the H.I.V. status of sex partners. It’s time to move past our ABCs.Elliott Millenson Potomac, Md.The writer was the founder and chief executive of the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary that developed the first home test for H.I.V.­Science Times welcomes letters, comments on nytimes.com and social media posts from readers.
