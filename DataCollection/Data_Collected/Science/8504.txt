CreditJames McDivitt/NASA, via Bloomsbury Auctions        Hundreds of photographs from the early years of the space age are for sale. That includes the first image taken from space — from an altitude of 65 miles by a camera on a V-2 rocket launched from the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico on Oct. 24, 1946. (The boundary to outer space is generally placed at 100 kilometers, or 62.1 miles.)The prints are vintage — dating from that era, not modern reproductions — and come from the collection of a single European collector, said Sarah Wheeler, head of photographs at Bloomsbury Auctions in London. The more than 1,100 photographs, to be auctioned Thursday, are expected to fetch $750,000 to $1 million.Some are iconic NASA photographs, like Apollo 8’s “Earthrise,” which shows our planet floating above the lunar horizon, and Buzz Aldrin’s boot print in the moon’s soil, taken during the Apollo 11 mission.But others were never widely distributed by NASA, and although some have been available on the web, the images are still unfamiliar to most. That includes a selfie taken by Mr. Aldrin in 1966 as he was floating in orbit during a Gemini 12 spacewalk.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2015, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: When the Space Age Was Young.
