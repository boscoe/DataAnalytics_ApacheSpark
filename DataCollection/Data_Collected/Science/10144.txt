Now, researchers have concluded that the green light emitted by some species attracts insects that help spread the mushroomâ€™s spores. Their study, published in Current Biology, also finds that the bioluminescence is regulated by a temperature-controlled circadian clock, which probably helps the mushrooms conserve energy. Of more than 100,000 known fungal species, only 71 are known to produce light, making them one of the rarest bioluminescent organisms.Advertisement
