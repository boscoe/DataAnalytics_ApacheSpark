A moth has 10 billion hairs, while the human head has only 100,000.An unusual new study looks at 27 mammalian and insect species to determine how animals use their fur and hair to keep themselves tidy.“It is two-sided,” said David Hu, a mechanical engineer at Georgia Tech and an author of the study, published in The Journal of Experimental Biology. “With hair, animals become a doormat to particles. But on the positive side, it lets an animal clean itself.”Dogs shake themselves, loosening dirt from their fur. Bees rely on bristled appendages to brush away pollen.Fruit flies toss dust off with their heads and thoraxes. “The hairs are just flicking these particles into the air right and left,” Dr. Hu said. “Like catapults.”Some animals keep clean with less effort, Dr. Hu and his colleagues found.Cicadas have sharp, hairlike points on their wings that catch and hold bacteria. Nanostructures on the wings stretch the cell membranes of the bacteria, causing them to pop like water balloons.The research could help scientists develop cleaning components for autonomous devices, Dr. Hu said.Advertisement
