The National Center for Health Statistics reports that the number of births in 2014 — 3,988,076 — was 1 percent higher than in 2013.Among the data published last week is some good news. The teenage birthrate fell 9 percent, to 24.2 per 1,000, and the birthrate for unmarried women declined for the sixth straight year.“For younger women, there has been a general decline,” said the lead author of the report, Brady E. Hamilton, a statistician with the center. “But teens are unique, because they are the focus of programs and policies.”Since the long-term decline in teenage births began in 1991, the rate has gone down by 61 percent.The cesarean delivery rate declined to 32.2 percent, the largest drop since the N.C.H.S. began collecting data. “We’ve had tiny declines in the past, but this year’s is big,” said Michelle J.K. Osterman, a health statistician with the center and one of the report’s co-authors.AdvertisementAlthough preterm births declined slightly, low birthweight (under five and a half pounds), a leading cause of infant mortality, remained unchanged at 8 percent.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

But the number of triplet and higher-order births declined by 5 percent. Ms. Osterman attributed the decline to new regulations limiting the number of embryos that can be implanted in fertility procedures.AdvertisementThere were some variations in birthrate by race and ethnicity. While births among white, black and Hispanic women all rose 1 percent, the number of births among Asian and Pacific Islanders went up 6 percent, and among American Indian and Alaskan Natives declined 2 percent.Rates rose among women ages 25 to 44, and declined among the 10-to-14 and 45-to-49 age groups. There were 743 births to women older than 50, up from 677 in 2013.Dr. Hamilton noted that the annual report had its limitations.“Our data comes from birth certificates. It has a lot of strengths, and we can focus on small groups and small geographic areas,” he said. “But it’s limited by attitudinal bias. What people were thinking, how they use contraception and so on can only be found out with surveys. Our data doesn’t give us that.”A version of this article appears in print on December 29, 2015, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: 3,988,076: The Number of U.S. Births in 2014.
