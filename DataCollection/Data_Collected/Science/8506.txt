The hypothesis has its proponents, but there has been scant evidence to support it.Now, an expansive study of marine animals suggests that Cope’s rule may hold true, at least for life underwater.Researchers at Stanford University spent four years combing through fossil records dating to the Cambrian Period 542 million years ago, ultimately compiling a data on body sizes for more than 17,000 genera of marine animals.The scientists found that the minimum body size for marine animals has decreased by only 10 percent over that time, while maximum body size has increased by a factor of 100,000. Over all, mean body size has increased 150 percent, the researchers reported.“For a long time, people have had this hypothesis that there’s not much directional trend in evolution, that random events and random drift can produce increasing size or complexity,” said Dr. Noel Heim, a paleontologist at Stanford and lead author of the study. “That model just isn’t compatible with the trends we see.”There are several reasons evolution might favor larger body size, said Dr. Heim and his colleagues, whose findings appeared in the journal Science. Larger animals tend to have faster metabolic rates, allowing for more active lifestyles, and a variety of sizes could reduce competition for particular foods and other resources.“Oceans have also become more oxygenated over time,” he said, “which allows animals to get bigger.”Advertisement
