Forests cover the mountainous Triangle Lake valley of the Oregon Coast Range, but that was not always the case, researchers found. Sediment samples from 200 feet below the surface of Little Lake, the remnant of an ancient lake that was much larger, show that frosty meadowlands and patchy subalpine forest predominated in the region during the last ice age, 26,000 to 13,000 years ago. The primary cause of erosion then was not rainfall but frost cracking. Erosion rates were at least two and a half times higher than today’s rates, according to the researchers, who published their study in Science Advances. Parts of the United States not covered by glaciers during the period, from Oregon to Georgia, may have resembled southeastern Alaska, they said.A version of this article appears in print on December 1, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Geology: Bottom of Lake Reveals World Above.
