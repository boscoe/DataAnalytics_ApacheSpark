The skies were mostly clear on Friday, but wind gusts that could have blown the rocket into the launch tower stopped the countdown.Another attempt will be made on Saturday during a 30-minute window starting at 5:10 p.m. Eastern time.The rocket is operated by Orbital ATK, one of two companies that NASA has hired to ferry cargo to the space station.Orbitalâ€™s last mission, in October last year, ended in a fiery explosion after a failure of one of the engines in the Antares rocket. This time, Orbital is planning to launch its unmanned Cygnus cargo spacecraft atop an Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance.Advertisement
