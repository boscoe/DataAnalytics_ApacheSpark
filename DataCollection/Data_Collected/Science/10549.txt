BhanooA type of phytoplankton important for carbon storage in marine environments is declining in the Southern Ocean, possibly because of climate change, researchers reported in Geophysical Research Letters. Emiliania huxleyi secretes a calcite shell, helping transport carbon dioxide from the surface into the deeper reaches. From 1998 to 2014, there was about a 4 percent reduction in the calcification rate during the summer months in the Southern Ocean.Advertisement
