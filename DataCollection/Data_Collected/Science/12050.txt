BhanooScientists measure electric fields in thunderclouds with instruments aboard airplanes and weather balloons, but during violent conditions these methods can be difficult, even dangerous.Now researchers may have found a better way to measure these electrical fields: the cosmic rays that originate from exploding stars.When cosmic rays hit the Earth’s atmosphere, they create a shower of high-energy particles. Researchers in the Netherlands measured the radio emissions generated by these showers and found that they varied markedly during fair weather and thunderstorms. The differences may provide an effective way to estimate the electric field in a thunderhead.Monitoring a cloud’s electric field is important because it helps define the power of a thunderstorm, said Heino Falcke, an astrophysicist at Radboud University and one of the study’s authors.“Only if the electric field is strong enough, you have enough power to get lightning going,” Dr. Falcke said. “This is like measuring the horsepower of a car, or the tension of the bow of an archer.”Dr. Falcke and his colleagues took their measurements using the LOFAR radio telescope in the Netherlands and published their findings in the journal Physical Review Letters.It’s possible that the cosmic rays themselves are somehow involved in causing lightning, Dr. Falcke noted.“How lightning is initiated is not at all clear yet,” he said. “Studying this, we might be able to better predict lightning, understand what exact conditions cause lightning, and perhaps gain practical tips to protect ourselves better.”Advertisement
