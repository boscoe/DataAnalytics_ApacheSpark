Tompkins Square Park, Manhattan, Dec. 16Everyone knew it was December but it seemed in name only. There were lots of people in T-shirts sans jackets, joggers in shorts and even a few people enjoying an ice cream bar. The park itself was filled with the gray sprawling limbs of bare trees, with the exception of one tree that was holding on to its golden leaves of fall, and in a surreal contrast, red and pink roses were everywhere. It made for a magical feel to the park that was reflected in the lighthearted and cheerful mood of those lucky enough to be there that day.CreditJoe Bachner1 of 19

Last week, it seemed like winter might never come.Then some warmer parts of the United States were socked by deadly winter storms. New York saw some frigid precipitation, with temperatures that almost made it easy to forget the T-shirt weather that teased us into imagining that we woke up in the Earth’s Southern Hemisphere. Now, some forecasts see cooler temperatures ahead.We weren’t the only living things fooled by the warm weather. All around, fall flowers performed encores on nature’s stage, and some species that bloom in the spring got an early start. Many Times readers captured the bright scenes they witnessed in nature. While some of these plants put on shows in winter months, the warm weather certainly made more people pause and take note of what was coming to life around them. Here is a collection of their photos and the descriptions of what they saw.
