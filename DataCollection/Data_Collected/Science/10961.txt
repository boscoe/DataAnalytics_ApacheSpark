The journey, long suspected but only now documented, is one of the longest overwater flights made by a songbird. Recording the migration was a challenge because of the tiny size of the birds, which typically weigh about half an ounce. In a study published in the journal Biology Letters, researchers attached miniature geolocators about the size of a dime to the backs of 40 warblers to confirm the migration route.Advertisement
