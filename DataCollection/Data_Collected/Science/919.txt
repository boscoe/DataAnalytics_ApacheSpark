A majority of the astronomy faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, have called for their colleague Geoffrey Marcy, a famed hunter of planets circling other stars, to step down from being a professor after he was found in a university investigation to have sexually harassed students.More than 20 current and emeritus members of the faculty, which Dr. Marcy has been part of since 1999, said in a letter posted online Monday that he should go. “We believe that Geoff Marcy cannot perform the functions of a faculty member,” the letter said.But the university administration, which placed him on probation over the summer after an investigation without announcing the decision, defended its approach, saying it left Dr. Marcy on a very tight leash and vulnerable to immediate dismissal if he violated his probation.“The university has imposed real consequences on Professor Geoff Marcy by establishing a zero-tolerance policy regarding future behavior,” said the statement, issued on Tuesday by the office of Janet Broughton, Berkeley’s vice provost for the faculty.AdvertisementFiring him, the university said, would have required a lengthy process including hearings before the faculty, “in which outcomes are uncertain.” Dr. Marcy, the school said, has now waived his right to those procedures.AdvertisementDr. Marcy has gained fame and mention as a possible Nobel Prize winner as a hunter and discoverer of planets around other stars. But he has been trailed over the years by complaints about harassment, according to people who have known him.In June, after a confidential investigation triggered by formal complaints by four former students, the university determined that he had engaged in inappropriate behavior, including groping students, kissing them and touching or massaging them. Two of the complainants have since left astronomy.Dr. Marcy was informed that another harassment violation would leave him subject to immediate suspension or dismissal — a decision that was not common knowledge until BuzzFeed News broke the story last week.
                The letter was signed by more than 20 faculty members.            On the eve of its release, Dr. Marcy posted an apology on his website, disagreeing with some aspects of the harassment complaints, but saying he took responsibility. “It is difficult to express how painful it is for me to realize that I was a source of distress for any of my women colleagues, however unintentional,” he said, adding that he had taken steps to change.Many astronomers in and out of Berkeley, however, were not satisfied with the university’s response, and they worried that the university was more interested in circling the wagons and protecting its star than in addressing the suffering of victims of sexual harassment.Their fears were reinforced when an email went around to the astronomy department on Friday from the interim director of the department, Gibor Basri, that said, in part, “Of course, this is hardest for Geoff in this moment.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Twenty-three active and retired members of the astronomy department signed the letter.A group of graduate students in the Berkeley department issued their own statement Monday, denouncing Dr. Marcy’s actions and the university’s handling of the affair so far.Advertisement“The university’s failure to impose meaningful consequences on Geoff Marcy — offering instead vague threats of future sanctions should the behavior continue — suggests that Berkeley’s administration values prestige and grant money over the well-being of the young scientists it is charged with training,” the statement said. A link to it and another letter signed by 32 postdoctoral researchers at Berkeley was posted to the Astronomers Facebook page by Jeffrey Silverman, an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin.The postdoctoral researchers urged the department to terminate its association with Dr. Marcy. “We believe,” they added, “that U.C. Berkeley and the astronomy department must transform their policies and practices toward sexual harassment. The first step we suggest would be public statements by the department and university that affirm the bravery and strength of the complainants and condemn Prof. Marcy’s behavior.”An online petition supporting the women who spoke out and declaring that “sexual harassment has no place in our community” has garnered more than 2,000 signatures.Outside of Berkeley, astronomers were still reeling and trying to reconcile the new revelations with their own experiences of Dr. Marcy. The effects of this scandal on the exoplanet field, which has emerged as the most dynamic area of astronomy in the last two decades, are not clear.“The stakes couldn’t be higher,” said David Charbonneau, an exoplanet researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. If a top exoplanet researcher is “a routine harasser,” he explained, it would jeopardize gender parity in one of the fastest-growing fields in physical science.A version of this article appears in print on October 14, 2015, on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Berkeley Faculty Call for Firing of Astronomer Found Guilty of Harassment.
