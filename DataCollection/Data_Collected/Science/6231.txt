The Dawn probe is in a low-altitude orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt.
Sept. 30 A spinnable map of Ceres, with prominent features named. The false-color map highlights differences in surface composition and was assembled from images taken by the Dawn spacecraft in August and September.Sept. 9 A composite image of Occator Crater reveals more details of the bright patches known as Spot 5, which are thought to be reflective ice or salt. This image was taken from 915 miles above Ceres.June 14 A conical mountain, about three miles high, is silhouetted against black space in this image taken from 2,700 miles above the surface of Ceres.June 9 A group of bright patches, collectively known as Spot 5, are scattered across the floor of a broad crater.June 6 A conical mountain, at right, rises about three miles above the dwarf planet’s surface.June 5 Raking sunlight highlights the texture of the dwarf planet, including a large crater, at lower left, in Ceres’s southern hemisphere. This image was taken from a low altitude of 2,700 miles.May 7 The cratered surface of Ceres seen from an altitude of 8,400 miles.May 6 Ceres and its bright spots photographed from 8,400 miles away.May 3–4 Dawn photographed Ceres from orbit, 8,400 miles up. The bright patches are thought to be sunlight bouncing off of ice or another reflective surface. The spacecraft is descending to a lower orbit and will begin a close study of Ceres in June.April 24–26 Dawn photographed Ceres from a distance of 8,500 miles, a day or two after its first circular orbit around the dwarf planet.April 14–15 The two unexplained bright features known as Spot 5 emerge into sunlight at far right. Dawn was 14,000 miles away when it took these images looking down at the dwarf planet’s north pole.MarsEarthDawnlaunchedSept. 27,2007SunVestaDawnArrival at Ceres: March 6, 2015MarsEarthDawnlaunchedin 2007SunVestaDawnArrival at CeresMarsEarthSunDawnlaunched2007VestaDawnArrival at CeresMarsEarthDawnlaunchedSept. 27,2007SunVestaDawnArrival at Ceres: March 6, 2015A Spiral Trajectory Dawn has made a long spiral through the inner solar system, flying by Mars and visiting the protoplanet Vesta. The spacecraft entered orbit around Ceres in March. April 10 After spending a month on the dark side of Ceres, Dawn photographed the crescent north pole of the dwarf planet from a distance of 21,000 miles.March 1 Dawn’s view of a crescent Ceres, five days before the spacecraft went into orbit around the dwarf planet.Feb. 19 An image from about 29,000 miles away shows that the brightest spot on Ceres has a smaller companion. The two bright features are collectively known as Spot 5 and appear to be inside a large crater.Feb. 19 Two images of Ceres from about 29,000 miles away.Feb. 12 Two images of Ceres from about 52,000 miles away.Feb. 4 Dawn photographed Ceres from about 90,000 miles away.Jan. 25 Dawn photographed Ceres from a distance of 147,000 miles. At the time this was the sharpest image ever taken of the dwarf planet, surpassing images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2004.Jan. 13, 2015 Dawn watched Ceres turn for an hour, from a distance of 238,000 miles.Dec. 1, 2014 Ceres appears as a small dot in this image, which was taken when Dawn was about 740,000 miles away.Ceres by Hubble The Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of Ceres in January 2004. Ceres is roughly the size of Texas and is the largest object in the asteroid belt.Visiting a dwarf planet An artist’s concept of the Dawn spacecraft arriving at Ceres. Fuzzy images from the Hubble Space Telescope hint at a rocky and icy surface. Researchers think that Jupiter’s gravity prevented the dwarf planet from accumulating enough mass to form a large planet.Dawn at Vesta Dawn arrived at the giant asteroid Vesta in 2011 and spent 14 months orbiting and studying the protoplanet. Vesta is the third largest object in the asteroid belt.Sources: NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Images by NASA/JPL and the Dawn mission team, except where noted.
