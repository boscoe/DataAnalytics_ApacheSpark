Many universities have decided to drop fossil fuel stocks from their investment portfolios, but the New School in New York City has decided to go a step further.The eclectic, historically progressive school said not only would it divest itself of all fossil fuel investments in coming years, but it is also reshaping the entire curriculum to focus more on climate change and sustainability.The school, which has a strong emphasis on the field of design, sees opportunities in meeting the challenge of climate change and economic growth, said Joel Towers, executive dean of Parsons the New School of Design.“What we’re trying to do here is to get students and faculty to think differently about climate change, and look at it as an opportunity to design the future differently,” he said.AdvertisementThat can mean something as seemingly small as creating processes for making clothing that minimize waste and transportation of materials, or planning urban environments that are more resilient and attuned to extreme weather events, he said.AdvertisementThe school will study its own facilities to find ways to reduce its carbon footprint and save energy costs, and reduce paper use and waste. And it plans to promote environmentally sensitive food services through such measures as working with small-scale suppliers in the Hudson Valley. The school has consulted with Bill McKibben, the writer and environmental activist, on its initiative.Climate change, said the New School’s chief operating officer, Tokumbo Shobowale, is “a wicked design problem.” Shifting the curriculum across all of the school’s disciplines, he said, is a way to go beyond divestment, a step that he said drew skepticism at first from many faculty members.“A lot of people said this is not going to make a difference in terms of hurting these companies or hurting their ability to conduct oil and gas exploration,” he said about the divestment plan.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The Harvard president, Drew Gilpin Faust, has said divestment is neither “warranted nor wise” and that the endowment “is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.”The New School sees things differently, said Michelle DePass, dean of its Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy.She said that the ultimate goal of the program was to transform all 14,000 students, faculty members and staff into “fully aware, service-oriented climate citizens.”AdvertisementWhile such goals are easy to envision for students in public policy and environmental studies, she said that drama students could be encouraged to create works that touched on issues of climate resiliency.A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2015, on Page A13 of the New York edition with the headline: The New School Divests Fossil Fuel Stock and Refocuses on Climate Change.
