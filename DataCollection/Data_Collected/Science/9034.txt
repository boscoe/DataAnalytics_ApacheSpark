Researchers with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had suggested last year that an El Ni単o was likely but that it would probably be weak.El Ni単o conditions can bring more rain to California, but the researchers said this one was so weak that even though it could last into summer, it would provide little or no relief for the state, which is in the throes of an extreme drought. However, they said, the Gulf Coast may experience more precipitation than normal this spring.Advertisement
