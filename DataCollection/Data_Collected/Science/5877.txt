There are three possible explanations, two of them connected to alteration of autumn’s normal sequence of light and temperature changes, said Dennis Wm. Stevenson, the vice president for botanical research at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.“Color change and leaf fall in temperate-climate plants are determined primarily by the increasing length of the night,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Usually, this is accompanied by cool nights and low humidity.”Because there was an unusually warm fall in the northeastern United States, he said, the annual leaf cycle may have been “disrupted to the point where the normal response was overridden and thus winter caught the otherwise green leaves,” leaving them on the branches.A second explanation, he suggested, is that a new source of night light, like a streetlight, could have shortened the darkness of the night, so the leaves would not change color and would eventually just dry out and turn brown because of temperature change and lowered humidity. This effect can sometimes be seen on just the side of a tree nearest to a light source, he said.Finally, Dr. Stevenson said, it is possible “that the tree actually died, which will be tested this spring if the plant fails to produce new foliage.”question@nytimes.comAdvertisement
