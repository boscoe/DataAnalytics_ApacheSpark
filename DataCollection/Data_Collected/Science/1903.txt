Geysers of water vapor and ice are erupting from cracks near the south pole of Enceladus and spreading out around Saturn to form a diffuse band known as the E ring. If there is life in the ocean underneath the surface of Enceladus, microbes could be going along for the ride into space. A future mission, suitably equipped, could study or capture them.CreditNASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute1 of 4

Like a kid running through a sprinkler on a summer day, the Cassini spacecraft zipped through a plume of water and ice spurting from Saturn’s moon Enceladus on Wednesday. The plumes are believed to come from an underground ocean that planetary scientists say could have the right conditions for the existence of life.The Cassini mission, a joint United States-European effort that launched in 1997, will come to an end in 2017. Although the probe will complete one last flyby of Enceladus in December, it will be at a considerably greater distance than this week’s pass, when it flew within 30 miles of Enceladus.Cassini beamed back these images from its flyby. What will not be available for several months is an analysis of data collected by the spacecraft’s instruments, including whether Enceladus’s plume contains molecular hydrogen. If its presence were confirmed, it could offer further evidence of the kind of hydrothermal activity in the moon’s ocean that might make it hospitable for life.Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the remaining time of the Cassini mission. It will come to an end in 2017, not in December.
