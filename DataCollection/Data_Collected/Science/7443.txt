 Q. What is the evidence for periods of global warming in the past? A. There are many kinds of evidence for past periods of warming (and cooling), according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research. These include geological records from the ancient environment, like the growth and retreat of glaciers, fossilized plant pollen, ice core data showing the relative prevalence of different isotopes of elements, tree rings, and the distribution of fossils.For example, cores of ancient ice extracted from great depths in frozen regions like Greenland and Antarctica hold layers much like tree rings in which two isotopes of oxygen can be measured. In the 1960s, it was discovered that Earth’s surface temperature could be estimated by comparing the ratio between the quantities of the two isotopes, which change with temperature but are unaffected by the passage of time.The same cores of ice can be studied for traces of layers of volcanic ash, another indirect indicator of temperatures.Government scientists say the current warming trend is different from previous ones, notably in its rate, which is much faster than those of the interglacial warming periods over the last million years.question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.A version of this article appears in print on February 3, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Tracking Earth’s Temperature.
