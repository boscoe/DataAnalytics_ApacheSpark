BhanooFor decades, researchers have debated whether a major asteroid strike or enormous volcanic eruptions led to the demise of dinosaurs almost 66 million years ago. According to a new study, the answer might be somewhere in between: The asteroid impact accelerated the eruptions of volcanoes, and together, these catastrophes led to the mass extinction.“The community is divided between whether one was the more important or more relevant cause,” said Paul Renne, a geochronologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and one of the study’s authors. “What we are saying now is that it may not be realistic to view them as competing effects.”He and his colleagues reported their findings in the journal Science.For their research, they collected about 700 rock samples from the Deccan Traps, a geological feature in India caused by vast floods of lava. The basalt formation covers more than 200,000 square miles and is more than a mile thick in some places.“What we were really trying to do was sample from the bottom of the traps through the top,” Dr. Renne said.They shipped these samples back to Berkeley, and with a process called argon-argon dating, they determined that the eruptions that formed the Deccan Traps started doubling in output within 50,000 years of the asteroid impact that preceded the dinosaur extinction.“What we think is that the impact may have somehow accelerated those eruptions,” said Mark Richards, a geophysicist at Berkeley and an author of the study.Exactly how is unclear, though the researchers have some theories.“There may have been a major change in permeability of the crust, causing magma to flow much more freely after the asteroid,” Dr. Renne said.Advertisement
