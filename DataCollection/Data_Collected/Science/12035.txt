They poke around frantically in the lawns for a few minutes, then leave all together. What could they be eating?A. Starlings eat a lot of things, including fruits, grains, seeds and garbage, but one of their favorite foods is the larva of the European crane fly, Tipula paludosa, which feeds on the roots of grasses. Starlings are known to form flash mobs and attack infested turf in a feeding frenzy.The familiar starling and the crane fly, which resembles a large mosquito and is also known as the leatherjacket, are introduced species. The crane fly was probably imported accidentally in infested potting soil, but the bird, Sturnus vulgaris, was brought to North America on purpose.All the millions of starlings in North America are believed to be descended from a few birds released in Central Park in the 1890s in a romantic attempt by the amateur biologist Eugene Schieffelin to populate the United States with every bird mentioned by Shakespeare.Schieffelin and others may also have hoped that the energetic feeding habits of starlings would make them useful in pest control, but the jury is out. In one study in Washington State, starlings feasted on crane fly larvae but reduced the total by only 7 percent, though other studies have found them to be locally effective. question@nytimes.comquestion@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.Advertisement
