Variegation, in the form of the familiar dark and light patterning of leaves in some plants, results from variation in the presence or absence of chloroplasts, the bodies in a cell that use the green pigment chlorophyll to produce sugar through photosynthesis.A common cause of variegation is that a leaf can have more than one kind of genetic makeup in cells in the same tissue system, making the plant what is called a chimera. The cells with genes that produce active chloroplasts are green, and those without are white or another color.Variegation can occur through natural mutation or can be the result of selection and propagation of a desired pattern. For example, in one common variegated plant, the snake plant or mother-in-lawâ€™s tongue, Sansevieria trifasciata, some cultivated varieties have yellow edges, and others do not.This kind of variegation results from what happens at the region at the tip of a shoot where most of the cell division and growth takes place, called the apical meristem.Mutated cells without active chloroplasts give rise to more of the same as the leaf grows. But if the plant is cut back, interfering with the activities of the various layers of the meristem, new shoots will often have cells that give rise to just green cells, rather than the two kinds of cells that produced the attractive striation. question@nytimes.comQuestions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.Advertisement
