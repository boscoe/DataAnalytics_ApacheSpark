Named Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis, the plant-eater stood on its hind legs and was about the size of a spaniel. Hualianceratops and another dinosaur from the region, named Yinlong downsi, are the two oldest known ceratopsians, so-called horned dinosaurs, although neither the Hualianceratops nor Yinlong had horns. There were dozens of species of ceratopsians, but Triceratops, which lived in North America about 65 million years ago, is the best known. “These small dinosaurs were related to Triceratops, but very distantly,” said Catherine A. Forster, a paleontologist at George Washington University and one of the team who discovered Hualianceratops. She and her colleagues recovered a partial skull and hind leg, and described their findings in the journal PLOS One.Advertisement
