McNeil Jr.The Food and Drug Administration approved a new one-pill H.I.V. treatment on Thursday with a new, apparently safer form of tenofovir, a powerful H.I.V. inhibitor. The new pill, called Genvoya, from Gilead Sciences , joins several other one-pill treatments, including Atripla, Complera, Triumeq and Stribild. It contains the same four drugs as Stribild, but with the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate replaced by tenofovir alafenamide. The new form of the inhibitor, Gilead said, enters cells where H.I.V. replicates more efficiently, resulting in 91 percent less tenofovir in the bloodstream. That should make the pill less likely to cause kidney damage or loss of bone density, which have become major problems among people with H.I.V. who survive into old age.Advertisement
