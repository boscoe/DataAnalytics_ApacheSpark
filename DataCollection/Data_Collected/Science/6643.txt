It is small. It is round.It was once a planet, but is now cast off as too diminutive.In March, a NASA spacecraft will arrive there to begin the first close-up examination of a dwarf planet.It is not Pluto.It is instead Ceres, 600 miles wide, the largest of the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. “We’re going to reveal the fascinating details of a giant world of rock and ice,” said Marc Rayman, the chief engineer for NASA’s Dawn spacecraft.“It’s not like we’re just going out to visit a chunk of rock the size of one of those mountains,” he said, pointing to the San Gabriel Mountains outside the windows at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. “Ceres has 38 percent of the area of the continental United States. It’s actually the largest body between the sun and Pluto that a spacecraft has not yet visited.”A year ago, the Herschel Space Observatory discovered water vapor rising off two spots on Ceres, possibly a sign of ice volcanism. “Ceres may have subsurface ponds or lakes or even oceans of water,” Dr. Rayman said.AdvertisementLater in the year, the bigger and much more famous dwarf planet Pluto will have its close-up when NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft zips past.These missions, years in the works, are expected to let loose a flood of data that will help paint clearer pictures of Ceres and Pluto and uncover clues on the origins of our solar system. They will also rekindle the debate over what constitutes a planet.The encounter phase of the New Horizons mission officially began Thursday, 180 days before the spacecraft’s closest approach July 14. New Horizons, launched in 2006 on a three-billion-mile trip to Pluto, came out of hibernation in December and is still 135 million miles away, closing in at a speed of more than 30,000 miles per hour. It will start photographing Pluto on Sunday, and by May, those photographs will be sharper than the sharpest taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.“From there on in, it gets dramatically better, week by week,” said S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator for New Horizons. At closest approach, 7,800 miles above the surface, the images will have a resolution of about 70 meters per pixel. If New Horizons were passing over Manhattan instead of Pluto, “we could count the ponds in Central Park,” Dr. Stern said.Pluto’s demotion from planethood in 2006 left fuzzy notions of what a planet is and is not. The International Astronomical Union, the organization in charge of astronomy nomenclature and names, invented a new category, dwarf planets, to place Pluto and Eris, an object discovered a decade ago that is a virtual twin of Pluto in size.AdvertisementMore controversially and confusingly, the group decreed that dwarf planets — Ceres was promoted from asteroid at the same time — were not planets.Dr. Stern is not shy about calling the current definition stupid, saying the “I” in “I.A.U.” actually stands for “irrelevant.”“They got it really wrong,” Dr. Stern said.Marc W. Buie, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo., and a member of the New Horizons team, agrees with Dr. Stern but wishes the issue would go away. Years ago, people would be fascinated to hear the scientific puzzles about Pluto. Now, conversations usually start with “Is Pluto a planet?”
                Dawn is mapping the dwarf planet Ceres, a Texas-size ball of ice and rock.            “It’s a very annoying, distracting issue,” Dr. Buie said. “You have to get past this wall of this nonscientific issue before you get to the good things.”There are plenty of good things for scientists to figure out. Why did Pluto, which had had a consistent reddish hue since Clyde Tombaugh spotted it in 1930, suddenly turn redder from 2000 to 2002? It has stayed the redder color since then. Why, as Pluto moves away from the sun, has the atmosphere not frozen and fallen to the ground as many scientists thought it might? How many moons circle Pluto? Could it have rings like Saturn? For decades, astronomers knew of only one moon, Charon, but Hubble has spied four more: Hydra, Nix, Styx and Kerberos.Scientists already have ideas about what is going on at Pluto. Dr. Buie said the color change could be the result of the northern pole now being in continual sunlight of summer, burning off the shiny veneer. Computer models have suggested how the surface of Pluto is retaining enough heat to keep its air from freezing.Even the simple question of Pluto’s size does not have a precise answer yet because the atmosphere bends light. The exact size is crucial to working out the dynamics of the atmosphere.Eris, farther out and colder, does not have an atmosphere, and its size was measured when a star passed behind it in 2010 — 1,445 miles wide, give or take four miles. Dr. Buie said that estimates for Pluto’s diameter range from 1,429 miles to 1,454 miles.“It’s all going to be fantastic,” Dr. Buie said. “I’m interested in seeing every single result, every measurement, every byte of information that’s going to come out of that spacecraft.”AdvertisementWhen Ceres was discovered, in 1801, it was added to the roster of planets. Within six years, three more objects were spotted in the region — Pallas, Juno and Vesta — bringing the number of planets to 11. (In the outer solar system, Neptune and Pluto had not yet been discovered.) But as astronomers found more and more asteroids, they thought it was ridiculous for every little rock between Mars and Jupiter to be called a planet. The rocks became asteroids, not planets. Ceres lingered for decades on some drawings of the solar system, but it was eventually forgotten, even by most astronomers.Almost no one cared much that Ceres was round and not a planet until round Pluto suddenly became a nonplanet, too.The common notion of planet is “a big thing orbiting the sun.” When Pluto was discovered, it was thought to be larger than Earth, but turned out to be just 1/450th the mass of Earth — smaller than our moon.The International Astronomical Union attempted to codify the “big” aspect by stating that a full-fledged planet “has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit,” while a dwarf planet needs only to be large enough that its gravity has pulled it into a roundish shape, what physicists call hydrostatic equilibrium.
                The New Horizons probe flew past Pluto and its moons early Tuesday morning.            Even many scientists who like the notion underlying the “cleared the neighborhood” clause — essentially that a planet is the gravitationally dominant object in its orbit — said that the I.A.U. did not explain itself very well.“It’s trying to be right, but it’s written terribly,” said Michael E. Brown, the California Institute of Technology astronomer who found Eris, setting off the events culminating in Pluto’s demotion. Dr. Brown is not shy about expressing his opinions, either. His 2010 book is titled “How I Killed Pluto, and Why It Had It Coming.”Conversely, Dr. Stern and Christopher T. Russell, a planetary scientist at U.C.L.A. who is the principal investigator for the Dawn mission, focus more on the intrinsic properties rather than gravitational interactions with other bodies. Once a body is large enough to become round, heavier elements like iron sink to the core.AdvertisementVesta, which Dawn studied before heading to Ceres, has some planetlike features, although it is more potato than sphere in shape.“If all of the scientific community starts referring to Vesta and Ceres and Pluto as planets, then eventually everyone will come along,” Dr. Russell said. “We’re going to let the bodies speak for themselves.”A simple change advocated by many Pluto fans would be to eliminate the “cleared the neighborhood” requirement. That would add not only Pluto and Ceres, but also two other icy worlds discovered beyond Neptune by Dr. Brown — Haumea and Makemake — that are large enough to be roundish.Dr. Stern goes further. If a planet is defined by its physical properties, not its dynamical ones, then anything round but not a star, is a planet regardless of where it is. “Some of them orbit other planets,” he said. “Get over it.”In a widely mocked video clip that circulated last week, Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer, and Shawn Killinger, a host on the QVC shopping channel, discuss the colorful patterns of a blouse — “It almost kind of looks like what the Earth does when you’re a bazillion miles from the planet moon,” Ms. Killinger says, then reverses to say that the moon is not a planet — and they end up squabbling over the astronomical definitions of moon, planet, sun and star.“The moon is such a planet I can’t even stand it,” Mr. Mizrahi says, exasperated. “Well, what else is it if it’s not a planet?”Under Dr. Stern’s definition, Mr. Mizrahi would win the argument.“I am happy to defend him,” Dr. Stern said via email Sunday. “I see no logical reason why large moons that are in hydrostatic equilibrium should not be considered planets too, and I call them that.”Dr. Stern’s classification system distinguishes moons as “secondary planets,” while “primary planets” directly orbit around the sun — pushing the number of planets in the solar system to more than 20.AdvertisementBut even some New Horizons scientists who agree Pluto should be a planet disagree with Dr. Stern. “No, I don’t count the moon as a planet,” said Catherine Olkin, the deputy project scientist. “I guess, where do we stop?”There is no indication that the I.A.U. will revisit the planet question when it meets in Honolulu in August. Astronomers there could propose a new definition, but Thierry Montmerle, the general secretary of the organization, said, “The vast majority of the international planetary community has clearly accepted this definition.”Indeed, passions seem to be cooling over all.Dr. Brown said he rarely heard Pluto complaints these days, but about a decade ago, he regularly received vulgar phone calls. “They were generally calling me names that were sufficiently rude that I can’t say them,” Dr. Brown said, “and some of them were sufficiently rude that I didn’t know what it meant, and I had to ask my grad students, and they often wouldn’t tell me, because they were too busy rolling on the floor laughing.”Related: My Very Educated Readers, Please Write Us a New Planet MnemonicA version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2015, on Page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: Planet Ex.
