A gigantic solar storm, while rare, could disrupt communications satellites and knock out power grids.Dscovr dates to 1998, when Vice President Al Gore imagined a distant spacecraft that would send back educational and inspirational images of Earth. NASA built the refrigerator-size spacecraft, then named Triana, adding instruments to observe the sun and the Earth. But the mission was canceled, and the spacecraft was put into storage.The sun-observing instruments were found to meet the needs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which financed the refurbishment of the spacecraft. The total cost, including the original Triana mission and the Falcon 9 rocket, is $340 million, split among NOAA, NASA and the Air Force, which is evaluating SpaceX for future launches of military satellites.SpaceX had planned to use the launch as a second opportunity to try to land the first stage of the rocket on a platform in the Atlantic, part of the company’s efforts to develop a reusable rocket. But with rough seas, including waves more than 25 feet high, it decided not to try. The booster still went through the motions of landing, but it did so over the water instead of onto the platform. That exercise, the company said, still provided useful data for refining future landing attempts.During the first attempt last month, after the rocket sent cargo to the International Space Station, the first stage of the Falcon 9 landed hard on the platform and exploded.Advertisement
