Most people think that trying to download an entire movie to a mobile device is the act of a madman. Or the act of someone with plenty of time and money to burn.But in Europe work has begun on one of the first examples of a new generation of wireless technology that could make mobile movie downloads not quite so crazy. The work, headed by Samsung, Fujitsu and other big companies, on so-called fifth-generation or 5G is set to be completed in a town south of London by 2018.The British project is hardly the only 5G effort underway. Wireless carriers like AT&T and Verizon are also working on 5G projects, and Facebook is even heading a project to bring an open-source version of 5G to consumers. Google is spearheading similar efforts to add rocket fuel to wireless networks.What can be done on a 5G network is expected to be a major conversation point at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona this week. Typically at the annual conference, most of the world’s biggest smartphone and telecommunications equipment makers gather to promote themselves in front of the technology press over who has the must cutting-edge technology.But instead of mobile apps and other entertaining doodads, the hard work of building mobile networks is likely to the big topic in Barcelona.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
