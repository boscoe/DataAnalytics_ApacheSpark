On Wednesday, Daisuke Wakabayashi and Brian X. Chen broke the news that Apple has been in discussions to buy a San Francisco start-up, Lit Motors, which specializes in electric self-balancing motorcycles. They also confirmed a report in The Financial Times that Apple had been talking with McLaren, the maker of Formula One racecars, about a strategic investment.The moves follow Apple’s recent layoffs from its car initiative, Project Titan, which people have described as part of a reboot of the project.What transportation initiative will come out of the region next? We can’t wait to see.Advertisement
