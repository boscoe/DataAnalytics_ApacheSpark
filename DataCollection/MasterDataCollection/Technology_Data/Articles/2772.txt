He is expected to introduce a proposal as early as this month.As Cecilia Kang writes, Mr. Pai said he believed the companies wanted to find “common ground.” He also recently met with the Internet Association, a trade group that represents Facebook, Google and Netflix.Was this sincere outreach or window dressing?It is interesting to note that of the four companies, only Facebook was born on the internet and does almost of all of its business online. Intel sells chips. Cisco sells networking gear. Oracle sells software.Yes, they all have internet-based businesses. (Oracle, in particular, says its cloud-computing business is growing fast.) And their bottom lines are all dependent on the healthy growth of the internet.But they are all already cash-rich companies, able to afford all but the most ridiculous internet-access rates. None of them are the sort of businesses that could be hurt most by changes to net neutrality — internet-based start-ups that can’t afford high prices.If Mr. Pai’s overtures are to be considered sincere by the tech industry, he will have to understand the risks for the little guys that could make up the next generation of giants.Advertisement
