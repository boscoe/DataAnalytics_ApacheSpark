Google is shutting down its Google Compare comparison-shopping site, marking a retrenchment from the search giant’s foray into selling financial products like insurance and credit cards, according to a spokeswoman and partners who work with the company.Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, has been running Google Compare in Britain for three years and started its highly anticipated United States site last March. Despite Google’s being the biggest name in search, insurance industry partners and an internal email said the sites never really caught on with consumers.Google, which had formed several insurance-industry partnerships to get access to broker networks, is telling partners that it is shutting down both its British and United States sites in about a month. In an email to partners, Google said it would focus on AdWords, the company’s mainstay advertising product, where “insurance” is among the most lucrative search terms.“Despite people turning to Google for financial services information, the Google Compare service itself hasn’t driven the success we hoped for,” the company said in the email, which was posted on the website Search Engine Land.AdvertisementWhen Google jumped into the insurance-selling game, it joined a long list of technology companies that have been trying to shake up the market by selling things like auto and homeowner insurance online. The idea behind their sites is to help consumers save money by showing them multiple quotes in one place.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Others, like Google, work on a commission model where they send referral traffic to insurers and get a finder’s fee whenever someone buys a policy.AdvertisementThe competition has so far done little to threaten the tens of thousands of insurance agents who continue to be the backbone of the business, but Google and others are likely to keep trying.In 2013, United States insurers wrote $481 billion in premiums for property and casualty insurance, which consists of mostly auto, home and commercial insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. That would put a rough estimate of agents’ commissions — including commissions to small-time agents as well as to brokers who sell large commercial policies — at around $50 billion.Insurance industry partners said Google left open the possibility of creating a new insurance product in the future. Specifically, these people said, the company is likely to veer away from a side-by-side design that works well for commoditized products like cameras but is hard to use on a product as complicated as an individual insurance policy.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
