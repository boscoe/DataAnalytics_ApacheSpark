For the social media network Twitter, the Trump bump turned out to be a Trump slump. The company, famous for its biggest newsmaker, President Trump, reported on Thursday that its earnings were far short of analysts’ expectations. Its stock tumbled in response.As Mike Isaac writes, Twitter’s disappointing results stand in contrast to its vast influence on the media ecosystem. Twitter is beloved not just by the new president — who uses it to hector enemies and praise his daughter’s clothing line — but also by lots of journalists, for whom it has become a town hall to commiserate over a nutty news cycle.“You don’t go a day without hearing about Twitter,” Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, told investors on a conference call.But influence doesn’t pay the rent. Or maybe it’s worse than that. It possible that all the news on Twitter — the constant fighting over politics, the onrush of news and instant reaction to news that’s tolerable only to reporters — may be turning away ordinary people.If people’s most frequent exposure to Twitter comes in the form of a president’s all-caps exclamations, it’s no wonder a lot of them are deciding to sit out this social network. Better to scroll through Instagram or Snapchat, where, at least, most people aren’t constantly anxious about the news.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
