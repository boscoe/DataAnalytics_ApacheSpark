If you were to enjoy a four-hour dinner of duck and a chocolate dessert in Manhattan, whom would you like to have as your famous guest? The outgoing president? The incoming president? Bill Gates? LeBron James?How about dining with Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist? During an interview over a fine meal with The Times’s Maureen Dowd, Mr. Thiel discussed his support for President-elect Donald J. Trump even though most in Silicon Valley have viewed Mr. Trump as the second coming of Lord Voldemort. Mr. Thiel also revealed his tastes: He prefers the bootlegger’s money problems in “Star Wars” to the money-free world of “Star Trek,” and explained the lawsuit he helped fund against Gawker. He also officially denied that he was responsible for the seating chart at Mr. Trump’s meeting with tech industry executives.Mr. Thiel is widely known as an investor who struck gold with Facebook, and as the gay billionaire who not only threw his support behind Mr. Trump, but also was a delegate and featured speaker at the Republican National Convention last year.This leads to what Mr. Thiel may be best known for: his contrarian nature. It is the basis of a technique he called pyrrhonian. He likes to turn questions inside out, he explained to Ms. Dowd. It is a way of looking differently at the world. Like Mr. Thiel or not, the technique appears to be working for him.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
