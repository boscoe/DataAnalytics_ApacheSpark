Even with the European Commission levying a record $2.7 billion fine against Google last month, the internet search company’s parent entity — Alphabet — looked hardly the worse for wear financially.Alphabet on Monday reported quarterly earnings that showed that its business continues to hum along, writes Daisuke Wakabayashi, a technology reporter for The New York Times. While the European Commission’s fine for antitrust violations hurt Alphabet’s bottom line, the penalty still ended up being something of a blip.Alphabet’s revenue rose 21 percent to more than $26 billion in the second quarter, powered by Google’s search advertising business. Excluding the European fine, the company’s net income rose 28 percent. Much of this handily beat Wall Street estimates.Such a performance effectively turned the “$2.7 billion fine into a financial footnote,” Daisuke writes.Alphabet is the first of several tech companies expected to report earnings this week, which will offer insight into the health of the industry. Others set to disclose their results include Facebook, Amazon, Intel and Twitter.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
