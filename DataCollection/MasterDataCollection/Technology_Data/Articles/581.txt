The problem is that many of those markets are highly unpredictable.The latest tech company to experience that fickleness is Amazon. In recent days, it has encountered bumps in one of its most potentially lucrative emerging markets, India. That’s because India recently issued new rules around foreign ownership of e-commerce companies operating in the country — and Amazon and some of its rivals appear to have run afoul of those rules, write Nick Wingfield and Vindu Goel.While the impact of this on how Amazon operates in India is unclear, it’s a bad time for the Internet retailer to face hurdles in the country. India is a fast-growing economy that offers the opportunity to gain millions of new e-commerce customers. Amazon faces competition there from other web retailers such as Snapdeal, so any loss of momentum in the country could potentially be costly.The difficulties of navigating growth in international markets are by now well known, especially for American tech companies in India’s neighbor, China. There, numerous tech companies have tried to make inroads and been shut out, or were never permitted to operate in the first place. Even tech companies that have tried their darnedest to be friendly with Chinese authorities have later faced regulatory challenges.Advertisement
