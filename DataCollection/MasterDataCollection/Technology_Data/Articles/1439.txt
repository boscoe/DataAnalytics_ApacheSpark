The heart of that oversight has been the concept of net neutrality. Support for the principle spurred, among other F.C.C. actions, the classification of broadband as a common carrier service like telephones, which are subject to strong government oversight.It was perhaps the signature telecommunications decision of the Obama administration, and one with considerable support in the technology industry.But as Cecilia Kang writes, Mr. Pai has long thought those rules were a hindrance, and he voted against them as a member of the F.C.C. before he became its chairman.“It’s basic economics,” he said. “The more heavily you regulate something, the less of it you’re likely to get.”Mr. Pai was vague on the details of his plan, but he said he generally supports the ideas behind net neutrality. The Obama-era rules, he said, went too far.Advertisement
