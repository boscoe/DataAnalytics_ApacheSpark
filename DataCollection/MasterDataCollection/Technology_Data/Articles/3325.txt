Facebook is leaning its considerable clout into the online advertising debate by blocking ad-blocking tools on its desktop site.If you’re in the online publishing business, there are plenty of reasons to dislike ad blockers. They limit the advertising seen by users, making it harder to make money from those ads and to pay to produce the material those ads are bumping against.In other words, if a site is already free, are you so cheap that you need to block the ads, too?And yet ... that aggravating advertising: Ads jumping into view in the middle of an article. Ads that stall or crash your browser. Ads that try to sell you fixes for beauty issues you didn’t know you had.Even the most ardent of ad tech fans (if they exist) would have to admit the experience is often less than ideal.Ads on Facebook are arguably much less intrusive than those on many other sites, so many users may not notice the difference when ad blockers are employed against it. But make no mistake: The social giant’s billions in revenue come almost entirely from advertising, so it is not about to let a few clever tools get in the way of profits.Facebook’s new blocking of blockers technology will not apply to mobile browsers or people reaching Facebook through mobile apps, which already have ads that can’t be blocked by third-party tools.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
