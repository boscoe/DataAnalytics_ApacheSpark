It began with a blog post from a former Uber engineer, Susan Fowler, detailing a history of harassment and discrimination that she said she experienced at the company, and snowballed into allegations of even more widespread bad behavior within Uber. Several of Uber’s investors criticized the company and BuzzFeed reported that Travis Kalanick, the company’s chief executive, held a meeting with 100 women engineers on Thursday about the issues.All of this was compounded by a lawsuit last Thursday from Waymo, the self-driving car business that was spun off from Google’s parent company, accusing Uber of using intellectual property stolen by one of Google’s former project leaders.Then last Friday, Mike Isaac and Daisuke Wakabayashi, tech reporters for The New York Times, reported that Uber had also been incomplete about its characterization of an incident involving one of its self-driving cars running through a red light in San Francisco.At the time, Uber blamed the running of the red light on “human error,” which was taken as a sign that a human was driving the car. But according to two Uber employees and internal Uber documents viewed by The New York Times, the car was actually driving itself when it barreled through the red light.Now a fresh week dawns. Is lurching from one news event to another over for Uber? Readers, we will keep you posted.Advertisement
