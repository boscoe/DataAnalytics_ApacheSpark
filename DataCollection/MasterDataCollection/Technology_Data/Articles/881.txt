I know it’s possible to make PDF files with my phone’s camera and a scanner app, but is it possible to make PDF files out of documents already on my phone, like email threads and web pages so I can save them in cloud-based research folders?A. Your phone’s app store should have several utilities for converting documents and pages into PDF files, and some are free. Adobe, which created the format back in the early 1990s, has a version of its Acrobat Reader app for Android, iOS and Windows phones, but the PDF conversion tool requires a monthly subscription fee of about $10. Recent versions of Android and iOS, however, have their own PDF-making tools built right in.Android features can vary based on the version used by the device manufacturer. But in most cases, you should be able to create a PDF from an open email message or web page by tapping the three-dot More menu in the upper-right corner of the screen and selecting the Print option. If you do not see a Print command, select Share and check for a Print option there. When you are asked to select a printer, choose Save as PDF, tap Save and choose a place to store the resulting file.In iOS 10, when you have a message or page open onscreen, tap the Share menu icon (the one that looks like an arrow popping out of a box) and select Print. When the print preview appears, put your fingers on the screen and pinch them outward to create a PDF of the document. Tap the Share menu icon again to send or store the new PDF file.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
