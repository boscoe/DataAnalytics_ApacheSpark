But success can often be elusive because many of the start-ups flop.So which investors have amassed track records that can put them atop the list of venture capitalists?In collaboration with the research firm CB Insights, The New York Times presents the top 20 venture investors this year. Many of the rankings have moved around from last year, partly because a spate of start-up acquisitions and initial public offerings have raised the performance of various venture capitalists, according to the formula that CB Insights uses to arrive at its conclusions.One of the venture investors who vaulted into the top 20 list is Kirsten Green at Forerunner Ventures, Katie Benner and Michael de la Merced of The New York Times write.Last year, Ms. Green’s start-up bets paid off in a big way when two of them — the online razor company Dollar Shave Club and the e-commerce company Jet.com — were bought for $1 billion and $3.3 billion by larger companies. The bonanza of returns from those deals helped put Ms. Green, who focuses on start-ups in retail and e-commerce, into the top 20 for the first time.More tech news:Amazon’s ambitions, unboxed.
