WASHINGTON — After a bruising week before lawmakers, big internet companies including Facebook and Google relented to pressure in Washington on Friday and agreed to support a sex trafficking bill they had vehemently opposed for months.The bill would allow victims to sue websites that knowingly support and assist sex trafficking on their site. State attorneys general would also be able to go after the websites that support sex trafficking content.The companies had argued that they had worked hard to combat sex trafficking on their services, but that the bill would jeopardize a free and open internet, as well as subject them to many potential lawsuits for the actions of users.But companies have come under increasingly harsh scrutiny in recent weeks, particularly for their role helping to spread Russia propaganda during the 2016 presidential election. This week, executives at Facebook, Twitter and Google faced tough questions from lawmakers in three congressional hearings.AdvertisementUnder those conditions, the bill, called the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act, became an unpopular lobbying battle for the tech companies. Rivals such as the Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox, Oracle and HP joined civil rights groups like National Urban League in support of the Senate bill.AdvertisementAfter weeks of negotiating over details, an internet lobbying group announced on Friday that it had ended its battle to squash the bill.The bill “will grant victims the ability to secure the justice they deserve, allow internet platforms to continue their work combating human trafficking, and protect good actors in the ecosystem,” said Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association.Congressional aides said the internet companies had been invited to weigh in on the bill before it was introduced in August, but they declined. The companies then forcefully came out in opposition, warning that it would expose web companies to numerous lawsuits because the actions of users were hard to police.Lawmakers said the new bill contained modest changes that clarified that state law enforcement officials would have to use federal law as their basis of suits, one of the final sticking points for the companies. And the new draft contained language that only websites that knowingly assisted and supported sex trafficking would be targeted.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Companies say that law has allowed internet services like Google and Facebook to thrive.But with broad support, legislators said some smaller companies had hidden behind Section 230.“Removing the unwarranted shield from legal responsibility will save countless children from horrific tragedy, both physical and emotional,” Mr. Blumenthal said.Consumer advocates said that the law put the big companies on notice as well.“This is a chink in the Teflon of Google and Facebook’s shield of immunity,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.A version of this article appears in print on November 4, 2017, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: In Reversal, Tech Titans Back Bill on Sex Trafficking.
