Q. In Windows 10, how do you change the name Cortana calls you when you talk to her?A. If Cortana, Microsoft’s digital assistant, is calling you by the wrong name (or mispronouncing your name) during your verbal exchanges, you can correct the situation in a few easy steps. In the latest version of Windows 10, start by clicking into the Cortana box in the task bar and selecting the Notebook icon on the edge of the Cortana window; it’s the third icon from the top. You can also just say “Hey, Cortana, open your Notebook settings.”When the Notebook menu opens, select About Me from the list. On the next screen, click the Change My Name button.On the next screen, under “What would you like me to call you?” type in the name you would prefer to be called. Click the Enter button. You can hear how the program will pronounce your name by selecting the “Hear how I’ll say it” button on the next screen.After you hear the sample, click either the Sounds Good button or the button labeled That’s Wrong. You can give Cortana a sample of the correct pronunciation by saying it aloud. (If the software is still butchering your name, try typing in a phonetic spelling instead.) Once you have accepted Cortana’s rendition, the program should address you that way in all your future interactions.The Notebook area is where Cortana keeps the settings for displaying other information about you and your life. Depending on what you choose to enable in the Notebook, you can have the Cortana home screen show the weather forecast based on your location, current traffic in your area, local news and sports headlines, your calendar schedule and more.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
