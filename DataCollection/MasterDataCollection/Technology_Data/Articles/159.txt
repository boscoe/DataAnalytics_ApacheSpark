Germany has long been a leading player in the old economy. Were this 1980, we would call it a “titan of industry.” And its biggest industry, by far, is cars. Germany makes some of the world’s most popular vehicles, not to mention some of the finest. (Let’s forget Dieselgate).But this is no longer 1980, and the car industry isn’t what it used to be. Across the globe, automakers are preparing for rapid change. There will be new sources of fuel — electric cars are becoming more and more popular — as well as new ways to drive, including, of course, cars that drive themselves.Then there’s the question of ownership. Today, most cars spend most of their day parked. Car-sharing services like Uber argue that thanks to technology, each car can become more productive — and if that happens, we’d probably need far fewer cars.These changes could upend the German economy. But the Germans aren’t sleepwalking into the future, write Jack Ewing and Mark Scott. Executives at some of the country’s leading car companies are pushing a slate of initiatives that could change how we think of the German automotive sector. They are building or investing in car-sharing companies of their own, and they are expanding their electric options.But perhaps most interestingly, German car companies are starting to think of themselves as more than just manufacturers, and instead as incubators of new ideas. It’s a very Silicon Valley way of thinking. As one executive told Mr. Ewing and Mr. Scott: “The biggest skill you have to have is the ability to change.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
