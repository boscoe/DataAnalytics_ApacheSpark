Twitter said on Thursday that it had overstated its monthly-user figures since 2014 after mistakenly including data from third-party applications in its counting.The revelation came as the company reported that its net loss had narrowed in the third quarter and that its number of daily active users had risen 14 percent.The disclosure could nonetheless do further harm to Twitter’s reputation as the company contends with scrutiny over its role in Russia’s efforts to meddle in the presidential election, complaints about what critics have called its scattershot efforts to prevent abuse and harassment on its platform; and skepticism among some investors concerned about its slowing user growth worldwide.Initially at least, investors did not appear particularly troubled by news of the inflated user figures. Twitter shares were up 10 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Digits is part of the Fabric mobile application platform that Twitter sold to Alphabet, Google’s parent company, this year.AdvertisementDigits allowed third-party applications to send authentication messages through Twitter’s systems and did not reflect activity on the Twitter platform, the company said.AdvertisementAs a result, the company lowered the number of monthly active users by two million for the first and second quarters of this year and by one million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Twitter said its data-retention policies made it unable to reconcile the figures for periods before last year’s fourth quarter.“Our estimates suggest the prior period adjustments are smaller than those in the fourth quarter of 2016,” the company said.Twitter said that — in addition to the uptick in daily active users — it had experienced a 4 percent increase in monthly active users from the same period last year, to 330 million. The company had 326 million monthly active users in the second quarter.Twitter reported a net loss of $21.1 million for the quarter, compared with a $102.9 million loss for the same period last year. The company’s revenue declined 4 percent, to $590 million.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter: @Chadbray.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
