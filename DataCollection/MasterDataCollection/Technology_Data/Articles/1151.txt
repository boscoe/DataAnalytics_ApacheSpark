IPad sales continued to deteriorate. And now the company faces an uncertain environment with the Trump administration, on the issue of immigration and with regard to the president’s call for the company to build its products in the United States instead of China.Now that the gloomy stuff is out of the way, let’s point out the good news: On Tuesday, Apple reported that revenue in the last quarter of 2016 was $78.4 billion, up 3 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. The company’s profits actually fell slightly, to $17.9 billion, but mostly because it spent money to buy back shares.Also, Apple’s once-sleepy services business in things like app sales and music is growing fast, up to $7.2 billion for the quarter. And the company is up to $246 billion in cash and marketable securities.Much of that is in foreign accounts. Don’t be shocked if Apple finds a way to make a deal with the famous dealmaker in the White House to bring some of that treasure back to the United States.Advertisement
