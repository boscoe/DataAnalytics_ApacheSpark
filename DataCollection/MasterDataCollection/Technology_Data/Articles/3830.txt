SEATTLE — Amazon is bringing one of its experiments in brick-and-mortar retailing to New York.Barricades went up several days ago outside a retail space in the high-end mall at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, with a sign saying an Amazon bookstore would open there soon. On Thursday, an Amazon spokeswoman, Deborah Bass, confirmed that the company would open in a space previously occupied by an Armani Exchange.The Manhattan location, with an opening planned for the spring, will be the eighth that the internet giant has opened or announced.Stores in or near Portland, San Diego and Seattle are open now, and Amazon has said it is working on stores in Chicago and Dedham, Mass., near Boston.

Amazon has declined to discuss the stores.At first glance, Amazon’s bookstores appear to be more conventional, with rows of shelves and nooks for reading. The company stocks far fewer titles than typical bookstores, using online data to determine which ones to carry.A version of this article appears in print on January 6, 2017, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Amazon to Open Manhattan Retail Store.
