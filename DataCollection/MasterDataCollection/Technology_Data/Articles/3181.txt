Q. I have been tied to WorldMate, an iPhone app that tracks and centralizes travel reservations, for years. It’s great and I love it, but the app is being discontinued and I need a replacement. Any ideas?A. WorldMate, an itinerary-management tool for travelers that has been around since 2000, recently announced it was closing down. As explained on the company’s website, the WorldMate app will be removed from the Apple, Google and Windows app stores on March 31. While the paid Gold version of the app will maintain most functions like calendar sync and flight notifications after the app is removed, that service itself will be retired for good on Sept. 30.In addition to providing tools like flight search, price alerts and currency converters, WorldMate allowed its users to forward email confirmations for flight, hotel, car rental and other travel-related receipts to the service. It then combined all the information in one spot, creating a handy trip itinerary with all the details. However, WorldMate was not the only travel app to do so, and several alternatives exist that work in a similar way.TripIt has many of the same basic features as WorldMate and has mobile apps for Android, BlackBerry, iOS and Windows Phone (along with many positive reviews). The free version syncs and shares your travel information in one centralized place, but the TripIt Pro edition ($49 a year) adds real-time flight alerts, seat-upgrade notifications and other perks.TripCase is another well-reviewed free itinerary manager with similar tools for Android and iOS devices; it also has integration with the Alexa assistant on the Amazon Echo line of speakers. And for those immersed in the Google ecosystem, the free Google Trips travel planner for Android and iOS automatically creates itineraries by pulling in confirmations sent to Gmail accounts.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com. This column will answer questions of general interest, but letters cannot be answered individually.A version of this article appears in print on March 2, 2017, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: Replacing an App for Travel Planning.
