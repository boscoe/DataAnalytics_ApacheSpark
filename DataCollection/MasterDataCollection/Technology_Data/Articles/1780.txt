In the Waze app, check to see what setting your phone is using for its sound output. Tap the magnifying-glass icon to open your list of destinations and then on the gear-shaped icon to get to the Settings screen. On the Settings screen, make sure sound alerts are turned on, and then, under Advanced Settings, select “Sound & voice.”On the “Sound & voice” screen, make sure the “Mute Waze during calls” setting is turned off. (On this screen, you can also have the app automatically pause audiobooks and podcasts so you do not miss anything when Waze cuts in with an announcement.)In the Advanced section, tap “Sound output.” In the iOS version of the app, Waze recommends using the “Device default” setting to listen to music and take calls while using the app. If you have Waze set to “Play on phone speaker” or “Play as Bluetooth phone call,” the company advises that you “make sure to accept the call and change where the sound will play from — from your iPhone to iPhone speaker. If you forget to change the setting your Waze announcement will be muted.” (You need to do this every time you answer a call.)On the Android version of the app, make sure the “Play sound to iPhone speaker” setting is enabled so you hear Waze announcements even when you are on a phone call.This summer, a version of the Waze app was released for the Android Auto software in some cars. In this case, the app works right on the dashboard system and you do not have to run it on your phone. While a native Waze app for Apple’s similar CarPlay system is not available, some enthusiasts have come up with creative workarounds.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
