Mostly weird ways, it turns out, in the case of Farhad Manjoo, The Times’s technology columnist.This year, we have been profiling how Times journalists rely on technology on the job and in their personal lives with a new feature, Tech We’re Using. In the latest installment, Farhad describes how he has set up his home to be like the set of a reality television show.Specifically, cameras abound in his living and dining rooms. The cameras are motion activated, so when anyone enters, recording begins. The aim: to capture the sweet, surprising and odd moments from his two young children as they grow up, making a kind of video memory for posterity.“I’m a strange person,” he writes of his home practices. But “when I’m 80 and the robots have taken over, I’ll look back on these and remember that life was good, once.”More tech news:Samsung unveils the Galaxy S8 smartphone.
