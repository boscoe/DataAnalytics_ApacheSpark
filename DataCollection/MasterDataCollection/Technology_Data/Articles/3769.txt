There are people old enough to remember — perhaps even in Silicon Valley — when a broadcast television show other than a football game was an event. Remember the final episodes of “M*A*S*H*” or “Cheers” or “Seinfeld”?And then the internet came along. As Farhad Manjoo writes, the explosion in streaming content has done a few things: It has allowed consumers to have a far wider choice in what they want to watch, and it has provided a new forum for well-conceived shows. It has also added to our culture divide.Case in point: the Netflix reboot of a popular ’70s sitcom, “One Day at a Time.” It has been praised  by critics. But will it ever come close to the audience enjoyed by its broadcast ancestor? Not likely.That is not necessarily bad. More choice, after all, is generally a good thing. And viewers no longer have to accept what a few companies want to produce.But it’s easy to see how something was lost on the way to high-quality Netflix shows. As Farhad writes: “Because it featured little choice, TV offered something else: the raw material for a shared culture.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
