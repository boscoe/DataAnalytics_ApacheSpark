SAN FRANCISCO — Google turned 18 years old in September and there are signs that as it gets older it is learning to be responsible with its money.A year ago, Google reorganized to create Alphabet, a holding company housing the search giant and a growing list of fledgling businesses, ranging from Nest, a home electronics maker, to a life sciences outfit called Verily.By making Google one of Alphabet’s subsidiaries — albeit the one responsible for most of its revenue — it put pressure on the company’s “other bets” to prove that they can stand on their own financial feet.On Thursday, Alphabet reported third-quarter results that provided evidence of that new interest in watching where the money goes. Alphabet said quarterly revenue from “other bets” rose 40 percent to $197 million, while operating losses narrowed to $865 million from $980 million a year ago.AdvertisementAnother big change has been more gradual: Search on mobile phones surpassed desktop queries last year and the company said that mobile web searches were now the driving force behind revenue growth.AdvertisementThe potential impact of Alphabet’s newfound discipline was also on display earlier this week when the company said it would curb expansion of Google Fiber into new cities and reduce staff in the unit responsible for the work.Google’s plan to build a high-speed, fiber-optic network resulted in years of costly investments to dig up roads and lay cable and it has started considering cheaper alternatives, including wireless and fiber partnerships.Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said such decisions were natural for high-risk, high-reward initiatives.“It’s inevitable that there will be course corrections along the way and that some efforts will be more successful than others,” Ms. Porat said in a call with analysts.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Along with the job cuts and scaled-back expansion plans, Craig Barratt, the chief executive of Access, the Alphabet unit housing Google Fiber, said he was stepping down from the company, noting that it was the “right juncture” to do so.Google has lost other Alphabet unit executives, like Nest’s chief executive, Tony Fadell, who left the company in June under increasing pressure to prove that the home devices unit could deliver profitable results on its own.AdvertisementAlphabet’s overall revenue in the quarter rose 20 percent to $22.45 billion, beating analysts’ expectations. Net income was $5.06 billion, up from $3.98 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share after excluding certain items were $9.06, or 44 cents more than analysts’ estimates.Alphabet shares were up about 1.4 percent in after-hours trading.There may be another Alphabet company coming soon. Astro Teller, the Alphabet executive in charge of the company’s research lab, called X, said at a Wall Street Journal technology conference on Wednesday that its self-driving car was on the verge of being spun out of X into a stand-alone company responsible for generating its own revenue.But one thing that has not changed is that Google remains the dominant force of the internet. It has seven services with more than a billion users each, including search, YouTube and Gmail.A version of this article appears in print on October 28, 2016, on Page B6 of the New York edition with the headline: ‘Other Bets’ at Alphabet Are Called to Heel.
