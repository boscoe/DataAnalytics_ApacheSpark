This week will offer a glimpse into just how dominant some of the world’s biggest technology companies have become.Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are all scheduled to post their quarterly earnings this week, giving a report card on their strength and reach in areas like online advertising, e-commerce, mobile gadgets and cloud computing.For one of these companies, Alphabet, this week’s earnings report will also be an almost-anniversary of sorts. It was nearly a year ago that Google announced that it would be evolving into a holding company structure, with a parent company known as Alphabet and different units — like Google, Nest and Calico — underneath it.How that transformation has been rippling through what was once Google can be seen through the X division, writes Conor Dougherty.
