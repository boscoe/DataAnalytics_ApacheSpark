The game has swept through the United States, New Zealand and Australia, and is prompting a mania that has already pushed its usage levels close to that of Twitter’s, by some measures.Unlike other viral games, though, Pokémon Go has not kept players cooped up inside staring at their screens. Instead, it sends people out to streets, parks, beaches and beyond because the game uses augmented reality, a technology that fuses the digital world with the real world, write Nick Wingfield and Mike Isaac. To play Pokémon Go, users need to walk around their neighborhoods or towns with their smartphones looking for Pokémon characters to pop up on their screen and then capture those characters.Pokémon Go’s popularity — even the United States Marines are getting in on the action — could mean a tipping point for augmented reality, particularly because the game is easy to download and play. It doesn’t involve fancy new headsets or other equipment, which virtual reality typically requires.Concerns about the game have certainly crossed into the mainstream already. Because of the number of people who appear to be walking around distracted while playing the game, local law enforcement, health groups and city agencies have issued tips on how to safely play Pokémon Go. Other groups are raising questions about the privacy risks that could be caused by the game, all of which underscore just how early we still are on augmented reality.Advertisement
