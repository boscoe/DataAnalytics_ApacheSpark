If what Uber is experiencing right now is something akin to adolescent growing pains, then the ride-hailing company is going to be one giant outfit when it grows up.If you haven’t been paying attention, Uber, based in San Francisco, has had a few problems lately, including concerns over a toxic, win-at-all-costs culture and a lawsuit accusing the company of relying on plans for autonomous car technology that were stolen from Waymo, the new name for Google’s self-driving-car project.Then there was the video recording of Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, getting into a testy exchange with an Uber driver over fees. As a rule, it’s never a good look when wealthy men tell less well-off people to “take responsibility for their own” problems, as Mr. Kalanick said to the driver (he used a more colorful word than “problems”).And don’t forget the disclosure of Uber’s so-called Project Greyball, a technology effort used in part to help Uber drivers avoid law enforcement in cities where the legality of the service was called into question.AdvertisementNow add to the mix what some might think is accelerating executive turnover, even as the company says it is searching for a chief executive to help Mr. Kalanick get the company out of its current predicament. The list of departures includes:• Jeff Jones, Uber’s president for ride sharing, who left the company after just six months.• Brian McClendon, vice president for maps and business platform, who plans to leave at the end of the month.The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
