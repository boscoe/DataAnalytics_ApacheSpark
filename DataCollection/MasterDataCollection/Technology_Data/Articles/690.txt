Q. How do I change the basic typeface in my new documents in Microsoft Word for Mac 2016 so that the program always uses it?A. One way to change the default typeface that Microsoft Word uses for each new document is to adjust the font settings box. On the Mac 2016 version of the program, create a document and then go to the Format menu in the toolbar. Select Font, and then choose the Font tab in the box.When you have the Font box open, use the menus within to choose the font and type size you want to use for the future files you create. When you are set, click the Default button in the lower left corner of the box. A box appears asking if you want to change the default font and warns that the change affects all documents based on the Normal template. Click Yes to make the change.Microsoft Word 2016 stores all of its default styles for font, line spacing, margins and other aspects of a newly created document in a template file called the Normal.dotm template. You can make multiple changes to your default document settings by opening the Normal.dotm template within Word and editing it directly on your Mac or Windows system, but the file is typically buried in a few layers of folders.For those wishing to change the default font in the Windows version of Word 2016, click the Home tab in the toolbar and go to the Font section of the ribbon. Click the small arrow icon at the bottom of the Font area to open the Font dialogue box. Next, click Font and choose the typeface and size you want to use. In the lower left corner of the box, click the Set as Default button and confirm that you wish to change the Normal template.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
