Many of them route sales through lower-tax countries like Ireland, even if the sales are made in other nations.In May, Amazon, which had been funneling most of its sales taxes through Luxembourg, a low-tax haven, said it would start paying taxes in European countries where it has large operations. Apple reached a deal to pay local Italian tax authorities in December after authorities there looked into whether the company tried to lower its taxes by moving more than $1 billion in revenue from its Italian operations through an Irish subsidiary.The executive arm of the European Union, the European Commission, is also investigating whether Apple and Amazon receive unfair state support through low-tax agreements in Ireland and Luxembourg.Mark Scott contributed reporting from London.Advertisement
