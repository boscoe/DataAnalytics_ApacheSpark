Twitter is making a play for people’s living rooms, unveiling an app on Wednesday for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV and Microsoft’s Xbox One that will showcase its bet on live content.Twitter’s new free app includes live streams of 10 National Football League Thursday night games, and all live videos from MLB Advanced Media, the National Basketball Association, Pac-12 Networks, Campus Insiders, Bloomberg News and the business news start-up Cheddar.“We’re excited to introduce this new experience to people, without requiring a pay wall or having to log in to Twitter,” Anthony Noto, chief financial officer of Twitter, said in a statement.Twitter, the social media company, wants to draw a large mainstream audience with live-streamed television events after struggling to increase its user base. It also is betting that a larger audience will make it more attractive for advertisers, especially for online video ads, which command a premium.AdvertisementTwitter has bet big on this live-streaming vision. This spring, Twitter beat Facebook and other technology companies to win the rights to live stream the N.F.L. games on Thursday nights. Twitter agreed to pay the league around $1 million a game and to let the N.F.L. handle some of the ad sales. Mr. Noto once was the N.F.L.’s chief financial officer.Last season, each Thursday night football game drew an average of 13 million viewers. Twitter will stream its first N.F.L. game on Thursday.AdvertisementTwitter’s new app will be available in select markets starting Wednesday. Apple TV users will also be able to see live premium video and video clips posted on Twitter side-by-side.A version of this article appears in print on September 15, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Twitter Introducing App to Stream Live Sports.
