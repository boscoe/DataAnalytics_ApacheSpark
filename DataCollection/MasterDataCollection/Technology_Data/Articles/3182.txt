As bad weeks ago, starting last weekend Uber has had one of the worst in tech industry annals.Though it is believed to be wildly unprofitable (it is hard to say for sure since the company is private and doesn’t have to disclose financial information), Uber is considered one of the great success stories of this generation of tech start-ups. Led by Travis Kalanick, the company’s brash chief executive, Uber is believed to be worth close to $70 billion.Now for the bad stuff: Uber has always been controversial, to say the least. It has regularly clashed with local regulators, competitors, critical reporters — even its own drivers.Over the weekend, a former Uber engineer wrote a post on Medium saying that she had been sexually harassed by a supervisor and that her complaints were brushed off by human resources. And Wednesday, The New York Times’s Mike Isaac detailed a history of bad behavior inside the company.Not to be outdone, Waymo, the self-driving car spinoff of Google’s parent company, sued Uber on Thursday, accusing one of its employees of stealing Waymo’s intellectual property before he quit to start his own company, which was acquired by Uber.For Uber’s executives, it’s fair to say this weekend can’t come too soon.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
