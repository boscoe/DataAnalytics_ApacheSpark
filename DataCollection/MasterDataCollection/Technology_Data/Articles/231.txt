When you are spending $85.4 billion on a company, it’s probably wise to have a rationale that includes a whole bunch of futuristic technology.That certainly seems to be the case with AT&T’s planned acquisition of Time Warner, which includes properties like HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros. Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, says a pillar of the acquisition is a superfast wireless technology called 5G.Imagine one day that wireless networks are so fast that you can download a movie in just five seconds. And wouldn’t it be great to own both the network and the content delivered on it?It’s a nice idea. But there’s only one problem, as Brian X. Chen and Mark Scott write: 5G networks aren’t likely to exist in any significant capacity for at least the next decade. Carriers and telecom equipment makers are fighting over how exactly this technology should work, and that dispute could take a few years to settle. What’s more, building this network could be spectacularly expensive, and it may be economically feasible to use it only in urban areas.So 5G is likely a ways off, despite Mr. Stephenson’s aspirations. But in the meantime, it might be pretty cool to say you run the company that makes “Game of Thrones.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
