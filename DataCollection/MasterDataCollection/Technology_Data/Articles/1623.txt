Nope. Nah. Not even close, writes Farhad Manjoo, the technology columnist for The New York Times.Instead, technology has made the airline experience worse for many people. Travel search engines are commodifying trips by focusing on price. Online check-ins, airport kiosks and the like are divorcing travelers from the airlines’ human workers. It’s a disconnect that has been accelerated by tech, Farhad writes.Episodes like the one over the weekend in which a traveler was dragged off a United Airlines flight against his will are a culmination. In initial statements, United’s chief executive, Oscar Munoz, offered little sympathy to the passenger, but a wave of social media outrage ultimately led to an apology.“What we are witnessing is the basest, ugliest form of tech-abetted, bottom-seeking capitalism,” Farhad writes, “one concerned with prices and profits above all else, with little regard for quality of service, for friendliness or even for the dignity of customers.”• Another Uber executive is leaving. Rachel Whetstone, the company’s head of policy and communications, announced her resignation, the latest in a string of departures.• Border officers have nearly doubled searches of electronic devices. There were nearly 15,000 searches at border crossings and airports from October to March — up from 8,383 a year before, Customs and Border Protection said.Advertisement
