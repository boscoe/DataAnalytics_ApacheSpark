We may have to wait awhile to greet our robot overlords. Or at least the robots that will take our jobs.As Steve Lohr writes, the McKinsey Global Institute on Thursday released a comprehensive report on the impact of automation and robotics on the global work force. Its conclusion: Many tasks can be handed over to machines, but full replacement of human workers will happen more slowly than many fear.The role of automation in displacing workers has been a popular topic since the presidential election. Indeed, it could be easily argued that more blue-collar jobs in the United States have been lost to machines than to foreign workers. A modern steel mill, called a minimill, for example, is mostly automated and needs a fraction of the workers needed at an older mill.There is no question that companies that handle large volumes of products, like Amazon, are eager to automate as much work as possible in their distribution centers. But envisioning the role of robots beyond repetitive manual labor (and perhaps even call centers and some legal research) gets trickier.Take self-driving trucks. Several tests of self-driving trucks led some to wonder how long it will be before the 3.5 million or so truck drivers in the United States were replaced.One day, they may be. But that day is most likely a long way out. A self-driving truck would be prohibitively expensive. That is, if you could buy one. And right now, you can’t.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
