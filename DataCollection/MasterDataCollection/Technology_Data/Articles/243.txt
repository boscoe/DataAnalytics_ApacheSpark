Overhead instructional videos of people making food have swept the internet. Making sliders or onion rings? Such videos online have snagged more than 160 million views each.Behind the craze is one company, writes Farhad Manjoo, the technology columnist for The New York Times: Tasty, a division of BuzzFeed, which has mastered the art of making these videos and regularly churns them out. Tasty has been so successful — and profitable through its brand-sponsored videos — that it is now turning its digital food machine into real-world products.This week, Tasty will start selling Tasty One Top, an app-connected induction cooktop, for example. And last year, Tasty released a made-to-order cookbook.Tasty’s success gives a peek into how social-media-fueled companies can extend their digital properties into other realms, Farhad writes. Just as Hollywood used movies to create ecosystems of products — hit records, toys and other merchandising — now digital media companies can make online content and experiences for people hooked on their phones and sell them a plethora of other products too.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
