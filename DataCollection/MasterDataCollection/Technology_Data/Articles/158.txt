Is there a middle path between working with President Trump and resisting some of his policy ideas?That’s the trail that companies in Silicon Valley are now trying to find. The difficulty was on full display on Wednesday when Intel held an event with the president to announce it will complete an unfinished manufacturing plant in Arizona, just days after it joined nearly 130 other technology companies in a legal brief denouncing Mr. Trump’s immigration ban.For Intel, as for other companies trying to figure out the new political landscape, there are many competing factors to consider. On the one hand, there could be a lot to gain in working with Mr. Trump. As Vindu Goel writes, Intel is in favor of the Trump administration’s tax cut plan. Intel, a company that manufactures a lot of goods in the United States, can also tag along with Mr. Trump’s overall message of revitalizing American manufacturing.But it is a tricky path. Workers in the tech industry overwhelmingly opposed Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and have shown outrage over his immigration ban. The danger for companies that decide to work with Mr. Trump is a revolt from within — from valuable employees who could easily jump ship to other tech firms if they don’t see their bosses being responsive to their concerns.But if its workers aren’t offended, Intel will have won the day: a new plant, some White House-fueled marketing and a promise to employees to fight the president on the issues they really care about. A win for everyone, just as Mr. Trump once promised.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
