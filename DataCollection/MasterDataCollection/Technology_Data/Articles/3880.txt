Management’s aim is to duplicate the small teams and excellent design of Apple, among other things, without Apple’s infamous culture of secrecy.Pearl aims to make products that give older cars some of the features of new vehicles, like backup cameras. It’s a good market to attack: According to a 2015 report by IHS, the average age of cars and light trucks on roads in the United States is now 11.5 years. People keep new cars for six and a half years.Cars are better built than they were in the past, so they wear longer, but that means drivers may miss out on lots of new safety features, particularly as more high-tech software and microcontrollers go inside the vehicles.The Apple work structure, of small teams with lots of accountability for all engineering decisions, makes particular sense when you are selling safety. And, of course, Pearl is not yet considered wildly successful or an iconic designer, so for now at least it is easy to forgo Apple’s secrecy.Based on reviews at a half-dozen websites, Pearl’s first product, the backup camera, seems to have the reception of an Apple product, with high user ratings and a very high price. Pearl’s camera rig is about $500, and there are lots of competitors selling cameras from $60 to $140.That high price may be a big deal when people are looking at something to throw into their older car. There are also complaints about the software, and how well the solar charger works when it is cloudy. On the other hand, the camera can be removed from one vehicle and put on another, meaning the cost could be stretched beyond one vehicle.And software tends to improve, particularly if lower-level employees writing the code have a clear view of what everyone in the company is doing. That’s possible at Pearl, but not at Apple.Advertisement
