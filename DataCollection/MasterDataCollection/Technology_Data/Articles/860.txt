That was abundantly clear this week when two longtime tech stalwarts made moves to change with the times.The first was Intel, which held a developer forum this week, in which the chip maker made numerous announcements including one for a platform called Alloy for virtual reality. Alloy includes a virtual reality headset, combined with other technologies to create immersive experiences. Itâ€™s part of how Intel is changing as it works to reduce its dependence on chips for personal computers, which are less in demand these days, and to look ahead to emerging technologies.Then there was Cisco Systems, a maker of networking equipment such as switches and routers, which on Wednesday said it was cutting nearly 7 percent of its work force, or 5,500 jobs. The latest layoffs come as the San Jose, Calif.-based company tries to diversify away from traditional networking gear and beef up its presence in faster-growing sectors such as security.All of this feeds into a broader landscape of adjustment by some of the once-largest tech companies that bet on areas like PCs that have peaked in popularity or that have since been bypassed by more innovative technologies. Expect more disruption to follow.Advertisement
