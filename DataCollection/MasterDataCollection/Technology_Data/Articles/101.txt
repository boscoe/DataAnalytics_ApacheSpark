American and European officials released details on Monday about a new trans-Atlantic data transfer agreement, prompting a new round of debate about how companies like Google move digital information between the two regions.The pact is the formal version of an agreement hashed out in early February after often-bitter negotiations, revamping the rules for how technology giants like Facebook and other conglomerates like General Electric look up, collect and manage online data, including social media posts, search queries and e-commerce purchases.As part of the new agreement — known as the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield — companies will face stricter rules over how they move people’s digital data from the European Union to the United States. American officials have also agreed to new limits on the powers of the country’s intelligence agencies to gain access to Europeans’ online information when it is transferred to the United States.“The U.S. has different structures to Europe, but both sides offer robust privacy protections,” Penny Pritzker, the United States commerce secretary, said in an interview in February. “The challenge was to show Europe how our system works, because we don’t have a single overriding privacy law.”AdvertisementThe European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, also gave its official backing on Monday after it released a so-called adequacy decision, an official text required to turn the data transfer pact into law.
                The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.            Though the agreement still needs to be ratified by European Union member states, that is not expected to be contentious and is likely to happen in the coming months.AdvertisementEurope’s approval, however, was somewhat offset by a separate document also released on Monday, in which the European Union called on the United States to bolster its domestic privacy rules. Federal efforts to offer new privacy protections have so far produced few new controls for American consumers.The tension between American and European policy makers over privacy rights had caused significant strain as negotiators tried to agree on the new trans-Atlantic data transfer pact, an accord that would underpin billions of dollars of trade between the two regions.“Restoring trans-Atlantic trust is crucial to businesses,” said John Higgins, director general of DigitalEurope, a technology trade group whose members include Google and Microsoft. “We welcome progress towards the adoption of the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Adequacy Decision.”Despite the agreement, privacy campaigners have been quick to balk at the deal, saying that it does not offer Europeans sufficient protections when their data is moved across the Atlantic.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The role would apply to the new Privacy Shield agreement, as well as to other mechanisms used to move European data to the United States, Mr. Kerry added.American intelligence agencies will also face stricter limits on the digital information that they can retrieve on Europeans, while the data transfer agreement provides new legal powers for European citizens who believe either companies or United States government agencies have misused their digital information, according to the American documents released on Monday.Ms. Jourova added, however, that the European Commission would continue to monitor the new deal to ensure that Europeans’ privacy rights — which are viewed as being equal to other rights, such as freedom of expression — would be upheld in the United States.That monitoring would include an annual meeting between Europe and the United States to review the new data. The first meeting is expected to be held in the summer of 2017.“Rules on paper are essential, but they also must be fulfilled,” Ms. Jourova said in an interview in February. “We need ways to check that this works.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
