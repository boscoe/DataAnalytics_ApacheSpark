Yes, even rougher than it has been for most everyone else on Wall Street (though a few energy companies might dispute that claim).The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is down 9.4 percent this year. The index’s technology components are down about 12 percent, and if you are one of the many, many people who have money in giants like Amazon and Netflix, it is safe to say that your portfolio is down even further.Now for the good news: If your money is in those tech giants and not in a smaller company that sells technology or services to businesses, you are probably better off.LinkedIn, the business-focused social network, and Tableau Software, a maker of business software, have both lost more than half their market value over the last week after weaker-than-expected revenue forecasts. Their bad news has dragged down the stocks of other business-oriented tech companies, like Salesforce.On Wednesday, Twitter will announce its highly anticipated financial results for the last three months of 2015. The social media outfit has already lost 40 percent of its market value this year and its shares have been flirting with record lows.If Twitter’s earnings are bad, expect an even bigger hit.Advertisement
