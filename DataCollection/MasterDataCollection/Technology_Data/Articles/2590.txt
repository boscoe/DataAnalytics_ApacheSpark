Different governments have different ways of controlling what information their citizens do or do not see. In recent years, technology — used to do things like blocking websites or choking off social media feeds — has become crucial to those governments’ efforts.Now, some countries are increasingly exercising a form of digital censorship over another tech arena, app stores, by determining what apps should or should not be sold in the stores, writes Farhad Manjoo, the tech columnist for The New York Times.Several examples of this trend have emerged in recent weeks. Last month, China ordered Apple to remove the New York Times apps from its Chinese app store. Russia has asked Apple and Google to pull the LinkedIn app from the country’s app stores. Over the weekend, China also said it would begin to register app stores, asserting a form of control over the marketplaces.All of this illustrates how information has been centralized in the hands of a few major tech companies — Apple and Google in this case — and in turn, how easy it has become for authorities to put pressure on those companies, Mr. Manjoo writes. This goes against how the internet was originally set up as a decentralized and distributed system, he writes, and “suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite — one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
