The company’s shares soared  up 44 percent from their offering price, writes Michael de la Merced, a New York Times reporter for DealBook, giving Snap a market capitalization of around $34 billion.Snap’s one-day jump was notable given plenty of questions about whether the company deserves such a high valuation. James Stewart, the Times’s Common Sense columnist, laid out how some Wall Street types viewed Snap’s valuation with disbelief, especially since the young company loses plenty of money and yet looks expensive versus other more proven web companies, like Facebook.As a result, Snap’s strong debut may encourage other start-ups to go public, and could potentially revive the somewhat moribund market for initial public offerings.As for the men of the hour — Snap’s founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, who created the company just a few years ago when they were at Stanford University and have now become very rich — what did they think of all the hullabaloo?In an interview with The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Spiegel said that Snap’s I.P.O. was exciting — but also acknowledged that he needed to educate people on the value of the company.“We built our business on creativity,” Mr. Spiegel said in the interview. “And we’re going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value.”Advertisement
