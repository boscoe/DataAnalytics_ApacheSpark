Famous for its personal finance and tax software, the Silicon Valley company rose to prominence more than three decades ago as one of the first and most popular makers of PC software.But among people who have spent years in the tech industry, Intuit is just as memorable for being the company that got away from Microsoft in the mid-1990s — a rare moment when Bill Gates’s giant, at the peak of its influence, did not get its way.In 1994, Microsoft tried to acquire the financial software company for $1.5 billion in stock.“In acquiring Intuit, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., is conceding the weakness of its own personal finance software, Money, which has captured only a tiny share of the market since its introduction a couple of years ago,” a 1994 New York Times article said about the deal.Even then, Microsoft was squarely in the cross hairs of antitrust investigators, so to satisfy antitrust concerns, it planned to sell Money to a rival called Novell, which at the time sold PC software that competed with Microsoft’s Office software package.It was not enough. Banks (not to mention other software companies and a few government regulators) were horrified that Microsoft could end up having so much control over personal finance software. The Justice Department sued to block the deal, and it was eventually called off.Microsoft was already the biggest software company in the world in 1994, and it recovered just fine from the failed acquisition, though it never did dominate the market for personal finance software (unlike the market for just about every other kind of PC software). Microsoft stopped selling Money in 2009.More than two decades later, Intuit is reinventing itself for another era of technology: cloud computing. Last month, Intuit sold off its traditional software business. But the company lives on as an online service, and this week, the final few days before taxes are due, is likely to be one of its busiest of the year.Advertisement
