Uber, the world’s dominant ride-hailing service, has gone barely a week this year without making headlines. This week has been no exception.On Wednesday, the trouble-prone company — which is already grappling with crises over a workplace culture rife with harassment and a leaked video of its temperamental chief executive berating an Uber driver — faced a crucial court hearing with a rival, Waymo, over accusations of stolen trade secrets involving driverless-car technology. A ruling in that case is expected soon.The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Uber devised a tool called Greyball to show a fake version of Uber’s app to the authorities. The company’s use of the tool was first reported by The New York Times in March.The federal inquiry was initially disclosed last week by the city of Portland, Ore., in a transportation audit that it published, writes Mike Isaac, a New York Times technology reporter. Portland was one of the cities where Uber had deployed its Greyball tool.After The Times revealed Uber’s use of Greyball, Portland expressed concern and called for an investigation. The city said in its audit report that it had been notified by the United States attorney’s office for the Northern District of California about the existence of the inquiry.Uber has said it discontinued the use of Greyball to evade the authorities in March. Even so, the repercussions from the tool — and the headlines — keep on coming.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
