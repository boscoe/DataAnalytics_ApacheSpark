That’s because Uber’s massive imprint around the world and its disruption of the global transportation industry offer a chance for someone to come in, engineer a turnaround and have a big effect.Of course, that person, whoever it is, will have many hurdles to deal with — not least the presence of Mr. Kalanick on Uber’s board.Still, as one executive recruiter told Mike, the job is attractive for those who have steel nerves. “These people are problem solvers,” the recruiter, Jason Hanold, said. “The hairier a scenario is, the more they’re attracted to trying to fix it.”Advertisement
