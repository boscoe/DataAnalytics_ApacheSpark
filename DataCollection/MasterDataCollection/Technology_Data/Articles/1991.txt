Windows 10 can also display a list of files you have recently opened, as well as Jump Lists of common tasks in certain programs. You can see these lists when you click an app’s icon in the All Apps list on the Start Menu, or right-click the icon for an open app in the Windows taskbar.Right-clicking on an app tile in the Start Menu also shows a list of frequently visited sites or items, along with a Tasks list and a menu to resize the selected tile. If you are running Windows 10 on a touch-screen computer or tablet, press down on the app tile for a second or two and then tap the menu icon in the lower-right corner of the tile to see the same lists. (Although you can pin your most-used apps as tiles in the Start Menu, they can appear in the Most Used lists at the top of the Start Menu.)If you do not see these lists, make sure the option for them is turned on in your Windows settings. Go to the Start Menu to Settings, click the Personalization icon and then click Start in the list along the left side of the window. In the Start settings, click the button to enable “Show recently opened items in Jump Lists on Start or the taskbar.”Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
