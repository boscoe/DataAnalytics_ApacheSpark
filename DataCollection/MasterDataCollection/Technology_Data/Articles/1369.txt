Microsoft devices used to be a joke. Even putting those two words together — Microsoft and devices — would elicit a giggle. After all, Microsoft was good at making software, not at making gadgets.Now, however, there’s been a change.Farhad Manjoo, The New York Times’s technology columnist, recently visited Microsoft’s hardware lab at the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. His conclusion is that Microsoft is now producing some of the most innovative personal computers in the industry, surpassing hardware rivals like Apple.This is not a joke. Sure, Microsoft still has a long way to go to catch up to Apple in PC hardware. But over the past two years, Microsoft has made many advances in PCs, such as its Surface line of computers.Consider the ingenuity of the giant Surface Studio big-screen desktop, which pivots into a kind of digital drafting table. Or the niftiness of the Dial, a palm-size knob that sits on the Surface Studio’s screen and can be used for editing or other features with the turn of the wheel.“It’s unlikely that Microsoft’s PC hardware business will beat Apple’s any time soon,” Farhad writes. “But anyone who cares about the future of the PC should be thrilled that Apple now faces a serious and creative competitor.”We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
