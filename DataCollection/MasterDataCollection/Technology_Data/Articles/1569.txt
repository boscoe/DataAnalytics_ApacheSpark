That is not content. That is a snuff film.On Easter, a man in Cleveland shot and killed another man and posted a video of it to Facebook. The video — and the two hours Facebook took to remove it — provoked intense criticism of the social media giant. Authorities say the man shot himself while fleeing police in Pennsylvania on Tuesday.Facebook is hardly the only social media company struggling to deal with lurid material posted by its users. Twitter and YouTube have struggled to block violent videos and other postings by terrorists. And YouTube has lost a number of advertisers because of its inability to prevent their ads from appearing next to offensive material.There are also many examples of beatings and other assaults that are posted for the amusement of the perpetrators and their friends.Social networks have made great strides in recent years in their efforts to block pornography, and artificial intelligence may help block violent material. But there is no easy answer, other than rigorous self-policing by users. For now, telling a machine to recognize nudity is a lot easier than telling it recognize that an assault is taking place.Advertisement
