Tech reporter Brian X. Chen answered questions about what’s in store for consumer tech 2017.
Hey there. I’m Brian, the lead consumer technology writer (which is a flattering way to say I’m the only consumer tech writer on staff for The Times). I’m here at CES, and I’m excited to take your questions about all things tech. Anything from 4K TV and drones to wireless battery charging and how “smart homes” actually work, just send in your questions below and I’ll be back on Friday at 1 p.m. EST to answer them. 
To get up to speed, here’s a quick rundown of tech trends at the show:    Photo        What to Know About CES 2017  A look at the trends that will matter at this week’s International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: Ultra HD TV, smart home and drones.   The New York Times    A look at the trends that will matter at this week’s International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas: Ultra HD TV, smart home and drones.The New York TimesReady to rock and roll! I’ve survived day one of CES.  Ask me anything.Carlos Silva - Brazil Hello, Sir! I have two questions. First one, what is CES? What could you tell us about 4K TV?It’s pretty ironic but not surprising at all that consumers aren’t aware of what the Consumer Electronics Show is. In a nut, it’s a networking event for tech companies and buyers (such as Best Buy) who are assessing what to put on their shelves this year. 

Lots of tech reporters attend the show to catch a glimpse of what might be coming in the future, but the reality is that the vast majority of what is shown at CES will never hit store shelves because the items are too gimmicky or tough to sell.To answer your second question, it’s basically a resolution that is quadruple the resolution of its predecessor, 1080p. Last year I said it was best to wait to buy a 4K TV because the content available to watch in 4K was very limited and underwhelming and prices were still high.    Photo        Despite the CES Hype, It’s Better to Wait on That 4K TV  Advice for those thinking about buying a 4K television, also called Ultra HD, which has a higher resolution than the current high-definition 1080p TV sets.   The New York Times     This year I’m OK with recommending buying one because prices have dropped a lot (you could spend around $800 for a great 4K TV or $1,300 for an exceptional one) and the content situation has improved, especially on Netflix where I think all its originals are encoded in 4K. Still, if you have an older TV and there’s nothing wrong with it, the longer you can wait to buy a new one, the better.Advice for those thinking about buying a 4K television, also called Ultra HD, which has a higher resolution than the current high-definition 1080p TV sets.The New York TimesRick Merritt - San Jose, CA Hi Brian. CES is famous for surprises and quirky new ideas that can sometimes be pretty interesting. See anything like that?For sure. I saw some pretty ridiculous gadgets yesterday, including a “smart mattress” that repositions itself as you toss and turn at night. If your partner snores, you can raise a part of the mattress to tilt their head and make them stop snoring. You get the picture: It sounds like a nightmare and a terrible product. There’s a video of it here: https://t.co/Jz96T2sA5QHi Brian, I’ve been putting off buying a 4K TV because I’m also interested to see if 4K projector technology will become cheap enough to compete with TV’s anytime soon. Is it reasonable to keep waiting or should I just go for one of the 4K TV’s coming out this hear?This is a great question. The Wirecutter, the product recommendations site that we own, spotted a 4K projector on the show floor: the Optoma UHD60 DLP projector will cost $2800 when it becomes available in May or June of this year. Keep an eye on this one: I think it might suit your needs.Is the DJI Magic the next big thing in drones, like what is the best drone right now?Are there any other drone makers besides DJI that can compete with the inspire 2. Not counting fully custom rigs. To answer both your questions, right now DJI is the most trusted brand in the drone industry. Its closest competitor, 3D Robotics, recently pivoted to focus on commercial drones. And as you probably know, GoPro had to recall its Karma drone last year because of a malfunction causing drones to fall out of the sky, but it still plans to sell drones.There are lots of cheap drones here at CES from unknown Chinese brands, but who knows what their customer service and warranty policies are?  In other words, when it comes to making a confident purchase with a reputed brand that offers a decent warranty, DJI is probably the way to go for now.What technologies are advertisers most focused on there?It’s tough to say because I don’t interview advertisers  but my gut says smart home and AI are hot this year. Amazon’s Alexa is the star of this show. I’ve seen a refrigerator, an oven and a robovacuum that all work with Alexa.Ramesh - Fremont, CA How do “smart homes” actually work?So “smart home” is just a term used to describe internet-connected home appliances like lighting systems, security cameras, locks and doorbells. The products vary on how they work. Some require a hub that you connect to your Wi-Fi router so that the product can talk to the hub to pull an internet connection: the Philips Hue lighting system is a good example. Other products have internet connectivity built into the product itself.The major trend is that tech giants and smart home product makers are working together to make voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri and Google’s Home control smart home products. You can say something like “Alexa, turn off the lights” or “Siri, lock the door.” Voice assistants are making it much easier for average people to control smart home products, which is great news.Has CES lost its spark? I remember being so excited to see all the new media devices and video players debut. Now I don’t even know what to look forward to.I’d say so. CES and trade shows in general (including Macworld Expo) have lost a lot of heft. Tech companies enjoy unveiling and releasing products on their own schedule and promoting them with their own tools including social media. So in the last five years or so CES has ceased to be a venue of major tech news and has evolved into more of a networking event between tech companies, retailers and media.That said, it’s not a total lost cause. I’d say CES is a nice way to get a peek at what’s coming for TVs if you’re interested in buying a new TV this holiday season, or home appliances like refrigerators.Can you tell us about any virtual assistants on the market this year? Anything new and different? (This can extend to smart homes too)Hi, Aly. I didn’t see any new virtual assistants announced here, but what’s interesting is that so many companies are teaming up with Amazon’s Alexa to build compatibility with the Amazon Echo. As I mentioned to another reader, think smart refrigerators, robo vacuums and more. That’s definitely exciting for virtual assistants in general, and it seems Amazon is going to lead the pack when it comes to smart home accessories.Seems like mesh networking has arrived in earnest. Previously limited to the military, it’s everywhere at CES – from mesh-enabled wifi like Eero to off-grid long-range mesh like goTenna Mesh. Are you bullish?John, I do like mesh networking. Setting up multiple access points throughout the home makes sense in an era when we carry multiple internet-connected devices around the home, including tablets and smartphones. I like how systems like Eero and Google Wifi use apps that make it easy for people with little technical know-how to set up a mesh network.Is all the hype about Alexa’s new integrations in partner products substantiated in your opinion? What do you think the coolest new voice or AI product is?Joanna, there is definitely a lot of hype around Alexa and home products. I do think some of these products will fade away because they are gimmicky. I can’t imagine needing Alexa to control a smart refrigerator, for instance. I do think the more boring stuff like lighting kits have more potential in the long term:  when things become boring in the tech industry, they are maturing.Hi, what is the difference between OLED and HDR. I hear these terms thrown around all of the time as the future of TV’s, but what do they actually mean and are they worth investing?Tanner, OLED, for organic LED, is a pixel technology for the screen. HDR, for high dynamic range, is a  software feature that enhances the color and contrast of  a picture. The consensus right now is that OLED TVs look better than anything on the market, and HDR does make videos look more vibrant and vivid.I would add that OLED TVs are also the most expensive on the market. LG’s 65-incher last year, for example, cost around $5,000.Are any products focusing on consumer privacy issues that arise out of “smart home” technologies?Meeki, regarding consumer privacy issues in the smart home, I think Apple is probably the most focused on this. It’s a bit more complex for smart home accessory makers to make devices compatible with Apple’s HomeKit framework, because it sometimes requires embedding custom chips that communicate with an Apple device via an encrypted channel.With Apple removing the headphone jack on the latest products, are the other companies going to follow and force us to go 100% Bluetooth?  What happens to my old corded devices like my Bose headphones?Frank, from what I saw, there weren’t any major smartphones unveiled at CES, so it’s tough to tell. I do think companies like Samsung will follow suit with high-end smartphones and move away from the headphone jack in order to compete with Apple. But I think lower-end phones will always have the headphone jack.What are you seeing in terms of AR glasses, there is lots of promises. Anything of interest on the show floor ? Gus, the focus on this year’s CES continues to be on virtual reality, not so much AR. The upshot is that VR is poised to get cheaper this year. Lenovo showed a headset at CES for less than $400, which is much cheaper than the HTC Vive, which cost $800.Is anyone talking about security or privacy when it comes to the Internet of Things?Aseem, in my conversations with smart home accessory makers, they seem to think that the concerns about security will shift away from DDOS attacks and more toward concern about the tech giants and their business models.For example, consumers might be more skeptical about what Google is doing with the data you share with it when using an always-on speaker like Google Home.Are there any new remarkable household robots? Anything that combines Alexa-like capabilities and house-hold robots?Jon, yes, there was an Alexa-controlled robovacuum from Samsung.  http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/12/28/14099720/samsung-powerbot-vr7000-robot-vacuum-cleaner-amazon-echo Still, I question how useful that would be.Do you get the sense that curved TVs are sticking around, or are they a gimmick most of us will have forgotten about in 10 years?Steve, I don’t like curved TVs. I tested a Samsung curved television in my home for weeks and it just looked ridiculous, and there were no benefits to the screen being curved. I do hope that consumers avoid buying them so that they go away.Brian - any interesting consumer trends you can gather based on what is being shown most there?Eliot, the most relevant trend I see is that 4K is getting close to replacing 1080p. The next TV you buy will probably be a 4K set, whether you care about 4K or not. The 1080P television sets that manufacturers continue to sell have low-quality features, so 1080P is quickly becoming obsolete.The other relevant trend I see is that home appliance makers are getting more adventurous with the so-called “internet of things” - that is, hooking up appliances like ovens, refrigerators and vacuum cleaners to the internet. Personally I would love to have an internet-controlled oven to preheat the oven before I come home, but I wonder how many of these products will be gimmicks that consumers don’t care for.Hi Brian! What companies should I keep an eye for when it comes to some sweet new camera tech?Anna, there weren’t very many announcements about cameras at CES. Panasonic introduced the GH5 mirrorless camera, which includes 4K video, among other features.The Wirecutter highlighted that camera and a few other products from CES that might realistically be worth buying in this post: http://thewirecutter.com/blog/some-things-we-might-buy-in-2017-a-realists-guide-to-ces/When does Google wifi router actually ship? and how does the new Linksys velop router launched at CES compare?Shanx, Google Wifi is already shipping. But I thought it was a pretty slow router and the Eero is better. The Linksys Velop looks very similar and I’ll probably test it alongside other mesh systems when I can get my hands on it.What do you think will be the most disruptive innovation in day-to-day life that was seen at CES?Meg, hmm, disruptive innovation…I think the most impactful innovation at CES is probably the least disruptive kind. That is, when technology gets more commonplace and “boring,” it is the best time to buy it because technology companies have taken years to work out all the kinks. The example I would give is mesh networking. Wi-Fi is really boring stuff, but still a common headache for everyone, and mesh networking helps solve that problem.Our company is considering to purchase a drone to record our trees from up above, which company would you recommend?TreeWorld, I would probably take a look at DJI. As I mentioned to other readers, it’s one of the more trusted drone makers.Did you notice any trends towards greater accuracy in wearable sensors (e.g. heart rate, etc)?Dan, I have seen that wearable makers are starting to focus on heart rate instead of step counts. The theory is that heartrate can tell us much more about your health whereas step counts just give you an approximation on calories burned.Anything TRULY new in the smart phone world in 2017?WX, new smartphones from the biggest phone companies — Samsung and Apple — get announced later in the year. Samsung usually announces a new Galaxy flagship around March, and Apple typically introduces new iPhones in September. The two companies continue to dominate the phone market, but in China there are lots of compelling new devices coming from Xiaomi and Huawei, though these usually get announced around March at the trade show Mobile World Congress.Thoughts on the RAZER laptop with two horizontal fold-out screens (total of 3 screens)?  Well-built?  Laptop performance?SF Architect, the Razer is an interesting concept but I’m skeptical about its commercial success. Will gamers buy it? Maybe, but why not just buy a desktop computer? It weighs 11 pounds, which is going to be a pain for people like architects to carry around from site to site.A photo here for reference: https://www.wired.com/2017/01/razers-project-valerie-insane-laptop-3-screens/Thanks, everyone, for your thoughtful questions! I hope you enjoyed this quick crash course on CES.Advertisement
