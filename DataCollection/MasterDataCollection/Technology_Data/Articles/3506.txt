Perhaps now is not the time to bring up crass things like profits and losses, but it is at least interesting to note that the social media tool at the center of civic engagement in the United States is run by a profitless company.Yes, we’re talking about Twitter. President Trump still uses it. Often. Perhaps you’ve heard about that. And as Farhad Manjoo writes, protesters are using Twitter to essentially create flash protests — as we saw with largely leaderless rallies at airports around the country over the weekend.Yet, for all the attention paid to it, Twitter still doesn’t turn a profit. Or, at least, it hasn’t so far. And when the company releases its next earnings report on Feb. 9, analysts predict it won’t have made any money in the last quarter of 2016. In fact, they expect Twitter to lose 11 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research.That Twitter can’t make money when the whole world is paying attention to tweets has to be a source of endless frustration for the company. But it may well be that for a company that mostly depends on advertising for its revenue, notoriety and controversy aren’t necessarily good business.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
