 Q. How do you unblock a number that had been previously blocked on the iPhone 6?A. If you have had a change of heart about who can contact you, one way to unblock the banished soul is to open the iPhone’s Settings app on the Home screen, scroll down the list and tap Phone. In the Calls area of the Phone settings screen, tap Blocked to see the list of numbers and contacts you have barred.On the Blocked screen, swipe to the left on an entry; you should see a red Unblock button for that number. If you have multiple numbers you want to unblock, tap the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the screen. You can now go down the list tapping numbers to get the Unblock button instead of swiping across each entry.For those unfamiliar with caller management in iOS 9, you can block calls from specific telephone numbers, as well as from people trying to pester you through Apple’s FaceTime and iMessage services. You just need to add the caller’s telephone number or contact name to your Blocked list. (Unfortunately, Apple does not allow you to add “unknown” numbers to your Blocked list, but you can find instructions for possible workarounds on many iOS-themed websites, or third-party apps that may help.)In iOS 9, when you have received a call from someone you wish to block, open the Phone app and tap the Recents icon at the bottom of the screen to see the list of your recent call activity. When you find the name or number in the list, tap the encircled “i” icon to the right of the entry. Flick down to the bottom of the contact screen for that number and tap Block This Caller.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
