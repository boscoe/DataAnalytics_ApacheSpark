Is there a way to close all of these at once instead of having to tap them off one by one?A. The procedure for closing all open Chrome browser tabs has changed over the years, but on most recent Android tablets, press down on the “x” on the end of any open tab. Leave your finger on the tab until the Close All Tabs option appears on screen and then select that option to shut down all of the open pages.Although Google’s instructions for closing all tabs in the iPad version of the Chrome browser entail manually tapping each one closed, the iPhone edition has a quicker solution. In Chrome on an iPhone (or an Android handset), go to the top of the browser window and tap the small square with the number in the middle, which indicates the number of open tabs. On the next screen, tap the menu button in the upper-right corner and choose Close All Tabs.Apple’s own Safari browser for iOS 10 lets you close all the open page tabs in the same way for the iPad or the iPhone (and iPod Touch). Just tap the Tabs icon — which looks like two overlapping squares; it lives at the top of the iPad screen, or in the bottom-right corner for the iPhone version. When the device displays thumbnail versions of all your open tabs, press and hold the Done button in the corner until you see a menu with the option to close all open tabs.Microsoft’s touch-screen browsers have a similar shortcut when you press and hold the “x” on an open tab. In both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer on a Windows 10 tablet, you should get a drop-down menu with the option to close the other tabs.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
