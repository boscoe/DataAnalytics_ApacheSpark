Gone, it seems, are the days of brass-knuckled antitrust investigations and — other than a fight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over encryption — threats of tougher regulations.Now in Europe, that’s another story. On Tuesday, the European Union’s competition authorities ruled that Apple will have to pay 13 billion euros, or about $14.5 billion, plus interest, in back taxes to the Irish government. Antitrust officials argue that the Irish government gave Apple preferential treatment on its local taxes from 1991 to 2007.The Irish government said it would move to appeal the decision and Apple can support that appeal in a process that could take years. But the decision is likely to stir charges that the E.U. is overreaching.Apple is not the only American company being targeted by European regulators. Google, which has largely escaped antitrust concerns in the United States, could still face competition concerns across the Atlantic. Facebook’s run-ins with local privacy regulators are near routine. And law enforcement in various European countries, like their American counterparts, are indicating they would like to limit the use of encryption in technology products.The source of some of these European concerns? American companies like the review site Yelp that believe their complaints have been ignored in their own country.Advertisement
