Uber abandoned its land war in China. Can it win a legal fight in Europe?A European court on Tuesday will hear arguments on how the ride-hailing service is regulated. If it determines that Uber is a transportation service, Uber will have to obey strict labor and safety rules and comply with laws covering traditional taxi services.This, of course, is something Uber would like to avoid. Uber, perhaps to the surprise of the many people who use it, argues that it is a digital platform. That’s an important distinction. If Uber is declared an “information society service,” it will face fewer restrictions on services throughout Europe.Europeans have not always welcomed Uber. Taxi drivers in Paris and other cities have protested the company’s presence and — like taxi drivers in many American cities — have argued that Uber drivers have an unfair advantage because they are not as heavily regulated.A ruling is not expected until March, at the earliest.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
