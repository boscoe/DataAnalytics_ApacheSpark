You can see the “permissions” — the hardware and software on a device that a particular app is allowed to use — in the Settings area. In Android 6.0, you can get there quickly by using two fingers to swipe down from the top of the tablet’s screen to open the Quick Settings box, and then tapping the gear-shaped Settings icon. In the Device area of the Settings screen, tap Apps.On the list of apps that appears, tap the one you want to see. The App Info screen that will appear displays the permissions info for that app. In Android 6.0 and later versions, most devices will have permissions for Body Sensors, Calendar, Camera, Contacts, Location, Microphone, Phone, SMS and Storage.You can control the permissions for all your apps here as well. On the App Info screen, tap the Permissions line for the app to manually turn off (or on) parts of the tablet the app can use. Keep in mind that turning off certain permissions could hinder the app’s ability to fully function.The App Info screen also shows other tidbits about the program, like how much data it has used, what kind of notifications it can display on your device, and how much storage and memory it takes up on your tablet. You can delete an app’s stored or cached data on your tablet by selecting Storage on the App Info screen, or change the alerts it can show by selecting Notifications. You can corral a misbehaving app on the App Info screen as well — just use the Uninstall or Force Stop buttons.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
