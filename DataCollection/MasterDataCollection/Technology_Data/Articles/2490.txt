Ever since, it has been buffeted by competition from Facebook.Facebook, the world’s largest social network, has been systematically copying many of Snapchat’s features for its own apps, including the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp. That has raised fears that Snap cannot compete — after all, Facebook, with about two billion users of its main social network alone, has many more times the number of users than Snap.But Snap still has some distinctive edges, writes Katie Benner, a technology reporter at The New York Times. One of those is Discover, the media-related section of Snapchat where publishers put videos and stories to appeal to the messaging app’s mostly young audience.After a slow start, some publishers are gaining traction on Discover and making money off it, Ms. Benner writes. And Snapchat has also pushed for the content on Discover to be high quality — all of which may be difficult for Facebook to replicate.How Discover may be helping Snapchat may be on display on Wednesday when Snap will deliver its first earnings report as a public company.Advertisement
