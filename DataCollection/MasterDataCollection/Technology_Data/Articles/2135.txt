A parent or teacher might wonder at the world of cyberthieves and hackers and think, “If only they used all that brain power for something positive.”On Tuesday, White Ops, a security company that specializes in tracking online advertising, released an astonishing report about a ring of thieves based in Russia that created a huge number of fake news sites meant to look like real news sites and hundreds of thousands of bots meant to act like real users.The point: to fool advertisers into thinking they were paying to appear on real sites and reach real users. The plan appears to have worked, bilking as much as $5 million a day, Vindu Goel writes.It is a scam admirable for its complexity, if not its morality.Much has been written in the last few years about why people hack computer networks. Some do it out of curiosity. Some for pay. Some to create mischief. Some out of a sense of patriotism to whatever country they live in.But there is no confusion that money motivated the thieves who created this Potemkin village of online advertising.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
