That’s how much may soon be knocked off the price that Verizon, the telecom giant, will pay to acquire the fading internet pioneer, write Michael de la Merced and Vindu Goel.Verizon agreed last year to buy Yahoo for $4.8 billion. But that was before Yahoo revealed that it had suffered a breach of 500 million user accounts in 2014, and before it disclosed another even larger breach of one billion accounts that took place in 2013.Both breaches were hugely embarrassing episodes that prompted many on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley to question why Verizon would want to buy Yahoo at all. Some thought Verizon might use the hacking as leverage to lower the price — or perhaps walk away from the purchase altogether.Now we know that the deal remains in play, though the purchase price is set to be lower and the two companies are expected to share legal responsibility and costs for the data breaches. And for Yahoo, a $300 million discount is better than no acquisition at all.Advertisement
