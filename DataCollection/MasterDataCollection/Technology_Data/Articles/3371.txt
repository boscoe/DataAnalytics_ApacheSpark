The tech industry has been up in arms about President Trump’s immigration moves. That shows no signs of abating anytime soon.For more than a week, tech companies have been denouncing the president’s executive orders to bar refugees and others from seven countries that are predominantly Muslim. Tech workers have staged protests, Uber employees asked their chief executive to consider stepping down from a presidential economic advisory council (he eventually did), and tech leaders have spoken out against the immigration actions. On Sunday, nearly 100 companies joined the court fight against those actions.The furor is set to continue if, as expected, Mr. Trump signs an executive order concerning H-1B visa holders, who typically are skilled foreign workers. These types of workers have been critical to the tech industry, which has long lamented a shortage of engineers with the right kinds of skills.But the debate over H-1B visas is not cut and dry. Daisuke Wakabayashi and Nelson D. Schwartz, reporters at The New York Times, found that some American tech workers think that people with H-1Bs have unfairly helped displace them. Others say the influx of people with H-1Bs has put downward pressure on salaries. The issue is thorny, spurring a variety of suggestions for how to overhaul the visa program.The next move is Mr. Trump’s.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
