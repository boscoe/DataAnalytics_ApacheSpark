I went to Settings and chose Internet Explorer as the default. However, I still get Edge when I click the “e.” How do I place the Internet Explorer symbol at the bottom left of the screen, so that I get Internet Explorer when I click that symbol?A. That small “e” icon in the Windows 10 taskbar is actually the shortcut for the Microsoft Edge browser, so clicking it will always open Edge. If you prefer Microsoft’s previous browser, Internet Explorer, you can pin its icon to the taskbar and remove the one for Edge.To pin Internet Explorer to your taskbar, open the Start menu, find Internet Explorer in your Apps list, right-click (or press down) its icon and choose Pin to Taskbar from the menu. To remove the Edge icon, right-click its icon in the taskbar and select “Unpin this program from taskbar.”Choosing Internet Explorer as the default means it should be the browser that pops open automatically when programs send you online or you click web links in email messages; however, Cortana search and some Windows 10 apps still use Edge. For those wanting to demote Edge in favor of a different browser, select the Start button, go to the Search box and enter “default app settings” — or tell Cortana to search for them.Select the Default Apps result from the results and when the Settings box opens, scroll to the Web Browser section and choose Internet Explorer (or your preferred installed browser) from the list. If you find Edge has reclaimed the default status after an update or restart, try opening your preferred browser and selecting it as the default from within its own settings.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
