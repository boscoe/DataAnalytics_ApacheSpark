Q. What does it mean when Waze makes a car horn noise at you?A. While Waze is primarily known as a traffic and driving-directions smartphone app with up-to-the-minute crowdsourced information about your route, it also includes some chatty social-media features that let you connect with other drivers. One of these features is a salutation called the “Beep Beep” — a car horn that you hear through the app when another Wazer user has reached out to greet you.As part of Waze’s social toolbox, you can link your phone’s contacts list (or your Facebook or Twitter accounts) in the program’s settings. The app matches up verified phone numbers from your contacts list while noting your acquaintances who are also using the service — and then provides an icon you can tap to make friends again in Waze World.Once you have started a friends list within Waze, you can share your location, announce arrival times, exchange private messages and beep at your buddies. To send a Beep Beep to a friend (when you are not actively driving, of course), open the Waze app, tap the magnifying glass in the corner of the screen and then tap your user name at the top of the next screen. Select the My Friends list, tap the name of the person there you want to greet and tap Beep Beep from the menu. You can also swipe to the left over a friend’s name in the list to get to the Beep Beep option.If you have not set up a Waze friends list, odds are another Waze user nearby sent you the greeting out of the blue. To do that (while stopped), find a user on the Waze navigation map you are using and tap the icon. In the box that pops up, tap the Beep button.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
