Q. How do you find Google Cardboard versions of YouTube videos?A. YouTube has a dedicated collection of 360-degree virtual reality videos on its site that you can watch on your smartphone with Google Cardboard or a similar virtual reality viewer. In the site’s search box, search for the hashtag “#360video” to get an idea of the panoramic virtual reality clips that are available. You can find nature scenes, a holiday tour of the White House and “The Hunger Games Virtual Reality Experience,” among the 360-degree offerings.Last fall, it was announced on the YouTube blog that all videos on the site would have a version that worked with Google Cardboard. When you have a video open in the YouTube app that you want to watch in the viewer, tap the menu icon in the corner of the screen and choose the “View in Cardboard” option (Android) or tap the Cardboard icon (iOS).The video’s screen then splits into two smaller stereoscopic versions of the scene, so when you put the smartphone in the Cardboard viewer to watch it, it feels vaguely like watching a movie in a dark theater. Unlike videos that were designed to be true 360-degree virtual reality productions, these Cardboard-mode clips do not give you the ability to look all around the scene in a panoramic view with a sense of depth perception.If you have a Google Cardboard viewer and an Android smartphone, you can easily create your own virtual reality content for your viewer. Just download one of the virtual reality camera apps from the Google Play store (including Google’s own Cardboard Camera) and follow the instructions for making your own 360-degree photos.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
