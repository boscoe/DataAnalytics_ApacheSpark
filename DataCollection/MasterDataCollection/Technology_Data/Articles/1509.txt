The New York Times recently spoke with more than two dozen women in the technology start-up industry about sexual harassment, provoking a range of reactions with their accounts.Sarah Kunst, an entrepreneur who told The Times about an unwanted advance from Dave McClure, a founder of 500 Startups and an investor, wrote on Twitter that several women had shared similar stories of harassment involving Mr. McClure:
            Story went live only a few hours ago and so far 2 more women have told me they had similar/worse experiences with @davemcclure. Both WOC.        Mr. McClure apologized for his behavior shortly afterward:
            I’m a Creep. I’m Sorry. https://t.co/ptO1mgubFZ by @davemcclure cc @500Startups And he announced his resignation on Monday:
            in best interest of @500Startups & at request co-founder @christine_tsai, i am resigning effective immediately. pls support christine/500 ❤️        Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist with Lowercase Capital, wrote a blog post on Thursday about sexual harassment and female entrepreneurs, then updated the post after it was heavily criticized:
            Thank you for your thoughts. I tried to answer a few of your questions in an update. https://t.co/QrBaNaC9M3 https://t.co/b4OULzMvKd Several women wrote on Twitter about being harassed by other tech executives, including Marc Canter, a start-up adviser, whose suggestive messages to Wendy Dent, an executive with the start-up Cinemmerse, were reviewed by The Times:
            Horrified but not surprised by Marc Canter's justification of his sexual harassment. He propositioned me for a threesome many times.        Susan J. Fowler, whose account of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation at Uber led to internal investigations that spurred the resignation of Uber’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, encouraged women who had been subjected to sexual harassment to speak up:
            I'm getting DMs from women who are considering speaking up. Reporters, please reply to this thread if you cover sexism etc in academia https://t.co/NNGmHsfOxK Many people spoke of the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in the tech industry and about their frustration with what they said was its failure to address the problem:
            Keep in mind, we're not hearing the worst VC sexual misconduct stories, just the ones that won't get the targets sued for defamation.        
            The only thing that surprises me about the latest round of revelations is women being brave enough to speak out. Remember the cost to them.        
            Folks speaking up about bias in SV *only* when folks get caught is disconcerting beyond belief. It is a pattern.        
            Retaliation against and silencing of women in the tech industry is very real. https://t.co/fBPLjzyBf9 
            Let's work together to improve SV culture. @jfonstad & I just published #BoostOpportunityPledge https://t.co/S8oHCjsdTN 
            if you've thanked someone who has harassed people for their apology but not mentioned a word of support for those who spoke up? i see you. pic.twitter.com/kmHWbKuRGb 
            these women are so brave. they are speaking up bc the problems are systemic across the tech industry. https://t.co/G9TqW83Kbr We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
