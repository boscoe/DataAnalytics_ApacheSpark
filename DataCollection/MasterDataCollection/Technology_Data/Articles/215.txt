It’s a phenomenon bedeviling more technologists these days, as machine learning start-ups sprout and giant tech companies including Google and Facebook dive headlong into A.I. It can play into our worst fears about artificial intelligence — here’s a list of creepy uncanny valley moments — and has even spawned a futuristic play.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
