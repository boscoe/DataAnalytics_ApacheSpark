In fact, his base of power wasn’t even in Silicon Valley. He kept offices in the quiet of San Francisco’s Presidio, an idyllic former Army base overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.But last year, the world got to know who Peter Thiel is. First, there was the revelation that he was the financial backer behind the ruinous lawsuit Terry Bollea (also known as Hulk Hogan) filed against Gawker Media. Then Mr. Thiel became the tech industry’s most vocal supporter of Donald J. Trump’s “America First” presidential campaign.Of course, with a higher profile comes additional scrutiny, leading to the recent revelation that Mr. Thiel was granted citizenship in New Zealand in 2011. “I am happy to say categorically that I have found no other country that aligns more with my view of the future than New Zealand,” Mr. Thiel wrote in his application, according to a New York Times article by David Streitfeld and Jacqueline Williams.That love of New Zealand might seem strange to people who have taken Mr. Trump’s promises to heart.Advisers to Mr. Thiel, who is a German immigrant to the United States, wrote to the New Zealand government that Mr. Thiel believed “citizenship is irrevocable.”“It is the public recognition of a hallowed bond,” they said. “For that reason and others, he is prepared to make this solemn allegiance and to hereby embrace and contribute to the life, history and culture of New Zealand.”Advertisement
