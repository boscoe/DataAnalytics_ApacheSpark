When trying to understand what’s wrong with the culture at the giant start-up Uber, it’s helpful to remember an old expression: A fish rots from the head first.Over the weekend, a former engineer at the ride-hailing company wrote a  blog post about her experiences of sexual harassment and the indifference managers at Uber displayed.The company’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has opened an internal investigation into what happened and has brought in the board member Arianna Huffington and the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. to look into harassment issues and the human resources department.But as Mike Isaac wrote, the problem started with the freewheeling environment Mr. Kalanick created at his company. That goes beyond wild parties in Las Vegas (although those have happened, too, Mike writes).AdvertisementMr. Kalanick created a ruthless meritocracy in which high-achievers are rewarded and underachievers are shown the door — fast. A rough environment like that can help a company grow fast and quickly overcome the innumerable problems a start-up is likely to face.AdvertisementBut there’s a big downside: Results count more than people. At Uber, it seems, being a top performer meant that a colleague in human resources was more likely to make excuses for poor behavior than issue a reprimand.Mr. Kalanick has promised to learn what’s gone wrong with his company’s culture.The exact root of the “fish rots from the head” phrase isn’t clear, although some think its origins go all the way back to ancient Greece. Mr. Kalanick can take heart in one thing: There is little biological evidence to indicate that the proverb is actually true. Every part of a rotting fish — tail, head and fins — would most likely rot at about the same rate.But it would rot all the same.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
