Whither the science fair?That is likely to be the question provoked on Wednesday by Intel, the Silicon Valley chip company that is dropping the sponsorship of yet another science fair that it once backed.Specifically, Intel plans to stop sponsoring the International Science and Engineering Fair, writes Steve Lohr, a New York Times technology reporter. That follows the company’s decision last year to end its support for the national Science Talent Search, a marquee event.Science fairs have been a rite of passage for many students over the years, a way to encourage science-minded youths with contests and the prestige of prizes. Whether top technology companies should still sponsor science fairs, and how they should promote the education of the tech work force of the future, is less clear.Even among some current and former Intel executives, there is disagreement on these issues. While the dropping of science fair sponsorships has been approved by Intel’s chief executive, Brian Krzanich, a former Intel chief executive, Craig Barrett, said he takes issue with the decision. Mr. Barrett said Intel may appear like “a company of the past” by ending its support of science fairs that nurture the youthful innovators of the future.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
