Q. Can I set Opera as the main browser on my Android 6.0 tablet, so links from email open in that program instead of Google Chrome?A. You can change your tablet’s default web browser program from Chrome to Opera in your Android 6.0 settings. To do so, tap the All Apps button at the bottom of the tablet’s home screen and swipe from right to left until you see the Settings app. Open it. (Alternatively, you can use two fingers to swipe down from the top edge of the tablet’s screen to open the Quick Settings box, and then tap the gear-shaped icon to directly open the Settings app.)On the Settings screen, tap the Apps icon. On the Apps screen, tap the small gear-shaped icon in the top right corner. When the Configure Apps screen opens, tap Default Apps. Tap the Browser App line. In the window that opens, select Opera or any other installed browser on your tablet to use as your default program for web surfing. Once you make your selection, you should see it listed under Browser App back on the Default Apps screen.Depending on your Android device and the software you have installed, you can also pick new default programs for other functions like Assist & Voice Input, SMS and the Phone apps.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
