Alton Sterling, a black man fatally shot by the police in Baton Rouge, La., was also in the top 10.#InternationalWomensDay gathered discussion about gender in March, while #LoveIsLove — a declaration associated with equal rights for gay people that Barack Obama used as Americans held pride parades — was popular in June.Twitter users publicly mourned mass-casualty attacks with #PrayForOrlando and #PrayForNice, while discussion of Brexit, a coup attempt in Turkey and the Panama Papers also made the top 10.AdvertisementBut #Election2016 was the leading discussion of the year and the subject of most of the most widely shared political tweets of the year.What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

            "To all the little girls watching...never doubt that you are valuable and powerful & deserving of every chance & opportunity in the world."        Ms. Clinton’s tweet was the third-most popular tweet of the year in any subject, falling behind one by a Spanish video gamer and one from Harry Styles quoting Taylor Swift.

That was slightly more retweets than Mr. Trump got this year on an early-morning tweet after winning the election.
