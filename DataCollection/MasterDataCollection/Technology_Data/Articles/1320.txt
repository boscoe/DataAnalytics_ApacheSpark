The industry’s clichés don’t project compliance.But there does appear to be an unwritten rule for tech execs: Don’t get too cozy with President Trump. On Thursday, Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, told his employees in an email that he is backing out of an advisory panel to the president, Mike Isaac writes in The New York Times.“Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” Mr. Kalanick told his employees.Here’s a quick recap: Mr. Kalanick, along with other tech executives like Elon Musk and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM, agreed to join Mr. Trump’s advisory council. In normal times, being among the small handful of tech executives on such a panel would be considered a coup.But these are not normal times.Mr. Kalanick was already being criticized for joining the panel when, over the weekend, the company told its customers that surge pricing had been turned off at Kennedy Airport in New York. The move was interpreted as an attempt to attract business after taxi drivers briefly halted service to J.F.K. The cabdrivers were protesting Mr. Trump’s executive order blocking immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries.Within days, hundreds of thousands of Uber customers deleted their accounts and company employees questioned why Mr. Kalanick needed to embrace such a controversial role — even as the company’s executives argued that it was being unfairly targeted.That brings us to Thursday, when Mr. Kalanick quit the council. Will Mr. Musk and Ms. Rometty soon face the same pressure?Advertisement
