Q. How do I change the name and password of my home wireless network? I have an AirPort router and use a Mac, but I don’t see anywhere to do this in the system’s network settings.A. If you are using one of Apple’s AirPort base stations (including the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule models), you can use the AirPort Utility app for OS X, Windows or iOS to manage your wireless network’s settings. Some systems include the AirPort Utility, or you may have installed the program when the AirPort router was set up; you can also download the software from Apple’s website.On the Mac, search for the AirPort Utility with the Spotlight search tool built into OS X, or open the Applications folder, and you’ll find it tucked inside the Utilities subfolder. Once you locate the program, start it up.The AirPort Utility should open to a graphical screen that shows an icon of your AirPort router. Click on the icon to open a box of network information, and then click on the Edit button at the bottom of the box. Depending on your base station configuration, you may have to enter the password for the AirPort device itself to get to the settings. (If you have forgotten the base station’s password, you can do a soft reset on the device by pressing the reset button on the back of the AirPort and then use the AirPort Utility app to reset your password.)Once you have the settings box open, click the Wireless tab. Here, you can change the name of the network, its security level and its password. If you do not want the name of your network to be visible in the public list of available networks that Wi-Fi-enabled gadgets can see, click the Wireless Options button in the box and select the option to create a hidden network; this action hides the name of the network from view, and people wishing to log on to it will have to know its exact name to find the network in their device’s wireless settings.Once you have finished making changes, click the Update button in the settings box. The AirPort base station takes a few minutes to apply the changes, and then it should reflect the new network name and password.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
