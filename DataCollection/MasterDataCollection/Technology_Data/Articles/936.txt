Q. If I have my phone’s location setting turned on and I post a picture from my house on Twitter, can people get my address from the coordinates in the photo data?A. According to Twitter, even if you have your phone’s location-services feature enabled, the service simply uses any embedded coordinates to suggest places you can use for tagging the image to a particular area. The company says it does not store the EXIF data (embedded information from the camera, which can include GPS coordinates if available) from a photo you add to a Twitter post. It also says EXIF data is not available to people who see the photo attached to your tweet.While Twitter may strip out the EXIF data from any picture you send from your account, you can share your location voluntarily when posting a photo. To do so, just select the map pin icon in the box when composing a post.If you want to remove location information from previous posts, log in to your account on Twitter.com and click on the Privacy & Safety option in your account settings. In the Tweet Location area, click the “Delete location information” button and then on Save Changes.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
