Technology products often go through a hype cycle: It starts with excessive enthusiasm (the hype), then it moves into a period of disillusionment (the anger). And, finally, reality.As Nick Wingfield writes, virtual reality gadgets — perhaps the most hyped new consumer electronics category of the last few years — appear to be sliding into that period of disillusionment. That’s not to say virtual reality won’t be a hit. Just not quite yet. At least not until there’s more virtual reality content available and the cost of equipment comes down.When Facebook acquired the start-up Oculus for $2 billion nearly three years ago, the assumption was that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief, was betting on the next big thing in technology. Others followed suit. Last year, $1.48 billion was invested in start-ups focused on virtual reality and a related technology called augmented reality, compared with $331 million the previous year, estimated PitchBook, a financial data firm. As Nick writes, many of the start-ups were funded before the headsets became available to the public.But virtual reality enthusiasts can take heart: The one type of virtual reality product that appears to have been popular over the holidays is the more affordable goggles that work with smartphones.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
