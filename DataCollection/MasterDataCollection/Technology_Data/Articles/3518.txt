Who has the hot hand in venture capital?To identify today’s top venture investors, CB Insights, a research firm that tracks the venture capital industry, created a data-driven list. The firm based its report on factors like connectedness, since people with access to the best information hear about hot companies first, and exits, meaning the returns generated when a start-up is sold or goes public. For exits, the firm considered the valuation and when the investor first put money into the company.Investments in start-ups with valuations of $1 billion or more, dubbed unicorns, were not weighted too heavily since many of the gains on those companies have not yet been realized. CB Insights’ list spotlights the top 100 venture capitalists; we have excerpted the top 20 here, along with a selection of their deals.
