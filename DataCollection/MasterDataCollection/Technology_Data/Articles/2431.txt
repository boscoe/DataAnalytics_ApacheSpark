Q. Is there a way to change where Microsoft Edge puts downloaded files?A. Although the first versions of the Microsoft Edge browser did not have an easy, direct way to pick a new location to collect files downloaded from the web, last summer’s Windows Anniversary Update includes a setting to do so. (If you are not sure if your computer has all the latest Windows software, go to the Start menu to Settings, select Update & Security, then Windows Update and Check For Updates.)By default, Microsoft Edge deposits files in the Downloads folder inside your user folder. To change the destination for your downloads, open the browser and select the More (…) menu in the upper-right corner of the window. At the bottom of the More menu, choose Settings.On the Settings panel, click or tap the View Advanced Settings button. In the Downloads area, select the Change button. When the next window opens, navigate to the folder you want to use and click the Select Folder button. The files you download in the future should land in your newly chosen location.Other browsers for Windows, including Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, have traditionally allowed users to change the default location for downloaded files. You should be able to pick a preferred location for your file downloads in each application’s settings.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
