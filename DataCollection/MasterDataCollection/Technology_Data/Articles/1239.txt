Windows 7 made it simple to see all the available wireless networks around me by clicking the little signal-strength icon in the taskbar, but I can’t find the same feature in Windows 10. Is it there?A. Windows 10 has its own version of the wireless networks list, and it can be opened from the Notifications area of the taskbar. One way to see the list is to click the Network icon in the Notifications area on the right side of the Windows 10 taskbar; the wireless version looks like radio waves fanning outward.If you do not see the icon, it may be in the Hidden Icons area. Click the small upward-pointing arrow on the taskbar, find the Network icon and drag it back out to the Notifications area.When you click the Network icon, you should see a list of nearby wireless networks. Instead of the green bars that Windows 7 used, signal strength is indicated by the number of radio waves in the icon next to each network’s name. You can also see if each network is secured with a password or open for anyone to join. (As always, be careful when joining open wireless networks, as they can put your data security at risk.)Another way to see a list of available wireless networks is to open the Windows 10 Action Center, which is a collection of shortcuts to common settings, apps and notifications. You can get to the Action Center in several ways: Click its icon, which is next to the time and date on the right side of the taskbar; press the Windows and A keys on the keyboard; or swipe in from the right edge of the screen. Once you are in the Action Center, click (or press) the Network icon and tap the Go to Settings button that appears in order to see the networks list in the Wi-Fi settings box.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
