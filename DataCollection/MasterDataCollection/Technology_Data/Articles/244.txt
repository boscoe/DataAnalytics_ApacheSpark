 PUI-WING TAM
 
JULY 28, 2017
Thursday was something of an up-and-down day for Jeff Bezos.For a brief few hours, Mr. Bezos — the chief executive of Amazon, the owner of The Washington Post, the man behind the rocket company Blue Origin and, lately, a frequent target of President Trump — became the richest man in the world, writes Nick Wingfield, a technology reporter for The New York Times. According to a real-time list of billionaires compiled by Forbes.com, an early pop in Amazon’s shares on Thursday pushed Mr. Bezos’ wealth ahead of that of Bill Gates, a Microsoft founder-turned-philanthropist.A few hours later, with tech stocks dipping, Mr. Bezos had receded to No. 2 in the wealth ranks. And that quite likely will not change again immediately: On Thursday afternoon Amazon unveiled its quarterly earnings results, reporting a steep fall in profits and a rise in spending. The company’s stock declined in after-hours trading.Of course, being only the second-richest person in the world is not exactly the worst place to be for Mr. Bezos. That he is even in that position is a testament to how he has built Amazon into a company thoroughly ingrained  in people’s lives.These days, Amazon not only is a prime online shopping destination. It also influences our entertainment choices, provides cloud computing services to numerous companies whose services we use, and has transformed the way goods are delivered to us. And Amazon is only likely to embed itself further into our lives in the future, as it invests in new technologies (drones, anyone?) that are set to be deployed in coming years.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
