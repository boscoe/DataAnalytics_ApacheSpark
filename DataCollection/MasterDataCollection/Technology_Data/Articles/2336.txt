A cyberattack has hit at least 200,000 computers in 150 countries since Friday. More will be known about the extent of the incident as workers who might have missed it on Friday trickle into the office on Monday. But where there have not been major outbreaks might be most telling, at least about who takes computer security seriously.The attack, to be specific, was a nasty form of ransomware, which hackers use to lock people out of their computers and demand payment. The malicious code relied on the victims opening a zip file emailed to them. From there, the program used a flaw in Microsoft operating system software to proliferate. Microsoft released a patch for that vulnerability in March, but as has been made clear, plenty of people, companies and government agencies around the world have not been keeping their software up to date.The Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

The hackers look for and often find flaws they can take advantage of, and the companies try to fix those flaws as quickly as they can. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work.True, software companies are often slow to respond to problems. But that does not appear to have been the case with this attack, since Microsoft released the patch for the vulnerability before it became widely known.But there’s little that a software company can do if customers don’t take advantage of the fix. Not updating that software is an invitation for trouble.We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.See More »
