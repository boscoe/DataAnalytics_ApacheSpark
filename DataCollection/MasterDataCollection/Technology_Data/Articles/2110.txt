In addition to the “While You Were Away” groupings of older posts at the top of your timeline, Twitter recently began to show what it considers the “best” tweets for you first — before you see more current material. Twitter’s software decides what is “best” for you by elevating tweets from accounts it knows you have interacted with most regularly.Sponsored or promoted material may show up in your Twitter timeline above more recent posts from the accounts you follow, too. Twitter may also show you posts or retweets from people you do not follow, if the topic is popular at the moment, or people in your Twitter circle are discussing it in their own feeds.If you want to regain a little more control over what you see in your timeline, you can tinker with your Twitter account settings.On the Android app, tap the menu icon in the top right corner, select Settings, then Timeline and turn off “Show me the best Tweets first.” On the iOS app, you can get to that option from your Twitter profile screen: tap the gear icon, choose Settings, select your account name and under Timeline, tap Timeline Personalization.If you are using Twitter on the web, log into your account, click your profile icon in the top right corner and choose Settings. Under Content, uncheck the box next to “Show me the best Tweets first.”Twitter is not alone in its feed-fiddling. Earlier this month, Instagram began using algorithms to increase the visibility of popular posts, and Facebook has regularly altered its news feeds for years.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
