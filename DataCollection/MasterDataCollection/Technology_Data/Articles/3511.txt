Q. I lost my MacBook power cord. I went on Apple’s site to buy a new one but they had a bunch listed and I don’t know which one is right for my model. How can I get the correct charger?A. Apple has made a number of MacBook power adapters over the years and they vary by connection plug and wattage. To get a replacement power adapter that specifically fits your laptop, you should first confirm the model you are using. Apple’s laptop family includes the MacBook, the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air lines.You can find this information by going to the Apple menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and choosing About This Mac. When the System Information box appears, you should see the exact model year and name of your MacBook displayed on the Overview tab.When you have found the name of your MacBook model, you can check Apple’s list of power adapters that go with each of its laptops. You can also find out more information about your laptop (including power adapter wattage) by clicking the System Report button on the Overview tab, back in the MacBook’s System Information box.AdvertisementApple gives its power adapters specific names, like “60W MagSafe power adapter with ‘T’ style connector” or “Apple 29W USB-C Power Adapter and USB-C Charge Cable.” You can use this name to search for a replacement unit on Apple’s online store, in its retail stores or at stores that sell Apple hardware, like Amazon or Best Buy.If you have access to another power adapter from a previous Mac notebook, keep in mind that you can use a compatible charger of a higher wattage than your MacBook, but using a charger with a lower wattage may not provide enough juice. The type of connection plug may be easier to visually identify than the wattage, but for those who still have their chargers and need to replace them, the technical information is printed in tiny type on the side of the square white power-plug end of the cord.AdvertisementFor those with PC laptops, check with your manufacturer about replacement power cords and where to buy them. Many third-party substitutes are available, but read the reviews and technical information before purchasing.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
