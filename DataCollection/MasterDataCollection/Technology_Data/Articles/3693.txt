The issue of how fake news spreads online has been in the spotlight since Donald J. Trump won the presidential election, prompting soul-searching in tech, media and political circles and discussions about how to limit the misinformation.But as Scott Shane, a New York Times national security reporter, points out, the creation and dissemination of fake news is far from difficult. In an article about Cameron Harris, a new college graduate, Mr. Shane tracked how Mr. Harris produced a false piece about fraudulent votes for Hillary Clinton, which was pulled together in just 15 minutes. After Mr. Harris published the story on a site claiming to be the Christian Times Newspaper — but was really a site to profit off online ads — the piece eventually was shared six million times.The phenomenon of fake news is reinforced by powerful figures who cite the false information and help spread it. That includes Mr. Trump himself, who has invoked fake news when it has suited his needs, writes Sapna Maheshwari, an advertising reporter for The Times.She found 10 occasions in which the president-elect made false claims and supported them with information from unsubstantiated sources, including when he said on Twitter that an “extremely credible source” had told him that President Obama was not born in the United States.And so the fake news train rolls on.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
