Some Android tablets can work with standard USB-connected devices like external keyboards and mice, but most tablets and phones can connect to keyboards and other input devices over a wireless Bluetooth connection.Many Android tablets do not include the standard full-size USB port, but an inexpensive USB On-The-Go cable (often referred to as USB OTG) can convert the mobile device’s USB-micro ports to the standard USB connectors that external keyboards commonly use. If you do not know if your tablet supports USB OTG, check the manufacturer’s website or use a free app like USB OTG Checker or OTG? from the Google Play store.If you would rather use a wireless connection, you can find a variety of Bluetooth-enabled keyboards (from manufacturers like Logitech, Matias, Zagg and others) that will work with your Android tablet after you pair the two devices. To do so on a tablet running Android 5.0 or later, open the Settings icon on the tablet, choose Wireless & Networks and then Bluetooth. If it is not on already, enable Bluetooth here. Tap the name of your device and confirm the “Visible to all nearby Bluetooth devices” status on screen.In the list of nearby Bluetooth devices that appears, tap the name of your keyboard in the list and follow the instructions on the screen to pair it with the tablet. Once you have typed in the required code on the keyboard to pair it with the tablet, you can use the external keyboard for typing in Google Docs, Chrome, Gmail and other text-based apps.Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
