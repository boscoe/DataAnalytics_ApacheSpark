According to William Shakespeare, everything you read online is now 100 percent reliable.Fake out.As Daisuke Wakabayashi and Mike Isaac write, the two internet giants have actually taken some small steps to remedy the plague of false or misleading news articles. Much, much more remains to be done.On Wednesday, Google said it had recently examined 550 sites suspected of deceiving users. It said it took action against 340 of them, and kicked 200 publishers off Google’s AdSense advertising network altogether. AdSense is how many fake news sites (and legitimate ones) make money.Those numbers may sound like a lot, but over 2 million publishers use AdSense. In November, Google said it would ban fake news sites from the advertising network, but it seems as though the ban is a taller order than first thought.One problem Google faces is that a lot of fake news amounts to selective quoting, improper emphasis or assertions that are hard to disprove, instead of outright falsehoods. Google has had far more success combating more straightforward schemes. The company said it took action on 47,000 sites promoting dodgy weight-loss methods.For its part, Facebook said on Wednesday it had made changes to its Trending Topics feature, which prominently shows what is popular on Facebook at a given time.The new version appeared to privilege more reliable information, but also to call upon the reader to act as something of a judge — the publisher of the Trending item is identified, and everyone in the same geographic area sees the same items.Put together, the changes signaled an attempt to strike a “we publish, you decide” stance that absolves Facebook of responsibility for declaring what is and is not true.We have arrived at a strange time: Declaring what is true and real has become a political act. Profit-making companies and people are rushing to seem apolitical.That may be the real news of the moment.Advertisement
