I tried dragging it with my finger, and nothing happened.A. If a finger drag does not budge the taskbar, you can use a system setting, but you should make sure the taskbar is unlocked first. To do that, press and hold your finger on an empty section of the Taskbar (or right-click) until the menu with the Taskbar Settings item pops up.Select Taskbar Settings. At the top of the Taskbar Settings box, make sure the “Lock the taskbar” option is turned off. Next, scroll down until you get to the “Taskbar location on screen” area and use the menu to select your preference: Left, Top, Right or Bottom. The taskbar should then jump to the side of the screen you have chosen. (Mouse users should be able to click and drag an unlocked taskbar to a different side of the screen.)The Settings box has other controls for taskbar behavior. You can choose to have it automatically hide when you are not using it. You can change the size of the taskbar buttons, or choose to show labels and notification badges on icons.The On switch for the Peek feature also lives in the Taskbar settings box. Peek, if you have not used it before, temporarily removes all of the open windows on the screen and shows you the desktop when you press and hold the far-right end of taskbar; mouse users get the same results by moving the cursor over the right end of the taskbar. To return to the open windows, move your finger or the mouse cursor.If the Peek feature has been turned off, you can enable it. Tap the On button next to “Use Peek to preview the desktop when you move your mouse to the Show desktop button at the end of the taskbar.”Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.
