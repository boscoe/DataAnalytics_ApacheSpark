Investors continued to make moves based on the bevy of policy changes that the Trump administration could put into effect when it takes over in January. Those include cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and slashing government regulation of businesses.AdvertisementThat has pushed financial, industrial and health care stocks higher, while prompting traders to sell consumer goods companies, utilities and phone companies. Investors have also continued to pull out of bonds in anticipation that Mr. Trump’s policies could usher in a stronger economy and, possibly, higher inflation, both of which are bad for bonds.The sell-off in bonds continued on Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.14 percent, the highest it has been since January, from 2.07 percent on Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans, including home mortgages.JPMorgan Chase led the 30 companies in the Dow, climbing $3.40, or 4.6 percent, to $76.65. It was followed by Goldman Sachs, which rose $8.24, or 4.3 percent, to $200.87.Traders also bid up shares in Macy’s and Kohl’s after the companies reported their latest quarterly results.Macy’s rose $2.15, or 5.6 percent, to $40.53.
