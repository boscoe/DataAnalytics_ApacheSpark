Lawyers in the bitter fight over Sumner M. Redstone’s $40 billion media empire could be awfully busy come October.A Delaware judge ruled on Friday that the lawsuit over the move to replace five Viacom directors would go to trial, setting Oct. 17 as a tentative start date. The judge also instructed lawyers for the two sides to discuss the possibility of conducting an independent medical examination of Mr. Redstone, who is 93 and in poor health. His National Amusements holding controls about 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS.A day earlier, a Massachusetts judge scheduled an October trial for a separate lawsuit over Mr. Redstone’s mental competence to make business decisions. And in California, a Los Angeles judge has set a tentative hearing on Oct. 18 for yet another legal fight over the future of Mr. Redstone’s business estate.The prospect that the dispute goes to trial in multiple states could increase the incentive for the two sides to resolve the fights outside the courtroom. It is not clear whether the sides are engaged in settlement talks.AdvertisementA compromise would allow for a less contentious exit for Philippe P. Dauman as Viacom’s chief executive and enable the company to move forward. Viacom shares have dropped about 20 percent in the last year and the company has been operating in limbo since the controversy erupted in May.AdvertisementThe Delaware case concerns the move made in June by National Amusements to replace five Viacom board members.
                War has spread across the empire of Sumner Redstone, one of the entertainment industry’s most tenacious titans.

The development was considered a precursor to a major shake-up at Viacom, including the potential firing of Mr. Dauman. The new directors are expected to be aligned with Mr. Redstone’s daughter, Shari, who has publicly opposed Mr. Dauman.National Amusements went to a Delaware court to validate the moves after announcing them. The company argued that, as Viacom’s controlling shareholder, it had the indisputable right to make changes to Viacom’s board.“We look forward to demonstrating the integrity of these changes, which were ratified unanimously by National Amusements’ board and would be approved again by a majority regardless of the outcome of this case,” Stephen Labaton, a National Amusements spokesman, said on Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Salerno, Viacom’s lead independent director, filed suit to block the changes with the support of the other independent directors.Mr. Salerno argued that the changes were invalid and part of an attempt by Ms. Redstone to take control of her father’s estate plan by manipulating him.“We are pleased the court has recognized the need to swiftly proceed to determine the serious issues of undue influence and Mr. Redstone’s capacity,” said Carl Folta, a Viacom spokesman. “We look forward to revealing the truth as we prepare for trial in both Massachusetts and Delaware in October.”Investors will be able to evaluate Viacom’s progress on Thursday, when the company reports quarterly earnings.A version of this article appears in print on July 30, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Redstone’s Busy October: 3 Cases in 3 Courts in 3 States.
