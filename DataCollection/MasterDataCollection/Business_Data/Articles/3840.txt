While a reading below 50 indicates a contraction in manufacturing, the index remains above 43.1, which is associated with a recession.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has been hammered by a strong dollar, as well as slower global demand and efforts at home by businesses to reduce excessive buildups in inventory. All that is keeping downward pressure on new orders.The institute said a gauge of new orders rose 3 percentage points, but remained in contractionary territory. Export orders gained 3.5 percentage points to 51 last month, suggesting much of the weakness could be concentrated in the energy sector, where spending has been undercut by lower oil prices.Ten out of 18 manufacturing industries, including apparel, machinery, primary metals and electrical equipment, reported contraction in December. The six reporting growth included textile mills, paper products and chemical products industries.Inventories at manufacturers rose slightly, but that was offset by an increase in customers’ reporting that stocks of unsold goods were too high. With activity weakening, manufacturers adjusted their hiring plans. The employment index fell to 48.1 from 51.3 in November.An alternative reading from the private data vendor Markit showed continued expansion in manufacturing but at a slower pace. Markit’s purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.2 from 52.8 in November, the lowest since October 2012.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.4 percent, the first and also biggest drop since June 2014, after a downwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in October.Advertisement
