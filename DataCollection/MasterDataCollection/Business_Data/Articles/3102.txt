United States markets ended the session mixed on Monday as interest rates continued to rise. Bond yields climbed to their highest levels this year, which pointed to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Donald J. Trump to lead to higher inflation.KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 0.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was unchanged. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.4 percent.TECH TROUBLES Shares of technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple stock gave up 2.5 percent while Facebook stock declined 3.3 percent and shares of Microsoft slid 1.5 percent. Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped 2.4 percent. Tech stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wondered if Mr. Trump’s policies as president would hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas.BANK BONANZA Bank stocks continued to surge, rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors were also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Mr. Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America stock rose 5.6 percent and shares of JPMorgan Chase picked up 3.7 percent.
