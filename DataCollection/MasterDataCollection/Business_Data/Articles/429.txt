Five years after an internal audit revealed serious shortcomings at the nation’s top auto safety regulator, the agency has failed to follow through on some overhauls, according to a new audit by the Transportation Department’s inspector general.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration still lacks a training plan to ensure that its safety investigators have the necessary expertise, and it frequently fails to record important investigative evidence and decisions, the report said. Efforts at change have been slipshod: An investigative documentation checklist developed in 2013 was subsequently almost ignored, the report found.The original audit, published in 2011, was ordered after Congress expressed concerns over Toyota’s handling of recalls to address unintended acceleration in its cars.While the new report acknowledges that the safety agency had adopted all of the inspector general’s recommendations, it said that in some cases it had fallen short in carrying them out.AdvertisementThe shortcomings underscore the findings of a blistering audit by the inspector general from last June that drew attention to the safety agency’s undertrained staff and weak processes for analyzing the safety data it collects from automakers and consumers.AdvertisementIn one especially glaring example, repeated in the new report, the agency workers in charge of interpreting data that can help regulators detect potential defects told auditors that they have no training or background in statistics.The agency has fallen under withering criticism from lawmakers in recent years for overlooking clues about safety defects in vehicles and failing to use the full extent of its powers to regulate the industry it is charged with overseeing.In response, Mark R. Rosekind, the agency’s chief, has taken a more aggressive approach since assuming the top job in 2014, increasing penalties and imposing stricter oversight.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
