WASHINGTON —  A congressional effort to put regulators under the microscope when they write new rules for Wall Street is gaining momentum, potentially creating new obstacles to the closer oversight of financial risk taking.A bipartisan group of senators is working on a package of regulatory reform bills that most likely would include a measure to subject the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other independent agencies to a heightened cost-benefit analysis and review process for major rules, according to people briefed on the plans.Supporters say the legislation would bring rule-making standards for independent regulators closer in line with those for executive branch agencies, providing more consistency and transparency in the rule-making process.But critics, including top Democrats, warn that the legislation is instead intended to create additional burdens and delays, as well as make agency rules more vulnerable to legal challenges.Advertisement“Reform is badly needed, but this package heads in the wrong direction, giving lobbyists and lawyers more chances to block outcomes they don’t like,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Reform should focus on a level playing field for working families and small businesses, not more ways to tilt the game for the rich and powerful.”AdvertisementOver the last three years, there have been previous efforts in Congress to give the president additional authority in the rule-making process, although those bills eventually stalled. Critics contend that the efforts are intended to neuter rule-making under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul.The latest effort began in October, when lawmakers on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved a bill by Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio; Susan Collins, Republican of Maine; and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. On Friday, the homeland security panel released a report that detailed suggestions on how to improve rule-making from businesses, trade associations and consumer advocates, among others.Senators including Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, chairman of the panel; James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma; Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri; Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota; Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia; and Angus King, an independent from Maine who often caucuses with Democrats, are also said to be part of the discussions for changing the rule-writing process.The group would need at least two more Democrats supporting the legislation to avoid having the package blocked on the Senate floor. That would be an uphill battle in a politically charged election year, but it’s a very real concern for those worried about the impact of such changes.Lawmakers could introduce the regulatory package in the coming weeks.Supporters stressed that the legislation would simply clarify that a president is permitted to impose stronger requirements on the independent regulators, including additional cost-benefit analysis, not that an administration would be required to do so. As instructed, agencies would need to systematically estimate both the potential costs and benefits of a proposed rule, including those impacts that might be indirect or hard to quantify.Many regulators already take these steps on their own or under other mandates, but that analysis could be reviewed by the White House or another body if the current bill goes through. Regulators might also need to assess whether an existing rule created or contributed to the problem being addressed as well identify alternatives to direct regulation, among other steps.Lawmakers may be discussing at least one major change. A new branch of the Congressional Budget Office would be responsible for reviewing, at the president’s request, a cost-benefit analysis of economically significant rules, instead of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, according to a draft of the legislation.AdvertisementOpponents say that change could have a chilling effect on rule-writing and serve as ammunition in any subsequent legal challenges to the rule, as the budget office review would be submitted publicly as part of the comments process.More broadly, critics have warned that subjecting the financial agencies and others to additional review would erode regulatory independence. A group of regulators wrote a letter in July to Mr. Johnson and Mr. Carper opposing the bill, which proposed subjecting the agencies to review by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.“Beyond injecting an administration’s influence directly into our rule-making, the bill also would interfere with our ability to promulgate rules critical to our missions in a timely manner and would likely result in unnecessary and unwarranted litigation in connection with our rules,” wrote the heads of the consumer protection bureau, the S.E.C., the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Credit Union Administration.Cost-benefit analysis is fruitful territory for opponents of the Dodd-Frank law.Industry groups often undermine or raise questions about an agency’s cost-benefit analysis in lawsuits in an effort to overturn the regulations — and they have had some success, especially in a handful of cases against the S.E.C. in the federal court of appeals in Washington over the last decade.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Other lawmakers said to be involved declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.House Republicans have been active on regulatory reform issues this term as well, approving several related cost-benefit analysis and rule reduction bills with support from a small number of Democrats. But getting such legislation signed into law may still prove a challenge.President Obama has threatened to veto the earlier House efforts, though he did signal general interest in the topic during his State of the Union address on Jan. 12 when he called for cutting outdated rules and “red tape.” The comment won a standing ovation from Congress.“It was a bipartisan applause line, but the devil is in the details,” said Edward Mills, a policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets.A version of this article appears in print on January 20, 2016, on Page B3 of the New York edition with the headline: Proposed Legislation Would Add Scrutiny of Wall Street Regulators.
