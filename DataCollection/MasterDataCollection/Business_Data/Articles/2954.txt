Sears Holdings says it has obtained a $500 million loan as it looks to fund a transformation and reduce the number of company-owned stores. The retailer, controlled by the billionaire Edward S. Lampert, spun off about 254 Sears and Kmart stores in June. It has been reeling under losses as shoppers move away from malls in favor of online shopping. Sears has lost more than $8 billion over the last five years. Sears said $250 million of the 15-month loan was funded on Friday, and the remainder would be accessible in the future. ESL Investments, which was founded by Mr. Lampert, provided $125 million of the initial $250 million, Sears said, adding that it had used 13 of its properties as collateral. The loan is in addition to $750 million Sears obtained in March.A version of this article appears in print on April 9, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Sears Secures $500 Million as It Seeks Transformation.
