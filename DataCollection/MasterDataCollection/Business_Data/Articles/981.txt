President-elect Donald J. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will announce a deal with Carrier Corporation on Thursday to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana from moving to Mexico.The deal with the company, which included a multiyear $7 million incentive package from the state and promises by Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence to work for lower corporate taxes over all, is good news for the workers in Indiana, but the jobs that will stay represent only a small boost compared with the millions of manufacturing jobs lost since 2000.200017,284,000201011,460,000 ↓ 34% since 2000201612,338,000 ↑ 8% since 2010Manufacturing jobs in the United States have declined significantly since the end of the 1990s, though output has increased with new technology.
