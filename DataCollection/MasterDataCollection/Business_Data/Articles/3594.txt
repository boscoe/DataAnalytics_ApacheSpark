LONDON — Global markets sank sharply on Friday as crude dipped below $30 a barrel on concerns about China and a potential flood of new oil from Iran.The recent turmoil, across stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, reflects investors’ growing anxiety about global growth. The swirl of forces are interconnected, so the volatility in one area can quickly spread to other countries and other markets.The tumult in China, where stocks are now in bear-market territory, is helping drag down oil prices. China, an important energy consumer, is facing a slowdown that could hurt its demand for crude.Oil prices are also getting crimped by the threatened arrival of new supplies to add to the existing glut. The lifting of sanctions on Iran, part of a nuclear deal, paves the way for the country to start exporting more oil.AdvertisementIt all makes for trouble in the stock markets, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell about 2 percent.AdvertisementThe sell-off started on Friday in China, where the main Shanghai index dropped 3.6 percent. The index has fallen more than 20 percent from its December high, a threshold that analysts generally regard as a bear market.
                Over the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.            China’s troubles have affected the price of oil, which is off more than 70 percent over the last 18 months.On Friday, the futures for Brent crude for March delivery were trading at $29.06 a barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange. West Texas intermediate crude settled at $29.42 a barrel, or down 5.7 percent. As recently as May, Brent crude was trading at about $65 a barrel.Whether the volatility subsists will depend largely on the direction of the global economy and how it affects demand for oil.In China, the world’s second-largest economy after the United States, underlying growth continues to slow. The government is expected to report next week that economic growth cooled last year to 6.9 percent. That figure would be the envy of many countries but that would signal China’s slowest pace in a quarter of a century.China and other growing Asian economies have become important customers for oil exporters like Saudi Arabia and Iran, particularly as rising production of oil in the United States has reduced American imports. If the economic weakness in China leads to a sharp fall in demand, the big producers will most likely discount their oil even more aggressively to attract buyers.Oil prices are also under pressure because an easing of international sanctions on Iran could come in the next few days. Sanctions have crimped Iran’s production and sales in recent years. If they are removed, Iran could start to ramp up production and rekindle sales to former customers in Europe and elsewhere. In the coming months, that could add 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day to an already oversupplied market, analysts estimate.AdvertisementSentiment in the market is now very negative, analysts say. Traders are betting on still-lower prices, perhaps even heading toward the $20-a-barrel range.
                China’s economy is faltering, prompting concerns that are now shaking global stock markets.            With prices settling below the $30 level, “it could set the scene for further declines next week,” said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a research firm based in London.The low prices of oil are wreaking havoc in the industry, adding to the broad investor anxiety.Already, projects that are in their early stages are being postponed. Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based consultants, estimated in the  summary of a report released on Thursday that the industry had deferred putting in place $380 billion worth of projects globally. On Friday, the global mining company BHP Billiton said it was writing off about $7.2 billion from its book value of shale holdings in the United States because of the changed environment.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Despite weak prices, oil production was higher in 2015 as extensive investments in previous years began to translate into higher production in the United States, Brazil and elsewhere. Even Britain, whose North Sea region is widely viewed as struggling, showed increased output.Seth Kleinman, an analyst at Citigroup in London, said it was unlikely that crude prices would reach bottom before markets encountered production declines outside the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC continue to produce at high levels and show no signs of abandoning their unwillingness to adjust outputs to regulate the market.“In order to maintain an efficient economy, you can’t be pushing your production up and down by half a million barrels a day to prop up prices somewhere else,” said Sadad al-Husseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, who now runs a consulting firm.Neil Gough contributed reporting from Hong Kong.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
