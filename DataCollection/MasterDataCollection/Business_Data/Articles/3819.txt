SoundCloud, a streaming music site that has clashed with the music industry as it grows more popular, has struck a long-awaited licensing deal with the Universal Music Group, the giant record company whose roster of hit acts includes the Weeknd, Sam Smith and U2.The deal, to be announced Wednesday, will give SoundCloud access to Universal’s catalog and let those artists make money from advertising when their songs are played on the free service, which is used by 175 million people around the world each month. Kanye West and Miley Cyrus are among the many artists who have embraced it as a promotion platform.The deal with Universal, which also includes songwriting rights that Universal controls through its music-publishing arm, follows earlier agreements with the Warner Music Group and Merlin, a consortium of independents, as well as the National Music Publishers Association.Last month, SoundCloud reached an agreement with PRS for Music, a British songwriters’ agency, ending a copyright infringement suit. Among the major powers of the music world, the only holdout from SoundCloud now is Sony.
