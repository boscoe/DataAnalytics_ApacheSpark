Four years ago, Deutsche Börse called off an effort to merge with the parent of the New York Stock Exchange after European antitrust regulators threatened to block the combination.Now, the German market operator is willing to try another deal — this time with the London Stock Exchange.The two exchanges said on Tuesday that they were in talks to combine in an all-stock deal, potentially uniting two of the biggest European market operators and creating a new giant in an industry that has rapidly consolidated.A merger of the two would help London maintain strong financial ties with the Continent at a time when Britain’s role in Europe is being questioned. Britons will vote on June 23 whether to leave the European Union, often referred to as Brexit.Advertisement“It’s probably not a coincidence that you get this announcement when the future of Britain and the E.U. is uncertain,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “It’s a way to develop a Pan-European dimension even in the event of a Brexit.”AdvertisementDeutsche Börse previously sought mergers with the London Stock Exchange, in 2000 and again in 2005. But changes in the stock trading landscape mean the latest try may have a larger chance of success.Traditional exchanges have lost substantial market share in recent years to electronic exchanges, notably Bats Global Markets and its European subsidiary, BATS Chi-X Europe. The competition puts pressure on the established exchanges to join forces, and it also helps address regulators’ concerns that Deutsche Börse and L.S.E. would have monopolistic power.With most trading now electronic, exchanges are no longer as tied up with national identity as they used to be. Political leaders are less likely to interfere.“It’s a very competitive space now where more consolidation needs to happen,” Mr. Véron said.Already over the last decade, numerous market operators have pursued ever-bigger scale through mergers. Both of the big, old names in American exchanges, the N.Y.S.E. and the Nasdaq, are the products of mergers themselves: the Big Board with Euronext and then the IntercontinentalExchange, and the Nasdaq with the OMX Group of Sweden.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Their counterparts at Deutsche Börse would receive one share of the new company for each of their shares, giving them 54.4 percent of the united market operator over all.The new company’s board would be evenly divided between directors of each of the two companies.Shares of the L.S.E. surged nearly 14 percent in Tuesday trading in London. In Frankfurt, shares of Deutsche Börse were up 3.2 percent.“The boards believe that the potential merger would represent a compelling opportunity for both companies to strengthen each other in an industry-defining combination, creating a leading European-based global markets infrastructure group,” the two said in a joint regulatory statement.The two are no strangers to deal-making. Even after Deutsche Börse failed to merge with the N.Y.S.E. — clearing the path for the Big Board to sell itself to the IntercontinentalExchange — it has struck a number of acquisitions.AdvertisementThe L.S.E. has played both acquirer and potential target, not least with Deutsche Börse itself. The two discussed plans to merge in 2000, though no deal emerged, and four years later, Deutsche Börse made an unsuccessful bid for its London-based rival.Other exchange operators, including OMX and Nasdaq, also made bids for the L.S.E. that the British company rejected.Instead, the L.S.E. has made acquisitions like those of Borsa Italiana of Milan and Russell Investments, the owner of the Russell stock market indexes. The London exchange also sought to acquire TMX, the parent of the Toronto stock exchange, though that deal was scuttled by investors in the Canadian company.Robey Warshaw is advising the L.S.E., while Perella Weinberg Partners is advising Deutsche Börse.A version of this article appears in print on February 24, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: Deutsche Börse in Talks With London Exchange.
