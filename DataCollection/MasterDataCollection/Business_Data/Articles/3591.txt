Profit and revenue rose at Citigroup in the fourth quarter, but investors looked past those gains on Friday and fretted about the bank’s ability to weather turmoil in the emerging markets and oil industryCitigroup said on Friday that its profit, after adjusting for certain debt valuations, surged to about $3.4 billion — up from the meager $340 million that the bank earned in the quarter a year ago when it was weighed down by huge legal expenses related to a series of government investigations.It amounted, on an adjusted basis, to earnings of $1.06 a share, a hair better than the $1.05 that analysts had estimated.Citigroup’s revenue was $18.6 billion in the quarter, surpassing analyst estimates of $17.9 billion and 4 percent higher than the year ago period.AdvertisementWithout the adjustments, Citigroup reported net income of $3.3 billion, or $1.02 a share.The company’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said the fourth-quarter results demonstrated that Citigroup was now a “stronger and safer company.” But analysts said many of the gains in the quarter came from asset sales and other one-time events, raising questions about whether the bank, which has large exposures in troubled economies like China, could continue to increase its earnings.AdvertisementCitigroup said its total exposure to China was about $20.5 billion, a mix of credit cards and mortgage and commercial loans. The company’s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, said its borrowers were of high credit quality.
                Investors are eagerly awaiting guidance from management about when higher short-term interest rates will impact the banks’ bottom lines.            Another trouble spot for Citigroup and other banks is the energy sector, where companies are struggling to survive as oil prices plunge.Citigroup said that it had set aside $588 million to deal with loan losses in the fourth quarter. Bank executives said about half of those reserves were related to weakness in the energy sector. Citigroup said its total exposure to the energy sector was about $58 billion, which included both funded and unfunded loan commitments.A year ago, Citigroup released $441 million in reserves, as the credit outlook remained strong and problems in the energy industry had just begun to stir. Bank officials have previously warned that collapsing oil prices would lead to higher reserves.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As the price of oil has dropped below $30 a barrel, the banks are expecting more of their loans to go unpaid.The bank’s non-accrual corporate loans increased 32 percent, to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, largely because of strain in the oil and gas sector.Mr. Gerspach said there were no signs that the slowdown in China and the plunge in oil prices were weighing on consumers.“We haven’t seen any knock-on effects as yet across the portfolio,” he told analysts in a conference call.A big driver of Citigroup’s performance in the fourth quarter was a 23 percent drop in operating expenses. The cost-cutting went beyond the decline in legal expenses. A year ago, Citigroup paid billions of dollars to settle multiple investigations into whether the bank had manipulated the foreign exchange market and certain interest rates.We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
