But in its latest round of fund-raising, it is seeking to raise $500 million through a debt offering, in which investors will gain the right to convert their notes to equity, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the company’s plans were private.A spokesman for Spotify declined to comment on the news, which was reported by the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet and later by Music Business Worldwide, an online trade publication.The move may help Spotify, which is privately owned, compete against Apple, which introduced a streaming service last year and recently crossed 10 million paying users, as well as Pandora, which has dominated Internet radio in the United States, but has plans to enter the world of on-demand audio, in direct competition with Spotify and Apple.Spotify announced in June that it had 75 million users, 20 million of whom pay, but its numbers are thought to have grown substantially since then. By August, Spotify told record distributors that it had as many as 22 million paying users. It operates in 58 countries, and recently began advertising for jobs in Japan, raising speculation that it would soon begin operating in that country, which is the world’s second-largest music market but one long resistant to streaming.Spotify, one of the most highly valued private technology companies, has been a regular subject of speculation regarding an initial public offering, or as a possible acquisition target by one of the giants of Silicon Valley. But the raising of debt may postpone that speculation for the time being.Advertisement
