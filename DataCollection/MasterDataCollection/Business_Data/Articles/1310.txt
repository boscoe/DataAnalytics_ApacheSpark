SeaWorld acknowledged on Thursday that it had sent company employees to pose as animal rights activists to protect the company “from credible threats.”The company’s chief executive, Joel Manby, said that several employees went undercover, but that SeaWorld’s board of directors had ordered an end to the activity.The admission came after the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals accused a SeaWorld employee last year of infiltrating its ranks and even joining several protests against the amusement park’s system.On Thursday, PETA’s executive vice president, Tracy Reiman, said that SeaWorld’s statement confirmed that “the company has employed more than one spy to infiltrate and agitate at PETA.”AdvertisementOfficials from the animal rights group said they had identified the SeaWorld employee as Paul T. McComb, of the company’s human resources department, who had posed as someone named Thomas Jones.SeaWorld did not immediately confirm or deny those allegations, though a spokesman said in a statement that the company was focused on safety and would not comment on its security operations. On Thursday, it would not comment further beyond its statement, which did not explicitly address PETA’s claims.The admission added to SeaWorld’s long list of woes. The company’s image has suffered since the release of the 2013 documentary “Blackfish,” which raised serious questions about the care of its animals and the safety of its trainers. The company  pushed back aggressively, but overall attendance has declined since the film’s release.What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
