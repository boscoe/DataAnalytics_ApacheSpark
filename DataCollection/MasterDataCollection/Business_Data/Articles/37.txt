The country is the world’s largest agricultural market.The deal is one of several remaking the market for agricultural chemicals, seeds and fertilizers.The other deals in the sector include a $130 billion proposed merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont, and Bayer’s plan to merge with Monsanto.Advertisement
