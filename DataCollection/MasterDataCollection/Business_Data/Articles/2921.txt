LONDON — Deutsche Börse said on Tuesday that it had gathered enough support from shareholders for its merger with the London Stock Exchange Group to proceed.The approval of the transaction came just over a month after Britons voted to leave the European Union, which cast doubt about the viability of the deal.The outcome of the June 23 vote has raised questions among investors about whether the London Stock Exchange-Deutsche Börse merger can be completed under its current terms, and in particular whether the combined entity’s holding company should be based in Britain, as planned.Two weeks ago, the exchanges agreed to reduce the threshold for investors in Deutsche Börse to agree to exchange their stock in the German exchange for shares in a new holding company for the combined entity.AdvertisementIn a news release, the German exchange operator said that at least 60 percent of its outstanding shares had been pledged to support the deal, exceeding the acceptance threshold needed for the transaction to proceed.AdvertisementThis month, shareholders in the London exchange overwhelmingly approved the all-stock deal, which the stock exchange operators hope will create a European champion in the industry.Ahead of Tuesday’s deadline, a number of German investors called for the companies to re-evaluate their plans and to move the holding company’s base elsewhere in the European Union.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
