Hulu’s new so-called skinny bundle is beginning to take shape.Hulu has signed deals that will make networks like ABC, ESPN and Fox News a part of its forthcoming live streaming service, the company announced on Tuesday.Through the deal, 21st Century Fox’s and Disney’s collection of broadcast and cable channels — both companies are part owners of Hulu — will join the new service. Hulu previously made a deal with Time Warner, which owns channels like TNT, TBS and CNN, and is also an owner. Hulu’s fourth owner, Comcast, which has a vast array of cable channels through NBCUniversal like USA, Bravo and E, has not reached an agreement to join the service.The live service is expected to make its debut in early 2017, and though Hulu has not said exactly how much it would cost, media executives have said that it may be around $40 a month.Hulu’s live offering will be the latest cheaper and slimmer television package at a time when more people are canceling traditional — and more expensive — cable subscriptions. Other skinny bundles include SlingTV, which goes for about $20 a month, and PlayStation Vue, which goes for about $40 a month.AdvertisementYouTube, owned by Google, is also expected to introduce a streaming service, which will begin early next year.Two weeks ago, Google signed CBS onto the service, according to two people familiar with the deal. The service is looking at a starting price of $25 to $40 a month, those people said.AdvertisementHulu’s new package also aims to attract more subscribers as it faces slowing growth. Hulu has 12 million subscribers, which is dwarfed by Netflix’s 47 million domestic subscribers.A version of this article appears in print on November 2, 2016, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Hulu Adds Channels to Streaming Service.
