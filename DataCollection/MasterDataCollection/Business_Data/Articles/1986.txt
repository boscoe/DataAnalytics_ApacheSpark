That compared with a profit of 1.21 billion francs in the second quarter of 2015.The quarterly profit, although lower than a year earlier, was above analysts’ expectations.“We achieved this strong result by helping our clients navigate continued difficult market conditions, while staying disciplined on risk and further reducing cost,” Sergio P. Ermotti, the UBS chief executive, said in a news release. “UBS remains in a solid position with strong capital, strategic clarity and a well-diversified business model.“Operating income declined 5 percent, to 7.4 billion francs, in the second quarter, from 7.8 billion francs a year earlier. Operating expenses declined 2 percent, to 5.9 billion francs.Net interest income, or what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, fell 22 percent, to 1.16 billion francs, in the quarter, from 1.49 billion francs in the second quarter of 2015.UBS warned that macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical risks that have caused clients to be more cautious “are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.”“Sustained market volatility, underlying macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical tensions, exacerbated by the impact of the U.K. referendum vote to end E.U. membership, will lead to continued client risk aversion and generally low transaction volumes,” the bank said.UBS also said that lower-than-anticipated and negative interest rates, as well as the strength of the Swiss franc compared with that of the euro, also were presenting “considerable headwinds.”The results were released a day after its Swiss rival Credit Suisse reported a profit after two consecutive unprofitable quarters. Credit Suisse is in the middle of reorganization under its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam.In the wealth management division of UBS, pretax profit declined 31 percent, to 518 million francs, in the second quarter, from 756 million francs in the period a year earlier.UBS said that its wealth management business had 6 billion francs in net new money invested by clients in the second quarter, compared with 8.4 billion francs in net new money on an adjusted basis in the period last year.The adjusted prior-year figure excluded the effects of client outflows as the bank began charging some clients to hold their cash as the Swiss central bank implemented negative interest rates.The wealth management business in the Americas, which is operated separately, reported that its pretax profit had risen 18 percent, to $242 million, in the quarter, from $205 million in the second quarter of 2015.UBS’s investment bank reported that its pretax profit fell 48 percent, to 284 million francs, in the second quarter, from 551 million francs in the period last year.Follow Chad Bray on Twitter @ChadbrayAdvertisement
