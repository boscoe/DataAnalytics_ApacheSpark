Few expected the Fed to raise interest rates this week because it just raised them last month. Sam Stovall, U.S. equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, said investors wanted the Fed to say that it won’t increase interest rates at its meeting in March, and will raise interest rates after that at a more gradual pace. It didn’t do that.“What the Fed was saying is No, March is still on the table,” he said.Even if the U.S. economy has slowed, it’s been growing steadily for years while other major economies like China, Europe and Japan have struggled.
