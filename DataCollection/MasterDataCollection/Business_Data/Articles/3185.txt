LONDON — A group of former Barclays employees plotted to improve its own trading results by “dishonestly rigging” an important global benchmark interest rate known as Libor, British prosecutors said on Tuesday as the criminal trial of the former traders got underway.The trial — the third in Britain to focus on the Libor scandal — follows a half-decade investigation that has led to billions of dollars in fines and has rocked the reputations of some of the world’s biggest banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Deutsche Bank, as well as Barclays.It also comes after a setback for prosecutors in January, when a jury in a separate case acquitted six former brokers at other financial institutions of helping a former trader at UBS and Citigroup to manipulate the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The former trader, Tom Hayes, was convicted of criminal charges in August.
                Abuse of interest rates and the failure to address the problem is one of the most expensive scandals to hit Wall Street since the financial crisis.            To set Libor and other rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities. Libor is used to price more than $300 trillion in securities.AdvertisementIn his opening statement on Tuesday, James Hines, a prosecutor for the Serious Fraud Office of Britain, said a group of Barclays derivative traders in New York and London conspired with rate submitters in London to try to manipulate the benchmark interest rate.AdvertisementTheir motive was simple, Mr. Hines said: to increase the profits the traders made from interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts with so-called counterparties on the other side of trades with Barclays, which could include other banks, governments and pension funds.“It’s not fair, it’s not trading on a level playing field and it’s dishonest,” Mr. Hines said.The former Barclays traders on trial are Stylianos Contogoulas, Jay Vijay Merchant, Alex Pabon and Ryan Michael Reich. Jonathan James Mathew, a former rate submitter at Barclays in London, is also on trial.They have all denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to the single charge of conspiracy to defraud.The trial comes nearly four years after Barclays reached a settlement with American and British authorities on manipulation of global benchmark interest rates.Barclays, the first bank to settle the matter, paid $450 million in penalties and was dealt a severe blow to its reputation. The ensuing scandal ultimately cost Robert E. Diamond Jr., then the bank’s chief executive, his job.The prosecution’s opening statement is expected to take most of this week, while the case itself is expected to last about 12 weeks.AdvertisementProsecutors have accused the men of plotting with others to try to manipulate submissions of Libor as it related to the United States dollar between June 1, 2005, and Sept. 1, 2007.Mr. Hines, the prosecutor, said the traders in London would communicate their desires for where the bank’s Libor submission should fall to Mr. Mathew and another submitter, who has been labeled a co-conspirator but is not on trial. The traders sought to influence the rate in their favor for derivative trades they had entered into, Mr. Hines said.As an example, Mr. Hines said, one trader wrote in an email that “our deal has a big position. We’re very much in favor of a crazy high Libor setting.”On another day, a trader wrote in a different email that he wanted a Libor submitter to “smash it. Have him set it low.”At the time, Barclays was one of 16 banks that provided submissions each day regarding Libor as it related to the dollar.Mr. Mathew and the other Barclays submitter “did their best to ensure their requests were carried out,” Mr. Hines said.“It’s the rate at which you can borrow money,” Mr. Hines said. “It’s not which rate suits our trading today.”Mr. Hines said that the evidence would show that Mr. Contogoulas had even tried to influence the rate after he left Barclays and went to another bank.AdvertisementSo far, British prosecutors have had mixed results in their efforts to pursue criminal charges in the Libor matter.Mr. Hayes, the former UBS and Citigroup trader, was convicted in August of criminal charges related to the manipulation of Libor. He is serving 11 years in prison after his sentence was reduced in December from 14 years.But prosecutors received a setback in January when the six former brokers were acquitted of criminal charges that they helped Mr. Hayes manipulate Libor.A version of this article appears in print on April 6, 2016, on Page B5 of the New York edition with the headline: London Trial Opens for Ex-Barclays Employees in Libor Rate Manipulation Case.
